    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-14a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor O'Brien" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016091400002#A00300"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to present today on this very important issue.  I introduce my colleagues, Mr. Stephen Watkins and Mr. Maurice Priestley, who also work at the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB.</p> <p>  The PIAB is an independent, self-funded, State organisation which was established to provide a low-cost, speedy delivery model for the settlement of motor, employer and public liability claims.  We assess personal injury claims.  We have assessed more 100,000 to date and we have awarded in excess of &euro;2 billion in compensation to people who have been unfortunate enough to be involved in accidents.  We remove cases from unnecessary litigation, and up to 70% of cases no longer have the need to go to court if they use our process.  We offer a low-cost alternative to litigation, and our processing costs were at their lowest levels last year, at 6.5% of the award.  We make compensation payments to injured parties in line with the book of quantum, subject to prevailing rates, and our average award levels have remained consistent over the past five to six years.  We publish statistics regularly on the number of applications we receive, the average award, the time to settle and the settlement costs.  Through our process we also preserve the right of access to the courts if that is required and people's constitutional rights are not impinged upon.</p> <p>  I want to bring the committee briefly through our process and to give a high level overview of it.  If somebody is involved in a car accident he or she will try initially to settle the claim directly with the insurer.  If that cannot happen, a claim is then submitted to the Injuries Board which will ask the insurer if it consents to the board assessing the claim.  If consent is granted, we proceed to assess the claim.  If consent is denied, the case can proceed to court.  At that point, but only at that point, will we issue a writ.</p><p>The case is then assessed.  We must assess such cases within a nine-month timeline.  We have an average assessment time of seven months currently.  Once the assessment is finished, taking in independent medicals, etc., a notice of award is sent to both claimant and the insurer.  The insurer and claimant must then decide whether they want to accept the award.  If both parties accept it, a notice of award is sent to the insurer and it must be paid within 28 days to the claimant.  If either party rejects the award, then and only then may a writ be issued for the claimant to proceed to court.</p><p> I have spoken in the past few minutes about our set-up and process.  It is very obvious that there is a significant problem with insurance premiums in the country, particularly as they have risen by over 70% in three years.  This has had a very significant impact on the public and, potentially, our overall national competitiveness.  It is a very complex issue, with many reasons being cited - to this committee and in the media - for the increases.  Those reasons include underpricing and under-reserving, increased claims, investment returns, increased fraud, levies, the failure of Setanta, changes to the legal environment and Solvency II.  What is not clear is the contributory factor of each of these items to the overall issue.  Specific information breaking down the size of those issues would lead to better targeting and resolution of the problem.</p><p> It is not entirely clear how claims are contributing to the issue, and that is specifically of interest to us.  Our figures in recent years do not support the level of increase in claims and we cannot see how it would justify the increases we have seen.  It is also very important to consider what has changed with respect to the level of claims and awards.  One can look at the average level of award at &euro;22,000 and see what has changed in recent years, driving into that increase in premiums.</p><p> I have a brief description of the different settlement channels that outlines the data available and different facets of those channels.  Claims may be settled directly between parties - the insurer and the claimant.  Claims may be settled through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, channel or through the courts.  The biggest issue, as many people have said before us, is the lack of data or the ability to target where the issues are.  If the issue is not with claims, is it in direct settlements?  Is it in the direct settlements process before or after getting to PIAB?  Does it relate to litigation costs or the average settlement amounts?  Some data is available through the courts at an aggregate level and some extra information in terms of a breakdown between personal injury and, for example, medical negligence would be very useful.  We could look at the average awards in courts to see if there is movement in the figures.</p><p> What is the Injuries Board doing about this?  There has been much discussion about the book of quantum.  That has been finalised and will be issued in the coming weeks, in line with the new court term.  If adopted by all parties settling claims, it will bring increased consistency to awards and allow the insurers to reserve more accurately.  It is not a silver bullet for current issues with the insurance premiums but if it is used consistently, it will certainly help the issue.  The book will reflect closed claims by the courts, the Injuries Board and claims data from the insurers and State claims agencies for the years 2013 and 2014.  This extensive exercise was undertaken by independent consultants and involved the analysis of over 50,000 claims.  There are also other changes to the book, with more gradation of awards and more injuries covered where data was not available for the initial book of quantum.  There will also be a better explanation of individual injuries.</p><p> As with many other bodies and individuals, we are seeking more transparency in claims settlements and the movements in these settlements over the past couple of years.  This may be a difficult exercise but there are four basic pieces of information that could be published.  These are the number of injury claims, the average settlement amount, average fees being paid and the length of time taken to settle those claims.</p><p> We are working closely with the Department of Finance working group to find ideas for reducing the cost of motor insurance.  There are some specific ideas that could be looked at in the context of this group's work.  Others have mentioned the idea of creating a national claims register to increase transparency, which would be a significant addition in identifying current and future issues with claims.  There would be some other benefits to the introduction of such a database, such as easier and more regular updates to the book of quantum because of the immediate availability of information.  It would also allow analysis of injuries and accidents in the State to consider root causes and try to bring this back to what is causing the claims in the first place in terms of road and other accidents.</p><p> We would also like to see a review of the personal injuries environment in Ireland, perhaps through the establishment of a commission to consider the various options discussed by this committee and others.  We would like to see a mechanism by which we could increase the level of acceptance of awards through a number of measures, either through fast-tracking cases into the courts or other mechanisms that could be considered.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-14a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gary Dunne" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016091400002#B00300"><p>I start by thanking the committee on behalf of the Society of Actuaries in Ireland for inviting us to present at this meeting.  We aim to help the committee by providing insights into the context of the rising costs of motor insurance.  We will also discuss how the Society of Actuaries in Ireland can support informed policy-making by contributing to a Government-led and market-wide statistical analysis of the industry.  We welcome and support the call by the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, for greater transparency in the industry.</p> <p>  I am Gary Dunne and I am the chair of the of the general insurance committee for the Society of Actuaries in Ireland.  I am joined by Mr. Ronan Mulligan, the deputy chair of the committee.  The Society of Actuaries in Ireland is the professional body representing actuaries.  It is primarily a voluntary body and we are not representative of the industry.  The society's roles are: to develop the role and standing of the actuarial profession in Ireland and enhance its reputation; support actuaries throughout their careers; and develop, maintain and enforce actuarial standards.  The society seeks to make an impartial contribution to public debate on social policy and public interest matters where an actuarial perspective may add value.  This committee - and its eventual report - provides one instance to make such a contribution so we are delighted to be here to assist.</p> <p>  I will discuss insurance premiums and the factors behind them.  The premium a customer pays today will discharge the claims that may be settled more than ten years into the future.  The time taken to settle a claim introduces uncertainty when the policy is being priced.  Property damage claims are relatively predictable in terms of both incidence and cost but injury claims are not only the largest component of an insurance premium, they are also subject to the greatest level of uncertainty.  The key factors relating to the price of insurance are the total cost of claims - which, in turn, depends on the number of claims and the average cost of an individual claim - the insurance company expenses, including the commissions paid, and the insurance company's profit target.</p> <p>  I mentioned earlier that we would like to bring some insight into the rising cost of motor insurance and, in particular, the base to which the rises are being compared.  Part of the recent increase in premiums reflects the need to restore pricing to a level that provides better security for claim payments.  In effect, this is a return to the correct base level.  Central Statistics Office statistics indicate that car insurance prices fell 27% between 2003 and the start of 2010.  Thereafter, Quinn Insurance went into administration later in 2010, Royal Sun Alliance incurred a loss of &euro;240 million in 2013, Setanta collapsed and there have been changes to court awards.  In addition, we had the Russell case in 2014, the proposed civil liability (amendment) Bill relating to periodic payments orders in 2015 and the FBD loss of &euro;96 million, also in 2015.  During the period in question there has been a 42% increase in the number of Injuries Board awards for motor insurance as well.</p> <p>  Three insurance companies required significant increases in reserves.  This meant their pricing was too low over the period.  This is backed up by Central Bank of Ireland statistics indicating motor underwriting losses of between &euro;20 and &euro;30 per &euro;100 of premium between 2013 and 2015.</p><p>Another part of the increase in costs is a higher degree of uncertainty in awards driven by court and other changes.  In addition, the experience has been worse than expected with more claims and higher costs.  In our view, for policy makers to be able to take effective action to control costs now and in the future while maintaining a properly functioning insurance market, it is essential to have ongoing information on the key factors impacting these costs.  This must include information on how these factors are evolving over time.  One of the key issues in resolving the rise in costs, however, is the lack of adequate information.  We are aware that many other bodies have called for greater transparency.  As insurance is quite a technical industry, the design of any study is very important.</p><p> There has been criticism of the lack of information on claims and market trends in the Irish motor insurance sector and this contrasts with the availability of information in the USA and UK, to cite just two examples.  The Institute and Faculty of Actuaries in the UK has undertaken a market-wide analysis each year since 2010.  This annual analysis has highlighted factors behind changes in insurance costs which allows policy to be informed by evidence-based research.  For example, it was possible to show that after legal reforms, legal costs reduced from approximately 40% to approximately 20% of claims below &pound;100,000.  This has also allowed the institute to provide other support to policy making such as the 2013 Transport Select Committee investigation into whiplash claims.  We do not have this market analysis in Ireland and it is therefore not possible to see the contributions of various factors to the overall premium.  We have carried out initial work on the feasibility of the Society of Actuaries performing a similar analysis in Ireland.  Considerations that we have needed to address include access to data, financing and resourcing the work.  We have also received legal advice that there may be competition law considerations.  We note now that Insurance Ireland is starting a process to gather industry data and it may be that this data can be used to undertake a market-wide statistical analysis.  Evidence-based research is vital to underpin informed policy making.  As such, we support the call of the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, for greater transparency and urge the Government to commission an annual analysis similar to that performed in other jurisdictions.  Such an analysis should not just cover industry data but also data from the Injuries Board and other road safety data.  The Society of Actuaries in Ireland will be very happy to lend its technical expertise and contribute to the design of such a study.</p></speech>

Clearly, both witnesses' organisations are very informed as to what is going on within the insurance industry, particularly motor insurance.  A number of members have indicated that they wish to put questions.  Generally, we allow each member to put questions, get responses and then put further questions before moving on to the next member.  I may interject from time to time as Chair.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-14a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1378" speakername="Rose Conway Walsh" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016091400002#C00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  For the last two weeks, we have been putting all the pieces together and as such it is very interesting to hear the different perspectives.  We have proposed that the CSO take on the role of providing an independent voice in regularly publishing data on the industry.  Does the Society of Actuaries in Ireland feel that it is better placed to do that and, if so, why?  Can the society explain further its relationship with Insurance Ireland?  Is it fair to say it has a symbiotic relationship with the insurance industry?  Might that interdependence affect its ability to act independently in any role involving collecting data and publishing it in a neutral way?  Mr. Dunne stated that the key factors in the price of insurance include the total cost of claims which in turn depends on the number of claims and their average cost.  The insurance companies' expenses, including commissions, and their profit targets are the other key factors.  The committee has been sitting for two weeks and I have yet to hear any evidence beyond spin that the total cost of claims, and again we have heard it today, has increased in any meaningful way.  The number of claims may have increased as one would expect in a growing economy but beyond that any other claim that costs have significantly increased has been well and truly refuted, including today.  Given that we have seen a 70% increase in two years, is it the case that companies' commissions in terms of their profit target is responsible for the increases?  I would like the society's thoughts on some of those questions.</p> <p>  PIAB has come under a great deal of scrutiny and many aspersions have been cast by the industry.  As such, it is good to have its representatives here today to have a look at some of the real figures.  There is a view that PIAB is designed to be a lawyer-free zone and that it has been taken over by the legal people.  We had the Law Society in here yesterday.  Based on what Mr. O'Brien told the committee, it appears that a high proportion of claimants have always chosen to use the law which figure has not changed significantly.  Has it increased in the last two years and, if so, by what level?  Are there any circumstances in which PIAB covers legal fees?  If so, what are they and what has been the cost of that in recent years?  Has that decreased or increased?</p> <p>  We continue to return to two important issues around the book of quantum and the lack of data.  A representative of the Law Society told us yesterday that from what he had heard, the book of quantum will show an increase in the lower levels and the higher levels.  Is that PIAB's understanding of what will happen with the new book of quantum?  Has the insurance industry provided all of the data it could to the book of quantum reviewers?  How can the process be made more transparent?  Is the book of quantum being delayed due to any lack of co-operation on any side?  The Central Bank publishes many statistics on the motor insurance sector.  What is missing from the data already published?  Why has the book of quantum not been reviewed for such a long time and will it be reviewed more regularly from now on?  Is there anything within the gift of PIAB to address the fact that people's first instinct is to see a solicitor when they have had accidents?  Does PIAB feel the legal profession is giving people enough information around the services PIAB can offer?  I am getting at the low number of people who have taken up the avenue of PIAB instead of going straight to court.  How can we reduce the legal tie-in with PIAB as it was never set up to be that?  It was established for people to access themselves and to provide a fast track.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-14a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gary Dunne" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016091400002#C00500"><p>I thank the Senator for her questions.  They are multifaceted and as such I will answer some and let Mr. Mulligan address others.  The first question was on the CSO collecting data.  From some perspectives, that could actually be quite a good thing.  One of the things I referenced earlier was potential competition law concerns.  While I do not speak as a lawyer, it is a difficult area.  We would have to ensure that there were no issues there.  If the Central Statistics Office was able to collect data and make it freely accessible, the Society of Actuaries would consider that fantastic.  The society does not want to collect data itself.  That is not what we are about.  In practical terms, to carry out the analysis that has been done in other countries requires a vast volume of data.  The Central Statistics Office is used to dealing with individual points.  To do a proper statistical analysis, one would seek to get a great deal more data.  Again, I said that is something the Society of Actuaries is happy to contribute to in terms of the design but the question of who collects it is one on which we are fairly agnostic.  It is more that it should be collected and we should have an annual analysis.  The design is crucial to ensure that we find out what the key components are.  There are many anecdotes around why insurance prices are going up and that is the reason we need a committee.  There are too many anecdotes and not enough evidence.  It is really about striving for evidence, obtaining which is the only way we are going to know.</p> <p>  I do not know how one would characterise our relationship with Insurance Ireland.</p><p>It is friendly.  We do not have a formal or informal relationship with it.  We meet it on occasion but there is no real need for interaction between our two bodies.  We are doing different things.  We are a voluntary body - primarily a professional body for actuaries - so there is no real relationship there, but we will happily meet it and discuss any issues as they arise.</p><p> The Senator asked a question about independence.  One of the things actuaries would very much pride themselves on is the ability to be independent.  One of the society's tenets is to contribute independently to debate, and it does that wherever it can.  That is evident from our sister entities in other jurisdictions.  In the UK there is a very comprehensive and detailed analysis, done from an independent perspective, to show what the factors are and to show the impact of changes, such as the legal reforms I mentioned which halved legal costs.  That brings transparency such that if premiums did not drop to allow for this, the market sees that.  That is happening on an ongoing basis.  Actuaries would very much pride themselves on their ability to act independently and to provide an independent voice in those circumstances.</p></speech>

We met informally with a number of companies as well to see if, in principle, they would agree to something like this.  The answer was a clear and resounding "Yes".  Among the companies and industry bodies we met, there were no concerns whatsoever about replicating the UK level of analysis, which is very detailed.  There were never any concerns mentioned to us.

I presume it took quite a period before it could be properly designed and implemented, the data analysed and published and the competition concerns addressed.  It was quite a while in incubation but it has been published since 2010 and has developed over there.  We were seeking to start the conversation here.  It is helpful in the UK in terms of assisting actuaries in doing their work.  It helps to address issues around uncertainty and knowing what is happening in a broader market context outside of one's own company.  As part of our role in supporting our members, we thought this was a good idea.  It is also probably more pertinent now given the issues that have emerged in the motor insurance market over the last couple of years.</p></speech>

We took some legal advice which said that there might be competition concerns with this, so we need to take more legal advice to dig into those issues and understand what they potentially are.  Our legal system is similar to that in the UK and the latter has been able to surmount this.  I believe it pertains to European regulations as well, so it should be the same regulation.  We do not believe the problems are insurmountable but they have not yet been overcome.</p></speech>

There was a significant risk of this occurring.  Ironically, greater transparency in an industry can facilitate collusion rather than inhibit it because participants then know more about what each other is doing.  The issue is fundamentally quite complex and we are definitely not lawyers.  We know the UK has managed to overcome this barrier and we were hopeful that we would be able to overcome it as well.  The society spent money getting legal advice to see if we could achieve this, but we paused our efforts because we understand Insurance Ireland is starting a process to gather more data itself.</p></speech>

They have different IT infrastructure, but that is okay because the issues in Ireland are a little different as well so we need to get different data.</p></speech>

The solicitor involvement has not changed much over many years.  Between 90% and 95% of claimants are represented by a solicitor and always have been.  It is a person's choice as to whether they come to us directly or go through a solicitor.  It is entirely up to them.  If they decide to come to us with a solicitor, they must settle their fee with the solicitor themselves.  We do not allow fees unless there are certain circumstances which I will refer to momentarily.</p> <p>  I will ask Maurice Priestley to deal with the questions on the book of quantum in terms of decreases or increases in awards.</p></speech>

Independent consultants were commissioned to prepare the book.  They collated data from the Courts Service, Insurance Ireland, the State Claims Agency and the board from closed claims in 2013 and 2014.  The findings in the book are reflective of what is happening currently in the market.  It will not have an inflationary effect on the cost of claims in Ireland, as has been suggested in other arenas.  Within the book each injury has a number of levels of severity and each level of severity has a band of values attached to it.  It is difficult to make a general observation given the level of detail in it.  An overall general observation is that there has been some upward movement at the lower end of the scale and a reduction at the higher level.  Without having the book available and going through each injury, it is difficult to comment otherwise.  We are happy to return to the committee when the book is issued to go through it, if that is required.</p></speech>

When we make an award in those cases, a court will ultimately have to rule on the quantum of damages.  There are other certain circumstances depending on the capacity of the individual and his or her ability to transact with this.  We would allow fees in such cases.  Another example would be in public liability cases where there would be a difficulty in identifying who is the person at fault.  The typical person might not be able to determine who is at fault because there could be several people involved.</p> <p>  The total amount we allow in fees annually is less than &euro;1.5 million a year, which would have a negligible impact on the cost of insurance.  On Mr. Conor O'Brien&rsquo;s point about the numbers who deal with solicitors, since 2006 when the O&rsquo;Brien Supreme Court decision was given, we have had 90% to 95% of people using a solicitor.  It is currently 93% and it has not changed over the past three years.  We still have 2,000 people a year who will make their claim directly to the board.  Over the past ten years, there was only one occasion where fewer than 90% of people used a solicitor.  That was in 2008 when we embarked on an extensive advertising campaign which had the impact of bringing it down to 88% for a short period.  However, that was not sustainable in the long-term.</p> <p>  We have carried out research as to why people would use a solicitor and there are valid reasons as to why people would prefer to have somebody dealing with us on their behalf.  The main point is that there has been no change over the past number of years.</p></speech>

Any expense incurred as a result of an accident is included.  In Ireland, hospitals are entitled to recover the cost of medical treatment provided following a motor accident.

However, it was for that purpose only.  It was not to be used for any other purpose.  There were no delays or lack of co-operation in the provision of data.</p> <p>  On the issue of missing data to figure out what issues are at play, I stated in my presentation that there were four basic pieces of information, namely, the number of personal injury claims, the average settlement amount, the time it takes to settle and associated fees.  If that was tracked over several years, it would certainly help.</p> <p>  Why was the book of quantum not revised up to this point?  The book of quantum was originally compiled in 2004 and would have taken several years to come fully into operation.  We then went through a long period of reducing premiums.  Accordingly, there was no call or context to revise the book of quantum.  However, in our 2014 strategic plan, we identified that it was probably time to review the book.  It was initiated in 2015.  We intend to review it on a three yearly basis from this point.</p></speech>

It pointed out the average pay out for whiplash in Ireland is &euro;15,000 while it is &euro;3,000 in Italy and Spain and &euro;5,000 in the UK and that 80% of motor injury claims relate to whiplash in Ireland compared to 3% in France which adds &euro;130 to the cost of every premium.

Those are quite interesting figures and it would be interesting to see the analysis behind that and what other information could be published.  A key question is whether they have changed in recent years.  For example, if the average whiplash payment is &euro;15,000, has it increased dramatically over the past several years or has it remained static?  There are two separate issues involved.  One is the actual level of awards and the other is the change over time.</p> <p>  On 80% of claims relating to whiplash, again that is an interesting statistic.

The real issue is that it has always been that way.  There is no suggestion that it has changed over the years.  There has always been an issue between the level of damages in Ireland and the level in the UK, particularly for soft tissue claims.  That has not changed as far as I am aware over the years.  Why it has been identified now as a particular issue in the context of the increase in premiums is difficult to understand.  As Mr. Conor O&rsquo;Brien said, unless the data behind the facts being put out is made available, it is very difficult to comment further on it.</p></speech>

Of the 33,000 claims we receive, we are dependent on the insurance companies consenting to us assessing the claims.  Of the 33,000, we get consent on 50% or 55% of them and, within those, we are dependent then on the medical evidence available to us as to whether they are capable of being assessed.  We are subject to timeframes.  If somebody has an injury and it is not possible to determine the final outcome of the injury within the nine months available to us to assess the claim, we have to release it.  That accounts for some of them.</p> <p>  Last year, we assessed approximately 12,000 claims and of those 12,000, approximately 60% were accepted, but it would be somewhat narrow-focused-----</p></speech>

Of the cases rejected, we do not know what is happening to them.

Of the 33,000 we receive, we filter them to see which are appropriate for assessment by the board.  We do not assess claims such as wholly psychological claims.  Some of the injuries are so complex they are not open to assessment.  I do not know what the figure would be; it may be about 10%.</p></speech>

We do not know whether they have settled or are not being pursued.  We are then relying on the insurer to consent to the case or not.  They would consent to approximately 18,000 cases, with us assessing.  Even after that we lose a few thousand cases before assessment.  They are not pursued.  We do not know whether they have been settled or are just not being pursued.  The problem is that we can tell the Deputy the exact number of cases we assessed and the number we received.  We know the outcome, but there is a huge volume of cases about which we do not know the outcome.</p> <p>  The Central Bank did a study in 2011 in which it asked insurance companies for the outcome of three months of cases that had been finalised.  They broke it down into cases that were settled before and during the Injuries Board process.  The outcome of that study was that 70% of cases were finalised either by the Injuries Board, through settlements or were not pursued.  Only 30% of cases ended up going into litigation.  When the board's model was originally conceptualised, the view was that two thirds of cases would be taken out of litigation.  Those 2011 figures, which unfortunately are the most recent, would show that approximately 70% of cases have been removed.</p></speech>

It depends on the way one looks at it.  We have no control over cases that will not be pursued, that will be settled or which the insurer does not consent.  We can only assess cases where consent is given, and that is what we do.</p> <p>  Another point is that we do not know what happens to our rejected cases.  It may be that some of them are settled some weeks later for a small additional or that many of them end up going into the costly litigation system.  We do not have that breakdown.</p></speech>

Their presentation seems to rationalise the reasons premiums have increased so much.  They set out the background and the reasons and, in a sense, a justification for it.  They do not reach any conclusion as to whether it is justified, but do we have data on the financial performance of the Irish arms of the multinational insurance firms?  The witnesses gave a number of examples of financial performance, but do we have data on the performance of the Irish operations of the insurance firms?  Can they give us a sense of that?  Have the insurers been losing money in the motor insurance market in Ireland in the past three or four years?  What is the picture?</p></speech>

The Central Bank publish statistics on an annual basis, although there is quite a lag to that.  We referenced some Central Bank statistics that were given to us that show a loss of between &euro;20 to &euro;30 per &euro;100 of premium on motor insurance; that is for Irish motor insurers.  There is evidence to say that Irish motor insurers were losing a substantial amount of money from 2013 to 2015, at a minimum.</p></speech>

One can add them up and get the results for the market as well.  That said, if we go back, they have made a lot of money in motor insurance in the past as well.  If we consider the period between 2001 and 2007, the motor market would have made quite a lot of money.  Between 2007 and 2012-13, the market was breaking even.  It made money in some years and lost money in others.  That is characteristic of an underwriting cycle.  Money is made.  People chase market share.  They chase that profit.  Prices come down.  What we were trying to say in the presentation is that they came down by too much, and that is a natural part of the underwriting cycle.  As companies chase market share, they reduced premiums too much and what we see now is prices coming back again but at a very pronounced level; 70% is an enormous number over the past three years.  In terms of understanding that, they are coming from a low base, and then we have this uncertainty in the claims environment that they are pricing in too.</p> <p>  There is evidence that they have lost money in the past two or three years.  Perhaps we should take a longer term view, and actuaries would always recommend that we look at these matters over the longer term and over the cycle.  We are where we are, and we shall see in the Central Bank returns over the coming years where the insurers profitability lies.</p><p>The problem is that it does not address the issue right now and that information is delayed or lagged because it is published in arrears and the financial results the insurers produce tend to be lagged as well relating to accounting rules.</p></speech>

Are there any statistics or any kind of data on the percentage of times the judges fall within the book of quantum or is it so vague that those kinds of statistics are not available?  Somebody told us yesterday that the book of quantum could give anything between &euro;30,000 and &euro;80,000 for a particular type of injury.  If that is the case, one judge might give &euro;30,000 for an injury while another gives &euro;80,000 for the same injury yet they will tick the box that says they both fell within the book of quantum.  Is the book of quantum so vague that we do not know what individual judges are paying out?  I was told anecdotally last week, in connection with employer liability or public liability, that insurance companies decide the settlements outside the courts when they hear which judge is on because one individual pays out a lot more than another in similar situations.  While the Injuries Board deals with cases that do not go to court, does it or the actuaries have any understanding of that?</p></speech>

Where there were three levels of impairment in the original book, we have increased that, where the data is available, to four levels of impairment and have given more description in each of those levels.  That will allow judges and others using the book to make more informed decisions.  The book is a guideline.  It could not possibly encapsulate every personal injury that happens in the State.  It can only ever be a guideline and it gives those broad bands to allow people consider relative awards for different injuries.  In the overall scheme of things, not many cases go all the way through the courts.  We would not have any data on adherence to the book of quantum.  It would mainly be anecdotal.</p></speech>

My first question is for the actuaries on the Central Bank statistics.  Table 15 of the Central Bank statistics on motor insurance shows in 2014 a loss for companies with headquarters in Ireland of &euro;137 million and in 2013 a loss of &euro;195 million.  Before that it shows profits of &euro;145 million in 2012, &euro;156 million in 2011, &euro;7 million in 2010, &euro;124 million in 2009, &euro;113 million in 2008 and for the five years preceding that a significant profit of &euro;500 million on a yearly basis.  Is it fair to say that, as a whole over ten or 20 years, car insurance has been highly profitable in Ireland?  When added together the results for 20 years come to &euro;2.86 billion in profits for companies headquartered in Ireland.  Over three years premiums have gone up by 70%.  That tallies with profits falling, for example, in 2013 they went down.  Would the actuaries agree that is consistent with the rise in premiums being an attempt to restore profitability?</p></speech>

There would not be an industry unless there was a reasonable level of profit.  There has to be a reasonable level of profit within an industry to ensure that there are competitors, because otherwise competitors will pull back.  If the losses were sustained over 20 years, if we had lost several billion euro over 20 years, how many companies would want to stay in that market?  It is not for us to decide the definition of the word "reasonable" in that instance but there does need to be a reasonable level of profit.  One of the points we made in our presentation was that the rate increase does look very high and one reason for that is that the base was too low so in most recent years there was an unsustainable situation.  As a result part of the reason for the rate increase was to support that.</p></speech>

Deputy Murphy has to think about how much capital they had to put into the industry to be permitted to trade and what those numbers represent as a return on that capital.  The absolute number is a big number but they have to hold enormous amounts of capital on a regulatory basis to be allowed to trade as insurance companies in the State and therefore expressed as a percentage of that capital is that a great return or not for the investments they have made?  That is how I would look at it.  On that basis, I apologise but the numbers get even more complicated because the capital is supporting not only motor business, but property business, commercial business and lots of different types of activity, each of which has variable profits.  Unfortunately, it is very complex and it is not really for me to say they were making huge amounts of profit or normal or low profits.  One could do that type of analysis but it would be complex and get a better answer expressed as a rate of return rather than an absolute amount.</p></speech>

How much profit do they make on the average policy?  Do the actuaries have any figures for an international comparison?  I have seen figures that suggest that the average surplus per policy in Ireland is significantly higher than in Britain, which is a good comparator in terms of the market.</p></speech>

The Deputy is probably referring to the private motor insurance statistics that the Central Bank has published.  That is where it uses the term surplus per policy.</p><p>One of our reasons for saying that we feel that we would be very happy to support the design of a study is because, as the committee will notice, the surplus per policy changes over time as claims are paid.  If we go out to the ultimate point of the claims being paid over ten years, the surplus in year 1 will be a certain number that will drop and drop and will potentially become negative.  In the most recent years, we expect it to become negative.  As Mr. Mulligan said, from a technical perspective, we call it the combined ratio.  When it is above 100%, one is underwriting losses and when it is below 100%, it is underwriting profits.  That would allow for the expectation of how the claims would develop over time.</p></speech>

That is why I think we should broaden the scope.  There is a different model of insurance, which is a not-for-profit model in which we do not have to have this extra cost.  That &euro;2.86 billion was paid by people in premiums as a cost.  If Mr. Dunne thinks, ideologically, that it is necessary then it is a necessary cost, but it does not have to be.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-14a.112" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gary Dunne" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016091400002#H00300"><p>Absolutely.  There are definitely competing models and other countries have gone down different routes.  The UK has not.  The Deputy mentioned them as a direct comparative.  The UK has not and it obviously feels that competition is the best way forward.  One thing I would like to emphasise is that models like that can hide underlying issues.  It takes a long time for these issues to surface.  Take the example of paying on the price of the pump if one decides to increase the price of petrol or diesel to allow for third-party liability motor insurance costs.  The rationale is that the more one drives, the more likely one is to have an accident.  That seems fair.  However, if there are underlying issues such as inefficiencies in the market in terms of dealing with claims, be they legal, expenses, medical or whatever it may be, they are hidden for a while because it is just the price of the pump and it is spread across absolutely everybody.  Therefore, it is a bit harder because it is not being allocated back to the people.  There are definite positives to an approach like that but also negatives as well.  As long we consider both of them, we can make an informed choice.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Dunne for those responses.</p> <p>  In terms of the Injuries Board, a big issue is the black box of lack of knowledge that we have, which is all that is not settled through the court or through the Injuries Board.  I accept that.  There was someone from the insurance industry - either this morning or last night - who was suggesting that lawyers are responsible for the majority of claims not going through the Injuries Board and instead being settled outside of that body, be it in court or privately.  Is that the case, given what the witness is saying about the insurance companies only agreeing that something like 55% or 60% will go through the Injuries Board?  Surely the majority of the decisions that are made by the various actors that result in claims not being processed through the Injuries Board are more on the side of the insurance companies than the claimants.  Is that fair to say?</p></speech>

We do not know how many of those people use a solicitor and we do not know if fees are paid at that stage or not.  As Mr. Watkins said earlier, we have seen no change in that representation in our own data and unfortunately that is the only data that we have on this.</p></speech>

The claimant has no choice in the matter.  The next step in the process is that we notify the respondent, which is typically an insurer, and it has a decision to make.  It decides whether we can assess the case or not.  The next decision is when we make an award and both parties have to decide whether they accept it or not.</p></speech>

In the case of respondents, it is usually around the 90% mark.  However, there are different dynamics at play.  For the respondent, there is the issue of going into a high cost environment.  There are different issues for the claimant.</p></speech>

That only relates to the claims that were received by us.  We do not know how many claims were settled at the outset.  This year, the number of claims has reduced by just under 1% in the six months to June 2016 compared with the same period last year.  Our average awards are stable.  By way of example, in 2013 our average motor award was &euro;21,730.  The average motor award in the last 12 months to the end of June was &euro;21,782.  The figures are almost identical.  If one looks at our average motor awards over the past six or seven years, they fluctuate by 1% or 2% every year but are basically stable.</p></speech>

It is nobody's fault that cost of premiums has risen by 70% in the past three years, which is a staggering figure.  According to the submission from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, the figures show that personal injuries motor claims volumes and average award values are static.  The witnesses have argued that there is an absence of overall data, an issue that has been raised by several groups as a major problem.  It has been argued that improved availability of data may help to reduce the cost of premiums.  The PIAB has also said that there could be an issue with the claims that are settled outside of the PIAB process but it does not have access to the full facts on those claims.</p> <p>  The Minister for Finance has suggested that legal fees were a contributory factor in the increase in insurance costs.  However, representatives of the legal profession appeared before this committee yesterday and refuted this suggestion.  They also pointed to the absence of data as an issue.</p> <p>  The book of quantum, which is currently being reviewed, has also been raised on numerous occasions.  Do the actuaries have any input into the preparation of the book of quantum?</p></speech>

Prior to the establishment of the board in 2003, cases could really only go into litigation.  A small number of cases were settled but most could only go into litigation to be resolved.  In the cases that are dealt with by the Injuries Board, while the award levels are maintained, the delivery costs involved are quite low.  For example, at the time of our establishment, a typical case that ended up in litigation would have had an additional 50% add-on in terms of costs, according to the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB.  In our system, the add-on is only 6% or 7%.  Back in 2003 when cases were being diverted to us, they were benefiting from an overall lower cost model which would have been a factor in the cost of claims which, one can assume, had an impact on premiums.</p></speech>

I think one of the key points to remember is that a lot of things happened in 2003 which led to a decrease in claims costs which then resulted in a decrease in premiums.  Claims costs can refer to the average claim as well as the total number.  In 2003, the Injuries Board was established which had a clear, visible impact.  What the representatives of the board have said on costs is that the amount of money that the injured party received stayed the same but the legal element, when cases used to go through the courts, disappeared or was reduced to a fixed fee.  Therefore, the amount that the insurers actually paid out was reduced.  At the same time we had the introduction of penalty points and a major focus on road safety.  This meant that the number of claims reduced.  So, not only did the number of claims reduce, there was also a saving, at least in part, on each claim.  There was also a large campaign conducted on fraud at around the same time.  People became aware that it is not a zero-sum game and that insurance fraud is literally taking money from someone else's pocket.  As a result, the amount of fraud reduced.  A series of things happened that meant that claims costs, as a total, reduced which then led to premium reductions over that period.  Actuaries would have been taking that into account in their pricing.</p><p>They would say, looking forward, costs are reducing, we accept that and recognise it and therefore the prices should reduce so that is why the prices have come down.</p></speech>

I thought he made a reference to that in his previous submission, that it was not just about efficiencies in terms of penalty points, fewer crashes and less expensive crashes but that the insurance companies went off chasing the market and that is a cyclical thing.  Is that a part of it as well or was it just due to better road safety, better roads perhaps and the fraud campaign?</p></speech>

Between 2003 and 2007, premiums came down because costs came down due to road safety and the Injuries Board among other factors.  At that stage insurers thought the market was profitable and that business was good so they decided to reduce their rates.</p></speech>

It takes up to ten years to pay a claim.  There is a great amount of uncertainty so some it can be banked but some of it cannot.  As costs came down, people were chasing market share.  At some stage the opposite happened and either due to road safety, the sheer volume of traffic on the roads, an increase in the number of claims, an increase in the amount of awards or an increase in legal costs, there was an increase in the overall costs.  Again, it takes time for that filter through the system because the amount paid in the first year is very low as a percentage of the amount that will ultimately be paid because it takes a long time to pay the claims.  There is a lag where the cost of insurance starts to come back up again and insurers decide it is not a profitable business, that it is a loss-making business and they have to increase rates.  That is one of the reasons there is a cycle.  It is purely because of the way the mechanics work.</p></speech>

It is a complex issue.  There are more people on the roads and therefore there will be more claims.  It is as simple as that.  That is what we have seen in all of the statistics to which we have had access, which is the same public information that is available to anybody else.  It does look like there is a material increase, in particular in injury claims, which is the main factor in the cost of a premium.  Injury claims have gone up quite materially from 2012 to 2015.  There are more claims coming through, but ultimately it comes back to the original point that we do need a good robust analysis of the issue in a transparent fashion which will highlight not only how much money is being made but, it is hoped, it will also allow us to find the factors behind that, which will then allow policy-makers to form policy decisions.</p></speech>

No.  What we do is look at the total cost of claims.  We know there will be a certain amount of fraud, as that is inherent in the process.  Senator Burke is seeking to price that but I am not sure whether our pricing actuaries necessarily look to say it is explicitly X amount of loading for fraud.  If one looks at the premium, about 70% to 80% of it relates to the cost of claims, so that is the number we are trying to estimate.  We might break that down between damage claims and injury claims and try to estimate them separately, but I am not sure it is worked out separately how much fraud there is in the system and that it costs X amount.  We just know the total cost in a certain region.</p></speech>

I welcome the presentations and the responses to many questions, some of which I intended to pose.  The Society of Actuaries in Ireland has given a good example of what has been happening since 2010, a picture with which we are quite familiar.  We have seen an increase of 70% in premiums in the past two years.  I do not suggest it has come from the society but there has been much deliberate misrepresentation of what is happening within the industry to create a smokescreen.  The sum of &euro;15,000 was always paid out for whiplash claims.  They are not the highest in Europe as other European countries have higher payments.  If that level of compensation was always the case, then it cannot result in a 70% increase.  If legal fees have not jumped, then it cannot result in a 70% increase.  The committee is trying to ascertain the reason and what is within the control of the Houses of the Oireachtas in terms of increased premiums.</p> <p>  Mr. Dunne is the chairperson of the Society of Actuaries in Ireland, but is it true that he also works for one of the biggest insurance companies in the country?</p></speech>

Professor Honohan went to say that the Minister would have noticed as well that these companies had put at their helm new CEOs to effect this return to profitability.  Is that not the point here?  The point is that these companies were behaving imprudently, saw a massive reduction in their investment income, appointed new CEOs and are now ramping up profitability because they have an issue with their own capital base and because Solvency II kicked in at the start of this year.  The other issues, such whiplash, extra claims and legal fees are important and we need to deal with them but it does not actually deal with the substance of the big issue, which is that the model at that point in time was not fit for purpose.</p></speech>

It is true that the CEOs have changed; that we were coming from a position from 2010 through to 2014, for which we have statistics, when insurance prices were at a very low base; that a number of companies did suffer erosion to their capital bases because they were not profitable through that period; and that there were some failures and some withdrawals through that period.  The Deputy said the model was broken.  What I would say is that prices were too low for there to be a sustainable profitable model and insurance companies have responded-----</p></speech>

They charged on that basis because they were of the view that they would have this type of investment income into the future.  Quantitative easing came along and basically said that they could not get the 4% return on their Government bonds that they used to get and would get negative rates.  This means that insurance companies have lost that portion of their income but earlier this year, the governor of the Central Bank, Philip Lane, told them not to chase risky investments so they are now in a situation where they have to charge insurance premiums at a cost that will cover all the claims and the investment income does not really come into it.  Is that not-----</p></speech>

During the period, they were underwriting losses but were able to subsidise those with returns on investment.  We are now in a place where yields have fallen to very low levels and there is no possibility of subsidising underwriting losses to the same extent because yields are so low now.  They are returning to underwriting as a source for profit.</p></speech>

The problem is that the underwriting or investment losses are not only attributable to the motor insurance industry.  In respect of the &euro;100 million that was lost in those three years or the smaller amount of income generated between 2000 and 2014, a small portion of that came from the motor insurance industry.  Is it not the case that because motor insurance is compulsory, losses made by non-life insurance companies in other areas are now being passed on to the insurance companies?  Is it true that to make up the shortfall caused by investment losses of &euro;100 million, even though about &euro;40 million applied to motor insurance, they must make up for the losses in other areas, for example, home insurance, but it is being loaded on to motor insurance because motor insurance is compulsory?  Is it not the case that basically, we have given the insurance companies a blank cheque?</p></speech>

Employers liability insurance and public liability insurance are products that companies will almost always purchase.  Is motor insurance bearing all of it?  Motor insurance probably is the largest piece of business that any of the insurance companies will underwrite so one's motor book is obviously one of the principal things one would target in order to return to underwriting profitability.</p></speech>

A number of Deputies and Senators have gone through the figures but if we look at the end figure of 33,000 that has come to the board, we can see that only 7,200 claims have been assessed by the board and agreed by participants so we have a huge gap in terms of numbers of claims that would have come to the board while at the same time not knowing how many of them were directly settled before they even came to the board.  In respect of the other 26,000 claims, it could be the case that the individual was not satisfied with the settlement that was being offered by the Injuries Board but in most cases, it would be the insurance companies that have not consented.  I know the board says it does not have numbers relating to the levels of claims but can the witnesses give us any indication?  Has the board monitored what has been happening in the courts?  How many of the 26,000 claims that came to the board that it did not process or accept ended up in the courts?</p></speech>

That would include medical negligence cases that would never come to us in the first place.  The balance would be made up of cases where we issued an authorisation because the award was rejected by the claimant, cases where the insurer did not consent to us assessing the case and cases we do not assess, which the legislation authorises us to release.  These would be wholly psychological cases where the claim might only include post-traumatic stress disorder.</p><p>There would also be a certain kind of case of abuse in that with which we would not deal.  There would be other cases in respect of which there may be pre-existing injuries from previous accidents and complications such that we would not assess those cases.  What we do not have is a breakdown of the court writs, which would be useful.  However, it is probably reasonable to say that most of the rejected cases will end up in litigation.</p></speech>

The number of claims received in that period would be a lot smaller than that - I think it is under 30% - but, again, if we focus on the past three years, we see that is when the problem emerged.  The 4.5% increase in motor claims between 2013 and 2015 - it was slightly down in the first six months of this year - shows that the problem of premiums seems to have arisen in the last three years.</p></speech>

As a result of the nature of personal injury claims, many factors are taken into account for an individual claim, and each case is dealt with on its own merits.  There are ranges of damages in the book for different injuries of differing severity.  Let us say one has a broken leg.  There may be three or four different levels of severity for such an injury, and for each level of severity there is a band of valuation.  The assessment is, therefore, based on the particular claim, but the book is a guideline, not a restriction as such, so it takes into account current developments in the levels of damages.</p></speech>

He said that the introduction of judicial guidelines in this regard would usefully complement the policy framework in Ireland as it has proved effective abroad.  This concerns the Injuries Board and the book of quantum.  Does the Injuries Board support that idea, that there should be judicial guidelines?  It was said earlier that the Judiciary must have due regard to the book of quantum, but that does not mean it is guided by it.  Does the board support judicial guidelines in this area regarding the book of quantum?</p></speech>

Part of the work we did in compiling the current book was to consider other models or books in use in the UK and the North of Ireland.  Due to the fact that the Judiciary has had to have regard to the book of quantum, we have also had very constructive engagement with the judiciary over the summer months on the adoption and use of the book of quantum.</p></speech>

Regarding claims that are settled, regardless of how we can fix the process or try to enhance the process, there always will be and always should be the right of an individual or indeed an insurance company to pursue a matter through the courts.  Is it the board's view that in cases of claims which come before it and are either rejected by the insurance company or by the individual, data on the ultimate level of payout, whether it is on the steps of the court or in court, should be referred to the board?  Is that something the board is seeking or would support?</p></speech>

Every level of the settlement should refer to the book of quantum because it will maximise the number of cases that are accepted through our model and remove the need for lengthy court cases and the fees associated with them.  Therefore, whatever the stage of the cycle through which the case is going, if the book is used as a guideline, it will certainly help.</p></speech>

I think in one of the documents I got through a freedom of information request I saw correspondence between the insurance sector and the Department, which were concerned about some newly appointed members of the Judiciary in terms of some of the payouts they would grant.  How does the board deal with that?  Does it revert to the book of quantum or does it now have to have regard to the new price that has been set by the courts?</p></speech>

There are always one-off cases in which the level of damages may seem unusual.  What we are considering is the general level of damages across the market.  The limited number of cases that are going to court now, that actually go to a hearing, are the most difficult cases where, say, the best minds in the Law Library or in the insurance company have been unable to settle.  It is, therefore, very important that consideration of this issue not be skewed by individual cases.  It is the market rate that needs to be considered.  Whatever the market rate is, the board is obliged to award that.</p></speech>

The first is for the Society of Actuaries in Ireland and concerns a bugbear of many people from whom I hear, namely, those who drive older cars and who are, they argue, very safe on the roads.  They argue that they are probably safer on the roads than many others because some of these cars are very old and quite expensive.  Perhaps the Injuries Board could also answer this.  Have the witnesses seen any trends whereby those driving older cars - some insurance companies refuse even to quote them - are more at risk or have they seen more of a trend compared to the data?  Do they have any oversight of that?  Could the Society of Actuaries in Ireland explain why it believes that such drivers pose a greater risk than somebody who is driving a new BMW, a new Ford Galaxy or whatever?</p></speech>

Like everything, these things are quite complex.  This is a general standpoint rather than a specific one because the Society of Actuaries in Ireland does not have access to the data.  However, an insurance company might do something like on the basis of what is termed "an underwriting reason".  Is is trying to underwrite out a particular segment.  One particular reason, anecdotally - and I am loath to use that word because we are really pushing for evidence-based decisions here - is that there can tend to be more fraud where people have recently purchased cars that are quite old with the intention of making fraudulent claims.</p><p>My recent experience, despite having an old car, was that I had no issue renewing.  I did not bother going elsewhere because at the time the premium was relatively low.  I did not look to see if there was going to be an issue changing insurer.  If it is the case, and I am not aware that it is, that insurance companies are refusing in cases where one has had a car with the same company for ten or 15 years, I do not know a reason behind that.  It would be unusual because if it is a profitable policy, why would it not want to keep it?  I can see an argument for it if there is a recent purchase of a very old car.  From an underwriting perspective, one could say one cannot even price for it.  That is the only anecdotal explanation I can proffer.</p></speech>

This issue is what drives a lot of people crazy.  The fact we have seen a 70% increase in insurance premiums is absolutely unforgivable.  I believe there is a rip-off culture and a gouging of customers.  That is my view but we will hear all the evidence and we will hear from the insurance sector.  I am open to being convinced but I think it will fail to convince me.  One thing I cannot understand is how certain people who have been insured with a company, who have not had any accidents in the previous 12 months and who have not received any penalty points in the last 12 months are seeing not a 38% or a 40% increase in their premiums but a 200% and 300% increase in their premiums.  We, as a State, cannot interfere with the setting of prices by the insurance industry but it has a legal obligation to base those prices on the basis of risk.  My understanding from speaking to people within the sector is that the insurance companies simply want these individuals off their books.  They have too many 42-year-old women living in rural Ireland on their books and they just need them gone so what they do is spit out a 200% increase.  How could that happen?  What is happening here?</p></speech>

The principle of insurance is that it is a big pool of money and everyone pays in and the people who have claims take out.  To put it in context, on average around 10% of policies have a claim in any given year.  Only 1% of policies have an injury claim so it is even a smaller number with which we are dealing that are actually the crux of the problem.  It is actually quite a low number overall.  The pot can be divided up into risk segments which I think is what the Deputy is referring to.  One can say a particular person is more risky.  To give an extreme example, a 17 year old on a provisional licence in a Ferrari will be much worse than a 50-year-old nun driving a Yaris.  They are quite different risks.  One risk will have a particular profile to it and a particular increase and another risk will have a different increase.  Even if neither has had claims, everyone needs to pay more because we do not know who will have the claims.  That is the principle of insurance, otherwise the whole system fails so everyone has to pay a bit more.  I do not have enough experience, particularly from the society's perspective, to say exactly why there are some very high increases.  What I can say and what I have heard on the radio is that when people shop around, they are able to bring that down to a level that is still high but not near the three-figure sum the Deputy referred to.  It is a common sense thing to do to shop around to ensure one has the best price for what one is purchasing.</p></speech>

Mr. Dunne has not enlightened me anymore as to why this is happening.  Members of Mr. Dunne's society inform the insurance companies of the risk associated with their policies, the type of person and so on.  These are individuals who have been insured by these companies for a number of years.  If their premiums were increasing by on average 40% or 50%, that would be in line with what was happening.  Even if it was 60%, there might be a riskier profile than for somebody else.  That is how averages work.  These are individuals, and there is a huge number of people, who are receiving 200% increases in their premium.  Is it a case that when an insurer looks at its books and sees an over-concentration of people in the 65 to 70 year age bracket, when it starts to turn the dials to increase their premiums, for that cohort of individuals, it has to turn it a bit further because it needs some of them to come off their books?</p></speech>

I know we are getting a bit technical here but in theory, one can price any risk.  No matter what it is, one can put a price on it, not just motor insurance but anything.  Lloyd's insures satellites and footballers' legs - it insures anything basically.  In theory, one can price on that basis but then there is a separate thing which is an underwriting decision.  From an underwriting perspective, an insurer can say it chose to play in this type of market and within this framework.  It can say it is quite interested in taxi drivers, it is the place in which it wants to play, it is a great area and no one else is doing it.  It can choose to play in it or not to do so.  One has to differentiate between pricing and underwriting.  What the Deputy is referring to are potentially underwriting decisions to be made.  If someone decides he or she does not want a 50 year old who drive a Yaris, which tend to be a safe risk in relative terms, that is an underwriting decision rather than a pricing one.  That would differentiate between the actuaries involvement which is on the pricing side, not necessarily the underwriting side.</p></speech>

With the actuaries' input this year, the individual, who is just one year older but no less safer on the road, has not bought a high powered beamer and is driving the same type of car, is now being charged &euro;1,200.  That is a real case example.  It is not an underwriting position.  Something has driven it.  Something has made that happen because it is completely out of kilter with what is happening within the sector as a whole.</p></speech>

If the increase is 40%, 60% or 70%, the premiums of a particular class of person who has not changed his or her car or address and has not had a claim has gone way out of kilter relative to what a lot of people would regard as pretty outrageous increases in the first place.

With every premium, I telephone or go online.  Presumably, there are lots of computer programmes.  One telephones and has a row with somebody on the phone and all of a sudden, miraculously, he or she always seems to find &euro;50 or &euro;80.  That will not solve a &euro;400 increase but it usually gets something off and one feels that their &euro;180 increase is now &euro;140.  One almost feels happy even though one should not be.  Are there other people, non-actuaries, saying that they are getting into one model or out of another?  Actuaries are very important people in the overall process.  Do they get overridden or told that the insurers hear them but are going to make another decision that is nothing to do with them and that they have just made a call?</p></speech>

We have a role here.  Somebody said no one is taking responsibility for anything.  We are here to make a contribution and actuaries have a role in the process.  I will try to answer Deputy Doherty's question, although I am not sure I have a more satisfactory answer.  We have a role in the process.  That role might be described as like setting the recommended retail price for insurance but we are not the exclusive owners of that price or the ultimate arbiters of the price the person will receive.  Company strategy, the strength of its market position and the ability to actually secure that price in the market are involved.  It will decline or hope to reduce its exposure in other parts of the market.  Where brokers are involved, they will be given latitude in certain circumstances to adjust the price as well as they see fit, to try to hit targets, generate revenue and optimise that revenue.  Actuaries have a role but not an exclusive one.  In terms of some of the prices, 70% in two years, or 30% in the last year is an average number.  Some people have not had anything like that while others have had far more.</p><p>Actuarial involvement in setting that price tends to try to segment the market into risk profiles that are as homogenous as possible and price for them in that pot.  There is a distinction between the individual and the group, in that one cannot price an individual, but one can price groups.  My opinion is not entirely fact based, but increases tend to happen in circumstances where there is a strategic underwriting decision about what one wants to target and not target.  In terms of risk profiles, many of the large increases are not made in the plain, vanilla, large amounts of data-type instances.  Rather, they tend to happen in more marginal cases, those being, very young drivers, very old drivers, perhaps very remote drivers or where circumstances have changed.  In those marginal risk profile segments, there tends to be less data.  An instance of a claim, in particular a large one, in one of those segments can suddenly cause the perception of that whole segment to change.  This is potentially a technical reason for it happening.  I am not saying that it is necessarily the reason, though.  Insurance companies may be making underwriting decisions independently of this process.  I am not sure what the reason is in every individual case, but it is a combination of a strategic decision owing to a desire not to provide cover in certain areas so as to manage the overall risk profile of the book and a technical, recommended retail price instance for marginal cases where there are not many people in a segment and a small change makes a big difference to the total risk.</p></speech>

We do not want to mention individual companies, as it would be unfair to ask people to discuss previous employers, but what of brokers' fees?  I am not asking the Injuries Board, as the fees are not part of its remit, but I presume that actuaries have full sight of data if they are working in the insurance industry.  Brokers argue that they face competition, negotiate bulk deals and get extra information, but what are the typical broker's fees?  If the motor insurance market pays &euro;1 billion, what do brokers get out of that?</p></speech>

The insurance industry has assessed that it will incur a cost of &euro;90 million if the Supreme Court case is carried through.  It seems to be causing reputational damage in the eyes of foreign companies that are considering moving into Ireland.  Qatar bucked the trend on 31 August when it announced its intention to come to Ireland, but how much has this case affected the level of uncertainty in the system?  Professor Philip Lane is on record as saying that a lottery system is operating throughout Europe in terms of regulation.  Setanta Insurance was registered in Malta, yet there appear to be unclear lines of responsibility where a company has a passport for providing insurance services in the EU.  Will the witnesses comment on this point?</p> <p>  There is a major argument about the lack of data that insurance companies use to assess risk.  This will affect foreign companies entering the market.  How do we tackle this issue?  Is there an unwillingness within the insurance sector to share information and data?  Should there be a national claims register?</p> <p>  The State-backed Insurance Compensation Fund, ICF, applied a 2% levy to account for the cost of PMPA and Quinn Insurance.  If the Supreme Court holds that the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland is not only responsible for picking up the tab for untraced and uninsured drivers, but also for policyholders and premiums where a company fails or becomes insolvent, how will that affect the insurance industry and people's premiums?</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct, in that the decision has introduced a great deal of uncertainty because new entrants to the market are considering whether, if they play in the Irish market, they will end up underwriting its weakest participant.  To some extent, it socialises the potential insolvency of anyone else operating in the market.  As to the cost of Setanta Insurance, &euro;90 million is approximately the correct number.  I am not sure how to translate that into a cost per policy, as it is a one-off and Setanta Insurance is effectively paid for, but it is a question of taking into account the potential cost of other failures when pricing.</p> <p>  Regarding the Central Bank Governor's comment about a lottery system in the regulation of insurance companies, there is a common standard across Europe, Solvency II, which was intended to harmonise the regulation of insurance companies.  While that was welcome, is good and has improved the risk assessment and management of insurance companies, its implementation and-or application will naturally vary across jurisdictions.  From a consumer's point of view, it is important to be cognisant of where an insurance company is regulated and to make a decision on same.</p> <p>  I will take the question on the ICF.  The Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, will end up underwriting the failure of insurance companies, but it is funded by a levy on the insurance industry, which is a member of MIBI.  That is the mechanism that will be used, in that the levy to MIBI will increase.  If one's annual levy to MIBI increases, one will pass that on to the policyholder.</p> <p>  Will Mr. Dunne address the lack of data?</p></speech>

The more transparency there is, the easier it is for foreign or new entrants to assess whether they want to enter the market.  In a market where there are reported losses, one is less likely to enter.  If the market is profitable, one is more likely to enter.  Reverting to an earlier point, eight major players would have a high market share.  One could name many other players, but the eight in question comprise a large percentage of the industry.  Of those eight, only one is a domestic insurer.  The rest are parts of foreign groups.  The availability of more data about profitability would make it much easier for companies to enter our market.  It is the same in every sector.  If one knows that something is profitable, one is more likely to make a good risk assessment of whether and when to enter.  This is the society's position.</p></speech>

Should the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, EIOPA, be taking the lead role in achieving a consensus on regulation throughout Europe?  The Governor of the Central Bank has responsibility for regulating the insurance sector in Ireland, but how can a consensus be achieved across Europe in respect of companies that are registered in other countries?  Should we build the consensus through the EIOPA?</p> <p>  If the Supreme Court holds that the MIBI is responsible for repaying the policyholders of insolvent insurers, will the ICF no longer be fit for purpose or should it continue?  Will the whole responsibility be passed on to the insurance sector?  Has Mr. Mulligan or the society any view on how that might affect the sector?</p></speech>

I am not sure whether the society has a strong view on whether that could be improved through the EIOPA, or whether the Central Bank has more of a role to play in terms of considering the application of the regulation in other jurisdictions.  I think the insurance compensation fund will pay 65% of the value of claims.  The issue is whether MIBI will pick up the tab for the other 35%.  It is not that the decision would make the ICF defunct in some way - it is just that the balance of the 35% would essentially be picked up by MIBI.  I think both-----</p></speech>

I note that the word "unknown" is used under each category in the Injuries Board's presentation.  Is there anything we can do, or any of the services can do, to try to ensure we can get data on them?  I know it is very difficult.  It presents difficulties.  Is there anything that the Injuries Board feels we could do to get more data, or any data, on such claims?</p></speech>

Instant transparency on claims - what is happening, what channel they are going through, what the settlement amounts are and what the fees are - would be provided from the inception of such a register.  It would lead to other benefits.  For example, revisions to the book of quantum could be done on a more regular and easier basis.  This kind of register would help with investigating the root case of accidents.  It would enable people to track more information about car accidents, for example relating to passengers and locations etc.  This might help to try to reduce the number of overall accidents.  An initiative like that would have a huge number of benefits.</p></speech>

We can talk about fraudulent claims and so on, but the figures in question show that insurance company income on the motor and liability side was &euro;1.4 billion in 2014.  The court records show that &euro;169 million was paid out in court awards and &euro;166 million was paid out through the Injuries Board.  We need to allow for administrative costs and for the fact that the State does not have to take out insurance.  If I am suing the State, I am aware that it is self-insured.  The figures that arise when someone trips on county council property or whatever do not enter into this equation.  If we allow for administration costs, that brings the total on one side to approximately &euro;400 million.  This means that insurance companies have income of &euro;1 billion net of claims that might be taken against them.  I think we have to begin there.  I know there has been some discussion in relation to the model.  This is gravely serious.  A small pub with a late licence is being absolutely crucified when it comes to public liability.  I know that lots of cases have been cited here.  Every good motorist is carrying a burden.  For restaurants and many other premises, it is more than 70% in the case of public liability on account of claims.</p></speech>

I made the same point at the first meeting of this committee last week.  At the moment, the joint committee is charged with dealing with motor insurance only.  Therefore, I ask the Senator to refrain from discussing other areas of insurance for now.</p></speech>

I will move on from that.  I recall that the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board in 2003 was highly controversial with lawyers.  It was heralded as a way to reduce insurance claims and costs in this country, but it has failed in that respect.  Aside from some benefits that have been shown over a period of time, it is clear that it is going to fail on the basis of the figures I have cited, which show that the claim amounts and levels of compensation paid are very small by comparison with the income levels of insurance companies.  I suppose the point I am making is that if, as it would seem, 60% of claims are settled through the Injuries Board when people accept the amount that is assessed, it could easily be argued on the basis of the involvement of lawyers and insurance companies that 60% of claims could be settled outside of court without requiring any litigation at all.  I understand the point that we should have a system that is a less adversarial and, as Mr. Priestly pointed out, more administrative in nature.  Is it really working?  Has the establishment of another Government body been justified?</p> <p>  It seems to me, based on my experience as someone who has practised as a solicitor in this area for some time, that in many instances this system encourages people with spurious claims.  It makes it a lot easier.  It is not as intimidating as having to pursue a claim in court.  It costs &euro;45 to lodge a claim.  It costs a certain amount for medical reports as well.  The person who is responding to the claim has to find &euro;600.  While there are legitimate claims and there are legitimate people involved, I wonder what function this structure is serving at the moment.</p><p>What it was being praised for, and what was meant to come about as a result, is not happening now.  I agree that compensation claims are just a component of the make-up of premiums and what is being charged.  I am at a loss about this.  In many ways this operates as a gateway; many of the cases being settled might have been settled anyway.  I will pose that question.</p><p> I have a question for the actuary, Mr. Dunne.  How many underwriters are based in or work in Ireland?  If there are not many, is it an issue?  It seems many underwriters are in the United Kingdom, so how does this affect our position?  I also note that the UK does not have an injuries board but we do.  That is not meant as a sign of disrespect to anybody working with the Injuries Board, but when one considers what it is supposed to do, one can see it is not working.  It may not be the fault of the witnesses, but is it now defunct?</p></speech>

Is it fair to say that of the number of motor insurance claims that arise on an annual basis, 70% or 71% are being settled, with 20% being settled by the Injuries Board, as opposed to being assessed?  The 70% figure includes the 14,000 cases involving non-liability and those that get lost on the system.  Approximately 10% end up in the courts.  Is it the case that 70% of settlements are before or after the involvement of the board or initial assessment?  We know 20% are dealt with and finalised by the board, with 10% going to the courts.  I presume the 70% figure relates to the &euro;1 billion referred to by Senator Mulherin as a kind of surplus.  Is that fair to say?</p></speech>

There are tips to bumpers.  We all know, anecdotally, that a bus could get a tip and all of a sudden there might have been 400 people on it.  We hear these stories.  I presume there are plenty of bumps and tips, with people reversing into pillars and other small stuff.  These people probably do not even go to an insurance company in some cases and when they do, the settlement is &euro;400 or &euro;500 in damage and no personal injury claim.  The cost of insurance claims is very much related to personal injury rather than material damage.</p></speech>

Our model facilitates early settlements by insurers and the problem is a lack of transparency in terms of what is going on in those early settlements and the contribution to costs and overall claims.  In an ideal world, there would not be any need for a process as they would all be settled early.</p></speech>

We are the gateway before a party goes to court.  I would not necessarily agree that we have failed.  One might look at the record over the past 12 years, the 100,000 awards we made and the &euro;2 billion in compensation.  These were for people who did not have to go to court.  These are also people who had their cases resolved in seven months, as opposed to having to spend three or three and a half years waiting to clear this issue from their lives and get on with it.  Some people have been incredibly badly affected by the accidents in which they were involved.  The board has a very important role and it has made a very significant contribution to lowering the cost of claims and bettering the outcomes for the claimants and people who use the process.</p></speech>

I do not know how many underwriters are in Ireland as there are no statistics on that.  We refer to the top eight having approximately 90% of the market share, with six of those companies having many people on the ground.  They are not branches, I suppose, but entities.  There are two that are branches of UK companies but there is a legal distinction in how the passporting works.  There are six based here with underwriters here, as far as I am aware.

Are there sufficient actuaries in the country?  One might say they should be everywhere, but we seem to have a shortage of nurses, doctors and consultants.

Certainly, the complexity of insurance is increasing rather than decreasing, so that lends itself towards actuarial analysis.  There is definitely a higher demand for actuaries at this point.</p></speech>

With the Central Bank there was a period after the financial crisis when there were issues at the bank relating to compensation, pension entitlements etc.  The bank lost some actuaries in that period.  It has recently staffed up again on the actuarial side and it has quite a healthy complement of actuaries working there now.</p><p>However, the Central Bank would be in a better position to state what it needs.</p></speech>

I am not sure the question is as relevant in this case, because both delegations have more or less stated they have relatively good relationships with or involvement with the insurance industry.  When dealing with groups such as the Irish Road Haulage Association, Age Action Ireland, young drivers and so on, they clearly have a lot of issues on behalf of their members.  Is it fair to state the witnesses have not experienced enormous difficulty in dealing with the insurance industry?  Obviously, a sharing of data as to the reasons regarding the 14,000 people and so on might be helpful to the Injuries Board.  I will ask the question.  Were Mr. O'Brien sitting as a member of this committee tomorrow, what questions would he put to Insurance Ireland?

This is important because they cause serious interference with the broadcasting and sound recording systems.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Michael Harty.</p> <p>  This meeting comprises two public sessions during which the committee will hear evidence on different aspects of the health reform agenda.  In the first session, we will hear evidence from Dr. Stephen Kinsella, an economist from the University of Limerick, on workforce planning models in the health service.  In the second session, we will hear evidence from Mr. Richard Corbridge, chief information officer with the Health Service Executive, on the role ICT can play in delivering an integrated health service.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I acknowledge the work of the wide range of stakeholders who contributed to the committee's public call for submissions, which process closed recently.  The response was very strong.  That is very welcome.</p><p>The committee received in the region of 140 responses, which were hugely informative and will assist us all in our ongoing work.<br/><br/>With that, I welcome Dr. Stephen Kinsella to the committee.  I draw the attention of the witness to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br/><br/>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/><br/>I invite Dr. Kinsella to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

It is a review of five different workforce planning models and consisted of an evidence-based review and a series of interviews with the people who make the models in these countries.  A workforce model is a series of forecasts based on a baseline data set of the number of doctors, nurses, physios, etc. in the system and what one thinks the demand for the services they provide will be over a given period.  It might be the number of doctors or physiotherapists in Limerick University Hospital in 2025, and it might cover the integrated care pathway patients can expect to go through to get the highest level of care and the requirements for same.</p> <p>  It is also about how these services change over time.  An example that kept coming up involved dialysis nurses across four of five countries.  When technological change takes place, certain service specialties tend to be used to a lesser extent.  Technology means there is less demand for nurses specialised in dialysis because people can dialyse themselves at home to an increasing extent.  How can the system know that it should reduce the number of training places for dialysis nurses?  How does one know whether one is producing enough or too many doctors?  It is about the connection between the demands of the system in five, ten or 15 years, the supply and also the mitigating factors.  For example, we know that migration is a major issue across all health professionals, including nurses and doctors.  Most of these models involve very simple modelling.  It is just forecasts being formed.  What is really difficult is getting the data on a fine-grain level and obtaining a very qualitative understanding of what is going on.</p> <p>  I will take the committee through what we found.  I ask members go to the results section of the paper.  We found that the onset of health workforce planning emerged independently in each country we studied.  We studied Australia, New Zealand, Scotland, Wales and the Netherlands.  Each time it happened, it was in response to some pressure.  Either it was demographic pressure, financial constraints or issues surrounding future supply.  In several countries, for example, it was the lack of available nurses that caused people to ask how many nurses were being trained and how many were being bought in from abroad.  There are very few integrated national care models.  Many take modules and only look at doctors, nurses or allied health care professionals, respectively.  Very often, they start with doctors, for various reasons.  It is very interesting that once one has moved beyond doctors and their sub-specialties, one sees that there are is a great deal of thinking and planning to be done.  Data are always the first problem.  Typically, we do not know what the data are on a given day.  If one stopped the health system today and asked the chief information officer of the HSE how many people were working that day in the health system, it is most likely he or she would not know the answer.  If one asked him or her how many doctors or phlebotomists the service would require in Temple Street in 2020, he or she would not be able to provide an answer.  That gives a sense that the planning system is short-term in nature.  While there is a workforce planning model in place right now, everybody agrees that it could change.</p> <p>  Each workforce planning model that we studied was country specific.  That is to say it was generated with respect to the institutional structures that underlay each individual country's needs.  Australia is completely different from New Zealand institutionally and similarly Wales and Scotland, notwithstanding similarities in terms of the National Health Service, NHS, have quite different financial and legal structures.  However, they all begin in the same way.  One creates a baseline analysis of how many doctors, nurses, etc., one has in a particular year and then forecasts based on demographic supply.  We know our population is ageing and that we have both a very young and a very old population and that will increase over time.  We are aware that demands on the service will change.  We are also aware that there are regional differences in the numbers that are accessible.  Once there is sight of the regional data and the patient flow data, it is possible to analyse the evolution of our system, which is very important.</p> <p>  When I started lecturing years ago, people said, "Get the summary in first, in case people are not sufficiently caffeinated."  Here is the conclusion.  This is not just a quantitative process.  That is, it is not just the case that some nerd in a room comes up with a forecast, a line goes up and that is fine.  This is a qualitative process, which is to say that it is a way for the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive to initiate a dialogue across all the sub-specialties.  As an aside, I note that I will be setting out some thoughts on governance structures in a while.  This qualitative process starts with saying, "Here is our forecast.  Is it right?"  It is about asking the individual services and specialties whether it is correct.  Every time, of course, they will come back and say it is not and that more of specialty X is required or less of specialty Y.  However, what is really valuable is being able to have that dialogue.  This was a real surprise to me as a technocratic, quantitative person.  In all of the expert interviews we did, this qualitative process and the idea of generating fora surfaced.  It means one could get the deans of medicine of all the major colleges and universities, a representative of the Department of Justice and Equality, who will talk about migration issues, and representatives of the Department of Health and the HSE around a table with the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.  If the medium-term forecast to 2021 is that health spending will increase by 7%, we can drill down and ask the different specialties how much of each resource they need and where, if we had the money, resources should go.  We can then ask the colleges if they are training the necessary personnel.  Before the Fottrell report and the massive increase in the number of doctors we produced, we were not producing enough doctors.  Now, it seems like we are producing too many.  The system needs a check and a balance.  There needs to be feedback into the system to slow things down.</p> <p>  In many of the cases we studied, clear and legislated connections to policy levers were very important.</p><p>For example, if an individual service did not do its forecasting plan, it does not get funded.  It is legislated in Wales that the medium-term strategy for workforce planning is allied with the financial plan, so if one does not do these forecasts one does not have one's service level agreement signed off.  If one does not have the forecast carried out, that is it.  Similar actions are being taken in New Zealand.  In Australia, where it is most developed, people can tell one down to the hour what each pharmacist, doctor, nurse and every other sub-specialty is doing.  They have activity data by the hour so they are able to compute productivity levels not just by hospital, but also by individual service.  I am not suggesting that we go that route just yet.  Perhaps we could find out where all the doctors were, although I am being slightly facetious because we have quite good data on that.</p><p> However, if we had a robust data gathering exercise, the modelling is not very difficult.  What is difficult is getting these fora established and having them repeat.  In Scotland, for example, when it was rolled out there were 150 individual contact sessions between the workforce planning unit and the relevant sections.  We are not just talking about the workforce planning unit talking to the HR manager of a hospital but to all of the people who run the services, who might say they need three administrative personnel rather than seven, that they do not need ten nurses but two nurses and six more doctors and so forth.  One might think that system could be gamed.  I am a university lecturer and if somebody asked me how many more university lecturers are required in economics, my answer would be "all of them".  One would imagine that people who hold budgets would say that.  In fact, it is not true.  Most of the time if one is asked for a fairly credible forecast, typically one gives it.  People are not that incredible, especially if they are held to it - "Last year you said your expectation was that you would need eight physiotherapists, but you did not need eight because you have coped perfectly well with four.  I know this because I have latent demand data and I know that there was not much of a waiting list and it was cleared quite quickly."  On the other hand, the service might not be sufficiently resourced with support staff.  This is a pretty big issue in certain areas.  The support staff is not there, so one has highly qualified medics, nurses and other allied health care professionals running around finding labels.  Much of this is about balancing and understanding the team composition.</p><p> This qualitative aspect is really important.  One of the matters I wish to impress upon the committee today is the need to think about what the structure of those engagements would be.  What would that structure be like if one had to have the deans of all the colleges of medicine, all of the various representative bodies in the Higher Education Authority, HEA, justice and so forth there, as well as a sense that the funding will follow whatever strategic priority is set?  The strategic priority is typically on a five to seven year basis, not one to two years, which means the funding must be set roughly in those parameters.  As I will outline later, the Irish context does not put the lie to that medium-term planning approach, but historically it has been quite difficult to do it.</p><p> We found that the engagement with the whole workforce planning process across all the countries we studied, and particularly a discourse around the modelling itself, is really influential.  It changes the wider health workforce policy, because it simply promotes a conversation.  This allows stakeholders concerned with health workforces to become actively involved, even me.  I am talking about doctors and nurses.  Very few people ask how many phlebotomists we need.  It turns out that this type of work gives what one might call the medical scientists a voice at the table, that they did not previously have because everybody is concerned that the public discourse is around doctors and nurses.  In fact, one needs a large number of allied health care professionals to make the system run and creating these engagements gives them a large voice at the table which they would not have had previously.  They get input into policies which they previously did not have and that is very good.  These types of conversations give one a sense of being able to sense and identify trends in a system, and these trends in a system turn out to be very important.  One will not get this data sitting in a room with a spreadsheet.  One only gets the data by talking to the people who run the service; that is the only place to get this data.</p><p> That is the reason the governance structure I recommend is so important.  If one locates a workforce planning unit completely within the Department of Health, the links it has with service users may be limited.  If one locates it entirely within the HSE, it will not have the strategic element which the Department of Health provides.  My recommendation is to have the workforce planning unit, division or department span both and have links into other areas, simply because the health system is so big.</p><p> As part of the context for our review, we looked at the evolution of the Irish health system to date.  I have a panel of figures for the members of the committee which is included in the series of graphs I have provided.  I am delighted it is done in colour because mine printed out in black and white and is completely illegible, so I was a little worried we would be looking at the wrong things.  These figures are indexed figures from the Department of Health, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and from the HSE's annual reports.  I am seeking to give the committee a sense of what has happened to the evolution of the Irish health system since the mid-1990s.  The members are looking at these numbers indexed; that is, one can imagine them as a type of horse race.  We are not looking at the nominal numbers.  We are only looking at them relative to a given index year, and for all but one 2008 is the index year.  Everything is relative to the height of the crisis, which I believe is a valid way of seeing it.</p><p> If one looks at the first figure, it shows all the Vote if one adds in the voted expenditure for health and the HSE.  That includes capital, non-pay, pay and pensions.  If we look at the rest of the public sector, we can compare the evolution of both directly.  One can see that from the early 1990s up to 2008 for much of the time health grew at a lower rate than the rest of the system.  It caught up around 2003 and 2004 in terms of its funding levels, which it then matched exactly until the crisis hit in 2008.  The emergency budget in 2009 pulled the wheels off the bus somewhat.  One can see the jagged drop in health and HSE funding, which then jumped up again.  One can see that the evolution of the health system relative to the rest of the public sector has been quite different.  The spending on health, despite all of the negative press it has received, has been relatively high if one compares it with, for example, education which is rather different as a subject.  Over the time there are two contrasting stories.  One is of relative underfunding followed by a levelling out of funding, especially relative to the rest of the public service.</p><p> Look at health worker numbers in the second panel.  Of course, they both fall relative to 2008 but health recovers faster but later.  The rest of the public service begins recruiting.  The public sector moratorium is removed in 2013 but it does not actually begin until 2014 for the health sector.  In terms of the deficit of people, there is an approximate 10% deficit of people by the end of the crisis in the rest of the public service and it is a 12% or 13% deficit in the health service.  If one looks at voted expenditure on pensions, we spent approximately &euro;2 billion in 2016 on pensions.</p><p>An interesting point is that the health service accounts for approximately one third of all public sector staff - approximately 103,000 people are employed in the health service - but just a quarter of all public sector pension expenditure.  It is clear from these statistics that health was relatively insulated from the decrease in capital expenditure over the period of the crisis.  Again, that is to be expected.  The next statistic to which I would like to refer explains the large increase.  The voted expenditure on non-pay items is 25% higher in 2016 than it was in 2008.  Non-pay expenditure in the health service is higher today than it was at the height of the crisis.  We can get into the various reasons for that in response to members' questions.  The level of voted expenditure on pay is relatively similar, as one might expect given that they are all public sector workers.</p><p> When we break down the staff levels, based on the HSE's annual report, we can see that 25% of those who work in the health service work in management, in administration or as support staff; 14% of health service staff work in health and social care; 34% of staff work in nursing; 9% of staff work in medical and dental roles and 18% of staff work in patient support.  I would not attach massive amounts of explanatory power to these numbers, for several reasons.  Support staff in this sense can be categorised in various ways.  ICT personnel and pharmacists could be classified as support staff.  It is not the case that all support staff are people who write letters.  If one looks at what many of those who are counted as nursing staff do on a day-to-day basis, one will find that they are managing the system.  There are other aspects of this in the patient support and medical and dental categories.  This is a very imperfect measure, in terms of the breakdown of the levels, but it gives a sense of how the HSE sees itself and perhaps of how it has evolved.</p><p> We know for a fact that we will need to spend more on health in the coming years.  Demographic pressures alone mean that current expenditure in the health service will have to be increased.  This will have to happen independent of policy change or anything else.  We know that demographic pressures will push this up.  I would like to refer to an estimate of the dependency ratio that assumes there will be middling amounts of migration and fertility.  It uses a pretty standard migration and fertility measure known as the M2-F2 assumption.  It is estimated that the dependency ratio will increase by between 12% and 15%, which means that more older people will have to be cared for through their taxes by fewer younger people.</p><p> We have studied five different national models in the system.  We have spoken to experts on these systems in several countries.  I will break down the main findings from these models.  There is no one single model that I would recommend for the Irish system, simply because we are so institutionally different from some of the other models.  The simplest thing to do would be to take the Scottish model, find a logo and slap it onto the Irish system.  I think that would be a mistake.  The NHS system is very different from the Irish system, especially at the service delivery level.  It is far less diffuse than our system, which has a very different public-private mix.  While I would be reticent to recommend an individual model, I will go through the strengths and limitations of the various models.</p><p> The authorities in Scotland have spent a substantial amount of time engaging with the people they are going to be working with.  They have been doing this for approximately ten years.  One of the limitations of this approach is that Scotland organises its medical and other nursing training differently, relative to other areas.  The Scottish authorities feel there is an over-reliance on quantitative data.  I was completely shocked when this came to the surface in the expert interviews.  I had a notion that this was a very technocratic exercise.  Those who went out to talk to everybody said it was actually a matter of structured engagement where they got to look people in the eye and ask whether everything was going okay.  As part of this engagement, the interviewees are asked whether they have enough people and whether they need more.  This helps trust to build up over time.  I think there is great value in thinking about that and about what kind of structure enables that.</p><p> As I said earlier, Wales has a legislative foundation for workforce planning.  It is based around five-year planning cycles.  There have been some strong quantitative studies in Australia.  They are less focused on the qualitative elements.  A far more collaborative approach is taken in New Zealand, where data quality is a huge challenge.  A great deal of the data in New Zealand comes from surveys.  Anyone who has ever decided not to fill out a survey on one's phone will appreciate that a representative sample is lost when surveys are used.  This turns out to be a big issue.</p><p> The medical manpower model used in the Netherlands is objectively the simplest one.  It is based on GP planning.  If we want to adopt the simplest possible system, we should choose the Dutch system.  The authorities in that country are able to pursue such an approach because they use the universal health insurance model.  That may be a bad phrase to use around here - I am not sure.  While this is very useful, it is important to note that an important aspect was lacking in the Netherlands model because there was no way to mix the different teams.  It produced a headline number of doctors, nurses, phlebotomists and so forth.  Under that model, one could not tell whether two doctors were needed for every three nurses and so forth.  There was no skill mix.</p><p> Three things are needed if workforce planning is to be done properly.  First, a well-resourced unit dedicated to information collection and analysis needs to be established.  Second, this unit needs to be split between the Department of Health and the HSE - the strategic and operational sides of the health service - and needs to have links to the Departments of Justice and Equality, Education and Skills, Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance.  Obviously, much of this is about financial control as much as anything else.  Third, there needs to be a commitment to the generation of a minimum data set, rather than a maximum data set, to make this thing work.  There is an international standard for what that is.  There are data quality indicators that enable us to say that our estimates of nursing provision in Tipperary are as good as our estimates of nursing provision in Dublin, for example.</p><p> The qualitative side of this workforce planning process cannot be neglected.  The establishment of forums and the dissemination of information about workforce planning should be a crucial task for the workforce planning unit that is set up.  This should be done before any formal model is put in place.  I will set out a rough governance structure to give the committee a sense of what this would look like.  Of course we have a large private sector in our system.  This includes GPs.  Tusla, the voluntary bodies, the various section 30 groups and the various hospital groups are also involved.  It is quite a diffuse system.  It is quite difficult to get one's head around just how complex the Irish health system is.  The workforce planning unit will take data from all the various bodies, work between the Department of Health and the HSE and contact external stakeholders like the ESRI and the OECD.  I think something like this can deliver a workforce planning model in two to three years, which would be a pretty good return on the taxpayers' investment.  I suggest we would get a significant level of engagement from the various health care professionals along the way.  They would start telling us in a structured way what it is like to run these services and what they think needs to change.  I do not think we would end up merely with people asking for more and more.  I think most of the people who work in the health service are committed to making it better.  Obviously, they are personally incentivised to make it better.  I think we should create a system like this, to the extent that we can do so, in order to help our growing and ageing population.</p></speech>

I would like to ask a couple of questions before I invite members to do likewise.  I would be interested to know how Dr. Kinsella deals with the various variables within the health workforce.  I refer to things like the model of care.  I presume all of this depends on where the services are delivered and the extent to which there is a primary and community-based focus within the health service.</p> <p>  Do decisions need to be taken with regard to skill mix, which has been mentioned by Dr. Kinsella, prior to the construction of a model to ensure that model is effective?  A similar question could be asked about work practices.  The issues of skill mix and work practices are inter-related.  For example, will chronic care programmes be predominantly delivered through nurses?  How many nurses does one GP equal?  What is the equivalent number?  Do such decisions need to be made beforehand?</p><p>How does one deal with variables in work practices, in terms of whether people are working seven over seven or nine to five or whatever, or the question of the mix between nurses and nurses' aides?  Do they need to be decided before one builds an effective model?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-14a.355" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Stephen Kinsella" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016091400002#E00200"><p>All these questions came up time and again.  This is called strategic health workforce planning.  The strategic element is based on the notion that the policy-makers set a direction for the health system, that it moves to a primary care-based model with large hospitals and subsidiary hospitals.  This has been the model we have been saying for many years that we are moving to.  If that is the case, then hiring more people into hospitals is not in accordance with that strategy.  The model of care is determined in an interplay between what the clinicians say they need and what the policy-makers know from their constituents and from what the experts are telling them is best placed.  That is very important as well.  The model of care comes from a dialogue between here and the people who run the service on the ground.</p> <p>  Where services are delivered is crucial.  For example, if there is an area of the country that is poorly served by an individual service, workforce planning can spot that quickly.  It is an efficient way of doing that, because there is a forum for saying, for example, that patients may have to drive for two and a half hours to get treatment.  We can then ask whether there is a way to put a system in a satellite spot to help these patients.  This is why I was talking about patient flow data, which is vital.  One has to know, for example, what proportion of the people of Sligo are visiting Dublin on a weekly basis, and so forth.  There is some data on that but it is quite old.  I think it was done mostly for cancer care services.</p> <p>  The question of where services are delivered goes back to the primary care model versus the tertiary care model.  This model is set at the strategic level and is then backfilled by the quantitative model.  To take into account the skill-mix requires a very large amount of data.  One has to have each individual service tell one what it needs.  Running a cardiac care unit is very different to running an opthalmic surgery.  What the service-provider needs is different and they need to surface this, somehow, to the service-provider.  That is quite difficult unless we have these data-gathering fora.  In Scotland, for example, we found there were very good templates.  They were very simple, one-page templates, asking service-providers where they are located, where they think they will be in two years, what they need to run their service at maximum efficiency, how many people they saw last year, and how many people they think they will see this year.  In Scotland, they map these simple team composition structures onto the map of clinical care they know they need.</p> <p>  We all have a clinical care pathway we think is the best, but if we did a workforce plan for each clinical care pathway and each one took three years, it would take 90 years to do the whole thing.  My suggestion would be to start in a simpler way, then work up to a skill mix.  Even in Australia, where they have the most advanced methods, where they know what people are doing by the hour, they find it difficult to do this.  My suggestion would be to start with a service delivery model and then maybe incorporate skill mix later on.</p></speech>

He made us aware of the paper at a very opportune time for this committee, given what we are studying.  I have a few questions and observations.  It is a great study and the timing is very important for us.  We have a defined period to do this work, but as regards governance structure, Dr. Kinsella has a great deal of analysis of what is going on across different jurisdictions.  I agree there is no one model that can fit - there never is - but as regards planting a model here, what would the structure be?  Can we define it?  Could Dr. Kinsella come back to us at a later date with something that we will not stick him with but that, from his analysis, will work best?  There is a requirement for far more continuous input and analysis into it than just sticking it between the Department of Health and the HSE.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform would have to play a significant role, from my knowledge.</p> <p>  In respect of Dr. Kinsella's analysis and correlating it to Ireland, my background is IT, where there is a saying, "dumb data in, dumb data out".  How good is the raw data here in Ireland?  Are there sectoral differences?  Are there differences across different areas?  That would be an issue.  I am very much taken by Dr. Kinsella's story in respect of technology change and how it is not prepared for.  The story in regard to dialysis is a very good example.  Is that something that is present across the board in respect of other countries and how does it relate to Ireland?  Technology in health care is changing dramatically all the time.  Are we prepared for it?</p> <p>  On forecasting in Wales, Dr. Kinsella said they were held to account.  How were they held to account?  In a situation where that happened in Ireland, where someone did not do their work, there would be a political outcry, saying that people are not getting services, and then everyone would buckle.  How is the Welsh approach different to than here?</p> <p>  In respect of the qualitative-quantitative issue, there is a huge volume of quantitative data out there that needs analysis.  I presume the qualitative analysis is necessary on top of it to execute continuous workforce planning.  What are the best examples across those Dr. Kinsella has studied for getting that information?  This is a continuous process.  It is an iterative process.  Workforce planning never stops; it is continuous.  Could Dr. Kinsella discuss the provision of that qualitative data and the engagement process, with models of engagement that worked across jurisdictions?  I am not sure the information will get out there.</p> <p>  Dr. Kinsella spoke earlier about how he believes that the majority of people do forecast and if they are held to account they are very honest about it.  In one of our submissions, which I was reading last week, the CEO of one of the hospital groups proposed, as one of her main solutions, to take a great deal of money off the group and put it into community care.  That would solve most of her issues.  I found that to be incredibly honest.</p> <p>  Could Dr. Kinsella speak about gathering that information and the models that worked?  I thank Dr. Kinsella.  It is a very good study.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-14a.358" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016091400002#E00500"><p>I, too, thank Dr. Kinsella.  I echo what Deputy Kelly said about the study - it is very interesting and very timely.  Dr. Kinsella referred to planning cycles.  Clearly we have been locked into something of an election cycle with regard to our health planning for a very long time.  Would he have a suggestion as to what the ideal cycle is in terms of workforce planning?  Clearly 50 years is too much and one year is too little.</p> <p>  I would be interested to know whether any of the 25% increase in non-pay expenditure from 2008 that Dr. Kinsella referred to was spent on purchasing man hours or whether it is all capital expenditure.  My sense is that some of that is agency staff and some of that actually refers to what I would call privatisation by stealth, although I am sure other people have different terms for it.</p> <p>  With regard to the IT systems we have at the moment, I am aware that the nursing and midwifery planning and development units, NMPDUs, were disbanded because the people working in them were needed back on the front lines - they were put back on their tools.  We have a great deal of workforce planning that we need to make up and in this regard we have a huge deficit.</p><p>In terms of the number of qualified people, if we were to snap our fingers in the morning and say that we will put in place a workforce planning team to do this, how close would we be to being able to get that personnel together?  What would be required in terms of IT?  As was said earlier, one only gets out what one puts in when it comes to data.  I would not be convinced that we have the IT infrastructure that would be able to support it but I would be interested to hear whether Dr. Kinsella has any views on what it would take for us to be able to do that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-14a.360" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1229" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016091400002#F00200"><p>I will revisit a few points that have already been made.  First and foremost, policy must set the template for the direction the health services will take.  In that context, I assume that if we are to produce a workforce planning model in the years ahead, we need a definitive view as to where we are going with our health services.  That would mean that we would have to assess whether primary care would become the bulwark of the delivery of health care in our communities.  On top of that, we also have an issue that is not compatible with other countries that we looked at, such as Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Scotland and Wales.  This issue is a national health system.  We have a national health system but half our population has private health insurance.  How can we assess the delivery of health care in the private sector <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>efficiencies there versus the public sector because if we are to amalgamate or move to a stage where it should all be done through public health, clearly, we must assess it very stringently to see whether different efficiency levels, etc., exist?  Did Dr. Kinsella look at that part of health care delivery in this country in terms of his views on assessing performance, etc.?</p><p>This leads to how one assesses efficiencies in a workforce planning model and how one extrapolates from quantitative and quantitative data in terms of efficiencies for future workforce planning.  It goes back to Dr. Kinsella's original point about dialysis nurses not only in that context, which is just changing technologies, but in terms of assessing efficiencies such as how many people are required to carry out a certain task and whether there can be changes because of technological advances, IT, changing work practices and inherent ability to get more efficiencies out of individuals and the system.  </p><p>When we speak about skill sets, I have always noticed that when one meets groups of people to address the problems in our health service, while they come with the best of intentions, they also come as captives of their own profession.  Dr. Kinsella said earlier that management, the Department of Health, the HSE and others, by and large, forecast honestly.  I suppose they do forecast honestly but not all forecasts are correct so it is very hard to assess whether it was a forecast with the best of intentions or whether it was just a forecast with other intentions.  How does one assess where health policy analysts <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>those who deliver health policy such as the Government, the Department of Health and possibly even the HSE may be steered because of political considerations?  In respect of laying off staff and cuts in numbers, we were always told that it was able to deliver but it was quite evident that when one drilled down through it, it was not able to do that.  Where can we independently ensure that workforce planning models are independent of the decision making of policy makers even though the model on the policy is being assessed?  This is critically important.  Could Dr. Kinsella address how we assess private health insurance <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i><b></b>rolling it into a public health model?  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-14a.362" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Stephen Kinsella" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016091400002#F00400"><p>I will do my best.  Defining the structure in governance terms is very important.  The correct structure evolves.  These things must evolve.  Data quality is variable everywhere.  One of the ways one assesses data quality is by using this minimum data set requirement.  There is an international standard.  If only 9% of the nurses fill out a survey about what they do on a daily basis, perhaps the information in the survey is not that great.  It is that kind of idea.  There is a minimum data standard that is pretty good.</p> <p>  Sectoral issues abound.  It turns out that we have pretty good data about the medical sub-specialities that are working.  Examples would be cardio-thoracic surgeons.  We know exactly how many of those we have in the system because one could probably count them on two hands.  There is capacity in the system to do that.  </p> <p>  Are we prepared for technical change?  I would say that the answer is "No" right now.  Quite simply, we only perceive technological change as an increase in the cost of delivering medicine.  There is a lot of data on health inflation, which runs far in advance of the inflation rates for other goods.  Some of that is as a result of drug pricing, etc., but some of it is simply as a result of the newest technical "whizz bang" thing that will deliver better care but cost a lot more.  </p> <p>  How do we hold the forecasters to account?  The answer is that it is legislatively backed so nobody can back out of it because it is enshrined in law that this is something that needs to be done as part of the budgeting cycle.  If one does not do this, the political system is, for want of a better word, insulated from this.  One can simply point to the legislation and say, "look, it is not us, it's those bad people who legislated for this in the past", who may also be us.  The hue and cry about this may be less than one might think because there is a fair amount of data to back it up.  When one has external experts saying that this is the best standard of care given in light of where one is - I am sounding awfully political because I know that another debate about this is taking place - and this is what it should be, people tend to go with that, generally speaking.  </p> <p>  What is the best example of engagement?  The regional fora in the Scottish example were really excellent.  They had two people whose only job was to go around gathering this data.  They were two principal officer-level people driving Scotland just hearing what people had to say so these two people amassed an enormous amount of soft knowledge and had amazing emotional intelligence.  When I spoke to them, they really knew when somebody was on the level and when they were not so there was credibility there.  </p> <p>  The ideal planning length is somewhere between three and five years.  Seven years is too long.  One forgets what it was.  I would imagine that, for us, three years is probably where we want to be because we still have a single-year budgeting cycle.  However, we have a system with over 100,000 people working in it and it is very difficult to turn that in under five years.  </p> <p>  In respect of the 25% increase in terms of support staff management and administration, there could well be agency people in there.  I do not know.  They do not drill down into the data.  I can check with the HSE and come back to Deputy O'Reilly.</p></speech>

It related to whether agency staff were included.  I suspect they were.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-14a.364" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Stephen Kinsella" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016091400002#F00600"><p>I do not know but I can check and get back to the Deputy.</p> <p>  There is an IT workforce deficit but there is a very large spend in the Department of Health on IT.  In respect of the eHealth strategy and data analytics, there is a deputy secretary just for data analytics and research who is a very good and competent person.  My hope is that one can ally this with those data gathering initiatives.  What is the capacity if we turned it on?  There are people who have produced workforce planning models in SOLAS.</p><p>Professor Eilis McGovern and her team in the HSE have done considerable work as well.  A group in the Department of Health has done this work to a high standard for midwives and nurses.  In terms of boots on the ground, the capacity to deliver the service exists, at least in skeleton form.  We would need to buttress it by adding in more people.  Another group that would be very useful is the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES.  Some of our best University of Limerick graduates are with that group now.  These are really smart people and very numerate but, most important, they give us a direct connection back to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform because that is where they were originally located.</p><p> Deputy Kelleher asked several questions, including one on the private versus public health system.  This is the main reason I do not recommend either the Scottish or Welsh models.  It is also why the governance structure should be managed between the Department of Health and the HSE.  The Department can compel access to some of the data from the private systems whereas the HSE cannot.</p><p> Data issues abound.  Assessing performance has to be done on qualitative and quantitative basis.  If we set a target, then people will move to fulfil the target.  If we do not have the qualitative elements along with other data, then all we get is people trying to hit targets.  Some of the best performance models set the targets but do not tell anyone what they are.  It is really interesting.  They set they target and then tell those involved simply to try to do the best they can.  They found that everyone exceeded the target.  Behavioural economics suggests that if we give people a target, they work to it.  There is a great example involving Boston firefighters.  They brought in a rule to the effect that no one could be absent for more than 15 days per year.  Then, the absenteeism rate exploded because people realised they could take 15 extra days.  Staff who had not taken a day off in 20 years then took 15 sick days.  Then, when they removed the cap the figure stayed at 15 days.  We should be careful of the targets we set.</p><p> Can we assess efficiencies in workforce planning?  We can, but it is typically done through the price system.  People try to figure out how expensive it is to recruit 100 new consultants or 25 new phlebotomists and so forth.  Typically, it is done through the price system.  The Australians have a very good system but I would caution against introducing a similar system immediately.  It comes back to work practices.  If we were to ask every consultant and nurse what they do on an hourly basis, I do not think they would be able to give an answer.  Producing the system to give us that answer would be enormously destructive in terms of the trust we want to build up with everyone.  I would do that only as a last step, if at all.</p><p> Forecasting quality is absolutely vital.  It turns out that we can figure out whether forecasts were of high quality.  We relate the forecasted levels to the levels that actually materialised.  Let us suppose we have six different anaesthetist groups and we are forecasting their levels.  Then let us suppose three are bang on.  We can measure that by the amount of latent demand.  If we have three people with a fairly average waiting list and then two others over-claim and have no waiting list while three other people are waiting around not doing much or doing mostly private work instead, then we may have overshot here and undershot there.  It is a rough balancing act over time and we can see that, especially with the qualitative element.</p><p> Is there a tension between these developments?  There is, absolutely.  There is a question of leaving it with the Department of Health and the HSE and then perhaps putting it with a body like the ESRI.  There is a tension.  In Australia they created an entirely new institute of workforce planning and had what was almost an ESRI body for workforce planning.  Then after some years they ended up nationalising the organisation and bringing it in to the health service again.  There are many different models to make it work.  I am uncertain whether such a body should be independent of policy.  I think we would want it to be fairly connected to the policy-making system.  Otherwise, it ends up evolving into a fairly technocratic dry exercise where someone produces numerous charts and people say it is grand but there is no action.  It needs to be close to the systems of power, including the committee.</p></speech>

I have some brief questions.  Where are we in Ireland with regard to the data-gathering process?  Are we at zero or are we somewhere along the line?  Is the information Dr. Kinsella has presented to us part of his role?  Has he been seconded from the University of Limerick to gather this information?</p> <p>  Have we any information regarding the relationship between the timescale of someone coming into an accident and emergency department and getting blood checked, X rays, ECGs, MRIs or whatever might be needed and effective treatment of that person?  It seems to me that the gathering of data on that level is critical, and if we have a quick turnaround in getting what we need to diagnose a patient, then we will have a quick diagnosis and everyone benefits.  Are there data on that?</p></speech>

I have three questions.  They relate to the issues of demographics, the question of current staffing levels and the increasing use of agency staff within the health service and hospitals in particular.</p> <p>  It would seem to me that one of the tasks posed here is to look at the big picture and the broad brush stroke before getting down to the detail.  I am calling on Dr. Kinsella to comment.  It would also seem to me - again, I am inviting comment on this - that there are two issues which point in the direction of significantly increased staffing levels in the context of putting forward a plan.  The first is the issue of demographics.  The map on the dependency ratio with the M2 F2 graph is quite dramatic.  Dr. Kinsella referred to an increase of 12% to 15% over a period of ten years or so.  One statistic relates to the numbers of our population over the age of 65 years.  Currently, the figure is below 600,000 and about 585,000.  That is set to rise within ten years to 850,000 or perhaps beyond to 860,000 or 870,000.  There will likely be an increase of approximately 50% in that one group within society.  There is another statistic on the prevalence of chronic disease.  It is not entirely linked to the demographics, but it is not unrelated either.  The figure is expected to rise by 4% or 5% per annum.  That figure was produced by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation.  It strikes me as a very strong statistic.</p> <p>  I am also wondering how we factor in other things.  For example, there are things that people may not be presenting for now but for which they will be presenting in five or ten years' time.  Let us consider mental health and the question of depression.  The culture is changing and it is becoming less of a stigma for a person to say that he is feeling bad and needs help, but there remain many people in society who would not present with depression or anxiety.  They would rather try to power through and batter on.  There is a better and more open attitude among the younger generation.  I imagine that as the demographics shift, there may be an increase in mental health issues.  I suspect there will be, but there may also be an increase in the number of people willing to present and say as much.</p><p>Considering those factors together, it strikes me, particularly on the issue of demographics, that it points to an increased need for health services and recruitment of professionals within the service.</p><p> The second issue is current staffing levels.  The graph is interesting.  It shows worker numbers in the health service to be down perhaps by about 7% on where they were in 2008.  The graph is a somewhat optimistic one because it points upwards.  However, I think it would show a plateau if it included the numbers for 2016, because there is this X and Y policy now, as enunciated by Tony O'Brien of the HSE, that one can only hire Y if X leaves.  Therefore, while there was an increase in staffing numbers of more than 4,500 the year before last, I think last year there was a plateauing of the situation.  For example, we are down more than 3,000 nurses on the 2009 figures, and there are quality of care issues such as the linking of bed closures to staff shortages and so on.  Again, I am inviting comment, but to me these issues point also to the need for significant recruitment.</p><p> My final question concerns the issue of agency staff.  Anecdotally, I am getting back from health service workers reports of a very significant increase in the number of staff being brought in from agencies.  This applies perhaps particularly to nursing.  I saw one figure which indicated that there is a budget this year of &euro;226 million for agency staff and that half of the budget had been exhausted by the end of April.  In other words, a third of the way into the year, half of the budget had been used.  It also strikes me that if one is planning in a sound way, surely there is a very strong argument to base staffing fundamentally on the recruitment of full-time permanent posts rather than using agency staff, which seems to me the epitome of short-termism.  One is considering not just quantity, but quality as well.  Obviously, if someone is employed in a hospital, he or she works there and it is good for morale - there is an issue with demoralisation in the health service - and it will improve the quality of the work.  Would Dr. Kinsella therefore agree that an over-reliance on agency staff is an indication of short-termism and that a more planned approach would base itself far more on the recruitment of permanent staff?</p></speech>

My first question concerns the way our system is structured in Ireland.  We have the regional health organisations and, on a separate wing, mental health and social care.  Is that kind of division between acute care and social and metal care reflected in any of the other models Dr. Kinsella considered?  It seems to me, from my position on this committee, that if mental health has its own wing, that immediately stigmatises it.  Is that division present in any other country?</p> <p>  Dr. Kinsella mentioned something about pensions in the health service accounting for 25%, I think, of overall pensions.  Maybe we do not know the reason for this, but is it to do with salary levels or the fact that nurses within the HSE are forced to retire at 65 even if they do not want to?  Is it because we force people into retirement early?</p> <p>  To follow on from Deputy Brassil's point about where we are now and whether we have done anything yet to fix things, does the same go for IT?  Are we 50% of the way through the IT developments or are we just starting off?</p> <p>  We talk about workforce planning over a two-to-three-year period.  That is great and must be done, and there is obviously time that one needs to spend planning things, but while that is being done, could a section of the health service be taken and sorted out in tandem with that so that we are not just coming up with another plan or report - so that we could actually achieve something?  For example, everyone seems to agree that the national cancer strategy was a major achievement and everyone says it seems to work very well.  My experience of it has been very positive.  The national maternity strategy is ready to go.  Maternity hospitals are separate from general medical hospitals.  Could one theoretically carry out that strategy in tandem with a kind of overlook of the whole health service?  Instead of this "Let's fix the health service" approach, could we set about planning for it over a number of years while fixing little sections of it as we go along?</p> <p>  Finally, doctors, pharmacists, physiotherapists and occupational therapists from Ireland have moved to other countries and there is a fair amount of skills transfer.  As a nurse, one can go to Australia or whatever.  Do we have any data on, or are there any optimum ratios of staff that we could take from other countries?  Would it be possible to say that on average, internationally, for every ten consultants one needs 30 nurses, three pharmacists, two phlebotomists and five care assistants, or whatever?  Is there some point at which we could start that we could use as a standard for what we might work towards?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-14a.370" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Stephen Kinsella" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016091400002#H00300"><p>To answer Deputy Brassil's point about where we are in Ireland, in our readiness for workforce planning, my understanding is that the HSE has devised a scoring system on its readiness to produce these data.  I myself have not seen the scores.  I imagine that, on a score of one to ten, we are somewhere around five, in that we know how many doctors we have.  We know because we have a payroll and we know how much we pay them.  One can use such a system, but I sense that once one moves away from the two or three main categories, the quality of the data degrades pretty quickly.  Deputy Brassil asked if I had been seconded to gather the data.  No, I have not; I was asked to write this report for the Health Research Board.  I am still teaching classes in UL.  I am teaching one at three o'clock.  I am tipping along and very happy there.  I am very interested in this stuff.  It is great.</p> <p>  Regarding timescale and treatment, patient flow data are absolutely vital.  They come from a unique identifier system.  One needs to have such a system and get over the data protection and privacy issues that surround it in order to gather that kind of patient data.  If I bring my ten-year-old son into Nenagh Hospital tomorrow for a broken arm - touch wood - he will be seen and treated, but if I bring him in the next day to University Hospital Limerick, they will not know he has been in Nenagh Hospital unless I tell them.  It is therefore a database issue, a big data issue and a very important issue in terms of quality and reliability of care.  It is related to some of the efficiency issues about which Deputy Kelleher spoke.  I gave a talk at University Hospital Limerick, the grand rounds lecture, at which I asked the doctors present, if I gave them the money to hire the people lost between 2008 and today, what they would do with it.  I asked whether they would hire more nurses or more people like them.  They said they would put all of the money, every single penny, into ICT systems.  These are young doctors who are all vying for registrar positions and so on.  To me, that was a really important issue.  Deputy Brassil asked whether there are any data on that kind of treatment flow.  The answer is yes, but they are case studies.  Case studies are typically examples of excellent care, which is great, but one also needs the middling stuff and the bad stuff.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Barry, that 50% increase is on a low-fertility assumption.  The dependency ratio I think he was seeing was using the M1F3 measure, whereby the population explodes, which is reflected in the chart.  I think I have seen the chart circulated recently.  It is based on an assumption of very low fertility.</p><p>I have not seen the INMO stat, but I will check it out, and I thank the Deputy for telling me about it.</p><p> Regarding the mental health issue, I am glad to see that it is becoming more publicly acceptable to do this.  People in my family have suffered from it, so that it is coming out more is great to see.  Medicine and medical care comprise a derived-demand system.  The more that people use it, the more it gets used.  It is like a road, in that if one builds a new road, it will be full of cars.  Do not get me wrong, as it is good that people present with these issues, but it entails a necessary increase in cost to the system.  The best example of this is autism services.  We are finally getting around to producing really good autism services in some parts of the country, which is producing a natural increase in Exchequer spend.  Once autism is diagnosed, it obviously does not go away.  The State has rightly made a commitment to the person and his or her family for the next 40, 50, 60 or 70 years.  When these diagnoses are made, they do not tend to be associated with one-time spikes in expenditure, but with long-term increases.  Nonetheless, it is the hallmark of a good and decent society that we do these things, so the State should do them.  However, in a world of constrained resources, by definition this means that the money in question is not being spent on early childhood education, higher education, etc.</p><p> In general, there will be an increased need for staffing across almost all grades, but my sense is that this is not true at the fine grain or service level.  I will give an example.  If we decided that we wanted to route more services into the community care space, we would fund that area and not other areas, but we would route people to that area in order to decrease demand there.  To do this, one needs a plan.  One cannot just stop something and hope that it gets built up by the private sector or the like.  That tends not to work.  The private sector tends to take options that maximise its profits, as it should.  There is an issue with that.  I do not want to give a two-handed answer but, while worker levels would increase, they would not increase by the same amount everywhere.  I only have anecdotal data on this.</p><p> No workforce planning model that I have seen plans for agency staff.  Models plan for full-time or part-time staff on a full-time equivalent, FTE, basis.  We are discussing worker equivalence, not agency staff.  Agency staff are seen as a sticky plaster to solve the problem.  My strong preference is for permanent and pensionable people in positions where they can do their best work.  One does not get a professional system if one does not hire people for professional reasons and pay them appropriately.  In fact, one overpays for agency staff.</p><p> May I ask Deputy O'Connell for clarification on the divisions issue?  Does she mean funding or the actual locations of the systems, for example, mental health services in one place and coronary care somewhere else?</p></speech>

It happens in certain countries like the Netherlands, but other countries integrate them.  Typically, it depends on how the system evolved.  Essentially, our health system evolved from the Catholic church and a series of 19th century Victorian systems that were effectively designed as workhouses.  Our hospitals are in certain places because of a decision that someone made in the 19th or, in some cases, 18th century.  We have stuck with many of these systems because they have been there.  Some of the governance arrangements are 19th century ones, which is bizarre.  We are stuck with a large number of systems because that is how they were in the past.  Our approach to mental health, for example, has been to ignore it for generations.  This is why one is separate from the other in physical, funding and governance terms.  I hope that our approach will change, but it depends on one's starting point.  New Zealand does not do it in the same way and instead uses an integrated model of care.  New Zealand is an interesting model of health care delivery.  Not all of its staff are permanent and pensionable, but it is efficient and good value for money and everything is integrated in terms of funding and delivery.  I do not want to give the Deputy an "it depends" answer, but it is where we came from.</p></speech>

With a population of 7 million to 8 million on the island in 30 years' time, which is what this committee should start planning for, Dublin will have 2 million or 2.5 million people, which is probably the population density per square mile of Los Angeles.  Places like Limerick will have 300,000 or 400,000 people.  It is a different proposition.  There will be areas of the country where almost no one lives.  Interestingly, it will be back to the same level that obtained before the Famine, when 8 million people lived on the island.  In such a situation, one would plan to integrate services as the population grew and aged.</p> <p>  I will offer an example.  The Deputy asked whether there was a section of the health service that we could do something about now.  The answer is "Yes", and it is the national children's hospital.  It is a big piece of capital infrastructure, but it is not there currently.  We could plan for the workforce that will be involved.  For example, we could place Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, CAMHS, in there.  As the system evolves, one builds things in.  We could fix that.  There is some talk of moving to the trust model for our large hospitals.  As one moved to a trust, one could build in that workforce planning along with the legislative and financial backing.</p> <p>  Regarding ratios of staff in various countries, I have seen many studies.  My sense is that this work would have to be done at the service level, which would mean contacting all of the major professional organisations and asking them what they believed best practice would look like if, for example, they delivered ophthalmic surgery.  One must listen to the service users and service providers.  If one does not, one ends up with a load of nerds producing spreadsheets.  That sounds good to people like me, a nerd who produces spreadsheets, but does it help those who are on the ground delivering services?  This was the feedback from all of our expert interviews.  While we could generate a baseline, we would need to ask the experts first.</p></speech>

Workforce planning entails a number of activities, but the main thrust is to have the right amount of people in the right place at the right time.  The common refrain is that the HSE is top-heavy with management, in that there are too many chiefs and not enough Indians.  Has this been borne out by Dr. Kinsella's studies?</p> <p>  Is there sufficient talent management within the HSE?  Are high achievers being rewarded within the system or is promotion due to seniority still an issue?  How do we address this or has Dr. Kinsella examples of how it was tackled in his other models?</p></speech>

I thank Dr. Kinsella.  I wish to ask him about his studies.  Our health service has moved from the Victorian type to matrons to the church, etc.  Generally, everyone attended public hospitals, for example, accident and emergency departments.</p> <p>  Given that the national cancer strategy has worked well, should we start with that to find the information required for the national children's strategy, the national mental health strategy, the national disability strategy, the national cystic fibrosis strategy and so on and feed it into services that are provided through our public health services or otherwise?</p><p>Is this taking on board that we are looking at a single-tier health care service based on need rather than ability to pay?  Reference was made to the population reaching eight million in so many years and those services coming together.  The way the health service has developed in Ireland means there has never been direct information pulled, for example, from the national cancer treatment plan: what are the issues, what does one need, how does it get put through the system, how many patients are there, whether there will be more patients in the system over time, etc.  Consider people who have cystic fibrosis or scoliosis and where their national treatment plan is going.  It is done in Galway and at the children's hospital in Temple Street, among other places, but the issue is how to pull all that information together and how it can link in to make a more efficient service so health care can be provided based on need rather than ability to pay.  It is about getting people into the public health service rather than letting them go private because they feel the public service is not there.</p></speech>

What are Doctor Kinsella's feelings on that side of things?  All of those bodies have their own individual management committees and it is probably difficult to get information from them.  Perhaps the witness could indicate whether that is a big stumbling block in the area of workforce planning and if there is any way around that or any suggestions in that area?</p></speech>

When he spoke about workforce planning in Wales and Scotland, Dr. Kinsella indicated that he liked it.  However, he felt that it might not fit with the health service in Ireland and its mix between public and private.  The question must be asked: is it the case that we make plans to suit the system or that we adjust the system to the plans?  When one looks at the population issue with a broad brush stroke - for example, in 30 years' time there will be 2.5 million people in Dublin and eight million in the State, which equates to a population the size of Los Angeles - if we are going to plan this properly, do we need to move more in the direction of England and Wales with regard to a national health service and a centralisation of health services?  Can the current system be properly planned for, given the types of changes we face?</p></speech>

Will Dr. Kinsella indicate whether there are objective best-practice ratios, issued by the World Health Organization or the OECD, with groups of countries comparable to Ireland, at least with regard to the number of cardiologists or speech therapists, for example?  Should that be our starting point, if those objective ratios are set and adjusting for profile of population and so on?</p> <p>  Dr. Kinsella made reference to elements of good practice in respect of workforce planning for nurses, midwives and other categories of worker, but is he saying, fundamentally, that there is no overall workforce planning of consequence going on in Ireland? Are there no agencies or bodies taking responsibility in the round for health workforce planning? This is what I took from his comments.</p> <p>  Another question to which we would want to apply our minds very soon is the allocation of resources and what we know to be very wide variations in staff ratios on a geographic basis.  Has Dr. Kinsella looked at that issue and, if he has, what are his findings on those variations?</p></speech>

I am hesitant to criticise the HSE because everyone does.  My sense is that if 25% of staff are doing management, administration and support it feels like a lot, but one has to look at where they began and where we are now.  I am not trying to evade the Chairman's question but I would be much more interested in the question of what it would look like in ten years' time - would there still be a 25% ratio or would it be reduced to 15% by using better technology to do some of the work and what does that mean for those administrative staff?  When one considers the ratio of management to administrative staff within the HSE versus comparator countries, the percentages do not look wildly out of kilter.  However, those data have to be taken with a pinch of salt because there may be nurses who perform lots of administrative work and there may be support staff who do much of the front-line work, so we are not 100% sure.</p> <p>  With regard to talent management and rewards within the system, the public sector is, unfortunately, not replete with massive amounts of rewards within the system.  I cannot imagine what a bonus culture would look like in universities, for example.  I would love one, if the politicians want to do one - that would be great.  I believe that our public sector and public structures are still within a very early-20th-century mode in which one gets a job for life, stays there and moves up in terms of seniority.  I do not see any evidence that it is different in other parts of the system.  My own experience is mostly within the higher education system, but I do not see any evidence that it is different.</p> <p>  Deputy Barry asked about work planned around the national strategies, such as the maternity and cancer strategies.  That can be done, but if we do that we will not get around to the major ones for quite some time.  I believe there are some 30 different clinical care pathways.  If we worked on one plan at a time and each one took three years, that would be 90 years.  Even this long-term committee does not quite hold to that.  I believe that we need to do one overarching plan and maybe work on specific modules at the same time.  It is important to have a workforce planning unit - that is, a group of 10 or 15 people whose sole purpose is to gather all the data.  It should not be done separately by Solas, the HSE and the Department of Health.  The group would gather the data and would fit it into the e-health strategy and all the rest of the system.  In being enabled to do so, the group would build up a competence so it can determine, for example, a module on midwives.  We saw this in Scotland, where a workforce planning module was prepared specifically for midwives.  This has happened in other places also, where having people on the ground with the data means that further investigations can happen in a particular dimension, as policy makers require.  For example, we know that diabetes levels are going to increase massively, so we may need more diabetes nurses - who knows?  It will be a case of planning for that.  We know it is going to get worse: the clinicians are telling us that we will have a problem into the future.  Autism care requirements may increase.  Care for people with different developmental disorders and those with mental health care requirements will increase.  We will need to do a workforce plan for that.  It would all be done in one place and it would not be aligned to a particular strategy whose work, when the strategy runs it course, might never feed back into anything else.  That would be one of my ideas - one resource putting all the data together.</p> <p>  With regard to the section 30 queries by Deputy Daly, that is why one needs to have a governance structure at the level of the HSE.</p><p>Even the Department of Health finds it difficult to get data from some section 37 and 38 organisations.  The Government will need to change the law in order to have them comply as efficiently as possible, as if they were fully public hospitals.  Again, it is interesting; it comes back to our history in that voluntary care has typically been provided in the absence of the State providing it and so what one has is a half-way house whereby one has charities doing the State's work that are poorly regulated.  People are set up to do a job, whose vocation in life is to help homeless people or people whose children are dying of cancer, for example, and one is saying to them that they must also fill out a risk register and the skill-sets are just not there.</p><p> I do not have the answer but a good question for me to pose to the committee is whether we have too many charities.  That is a question this committee could answer.  What are the consequences if the answer is "Yes"?  If the answer is "Yes" then this committee must recommend that some of those charities get amalgamated, go away or become regulated out of existence.  That is a big question.  Do we have too many hospitals?  That is another big question.  Do we have too few?  This is why we elect Deputies.  They must answer those questions.  I wish members good luck in answering them.</p><p> In terms of the information, the law must change.  Some of the organisations are just private companies, effectively, with a board of management and the CEO is subsumed into the board and the board might decide it is not giving the information.  The HSE has made lots of changes in order to get the information on a timely basis and it is starting to get to the nub of some of the issues, but I strongly suggest that with thousands of charities we have not seen the end of this.</p><p> A good question is whether we adjust the system we have or strategise for the system that we want.  I strongly urge the second option.  I would argue that one should set the strategy for the system one wants and one should build funding on a multi-annual basis in order to get there.  The best example of that is the city of Copenhagen.  It was decided to plan the city using the finger model and to develop in a certain direction along one finger for five years and then go back and develop another finger and then another one.  The intention was to connect up the fingers using public transport.  Anyone who has been there will know it is a very nice city.  They did not plan for the city they had, they planned for the city they would have and then money was put in as it became available.  When the money was not available no building took place, but over a 30-year period they produced a beautiful city.  One could do the same with the health system.  One would do it by simply sticking to a plan.  That is why it is called strategic health workforce planning.  It is strategic because the Government sets the strategy.  It is interesting to see where the strategy is set but my hope is that it would be at Cabinet level and committee level.</p><p> In reply to the question of whether ratios should be our best starting point, the answer is "Yes" but what one will find is that the ratios are different by country depending on their institutional structure, so one must control for that and it is quite difficult to achieve.  I have seen many of studies that tried to do this.  Eventually, what they end up doing is focusing on doctors, nurses and physiotherapist and then they give up because it is very difficult to get comparable data.  Reference was made earlier, for example, to nurses and nurses aides but they do not have those comparable distinctions in other countries which means one cannot compare them directly and it becomes a little difficult.  That said, we could do that as our starting point.  To my knowledge it has not been done but I am open to correction.  It could be done as part of the work of the committee.  I imagine the HSE would be the first ones to do it.</p><p> In terms of allocation of resources and staff ratios, one should follow the other.  The question is what is the appropriate staff ratio.  There must be dialogue with the people who do the service.  If one does not, one will impose a system where there are too many doctors and not enough nurses or one will forget something.  I believe in listening to the people who do the work.  That is probably the best way to do it, and that is informed by best practice.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague, Yvonne Goff, who is the HSE's chief clinical information officer, a role recognised globally as key to enabling the delivery of digital solutions in health and to maintaining a clinical focus in the delivery of digital solutions for how we put forward what we do.  The work being done in Ireland around clinical engagement has been recognised by the European Union, the World Health Organization and the NHS as having world class clinical engagement and leadership in many of its digital projects.  This is a crucial foundation to the digital journey we are on today.</p> <p>  I will first clarify the concept of eHealth Ireland in relation to the Health Service Executive.  It is a function created out of the eHealth Ireland strategy of 2013.  This document was provided to the committee previously by the Department of Health in an earlier submission.  Today, eHealth Ireland is a function within the HSE tasked with bringing about a change to the way in which health care is delivered in Ireland through the use of digital solutions.  The documentation that has been provided to the committee ahead of this meeting will give it a comprehensive view of what and where the delivery for the eHealth Ireland programme has got to over the last 18 months.  These documents include: Ireland's eHealth, a progress document that sets out key successes that have been achieved and provides a summary of the focus for the next 12 months, highlighting priority areas throughout the health system, and the Knowledge and Information Strategy, a plan formulated and agreed across all stakeholders in March 2015.  This document sets out an organisational design which created a national programme delivering digital benefits into health throughout Ireland.  In addition, there is a pack of ten slides which give the committee some pictures to explain some of the things we will go through as part of this opening statement.  </p> <p>  The development of the knowledge and information plan is not simply another health-based strategy.  Its agreement and implementation has enabled us to move forward at a rate not seen before in digital health in Ireland.  It has enabled us to consider what digital means to health care specifically in Ireland, learning from other jurisdictions such as the USA, the NHS in the UK, Northern Ireland, Estonia and Australia, where success has been achieved in some arenas and where significant lessons have been learnt in others.  The delivery of digital solutions supporting health care is described in the knowledge and information plan.  It has enabled the HSE to put in place a national team to deliver solutions to the whole health system.  It removes a previous focus on acute hospital solutions and places at the heart of health care delivery the ability to centre what we do with digital on the health system, not the health care definitions and boundaries but putting the patient at the centre of everything we do. </p> <p>  Digital solutions deployed to the health care system are immune to organisational structure and change.  They are put in place to empower the patient to choose where they want to be treated and to neutralise the current boundaries of health care.  Effectively, digital solutions can be seen as a catalyst to the delivery of integrated and personalised care.  "No more IT projects" is the mantra of eHealth Ireland.  This may seem somewhat strange but it is a key lesson learnt from previous attempts to deliver large digital solutions in health in Ireland.  What do we mean by "No more IT projects"?  We mean everything that digital can do, whether it is a new financial management system or an electronic health record for community functions around Ireland, has to be more about the business change than the technology.  Digital solution should not change the way people work.  We need to do that through development of business change facilitated by digital.</p> <p>  The knowledge and information plan defines the resources, both financial and human, needed to do this and a timeline to enable it.</p><p>All targets set in the plan in the spring of 2015 have thus far been met, which is a credit to the eHealth Ireland team and its collaboration with the Department of Health.  The success of 2015 has released a small amount of additional funding to the HSE in this area after over a decade of what is considered to be under-investment.</p><p> Building on a change that has seen some success provides Ireland with a unique opportunity to apply lessons learned from elsewhere and move forward safe in the knowledge that others have proven the direction Ireland can take.  Now is not just a safer time to invest in digital solutions for health, but an essential time.  The integration of care, the removal of false boundaries and placing care delivery around the patient can only be achieved with digital solutions.</p><p> I would like to provide the committee with an overview of the current resources available to the HSE to take forward this digital agenda.  We have a very lean team in comparison to other Government Departments and health care systems.  There is one IT person supporting every 236 people in the HSE today.  Other Departments such as the Revenue Commissioners have one IT person supporting every 11 resources.  In other areas, such as social welfare and agriculture, there is one IT person for every 17 resources to support their complex agendas.</p><p> The current average EU health care budget spend on digital solutions is just over 3%.  The HSE has around 1% of its budget allocated to this agenda.  In 2016, we secured permission to add further resources to the team, around 49 new people.  This has been progressing through the year as we start to bring those people on board and into the team.  </p><p> The HSE has created a function that can work in an agile manner.  It does not require funding linked to EU norms.  However, it will necessitate a steady programme of investment that, over time, enables it to become a function that drives business change and supports digital delivery in health.  I ask the committee to give consideration to how digital solutions can be implemented in health care over the next decade.  In order to truly realise benefits, the system needs to be equipped with business change capabilities and the ability to apply funding from IT to business change.</p><p> Clinical leadership of digital projects today is the key enabler of the of the work eHealth Ireland is doing.  More than 200 clinicians across 45 disciplines now have the additional role of clinical information officer.  This resource is there to ensure that projects that used to be focused on the delivery of IT are now there to focus on the delivery of patient and clinical benefit.  The vision can overcome many operational issues in the creation of integrated care.  Digital is the catalyst for the delivery of an empowered patient who expects and rightly assumes that care is integrated.</p><p> In 2015, the Minister's office asked us to consider how we could learn through real Irish digital projects within our current budget.  We chose three radically different chronic disease areas to focus on: epilepsy, bipolar disorder and haemophilia.  These areas became known as lighthouse projects.  Haemophilia now has a patient solution that allows illness to be managed, controlled and audited digitally.  The supply chain of that treatment can now be managed at home with the patient's mobile phone.  The solution also allows patients to have access to their records and will this year enable secure communication with their clinicians.  The Irish Haemophilia Society has considered the savings in this programme and puts the figure at around &euro;10 million a year in drug cost savings.</p><p> A second lighthouse project is epilepsy.  Ireland has begun its first genomics sequencing programme in partnership with the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.  Through seeking for the genome of suspected epilepsy patients we can provide efficient and safe care to a cohort of patients; fatalities could be avoided and the cost of treatment has come down dramatically.  There are as many as 130 epilepsy-related deaths in Ireland each year, 90 of which are considered to be undiagnosed children.  The cost of finding the correct medicines for those patients is approximately &euro;5 million year.  Investment in this project has made and can continue to make treatment available for 40,000 epilepsy sufferers in Ireland.  Treatment can now be personalised and contextualised to their type of epilepsy.</p><p> The final lighthouse project is in the area of bipolar disorder, which affects 1% of the Irish population.  The ability to treat complex mental health issues through the use of digital solutions is yet to be fully explored globally.  Ireland has been able to invest and we consider bipolar disorder as an area to concentrate on.  Delivering a solution for the recording and communicating of the patient's disorder directly to the clinician is the first step for this calendar year.</p><p> I would like to describe a number of national solutions that have been the focus of our attention over 2016.  These are projects that can become the foundational elements of the future of a digital fabric of Ireland.  In the coming weeks, the individual health identifier will be connected to the first local health system, joining up information and supporting integrated care.  The technology infrastructure to support the individual health identifier, which was legislated for in 2014 by the Health Identifiers Act, is now live.  The complete population and building of the process to support this within health are under way.  The Department of Health continues to work with the Department of Social Protection to get agreement on the linkage between datasets, all of which is made clear in legislation.  This will allow us to populate many of our current and new information systems with the IHI, ensuring that patient information across a range of systems can be safely connected.  The HSE is ready to place the individual health identifier on all electronic referrals as soon as the Department has completed this negotiation.</p><p> The implementation of electronic referrals in every hospital in Ireland is now complete.  More than 40% of GPs used the service in August 2016, with 10,733 referrals being handled by this digital service during that month.  This means that a patient can see the arrival of his or her referral in the hospital while he or she still with his or her GP.  This solution removes the need for a paper referral and for the GP practice to post the referral, where the referral can touch an estimated 11 hands in its movement through the health system.  This digital process enables an increase in efficiency, security and traceability, and allows us a significant opportunity to modernise the referral process.  This will clearly have an impact on waiting lists across the system and will create a significant cost reduction with the removal of paper referrals.  The referral project is now moving to the next stage, with the ability for patients to see their referrals digitally and to make changes to the time and date of their appointments.  Due to the success of e-referral, we can now move to consider how e-pharmacy and electronic prescribing can also be added, and a focus will be applied to that in the coming months.  </p><p> There are three other key projects that are a priority to the end of 2016 and that will begin to deliver benefits before the end of this year.  The first national digital health record solution will be the maternity and newborn clinical management system, MNCMS.  This will be deployed in Ireland's maternity hospitals over the next 18 months.  The first hospital will be Cork, in late October, and Kerry, in late November this year.  Moving one of Europe's busiest maternity hospitals from a largely paper-based administrative system to one which is almost paper-free and supports clinical practice is a major task, but one that is on track and is clinically led.  Delivery in this area will allow Ireland's maternity services to ensure national integrated care is safely and efficiently delivered into the next decade.</p><p> Ireland will move to a single digital lab system, known as MedLIS.  This will allow information to be shared securely across the areas of care that have a legitimate reason to access this type of information.  Electronic ordering, tests and results and sharing between acute, primary and community care settings will reduce the burden of testing and retesting.  This will have a significant financial saving as well as being more convenient and, in some cases, safer for the patient. </p><p> Another priority is the connectivity of delivery staff to digital solutions.  The connection of the 47,000 health staff who today have no access to any digital solution for their work is a key enabler for eHealth Ireland to put in place.  The priority areas include the implementation of 10,000 new physical devices into community and primary care, areas that are currently largely paper-based.  This is crucial to the success of all digital projects.</p><p> Ireland is the first EU member state to avail of the Health Cloud First policy.  This technical term simply means that the clinical resources of Ireland can access their system safely, securely and from anywhere.  They can do this happy in the knowledge that information remains within Ireland and is protected to a high globally recognised standard.  One of the next areas that can avail of this is the cancer care solution, known as MOCIS.  Currently, cancer care is delivered largely on paper and does not have a digital solution to support it.  Early in 2017, MOCIS will also begin its journey to go live.</p><p> Before closing, I would like to speak about the opportunities of the future.  I hope what has been made clear today is the opportunity of the present, the building blocks that are being put in place and structures set up to facilitate the ten-year journey ahead of us.  The concept of an electronic health record Ireland is not new.  However, Ireland now has a well-structured and HSE-approved route to deliver an electronic health record. </p><p> This programme of work will span ten years and will put in place a set of solutions built around the individual health identifier, which will be deployed in a modular fashion to the benefit of the whole health care system.  It is in this area that Ireland can come to the concept of digitally connected health care systems and leapfrog other jurisdictions.  The concept of an electronic health record described in the business case is not one of a single, monolithic Irish Government database, but rather involves connectivity, integration and transformation and clinically led implementation with the person at the centre.  This is a ten-year journey that the electronic health record programme will put in place.  It is not an immediate large investment, but rather a commitment to incrementally evaluate the success of digital over a ten-year period and continue to add to the investment as benefits can be seen and success is clear.</p><p>It is crucial for Ireland that this solution is not a big bang but an evolution of today's systems, set in stone as we move to 2020.  By 2020, clinicians will be able to access digital information about patients appropriately, and by 2025 we will see a digital fabric throughout the health system including a system that is also accessible and in the hands of the people of Ireland.  It is important to reiterate this is not a single one year investment; it is a continuously assessed multi-year investment over the lifetime of the programme.</p><p> I thank committee members for their attention and interest in these key areas.  The success of the past 18 months can be built upon with support, investment and enthusiasm.  We believe we can truly change the way in which the health system can work together by enabling eHealth Ireland as a digital catalyst.  I and my colleague will endeavour to answer any questions committee members may have.</p></speech>

He referred to the evolution, which is particularly slow.  It is hard for many of us to understand why the evolution has been so slow.  We have been speaking about an individual health identifier for many years.  It was legislated for, as Mr. Corbridge stated, in 2014.  What is the difficulty with the Department of Social Protection?  Why are we still in a situation where the HSE is trying to negotiate on data sharing?</p> <p>  My next question relates to the urgent need to ensure electronic referrals and record-keeping at primary care level in particular.  Mr. Corbridge stated 40% of GPs use electronic referrals  This is very low in this day and age.  What needs to happen to increase this figure to 100%?  Mr. Corbridge referred to the fact that 47,000 health staff have no access to any digital solution.  This is quite a shocking figure in this day and age, when the vast majority of workers and teenagers have access to digital solutions for whatever work they are doing.  Why is this number so large?  What needs to happen to expedite this to ensure standards are increased to an acceptable modern level in the HSE?</p></speech>

The negotiations between the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Health on the use of PPS numbers and sharing information have reached the point where there is a memorandum of understanding between the two Departments.  Once this is finalised and agreed we can begin to use the individual health identifier.  The length of time between the Act and going live is, to some degree, to do with investment and being able to work out how to begin the implementation.  We started the technology part of this 18 months ago.  To do this in 18 months is considered by other jurisdictions as quite a significant achievement.  It has taken a long time to work from the Act to understand how to implement what we have done, but the solution has been put in place in 18 months and brings about a great change.</p></speech>

From a clinical point of view, it is absolutely essential.  It is key to bringing patient data together.  All of the national systems we have been implementing for the past 18 months, or five years, have been built based on being able to take the additional individual health identifier number.  We are ready to go.</p></speech>

To move in 12 months from three hospitals in Cork and Kerry to every hospital in Ireland being capable of receiving an electronic referral is rapid progress.  GP systems in Ireland are already predominantly digital and the electronic referral solution is being built in such a way as to allow GPs to have access to it.  The biggest selling point, for want of a better way of putting it, of electronic referral for a GP is the removal of cost.  A GP would no longer need to complete the administrative functions of printing, putting a stamp on an envelope and sending it.  We have seen a very quick take-up of the electronic referral service.  The HSE has set itself a target of having 100% of GPs using the electronic referral service by 1 April next year.  This will be a joint leap forward because it will give patients access to electronic referral and will allow us to collect information and use it in an anonymised way to manage the referral process and patterns.</p></speech>

The e-referral will start to build a foundation to get people used to using digital solutions.  The reality today is many of our hospitals and healthcare systems are almost entirely reliant on paper.  E-referral is one of a number of projects to create a foundation to allow us to build on it and start to move forward.</p></speech>

As the Chairman rightly pointed out, we probably all have a very powerful pocket computer today, and the HSE has not had the funding to implement this type of digital fabric into the healthcare system.  In April, we set ourselves a target to connect these 47,000 people to digital solutions.  This means giving them the ability to log onto a computer that will be in their care setting.  It gives them the ability to have an e-mail account and solutions they can start to use to do this.  What is perhaps even more worrying are the 10,000 people in primary and community care who have no devices and our programme to roll out these is well under way.  In 2015, Ireland was the largest EU population to roll out new Microsoft solutions into what we deliver and we followed up on this commitment this year.</p></speech>

I understand the IT spend in 2009 was approximately 0.75% of the budget.  By international standards, what is required to meet the targets and be on track?  As has been stated by my colleagues, we are behind on this.  The HSE is putting in place very good targets but what is required percentage wise when we consider what other countries spend on investing in our IT systems?  Mr. Corbridge stated e-prescriptions are coming down the track in the coming months and I ask him to expand on this.  With regard to the GP uptake of 40%, what has been the main barrier to date with regard to the slow uptake of e-referrals?  Is the HSE leveraging the skills and experience of the ICT industry in progressing this to help it meet its targets and develop the IT systems?</p></speech>

Reference is often made to a push pull system with prescriptions.  Where are we with regard to patient choice in Ireland?  A family member is a pharmacist in the Netherlands and in that country a defined number of patients are directed to a particular community pharmacy setting so an element of choice is removed.  As a community pharmacist, I am quite interested hear where we are with this.  With regard to the Department of Social Protection, recently I received an identifier card with a chip.  A chip seems outdated at this stage.  If we are to integrate systems, is it true to say the card will be defunct?</p><p>If there is to be one number identifier per patient, it seems somewhat bizarre that the social protection card would not be used.  Why not simply have one card for everything?  As for spending in this regard, I may have missed this at the outset but technology moves so quickly that when something like this is being done over the next ten years, is the ability to adapt to changes that happen in the technological world being factored in?  It is great to see the savings in these few projects.  Perhaps I am missing it but does the Health Service Executive, HSE, have data showing the savings made when this is done whereby, for example, if one invests &euro;10 million, one will save &euro;20 million over ten years or whatever?  Are such data available because significant amounts appeared to have been saved already?</p></speech>

In respect of the 47,000 people who currently do not have access to a computer as part of their work within the health service, I assume that number does not also take into account agency staff who are not directly employed or does it?  Second, this is more of an observation than a question, as someone who has represented workers in the health service, but there is great emphasis on making sure those who are senior management in the health service have access to a wide range of equipment.  They have iPads, iPhones, BlackBerry devices and everything else but those who are on the front line and who might benefit most from it do not.  For example, when the health service introduced electronic payslips, none of the catering staff in hospitals were able to access them and likewise for directly employed cleaning staff, health care assistants and people like that.  However, senior managers who would not necessarily have a need for all the information and communications technology, ICT, equipment because they have desk computers, also had all the mobile information technology, IT, equipment to go with it.  There must be something of a refocusing on who actually needs the technology.</p> <p>  The 2017 figure for capital investment in ICT is &euro;55 million.  In Mr. Corbridge's estimation, will that come close or will it even knock the corners off it?  Deputy Naughton alluded to a percentage of overall expenditure on health but rather than a percentage, what actual capital figure does Mr. Corbridge perceive to be necessary to ensure some of the fairly ambitious targets he has outlined can be hit?  Finally, a system of integrated waiting lists is in operation in Portugal at present that all the figures suggest has had a significant impact on reducing waiting times.  The system has integrated all of the waiting lists rather than having separate waiting lists.  In Mr. Corbridge's opinion, were this to be done would there be a saving to the Exchequer?  How far is the HSE from being able to introduce a measure that is fairly desirable and that makes a lot of sense?  How far is the HSE from having such an integrated waiting list system or is it dependent on the unique patient identifier, which unfortunately and regrettably is taking a long time to implement?</p></speech>

First, on funding and the size of funding, the team size, that is, the people on the team probably is the area we must consider most in 2017.  We are spending money from a capital point of view that allows us to buy technology.  Our biggest problem is having people to implement and, in particular, with people working with Ms Yvonne Goff's team to do the business change part of it.  It is all well and good to have enough money to buy the brown boxes and cables and to put them into hospitals but we need additional resources to train people and make the business change happen.  There is a real risk in information technology across the world and in health care in particular of spending money on technology that people cannot use.  This is a major pattern that was seen in the United States and is why we have concentrated in 2015 and 2016 in particular on making sure that the clinical engagement, namely, the 200 people working with Ms Goff, bring to bear that resource, which is different, on how we actually implement in that space.  My suggestion or request would be that consideration be given less to the capital budget and changes therein and more to the revenue side.  IT in general is moving more towards a platform as a service, that is, things as a service one buys each year, rather than as an investment that lasts for five or ten years.  One point to bear in mind with technology and the investment thus far is that in Ireland today, there are patient administration systems in hospitals in Dublin that are 32 years old.  That kind of investment has not happened and therefore driving that forward would be a useful way to go.  Would Ms Goff like to say anything about the ePharmacy piece?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-14a.422" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Yvonne Goff" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016091400002#Q00500"><p>The ePharmacy programme has just begun.  We are considering three pillars, the first of which is the national drug catalogue.  The second is e-prescribing in the community and a third concerns pharmacy within the hospitals.  Of the group of 200 clinicians, 19 are pharmacists and another subgroup comprises doctors who are interested in pharmacy.  They have come together and are considering a solution that would address everyone's needs.  For instance, Deputy O&rsquo;Connell asked a question about patient choice.  In England, as she is aware, they started with no patient choice and a patient was obliged to go to a certain pharmacy but they now are in a different phase in which they are broadening out the patient choice.  Again, to revert to the point made earlier by Mr. Richard Corbridge, although we are slow to the game, we have the benefit of learning from other countries and will continue to so do.  We definitely do not have all the solutions with regard to the ePharmacy programme.  It is at the beginning and it is being scoped out at present.</p></speech>

As for the suggestion that it has been slow, it has been 12 months and as of August, 40% of GPs are now using it.  That is not actually really slow for health care and technology.  Health care globally and not just in Ireland takes time to adopt digital solutions.  In respect of what we actively are doing, over the next month we will begin a communications process with the people of Ireland, namely, the patients.  We will tell them that the next time they are in front of their GP, they should ask to be electronically referred.  The benefit to a patient in how they feel when they have been electronically referred, rather than handed a referral and asked to post it or get to the hospital themselves, is significant.  Increasingly, patients asking their GPs is what will drive the process, particularly because thus far, GPs have been warm to the electronic referral because it reduces their costs and brings efficiencies.  Our commitment is that within 12 months, we will be very close to 100% of first referrals out of GP practice being electronic referrals, which globally would be quite a quick implementation of a solution like that.</p></speech>

That was going out through Healthlink, which is the same process as we have for the referrals.  As GPs were not comfortable with not receiving a paper report for a long time, we spent significant time on a communication plan and building up to a time when we ceased printing reports and over six months, there was a saving of &euro;150,000 based on that.  It was through communication and working with the GPs in particular that they became comfortable with moving into this environment.</p></speech>

The HSE has created something called the eHealth Ireland Ecosystem.  That is a group of people, now 300 in number, who come together each quarter to help eHealth Ireland drive forward its agenda.  They range from some of the biggest digital organisations globally, which come and provide assistance - not at cost - to make sure we can learn from other jurisdictions and keep driving forward in how we do this.  The ecosystem was set out in the original eHealth Ireland strategy as something that should exist and 12 months later, with such numbers of people involved, it has been highly successful.  We use a lot of the digital organisations not as contractor partners, but as organisations that are willing to provide advice and guidance on where we go.  This has been particularly useful in the past six months as we have started to learn more and more about different jurisdictions as we have built the electronic health record business case.</p> <p>  The Deputy also mentioned the public service card.  One plan through which the Department of Health is working with the Department of Social Protection is on how the individual health identifier can be on that same card, that is, how in the future that number and code could be part of that same identity and dataset.  It is a discussion between the Department of Health and the Department of Social Protection about how to make that happen.  It makes complete logical sense to do it; the Deputy is absolutely right to say that.  As for the speed of technology adoption - this is something on which Ms Yvonne Goff can also comment - I have worked in health care technology for 20 years.  I have never seen such amazing clinical engagement as that which we have in Ireland.  Clinicians in Ireland want technology and there are two key reasons for this.  First, the system in Ireland is largely paper-based and clinicians can see that this perhaps is not always the easiest, most efficient and safe way of delivering health care.  Second, many clinicians will have worked in other jurisdictions that have digital solutions.  Consequently, our pace is very much based on the business change capability we have put in place.  We must not do what the United States has done, where digital is done to clinicians and clinicians walk away from digital and stop using it.</p></speech>

We are less likely to buy a system that will not fit into meeting our needs or will never fit into doing so.  That is the way we work together with our IT staff on every one of our technology programmes.</p></speech>

The electronic health record business case, which the HSE, eHealth Ireland Committee and the Chief Clinical Information Officers Council has approved, is now with the Department of Health.  It stresses the efficiencies and safety savings that can be made through implementing an electronic health record system.  It does not give a literal figure for each hospital, community setting and mental health setting.  That has been proven in the NHS in particular to be quite a dangerous thing to do.  What it can do is make sure the system becomes more efficient and more safely delivered, and that is crucial to that business case and how we take that further forward.</p> <p>  The 47,000 people Deputy Louise O'Reilly referred to in our document also includes agency staff.  It is the people who work in the health care system.  A process will be put in place to enable a single digital identity for a member of staff who is working in the health system regardless of where they work across the health care system.  The Deputy's comment on the level of technology is spot on.  It is very much the case that we consider how we can use technology at a more senior level rather than its implementation at the front end.  Ms Goff's team drives us to make sure that is not what we do.  That is unique for Ireland.  In other jurisdictions in which I have worked, the clinicians have said they want and need this technology rather than it being a management function illustrating the technology that could be in place.</p></speech>

The electronic health record business case considers a capital investment of around &euro;107 million in year one.  That is not an insignificant additional amount of capital but I would refer to my earlier comment about revenue and about the ability to have the right number of people employed by the health system to implement this.  We need to be careful not to rely on temporary staff, contractors and consultancy teams and to make sure that we lodge the intelligence and capability to deliver this in the Irish health care system and not be reliant on temporary resources.</p></speech>

Slide 10 details the revenue costs, the capital costs and the spread of resource over the year.  Slide 10 in the document pack we have provided gives members the details on that.</p> <p>  The last question was about integrated waiting lists and the possibilities around that.  Many members will be aware that in the past three weeks we were asked by the Minister to deliver a digital challenge solution to the waiting list issue that exists today.  That is now with the Minister's office to consider how that could be put in place.  That includes a 12-month challenge and an additional spend of &euro;1 million, and one of the products within it would be an integrated waiting list.  In terms of electronic referral system, when moving referrals to an electronic solution, it is not that difficult to create an integrated waiting list from that solution.</p></speech>

What did he mean by that?</p></speech>

We forget sometimes that the health care systems of the world are based on demand.  If we make a system more efficient, it does not remove demand.  It just means we can do more.  Therefore, to say one would save money is not something that I believe a digital solution would do in the health system.  It means that one can provide more care, be more efficient and deliver what one does more safely rather than return money to the system.</p></speech>

How big an issue is data protection for the future of IT or ehealth care?  If there are issues, do we need to legislate to overcome them?  I would hate to think that we would continue run up against a problem because of data protection.  Sometimes we have to serve the greater good.  I would be interested to get our guests' views on that.</p> <p>  It is stated in the summary that this is a ten-year journey and that it is important not to have big bang solution - I think that was the phrase used.  Given where we are at with IT and, as Deputy O'Connell pointed out, it changes almost annually in that what we are using today is almost obsolete in 12 months' time, should we be more ambitious?  It was stated that this is a lean, mean operation, but are we fit for purpose?  Revenue is pretty efficient at what it does, too efficient perhaps for people like me if I were still in business.  Is, as was mentioned, one person per 11 what is needed, and if it is, is that what we should be striving towards?  As a committee we have been set up to come up with a ten-year strategy.  Mr. Corbridge spoke about a ten-year strategy, so there is a sort of fit there.  I have seen the benefits of improvements in ehealth for local GPs who work with the system through the hospitals, and the amount of time and energy saved by the exchanging of information electronically is colossal.  Are we ambitious enough in this area?</p></speech>

I am very interested in this paper and presentation.  The witnesses have an incredibly difficult job.  In a previous life I used to manage large integration IT projects, so I can share their pain at times.  Much of the pain is not due to IT.  Sometimes it relates to the decision-making and the process.  Leaders are very important in projects that are going to take this length of time to implement.  Historically, if we consider many of the integration projects that have been done in this country, and they are very well known from the media given the volume of funding that has been put into them, there has been a loss of critical leadership at certain points.  Effectively, many of the people, including the witnesses at the top of tree, are single points of possible failure.</p><p>Is there a process for managing that, particularly as people move on all the time?</p><p> The second issue is technology use.  Deputy Brassil stated that everything moves and that changes take place every year.  That is the case.  It changes every month at this stage.  Obviously, from an IP point of view, I presume open source is being managed in a way that allows continuity rather than technological single points of failure.  I presume there is a methodology for doing that and we do not get locked in with any supplier to the point where we cannot get out.  I remember being involved in the launch of the Leap Card in respect of which there was a process whereby technology partners were locked in and it caused significant delays.</p><p> I am a huge supporter of the public service card.  That is a massive project.  At what stage is the HSE in its conversation with the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Social Protection, both of which are involved with that project?  I presume it is on a continuous basis and Mr. Corbridge might let us know whether that is the position.</p><p> I am delighted to hear about eHealth Ireland.  I knew a little about it but not enough.  How does Mr. Corbridge find stakeholder engagement in this regard and is everyone covered?  From a buy-in point of view, this is a necessity not only among technology partners but across government?</p><p> I will not begin to discuss medical devices because a lengthy conversation is required in that regard.  The IT projects that are being done within the Department of Health and the data management system are integrated but they also separate.  We spoke earlier with Dr. Stephen Kinsella, who made a good presentation.  There is an overlap in respect of some of the aspects here.  I refer to consistency in data, the processes for managing data and the back-end database.  The quality of data is essential.  As stated earlier, there is a phrase which goes "dumb data in, dumb data out".  In the context of the process for managing data - the differential regarding the management of it from the top down - the IT aspect is one issue.  Obviously, it is ever-changing.  However, it is about ensuring that there are standards as regards data input because all the technology in the world is irrelevant if the data are not being input correctly.  I accept that they must come together but I presume they are managed throughout the network down to the very lowest level separately.  Those are my questions.</p></speech>

They are the first sites that will go live.  Obviously, we will evaluate each site as it goes live.  They are the first two maternity hospitals to go live.  The clinical engagement and passion in both hospitals for that system to go live successfully is phenomenal.  The solution that is being deployed is an American solution that was procured a number of years ago but has been clinically built and validated specifically for the delivery of maternity care in Ireland.  I personally have never seen a more committed clinical team to make a solution go live well.  There have been 8,000 man hours of training in Cork hospital alone to ensure that system goes live successfully over the weekend in October, and then the team moves on to Kerry.  We in the team all are personally committed to ensure those two sites go live well.  New IT systems, particularly those in the area of health, will often give rise to issues when they first go live.  We know how to manage those issues in Cork and Kerry and have a good team on the ground to ensure they are fully supportive.  We strongly believe that they will not be pilot projects; they will be proving how this should be done for hospitals across the rest of the country.  The programme team is ready to roll that into every one of the maternity hospitals.  Ms Goff may want to say something about the clinical engagement aspect.</p></speech>

One of the restrictions is that we have our solution and we have huge clinical engagement, but it is difficult, from a clinical point of view, to keep the business running as usual.  Midwives and doctors have to be released to test and train on these systems and although we might be asking for a large number of IT staff, we also need the clinicians to be able to attend that training and to build and test that system as well.  It goes to our big-bang theory a little bit that, unfortunately, we are not at that stage and we do not have an unlimited number of clinicians at present.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-14a.459" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richard Corbridge" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016091400002#S00500"><p>Moving to the savings in individual hospitals, where we take a national solution, such as the health cloud first solution, which will release money that is spent locally.  This means that money can then be spent in those local hospitals and on mental health and community organisations.  Where we have deployed solutions such as the electronic referral into GP practices, that saves money in such practices.  However, that money is not pulled back to the centre.  It is money that is released in the GP practice to be spent differently on particular efficiencies.  The same goes for simple solutions, such as mobile phone bills.  There is a single mobile bill solution for the HSE that has saved millions of euro.  However, those savings are not re-spent in the area of technology.  It is important to point out that they are re-spent across the HSE.</p></speech>

An electronic order can go all the way through into the system now rather than just stop at the door of the hospital.  That is where we are trying to reinvest.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-14a.461" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richard Corbridge" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016091400002#S00700"><p>On the question regarding data protection and legislation relating to it, other jurisdictions have ultimately failed to deliver technology into health for multiple years because they have fallen down in the context of data protection.  We go into this with our eyes wide open and having learned those lessons.  One of the principles we have adopted, particularly in terms of the electronic health record, is that data protection and the ability to govern who has looked at information to do with health will be placed in the hands of the patient.  We will enable a patient to log-on to see who, from a clinical point of view, has looked at his or her records and be able to do something about that.  That has been proven, particularly in Estonia, as a way of taking away many of the concerns around data protection.  The concept of a legitimate relationship to access information, I personally believe, is something in respect of which there is a need to change legislation in order that it might be contemplated.  We must also consider how we do that so that we have health information legislation around accessing health information is important to the success of our programme.  We have seen, even in the past six months, issues in the NHS where large programmes, after quite a significant spend, have been stopped because of data protection concerns.  We work with the Department of Health to ensure that we address our data protections and keep striving to deliver in that space.  Something called the privacy impact assessment was completely around the individual health identifier before that was made capable and live.  That was done in the public domain, with comments from the public, to try to ensure that we bring people on the same journey that we ourselves are on in that space.</p> <p>  As Ms Goff said in respect of the big-bang solution, the ten-year strategy and the ambition we have in that space, our rate-limiting factor on the delivery of technology in Ireland is probably not technologist, it actually relates to clinical capacity.  The Cork hospital example is a prime one, where 8,000 hours of training were needed in a hospital before a system could go live.  That cannot be fulfilled by putting IT staff into that place.  Business change is what drives efficiency and benefits from digital, and business change cannot be done to people.  It is clinical time that is most needed as opposed to IT staff.  That is one of the asks in the opening statement - to consider how, at some point, the digital health budget could also include capacity to do business change.  Currently, my budget does not allow me to spend money on business change.  It only allows me to spend money on technology.  I must then seek assistance from the system itself to spend its own clinical budget on business change and that makes it somewhat challenging sometimes to ensure that business change can happen.</p> <p>  On the question around leadership and how to keep it in place, we have built a strong team across eHealth Ireland.  Throughout the whole function, as small as it is, we have a team of passionate people who believe strongly in what they are trying to deliver.  There is the ability to move that team and flex it to reflect the Health Service Executive itself and how we change our structures and what we deliver.  Having 200 clinicians and a chief clinical information officer who is considered to be the deputy CIO is hugely important to me personally because that means that we are clinically led and have clinicians involved in where we are going.  We are striving to ensure we combat any issues around changes in leadership, changes in styles and changes in structures.  We have created a national structure in the past 18 months.  Previously, we had lots of local IT teams.  That also has been crucial in ensuring that we deliver a single vision for where we go.</p></speech>

We are trying to ensure there is not a single point of failure.</p></speech>

In the context of the solutions we have deployed thus far, we have made clear that we will not accept a single solution.  What we are looking for across Ireland - if it was possible to go back one slide in the presentation then there would be slide that would demonstrate this - is not a single system or solution.  It is actually about being able to have a set of solutions that come together to deliver that integrated electronic health record.  It has been important to learn from the experience in other countries in order to ensure that we can drive forward how we deliver those different solutions and put them in place.</p><p>That is a really big part of it.</p><p> The Deputy mentioned the public services card.  There are very early negotiations around the individual health identifier and health information could become part of that public services card.  That is very much a discussion between the Department of Health, the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I have been working very closely with the Government CIO to make sure the health information that could be part of that card can be driven forward and moved into that space as closely as possible.</p></speech>

We have phenomenal engagement from a clinical point of view out into our hospitals, community settings and GP user groups.  Probably the biggest part of the role today is trying to make sure that engagement is there.  We are trying to ensure that people understand the eHealth Ireland journey and the direction of travel.  One of the ways we have done this is by trying to pick projects that we can deliver each year, as well as the end goal.  Projects like epilepsy genomic sequencing, the bipolar project and those lighthouse projects were picked very much to invest time, effort, money and communications in order to engage different cohorts of people in how we can drive benefit to different patients.  The success has been phenomenal, and we would in particular call out the epilepsy area.  We believe Ireland is the first country in the world to start a genomic sequencing programme for epilepsy so that, by sequencing the genome of a child under the age of five, one can find out what is the right drug for that child.  There is no need to try lots of different drugs and we will no longer have 90 children under the age of five dying.  It is a huge programme of benefit and one that other countries can and will be able to learn from.</p></speech>

What we have put in place over the past 18 months is what we call the eHealth Ireland design authority.  This will be a function that has the final say on solutions that are deployed throughout the system to make sure the data models integrate and interact across the whole Irish health care system.  We have a data dictionary in place which captures all of the single data models and allows different systems to reference that.  We have put a lot of effort and work into trying to make sure our single data model can move forward.</p></speech>

I have two questions.  One relates to the issue of electronic referrals from GPs and the other relates to the savings identified by the lighthouse projects.  With regard to the electronic referrals by GPs, perhaps I got the information wrong, in which case the witnesses might correct me, but my understanding is the programme has been rolled out over the past 12 months and there is a 40% take-up.  The witnesses are predicting that by April of next year we will have reached the target of 100%.  I hope they are right but I want to ask what are the grounds for their confidence.  If it has gone from zero to 40% in that period, unless there is an increased take-up, we are looking at a percentage in the low 60s by April of next year.  I would imagine that, in a situation like this, there would probably be one third of GP practices that would take to it like a duck to water and buy in fairly quickly.  Once they were on board, however, it would begin to get tougher and, in the normal scheme of things, one would expect it to slow down somewhat.  There is also the age profile of GPs.  It is not the laptop generation.  I can think of GPs who I would imagine will be slow to move from paper to electronic referral.  My own doctor has an electronic referral system but that is not the case with other GPs I know.  On what is the idea based that we will be at 100% by April of next year?</p> <p>  The savings identified by the lighthouse projects are &euro;5 million next year on epilepsy and &euro;20 million over three years on the haemophilia sector.  I would like to hear a breakdown, not to the nearest euro but in broad percentage terms, as to where those savings are coming from.  I have listened to various points in the presentation and during the questions, so I can see mobile phones are one area for savings, given a lot of money was previously spent on phone calls.  There will be savings on drugs, as was indicated in regard to the genomic sequencing for epilepsy.  Is that part of the savings that are identified here?  What about labour costs?  I can imagine there will be a need for fewer people to do the work once the IT systems are in place but surely that would not be a saving to the health service in the sense that people are not being made redundant and they would be transferred to other work.  Is the HSE counting the fact they are working in other sectors as part of the savings?  How do the savings break down?</p></speech>

A lot has been asked and answered.  To bring it back to the practicalities of the delivery of health care in general, if we look at the various policies that have been outlined by the Department of Health, the HSE and various Governments, and probably by this committee in its final deliberations, without setting that it stone, primary care and community care will be where most health services are delivered in the years ahead.  This will be for many reasons, in particular cost efficiency, but it is also the obvious place to deliver health care as opposed to acute hospital settings.</p> <p>  To put it into a practical example, a public health nurse calls out to a patient in some part of the country, he or she makes an assessment of the patient and, given he or she may or may not be prescribing nurse, it may be necessary to refer back to the GP to prescribe.  The GP should then, in theory, be able to prescribe through electronic means to the pharmacy, and all of that should be centralised under the individual health identifier code.  The question is how far we are away from this happening.  I visited a GP practice recently where the staff have to put the mobile phones into a car and drive to the top of a hill to download messages before driving back to the surgery.  That is happening as we speak in rural parts of this country.  While we are trying to move to this model, do we have the infrastructure in place and has this been considered in terms of the ability to roll out e-health across the country?</p> <p>  To follow on from a question asked by Deputy Barry, there is the issue of the support and training that would be required.  While come clinicians are technologically advanced and want to embrace technology, others may be resistant or may not feel confident in engaging in that process.  The witnesses mentioned a figure of 40%.  In general, it is those who are interested who will step up to the plate first and it then gets harder and harder to encourage or, possibly, force people.  In that context, how much is being put aside in the HSE budget for training and support in moving people to e-health?</p> <p>  Reference was made to 47,000 new digital identities and 10,000 staff being given access to a digital device by December 2016.  Is that digital device an iPad or a tablet?  What type of device will they have access to?  With the continuous advances in technology, how flexible will contracts and tendering processes be in terms of ensuring we are not burdened with out-of-date equipment, given tendering processes can be very slow in this State?</p> <p>  How compatible will our system be with other jurisdictions?  For example, there is an EU directive whereby people can access treatment abroad if it is not provided for in this State.  This is one area where I wonder whether information can be transferred electronically to clinicians in other jurisdictions who are taking on an Irish patient.</p><p>On the issue of collating data, the Scottish did a lot of analysis of prescribing by individual GPs and GP practices.  Would e-health make that more efficient or do we already have systems in place to do that?</p></speech>

Over the year that we have moved from 0% to 40% of GPs, we have moved from no hospitals to all hospitals being able to receive an electronic referral.  Obviously the rate limiting factor in being able to send an electronic referral is that the hospital needs to be able to receive it at the other end.  The Deputy's point is absolutely valid that there are practices out there that are not digital today, but it is only around 3% of practices.  The electronic referral solution that has been deployed is agnostic of the GP system that is already deployed.  It is a web-based solution that GPs can access easily.  It has been built to make the process as simple as possible and to illustrate the efficiencies and savings to the GP practice of using it.  The target we have set ourselves, not just in new referrals but in a number of places, are stretch targets.  We are setting these targets to allow the team to have room to stretch and believe it in terms of where we can get to with e-referrals and other subjects.  That is why we have said 100% of practices by April of next year delivering electronic referrals.  That is direction we are taking in that space.</p> <p>  The issue of savings, specifically with regard to epilepsy and haemophilia, was raised.  The savings relating to epilepsy that were called out at around &euro;5 million are based on the fact that if we could sequence the genome of everybody with suspected epilepsy, we would know the type of drug with which to treat them.  Last year we spent &euro;5 million on drugs while trying to find out which was the right one for treating patients with suspected epilepsy.  That is where the &euro;5 million in savings comes from.  If we spend money on sequencing the genome, we know the right drug to use straight away and, therefore, we save that &euro;5 million.  The money that was suggested around haemophilia arises from savings around the supply chain management.  If we do not have a supply chain solution that is deployed to the patient then we do not know whether the patient has received all of the treatment he or she needs or whether the patient has had a bleed.  Therefore, we are constantly sending the treatment to their fridge in order that they have it on board.  The Irish Haemophilia Society did some work in the past two years to try to understand how an early version of that solution was saving money and that is where those figures came from.  They are very specifically savings related to drug wastage, with drugs being stockpiled in patients' homes, as opposed to any of the other additional savings that are in that space.</p> <p>  Reference was made to primary and community care and how we get GPs involved and move it forward.  Our work with the GP systems suppliers of Ireland, of which there are two main players, has been forthcoming in terms of how they adopt the individual health identifier, IHI, and put the electronic referral and e-pharmacy solutions into their systems.  We believe the relationship is in a good place with those systems and with those people and will drive forward a change in that marketplace.  The fact that Ireland only has two organisations to engage with to drive forward changes in those systems is phenomenally useful for us because we can build relationships and standards and have the design authority to put those systems in place.  It enables us to drive forward how we extend the functionality that is available in GP systems out into the community.</p> <p>  One of the four pillars of the electronic health record, EHR, is to deliver EHR functionality into the community.  We believe community is an easier place than an acute hospital to deploy the EHR because currently there is no digital solution there.  Therefore, once the business case is approved, we will focus on having an early win in the community around the EHR.</p></speech>

It means enough additional devices in primary care and community settings to allow people to have access to a device.  The days of queuing up to use an Excel spreadsheet on one machine in one community centre needs to end.  We need to have more machines in more places in order that people can have access to that kit.  It does not necessarily mean a piece of kit for every single person that is in the system.  Predominantly, they would not use a single piece of kit each if it were deployed into the system.  That has been seen across many jurisdictions.  The aim is to improve the access to the systems that are there.</p> <p>  If one looks at the maternity and newborn system in Cork and Kerry, for example, we are rolling out a large number of new devices called computers-on-wheels in order that there are touch screens on wards, enabling people to access information as they pass by rather than being expected to carry their own device with them.  That is a really big and important part of where we are going in that space.</p> <p>  On the issue of flexibility around contracts, the HSE works with the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, OGCIO and the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, to make sure there are frameworks in place that do not lock us in to old equipment and to ensure we can continue to move forward.  Things like mobile devices are in a good place in terms of the refresh rate, particularly in the past three years.</p> <p>  Compatibility with other jurisdictions is something that is very much EU-driven to allow the transfer of information.  The IHI uses the same format as the NHS number which will give us the ability in the future to identify our patient information uniquely as if it were being shared with Northern Ireland or with the NHS.  Behind the IHI is a code called the GS1, which is a global standard number that allows the number to identify a patient uniquely across the EU.  The IHI has been built with exactly that in mind, which is very important.</p> <p>  The Deputy's last comments centred on collaboration and data analysis.  Data analysis cannot be done easily today but with e-health Ireland in place, we will be able to conduct data analysis where it is appropriate, anonymised and where information is available.  That is a key hook in terms of where we are going.</p></speech>

Has the HSE with the Revenue Commissioners, given the success of their systems?  Is it likely that patients will be able to get access to information like the length of waiting lists?  That would be very helpful in the sense that if one consultant has an 18-month waiting list while another one has a six-month list, patients could choose to be referred to the latter consultant.  However, I know that this has been resisted traditionally by consultants.  Has any progress been made on that?</p></speech>

The organisations with which Revenue worked actually helped us to create our knowledge and information plan and the operating model.  We shared an awful lot of learning across those different areas.</p> <p>  Patients having access to waiting list information and information on referrals is digitally possible because of the e-referrals solution.  It is a policy decision as to whether we open up that information, but digitally and technically it is absolutely possible to do so.</p></speech>

I hope they found it useful.  We are trying to ensure everybody has access to all the information they need on the action plan which will be a feature of the lifetime of this Government.  The more people who know the detail of what we propose, costing, numbers and timescales for different targets, the better for everybody.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for inviting me here today to address it on the cross-Government action plan for housing and homelessness, Rebuilding Ireland, and look forward to our discussion.  The informal meeting last week was very useful.  I hope we can continue that level of engagement within the formal committee setting.</p> <p>  I would like first to introduce the officials accompanying me here today: Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General; Mr. David Walsh, assistant secretary for planning, housing market policy and land management division; Ms Mary Hurley, assistant secretary in charge of the housing programme delivery division, which is very important in the context of this plan; Mr. Brian Kennedy, principal officer for homelessness and housing inclusion supports; Ms Nina Murray, principal officer for housing assistance payment and current programmes; Mr. Terry Sheridan, principal officer in charge of planning policy and very much behind the complexity of the new legislation; and Mr. Barry Quinlan, principal officer over housing market policy and land management.</p><p>This afternoon I want to take the opportunity to outline the Government's approach to housing under Rebuilding Ireland, which I believe marks the commencement of a new partnership approach with key stakeholders to deliver the required actions and solutions to address the housing crisis.  The Government's approach to housing, and mine, can be summarised as follows.  We developed Rebuilding Ireland through a meaningful consultation which adds real value to the overall policy.  We are absolutely focused on delivery through measurable and time-bound actions.  We want to deliver outcomes for all households the State can help.  We need to help, either directly or indirectly, to put a roof over people's heads, help them live in attractive sustainable communities and, of course, put infrastructure around those who need support while finding a home for themselves.<br/><br/>Importantly, the report of the special Oireachtas Committee on Housing and Homelessness has helped to inform the final action plan.  This process added to our understanding of the housing system and it is my intention that a consultation will remain a cornerstone of Rebuilding Ireland throughout its implementation.  In this regard, I am visiting local authorities around the country in a series of events targeting implementation of Rebuilding Ireland on the ground.  Local authorities are a hugely important part of delivery, particularly of the social housing build programme.  Next stop is Waterford tomorrow, where, hopefully, we will be able to focus on housing, although we will have to wait and see.<br/><br/>This committee has a key role to play in terms of the implementation and monitoring of Rebuilding Ireland, not least in terms of the legislative requirements needed to make key elements of the plan come to fruition.  My hope is that we can come to an agreement as to how we effectively manage the pre-legislative scrutiny stage in order to get priority legislation debated through the normal stages in the Houses and passed without any unnecessary delay.  I am sure everybody in this committee room wants to avoid any recurrence of what happened in Tyrellstown, for example.  Likewise, we all want to strengthen the RTB.  However, we need to put legislation in place as a matter of urgency to ensure a number of these early actions happen.  Without stifling the deliberative process, I sincerely believe we can streamline how we do business, the result of which can only have a positive impact for citizens.  I look forward to hearing the views of committee members today and their ongoing and future co-operation in fast-tracking, from a legislative point of view, the various stages we need to go through, while at the same time giving serious and robust consideration to all proposals.<br/><br/>As we all know, we are currently facing a national housing crisis.  Since 2009, persistent under-supply, especially in Dublin, has meant the housing supply deficit is currently likely to exceed 50,000 homes.  Given that we built just over 12,500 units last year, the first step is to move from current levels towards accepted long-term demand requirements of at least 25,000 housing units <i>per annum</i>as quickly as possible.  That is the target in the plan.  To be honest, I believe we need to go well beyond that - up to 35,000 units - to keep pace with a growing population and a growing economy.  What has concerned me most in developing this plan is the knock-on impact caused by a growing supply gap.  The effects are felt by both buyers and renters and affect the most vulnerable in society the hardest.<br/><br/>Of course, promoting housing growth has advantages beyond the obvious social and economic benefits.  Almost 137,000 people are employed in the construction sector, an 8.7% increase year on year.  While this part of our economic activity had diminished in recent years, we are thankfully now seeing this trend turning around.  I am also confident that those who had to emigrate will be encouraged home once we get building on the scale envisaged under this plan, whether that is social housing or private housing.<br/><br/>In drafting Rebuilding Ireland, we analysed each element of housing and came up with key actions to help repair what is broken or not recovering at the pace it needs to.  It was through this analysis that we arrived at five key pillars to try to bring clarity to the multitude of different actions that needed to be taken.  The first pillar, which I also think reflects the priority, addresses homelessness, the second is accelerating social housing delivery, the third is building more homes for the wider housing market, the fourth is improving the rental sector, which needs quite a lot more work between now and the end of the year, and the fifth is making the best use of houses that are vacant.  There are some 260,000 vacant housing units across the country, 60,000 of which are holiday homes, which leaves 200,000 other units.  Many are in parts of the country where there is not a strong demand for homes but there are certainly thousands in parts of the country that have huge housing demand, in particular Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway and other urban centres.  The plan sets ambitious targets to deal comprehensively with homelessness, double the annual level of residential construction to 25,000 homes, deliver 47,000 units of social housing with an investment of &euro;5.35 billion, make the best use of the existing stock and create the right conditions for a much more vibrant and responsive rental sector.<br/><br/>I have a long speaking note to read but I suspect members may wish to ask questions and get under the skin of some of the issues.  My speaking note deals with each pillar, one after the other.  I am in the hands of the committee.  We can take it pillar by pillar.  One of the things I would like to deal with, if members agree, is the legislation we are hoping to introduce in the next couple of weeks.  Without that legislation, we cannot do some of the fundamental things we are looking to do.  I mentioned this last week when we were discussing this issue.  It would be very helpful to me, for lots of reasons, if we could agree to progress the legislation.  There are only six actions that are being progressed but if the committee insists on a formal pre-legislative scrutiny stage, that will add about six weeks to the overall enactment process for the legislation.  Hopefully, by giving people very full briefings in regard to the legislation, we can effectively have an informal pre-legislative scrutiny process.  I will certainly give members everything I have once I have it cleared at Cabinet.  Hopefully, we can then deal with it through the various stages.  I will happily accept amendments on Committee Stage and Report Stage if they make sense.  However, I believe there is an urgency with this legislation if we want to get the construction sector moving at a pace that I think is possible if we enact a lot of things at the same time in parallel.  I mentioned this last week and I would like to take time at a later stage to address this particular issue.  However, I am sure members will want to go through the pillars first.</p></speech>

There is no great mystery to most of this stuff.  It is about streamlining the planning process, extensions of planning in certain circumstances, protecting tenants in terms of security of tenure when there is a sales process in a development and beefing up the RTB in certain areas to get decisions out faster.  These are all practical things that have come up in the discussion of the plan.  The legislation is a relatively small part.  There are 80 actions in the plan and the legislation probably only addresses five or six of them.  However, it is still important we get them moving, particularly the planning one.  I want to talk to the committee about how we can maintain integrity in the planning system while, at the same time, getting decisions faster.  That is the key issue we are looking to change in legislation.</p></speech>

However, when we are given the draft Bills, particularly the planning ones relating to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and Part 8, any research the Department has that outlines the rationale behind the particular changes the Minister is proposing would be very welcome.  Some of us are not yet convinced of the need to streamline Part 8, for example, but if the Minister can demonstrate that there is a problem across the State with Part 8 applications taking longer than the eight weeks they are supposed to take, we would benefit from that research being made available.</p></speech>

It is not a problem.  In fact, what we are doing on Part 8 is not very radical.  It is really about trying to get decisions two weeks earlier.  It imposes a stopgap, in that it forces a decision.  Part of the problem with Part 8 is that further information is requested repeatedly to try and create more time for consideration, because there might be political issues that cannot be resolved or whatever.  What we are trying to do in the planning system generally, be it Part 8 or applications in general, is to force some timelines so we can get decisions, be they approvals or rejections, and to ensure we have a system that makes decisions.</p> <p>  Another aspect to the changes we are making is that there is a three year sunset clause here.  What we are seeking to do is change the system for three years, so we can get significant numbers of new starts up and running and get the planning permissions to get that moving, while at the same time ensuring that the right decisions are made.  We spent quite some time with An Bord Plean&aacute;la on that to ensure that it can do it.  However, I cannot stand for having indefinite delays over and over again on planning decisions because of other issues or distractions that might be localised or whatever.  There is too serious a deficit in housing supply for us not to force decisions through the system.  This is about making sure we have a robust and good decision making process that makes the right decisions.</p></speech>

I am giving the committee, which is very unusual, a quite detailed briefing note on what will be in the legislation, to ensure I am not doing anything that is inappropriate.  I have to get it through the Government.  We plan to bring it to the Government in two weeks' time.  There are issues that must be followed through, tested, effectively peer reviewed and so forth to ensure that the legislation will work, because it involves change.  We anticipate that we will bring the heads of the legislation to Cabinet two weeks hence and the legislation itself the week after that with a view to bringing it to the House on Second Stage subsequently.  There is a decent lead-in here.  I am not trying to bounce anybody into anything.  We must draft it and it must be approved by the Office of the Attorney General.  We have legal draftspeople in the Department who have put it together.  We must now ensure that it is tested in the Attorney General's office and so forth.</p></speech>

There is no problem with that.  I am asking that we would not have a formal pre-legislative scrutiny stage which often involves the committee inviting experts, witnesses and so forth and delays the process by at least six weeks, perhaps more.  Incidentally, we will be doing that with many other legislative measures.  We are hoping to bring through a great deal of legislation before the end of the year and some of it will involve pre-legislative scrutiny.  We have a large foreshore legislative measure, for example.  On this measure, because there is an urgency attached to it and there is an expectation built up around it where most people have accepted that what we are doing makes sense in principle, it would be helpful if we could move through the process quickly.  However, everybody must make up their own mind.  I will not tell people how they should respond.</p></speech>

On the broader rental market, we have said we will have new initiatives relating to the broader rental sector before the end of the year.  These will try to balance the need to continue to incentivise investment in rental property from a landlord and developer perspective and the need to deal with issues such as security of tenure, more predictability on rent, prices and so forth.  We will do that and we will be back before the committee in that regard.  However, we cannot do everything immediately.  My job as Minister was to produce a strong foundation in terms of policy and budgets to try to make a considerable impact on a crisis situation in housing within 100 days.  We did that before the summer, which was 74 days.  I said at the time that we did not have enough time for the consultation required to get the balance right on the rental market and that we would take more time to do that.  It was the right thing to do.  Some of the issues the Deputy is raising are perfectly valid and require debate, but that does not mean we should delay on what has already been proposed and decided and can make an impact in various areas.</p> <p>  I am not pretending we have all of the solutions here.

Long-term hotel accommodation for families is not acceptable and we need to end it.  We will treble the rapid-build programme to 1,500 homes, 200 of which will be delivered by the end of this year.  In the meantime, we will ensure that services for families, particularly children, in hotels and other emergency accommodation are far better and adapted to ensure that we look after the needs of families.</p> <p>  The other side of homelessness is rough sleeping, which is often compounded by and tied in with mental health and addiction issues, family breakdown and so on.  This is a complex area that really requires close co-operation with both the Department of Health and the HSE.  For that reason, we are trebling the funding for mental health and primary care services for homeless persons, from &euro;2 million to &euro;6 million, in budget 2017.</p> <p>  In examining the social failing that is homelessness, one point made to me repeatedly was that prevention obviously is far better than cure.  We are therefore targeting families and individuals worried about or at risk of homelessness with a new awareness campaign.  For the families and individuals in mortgage arrears, we are providing more and better services, including free expert legal and financial advice and supports.  I particularly acknowledge the support I have received from other ministerial colleagues in this area.</p> <p>  In addition to the series of local events on Rebuilding Ireland, there will also be a series of pillar-specific national launch events.  The first of these will deal with pillar 1 and is scheduled to take place tomorrow week, 22 September, in Dublin.</p> <p>  For the information of members, particularly those from Dublin, at present we are assessing our level of preparedness for rough sleeping demand for the oncoming winter.  There is clearly a need for more emergency beds and we are assessing properties to ensure that we can accommodate that extra need.  Obviously, there is a lot of detailed consultation going on with all of the different stakeholders, from Dublin City Council to the many others that are providing and trying to co-ordinate services.  Some members have been involved in that.  We are looking to put practical measures in place that can ensure that through the winter those who need emergency hostel accommodation can get it.  I can provide details as we finalise numbers on that and the locations as to where we might be able to add capacity for those who will otherwise be rough sleeping.</p></speech>

On the one-stop shop that Mr. Brian Kenny is overseeing, one of the concerns I have on the basis of the information we were given at the previous meeting is there would be, if I understand it correctly, a facility, probably in Dublin city centre, where family presenters could go to be assessed as to whether they have an emergency accommodation need and the attempt at that point would be to provide interventions to keep them in their homes.  One of the concerns is that there is still a problem which I raised previously with the Minister of family presenters at local authorities who have been put out from the extended family home due to overcrowding, relationship breakdown and family stress, and those persons, because they are not able to provide any independent documentary evidence of their need for emergency accommodation, such as a notice to quit, are being turned away.  I thought, from earlier discussions, that this facility would be an assessment facility to determine genuine cases of persons with a real need for emergency accommodation.  It sounds more like a mechanism to return such persons to the family home, where, by and large, when they are presenting as homeless, that relationship has broken down and they need some alternative arrangement.  I have some concerns with the way that is presented and I would like the Minister to reflect on that and maybe respond.</p> <p>  At our last meeting I raised the issue of the low number of Housing First tenancies being proposed, which was 300, up from 100, and the official who responded stated that only a small number of the homeless individuals had the level of complex needs that requires Housing First.  I would not say it is 300.  On the basis of the research that is out there, I would say it is far more than 1,000.  The target of 300 is far too small.  Housing First works.  It is proven to work.  There is a need for the Department to be much more ambitious in terms of the numbers based on research from the Housing Agency and elsewhere.</p> <p>  I asked at the previous meeting for the Housing Agency's report on the 50% priority allocation of local authority housing to homeless people.  We got it and I thank the Minister for that.  I am concerned by the report.  It is rare that I would criticise the Housing Agency, but nowhere in the report does it provide evidence to support its conclusions.  When one reads the report, it tells one that even though the ministerial directive was introduced in January 2015, the Dublin local authorities were already beginning to increase the amount of allocations to those on the homeless list.  These amounted to 5.8% of allocations in 2013.  By 2014, they amounted to 15% of them.  However, the report refers to a concern about clusters of vulnerable people arising from the 50%, and nowhere is there evidence to suggest that this has happened.  In South Dublin County Council that has not happened because of the allocation decisions of the officials.  The report states that this is a problem and this is one of the reasons it recommended the ending of the directive, but it does not provide any evidence for that.</p> <p>  The report also talks about creating perverse incentives whereby people think they can get a local authority allocation quicker if they present as homeless, but there is no evidence of this.  While it states - it is a kind of assumption - that people may think that, it is not documented in the report.</p> <p>  On the basis of the 2015 figures, 28.6% of all allocations in the Dublin region went to persons who were homeless.  By ending the 50% priority allocation, the logic is that this will fall back to the 2014 level, which was 15%, or even back to the 2013 level.  This was a really big decision - I presume by the Minister's predecessor - to end the 50% priority allocation.  It is politically unpopular.  Local councillors will tell one it causes significant difficulties.  Given that there is an ever-increasing number of family presenters, the Minister needs to revisit this, either by asking for further research from the Housing Agency to track what happens with the allocations to those in emergency accommodation, or by asking for the evidence, if any, of vulnerable clusters and perverse incentives, because it is merely guesswork if there is no data.  The difficulty is that either somebody is a priority case and is prioritised, or he or she is not such a case and is not prioritised.  This is one of those areas that needs to be re-examined.</p> <p>  I have two quick questions.  The mortgage-to-rent scheme is broken.  It simply does not work.  The numbers speak for themselves.  I would be interested to hear what is the plan other than to review it.</p> <p>  On mortgage distress, there is a significant difference between what is detailed in this section of the plan and what is in the programme for Government in terms of the new model for dealing with mortgage distress.  That is not the Minister's primary departmental responsibility, but are we to take it from this document that the Government has shifted from what is in the programme for Government, or are those programme for Government commitments in terms of the broader programme for dealing with mortgage distress, including the independent court and so on, still Government commitments and will they be implemented?  If so, does the Minister know when?</p></speech>

In the short time between this proposal and the completion of the units, it has not proven to be the silver bullet promised.  We were told they would cost in the region of &euro;100,000 per unit, but the actual cost in Ballymun is &euro;240,000.</p><p>We were told they would be provided quickly, once construction commenced.  They are taking six months to provide.  They are no different from conventional build.  Regarding cost, time and numbers, what improvements does the Minister envisage or are provided for that will ensure they can have the desired effect originally intended, which has not proven to be the case to date?</p><p> Second, with regard to the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme and the reliance on that in the policy plan, as we all know, there is a fundamental design flaw with HAP.  It forces families to make a perverse choice about whether to be immediately housed in temporary rental accommodation or hold out in the hope of a permanent home.  The fact that they come off the waiting list again forces them to make a decision they should not be faced with, and we should not be in a position whereby we are putting this scheme up in lights, so to speak, and suggesting it will improve the position for many people, which it does not and cannot.</p><p> Regarding the supports for families, and particularly for children, the action plan lists a number of proposals that provide new supports for children.  In particular, for the first time it suggests the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla can have a critical role to play in providing co-ordinated supports for the approximately 2,350 children in emergency accommodation as of July 2016.  However, it would appear there is very little substance to such proposals.  Tusla has no statutory requirements or responsibilities to co-ordinate welfare services for children and families in emergency accommodation.  Is it the case that the Minister will put in place in-reach plans to allow it to co-ordinate and integrate all social services for vulnerable families in terms of managing them and reducing the risk of a period of homelessness, which has the potential to have a long-term damaging effect on a child's upbringing and further development.</p><p> A previous speaker alluded to Housing First and long-term homelessness.  The Minister set out an ambitious target, which we welcome, support and hope to see realised, to triple Housing First tenancies in Dublin, for example, from 100 to 300 by 2017.  It states that this will require co-operation of the Health Service Executive and increases in budget allocation, especially in the HSE service plan for 2017.  Can the Minister inform the committee how much funding will be required specifically because the HSE budget for homelessness has been cut by 20% since 2012 and the drugs initiative budget has been cut by 37% in the past six years?  What increases in HSE funding will be required for the Minister to meet the targets contained in this plan?</p><p> Regarding emergency shelters, the ambition in the plan is to greatly increase capacity in emergency shelters but there is nothing in the report on whether there will be new investment in emergency shelters or whether, as expected, new beds will come from better bed management, such as the Housing First initiative.  Those are some questions on the first pillar.</p></speech>

It is not easy to get good quality accommodation that can be altered and prepared for people.  Last night I visited Br&uacute; Aimsir, about which Deputy &Oacute; Broin has raised issues with me previously.  It is an impressive hostel facility for people who are homeless.  It accommodates over 100 people - 21 women and 80 men - and works very well.  There is plenty of space and the accommodation is good quality.  People are not in each other's faces.  There are individual cubicles that accommodate about three people per room.  There is a very good management system at the facility.  There are approximately six people working and another 15 or so volunteers in the caf&eacute;, doing other activities and so on.  We can compare that to some of the other emergency accommodation facilities that are much more confined, with beds alongside each other in much higher numbers and so on.  We are trying to add to capacity but we are trying to learn from best practice as well.  We are looking at a number of buildings that we hope will be suitable so that we can add the numbers we need.  In response to Deputy Cowen's question, we are seeking more sheltered accommodation.</p> <p>  In the long term, we want to move away from the provision of more emergency beds.  We need a streamlined transition so that people only have to stay in emergency accommodation for short periods - a Housing First model for many of them that they can move on through or other social housing solutions because many people who are homeless now do not necessarily need the complex supports some others require.  Approximately 60% of the clients in Br&uacute; Aimsir, for example, have addiction issues, so that requires other supports and services.</p> <p>  Regarding the extra supports from the HSE, one of the reasons we have got agreement for next year - moving from &euro;2 million to &euro;6 million - is because we need more from the HSE in terms of such supports, whether it be through Housing First or in the form of supports within hostels.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has been clear with me that as long as we plan for it, we will provide the funding needed to provide basic health care for people in vulnerable positions.  There will be projects and new facilities in Dublin that will be controversial, particularly around addiction and trying to manage that in a more structured way.  Often, there is a lot of resistance to that, whether it is needle exchange programmes, step-down facilities, detox facilities and so on, but we have to do it.  The Deputy will find me supporting organisations that are trying to take a more ambitious approach towards that type of assistance.  I believe the HSE will support us as well in terms of funding.</p> <p>  It is probably a fair comment that while there is a good deal of aspirational talk around family supports, there is neither an itemised budget nor a response plan.  I hope the Deputy will get some of that information next week.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, will be part of the official launch of the first pillar on homelessness next week.  She has been greatly interested and responsive to anything we have requested from her.  There are some definitive commitments, for example, all children of families in hotels will be given a free transport pass to move through Dublin on buses, the Luas or whatever.  The Minister has given a commitment on nutrition plans for families, supports regarding education and so on.  For a child doing his or her homework at the end of a bed in a hotel room, with all the other pressures in terms of confinement and so on, supports are needed in those circumstances, particularly for families under pressure and suffering stress, in addition to the fact that they are homeless.  I will ask the Minister to outline what Tusla intends to do, but there are many commitments in principle and some specific commitments on which we will build.</p> <p>  I would be much more supportive of HAP than some people in this room.  The numbers do not lie.  We have already met our HAP targets for Dublin for this year, and there are still some months to go.  Some people who might not want a council house want the flexibility of the HAP in terms of temporary rental accommodation.  There are many people who would much rather the certainty of a social house or a council house.  That is fine, but to say they are off the list once they are accommodated through HAP is not strictly true either because they go onto the transfer list.</p><p>Like everybody else, they will not be disadvantaged on the transfer list.  We had a conversation about this last week.  They are not disadvantaged on the transfer list by being a HAP tenant.  They are accommodated through a rental solution rather than an allocation solution.</p></speech>

We simply do not have the social housing stock to accommodate everybody's needs.  The question is whether we continue to try to accommodate the people who cannot get accommodated by allocation through rent supplement or whether we try to put something in place with a bit more certainty that is more effective than rent supplement.  In HAP that is what we have been doing.  That is what I have been doing.  I am looking across at Senator Paudie Coffey who was very involved in designing HAP.  From my experience of speaking to people on HAP, they no longer have to deal directly with landlords because the local authority does that for them.  If they are lucky enough to get a job and increase their income, they can manage their transition out of HAP over time.  It has much more flexibility and more certainty than rent supplement has.  It is not perfect, perhaps, for many people, but it is a housing solution that makes sense in the current environment.  Certainly, the transition over time on to HAP of people currently on rent supplement makes a lot of sense.  I take the point that there are many people who only want to be allocated a council house or a social house and they have to make do with HAP for the moment.  Until we start building, acquiring and leasing long-term large numbers of social houses, we will have to deal with the realities of where we are rather than trying to create a perfect solution for everybody.  We need to be upfront about that.</p> <p>  The other thing we should say is that 120 people have already been transferred to social housing from HAP.  It has only been available since 2014.  It is not like one never gets a transfer.  There have already been 120 of them.</p> <p>  I take the Deputy's point on rapid build and silver bullets.  These clearly are not a silver bullet.  The 1,500 houses on rapid build will be prioritised for homeless families and will help us make the transition for those families into permanent sustainable housing solutions.  They are a hell of a lot better than a hotel room or bed and breakfast accommodation.  I share some of the frustration over the 22 units in Ballymun.  It was a pilot project and there were some mistakes made but there were also some really good lessons learnt from it.</p></speech>

What lessons have been learned?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-14a.547" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2016091400002#G01100"><p>There are a number of things.  Procurement needs to happen a lot more quickly.  We now have an Office of Government Procurement national framework which is close to being finalised.  It has attracted a lot of interest from developers who have the capacity to build with rapid build methods and technology.  There will be a central database of approved builders that any local authority can access in order that they will not have to go through a lengthy procurement process.</p> <p>  On the issue of sites and trying to manage communities that live in close proximity, there was huge resistance from the local community in Ballymun.  Some of that has now dissipated and people realise that these houses look more or less the same as every other house but they are just built a bit faster.  The truth is that building something in 12 weeks as opposed to six months takes some time off it but the other factors around decision-making, sign-off, funding, and procurement are the real delay factors in property.  We have a number of local authorities under a lot of pressure to deliver on the target that we have set of 200 houses by the end of the year.  Some of these sites are moving at the moment and some are about to get moving, but to have 200 houses built - we have none at the moment - by the end of December is a big ask.  To have another 800 built by the following June or July and the remainder of the 1,500 that we have set as a target by the end of next year forces the pace all the time.  In parallel with that there will be a lot of conventional build of social housing as well.</p> <p>  In my home city, last year in total there were 74 social houses built by local authorities.  There were many social houses acquired and vacant properties brought back into use but in terms of new build there was 74.  That is the figure in my head anyway.  In Cork city alone we will have within the next five to six months 400 social houses under construction on 13 different sites across the city.  That is a relatively small segment when one takes the whole country.  That is the level of increase we are talking about.  It is hoped we will see many more than that in Dublin.  We are trying to get things moving here with a real focus on delivering volume and numbers with decent quality in the right places.  Part of that solution is rapid build.</p> <p>  As far as I and the Government are concerned, the programme for Government commitments stand on trying to keep people in their homes.  We have added a bit of detail and some new thinking in this plan that we think we can bring to it in terms of more supports and so on.  I think one will find other initiatives happening before the end of the year that are outside the programme for Government.  I have had a number of people come to me with new ideas and ways of, for example, making mortgage-to-rent work more effectively than it has in the past.  Mortgage-to-rent is not the disaster that some people say it is.  If one looks at local authority mortgage-to-rent figures, there are actually significant numbers.  Where it has been far less successful than was expected is in the private market with people who are having homes potentially repossessed by a bank.  Getting those people into a structured mortgage-to-rent scheme run by an approved housing body has proven not to be the success that many thought it would be.  That does not mean we should not try to find a way of making it successful.  To be clear on the numbers, 162 families have completed mortgage-to-rent and remain in their homes.  Some 675 active cases are in the process and there will be a review by the end of the year to try to make the appropriate changes that can streamline and improve the outcomes there.</p> <p>  In terms of homeless HAP, I would make a distinction between HAP generally and homeless HAP in Dublin, which has been very successful.  There have been 500 tenancies put in place under homeless HAP in Dublin so far this year, which is quite a significant number when one considers the number of homeless people.  It is not enough but it is still quite a significant figure.</p> <p>  In terms of the 50% private allocations, it would be wrong to say that I agonised over it but I have been trying to make the right decision on this issue.  The only report that was done that actually looked at it in any detail was from the Housing Agency.  My experience of the Housing Agency is that it is pretty good at what it does.  It genuinely cares about housing people and working with local authorities and so on.  It made a recommendation.  The previous Minister acted on the recommendation and I did not change it.  That is the truth of what happened.  I will not start running away from it and blaming the previous Minister.  To be fair, we are requiring local authorities, particularly in Dublin, to prioritise homeless people and homeless families in terms of allocations.  Whether we publicly set a 50% figure and whether there are implications of that which create pull factors or perverse incentives, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin described it, I am not sure, which is why I have simply taken the advice of a body in which I have quite a lot of trust.  Either way, we need to make sure that a significant percentage of the available properties coming on stream in terms of social housing are prioritising homeless people.</p><p> A fair question was asked about central co-ordination and assessment.  How do we fairly, consistently and with the necessary compassion and support assess a family who declare themselves homeless?  How do we ensure someone is not looking to try to access social housing faster because they are frustrated with the process or whatever?  We have to trust the judgment of people who are making those assessments.  There is virtually no way of setting hard and fast rules that can determine every case that comes in the door.  We need to ensure we have experienced and qualified people who are assessing the needs of many vulnerable people in stressful and difficult circumstances.  This will help in deciding on the best outcomes.  I am unsure whether it is a good thing for a Minister to become overly prescriptive in terms of how that must work.  I will gladly talk to the committee about it and hear any suggestions from committee members on the matter.  However, for the most part, from what I am hearing, the right decisions are being made in allocating a new house, an emergency space or a hotel room to a family.  The same apples in working with families or individuals who may be able to go home with some mediation and support.  Others may have an addiction issue that can be dealt with, managed and contained within the confines of their own homes.</p><p> When we have as many people homeless as we have and as many people as there are looking for emergency accommodation and Housing First units, we have to try to prioritise and keep people in their own homes, where possible.  That is what we have been talking about.  This is a very practical and sensible way of responding.  The truth is that for a considerable percentage of the people who find themselves homeless, it is often as a result of family break-up or tension in the home that has resulted in someone having to leave.  Obviously, if it involves a domestic abuse case, we do not want to force someone back into that circumstance.  However, if it is a misunderstanding or a breakdown of communication and we can intervene to try to ensure a person can go home, then I think we have obligation to try to do that to take the pressure off the system.</p><p> Someone said the figure of 300 Housing First units was not enough.  That is true, but I would say it is a significant improvement on 100.  The reality is we need to go beyond some of the targets we have, but we have to start somewhere.  My view on Housing First is that the more houses we make available for the model, the more it will become the norm as opposed to being seen as a pilot project in certain areas.  People will see the outcomes and the significant improvement in results that ensure people do not relapse into homelessness and so on.  Let us get to 300 and then have the conversation about whether we can push on to 400, 500 and so on.  The committee will not find me opposing that when we get there, but we have a job to get to 300 first.  It involves budgets, management and co-ordination across various agencies and Departments and so on.</p></speech>

We are still only on pillar 1 and we are well into the meeting.  I am not trying to limit anyone from asking questions, but with the agreement of the committee we might stick to questions rather than stories, if that is agreeable.  There may be a divergence from that in some cases and that is fine.  Deputy Casey is next.</p></speech>

We mentioned the question of Airbnb at the start of the meeting before the Minister came in.  We have agreed to meet a delegation from Airbnb in the near future.  However, this was not discussed at the special committee on housing.  This is a solution to the crisis and I think it needs to be considered.  It is disappointing that we are housing families and homeless people in hotels, yet we are facilitating domestic, foreign and business tourism in homes and houses.  Within 1 km of this building tonight there are probably in excess of 200 units available, whether homes or apartments.  I am not talking about bed-share, I am talking about apartments and homes.  We need to look at the Airbnb phenomenon that has taken off.  A number of cities throughout Europe have already banned Airbnb for apartments and homes.  We need to look at this because it is an immediate solution to the homeless crisis.</p> <p>  Reference has been made to rapid build.  I believe we are doing rapid build technology an injustice.  It is being perceived as an inferior home.  In fact I believe modern technology and methods of building have to be enhanced and further engaged in.  In rural areas we are beginning to use rapid technologies to build houses.  I am unsure whether it was red tape or bureaucracy that held this up, but I do not think the physical construction of houses was the cause of the delay.</p> <p>  At the committee last week we heard how rapid build only had a lifespan of 60 years.  In fairness, let us consider what is required for a house that was built in the 1960s or 1970s to get the energy efficiency required for an A+ rating not to mention the ongoing efficiencies from a new build.  It would probably be cheaper to knock that house and rebuild it rather than try to refurbish it.  We are doing an injustice to rapid build technologies.  The perception is that it is an inferior home, but it is not.  I think we will depend more and more on rapid technologies as we move forward to deal with this crisis.  Anything that is manufactured in a controlled environment under scrutiny will probably have a better long-term result than materials from on site.</p></speech>

The first relates to the local authorities.  I am glad the Minister has commented on the part they play.  My issue is that most people are becoming homeless because of the criteria from the Department.  I will set out some examples.  This needs to be looked at.  Let us consider my area of Carlow and what is needed to qualify to go on the local authority housing list.  If a person earns more than &euro;27,500, he or she does not go on the housing list.  Our neighbouring counties have eligibility limits of &euro;32,000 and &euro;33,000.  We now have a predicament.  People are coming to us who do not meet the criteria for the local authority housing list.  They are falling out of the loop.  I then bring them for a mortgage because, as we know, to qualify for a local authority mortgage, a person has to get refusal from a bank and a building society.  They do not qualify for that because they are not earning enough.  Now we have a situation where a local authority is making people homeless.  These people do not qualify for the local authority housing list because they are barely over the criteria and there is no hardship clause.  I spoke to a couple recently who earn &euro;28,500.  They did not qualify to go on the list because they were &euro;1,000 over and they did not get a mortgage.  This is making people homeless.  Unless the Minister addresses the immediate criteria to help people to get on the housing list, we are going to have homelessness.</p> <p>  There is another issue.  Recently, the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme has come into being.  In fairness, I think the HAP scheme is quite good in the sense that people are getting rent allowance.  There is considerable confusion and there needs to be further education on this.  There is considerable confusion between the HAP scheme and the rental accommodation scheme.  HAP is a good scheme and people will get their rent allowance.  However, the problem is people are going on the HAP scheme now and the landlord is upping the rent.  Therefore, we have people who are getting extra money on the HAP scheme because they are entitled to it, but there is also the landlord.  We need to put something in place to stop the landlords from hiking the rent.  It is not helping the people who are renting.</p> <p>  When assessments are done under the HAP scheme, it means people waiting to get their interviews to go on the local authority housing list fall behind.  When all these schemes are put in place, are extra staff given to local authorities in order that there is no backing-up of people waiting for interview to go on the local authority lists?  In fairness to the staff, they are now going through a new assessment of HAP.  They have to do that.  However, people are not being interviewed to go on housing waiting lists because there are not enough staff.  These are small things but they are massive in terms of keeping things progressing.  I want to know the position.  When the Minister puts such a scheme in place, does he give local authorities extra staff to deal with the queue of people waiting to have their needs assessed?  It is not happening.</p><p>At the time this scheme was introduced, we had the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.  This is where confusion arises.  Anyone involved in the housing assistance payment, HAP, knows that those on RAS were taken off the local authority housing list.  Anyone now on rent allowance must go on HAP and are told they are being removed from the housing list.  Those who were on RAS before 2011 have been told they do not qualify to get back on the housing list.  We are making them homeless.  We need to examine these issues.  They are small issues but people are being left homeless.  They are on RAS but do not qualify for the local authority list and they do not qualify for a mortgage.</p><p> People whose houses are in the process of being repossessed, through no fault of their own, cannot go on the housing list because their name is on a house.  These people have no home because the banks have taken it, but they do not qualify for the local authority housing list.  The paperwork can take up to two or three years, but the local authority tells them they do not qualify for the housing list because their name is on a house.  The people have letters from solicitors but they are not allowed on the local authority housing list.  These issues are not being taken into account and it is making people homeless.</p><p> I understand what has been said about the planning for 100 houses, which I welcome because it is a good initiative, but the Department must do its homework with the local authorities whereby people can qualify for the housing list, people are helped to get mortgages and help is given to those who do not qualify for the housing list because their name is on a house even though they do not actually have it.  This needs to be examined, as does RAS.  People who have been taken off the housing list should be put back on it.  They are panicking.  This is urgent.</p><p> Another element of the policy I do not understand is with regard to people who are on the housing list of one local authority area but move to another local authority area.  For example, people on the Kildare list moving to Carlow are almost told they cannot live in the new area.  They are asked what is their need to live in Carlow and why they want to live there.  It is almost as though people must need to live in an area.  If people choose to be in an area they should be allowed to be there.  If they qualify for rent allowance in Kildare they will get it in Carlow.  The difference is that the amount of rent allowance in Carlow is much lower than in other authority areas.  That needs to be examined.</p><p> Many elements in this area have been totally forgotten.  Unless the new plan is changed, the Minister will make the normal person homeless, and that is part of the problem.</p></speech>

Why not do this now?  Is there a reason?</p> <p>  I am glad progress has been made on support for people in homelessness at present.  I proposed at the housing committee that there be supports such as transport for people, but I would argue that a free bus pass is not enough.  According to a survey, 40% of homeless people in Dublin are from the constituency of Dublin West, and I would well believe it because I am snowed under with this issue.  There are no hotels in Dublin West so people are put into far-flung areas and must take two buses.  Why does the Department not examine the idea of providing a bus to collect children and bring them to school, rather than leaving mothers to try to bring four children to different places across the city in rush-hour traffic?  This should be considered.  It is obvious.</p> <p>  Another issue is food.  The Minister spoke about nutrition plans, but there is no way anybody can avail of proper nutrition while living in emergency accommodation because they cannot afford it.  Good food costs money.  Many children I see in my constituency who have been homeless for a year are suffering real obesity because of the crap their parents are forced to feed them.  They cannot afford to eat in the hotel.  They are not allowed to eat in the hotel because those running the hotel do not want them to be seen.  The Minister must give allowances for food.  He cannot expect people to keep children healthy.  We will have serious health issues arising from this.</p> <p>  The Minister spoke about putting pregnant women in particular locations.  I am sure he is not speaking about a Magdalen laundry.  Pregnant women have specific needs.  They should be able to access clean water and not have to buy it in the hotel for &euro;5 a bottle.  Any supports are welcome.  Will the Minister expand on this?</p> <p>  Domestic violence is a big driver of homelessness.  We all know families stay in their homes and women stay in danger because of the homeless situation.  People are stuck in refuges and cannot move out of them and are blocking spaces for other women.  What specifically is the Minister planning?  He mentioned that he had something.</p> <p>  With regard to prevention and ending homelessness, we need to put a bandage on the haemorrhage.  We need to stop more people from being made homeless, but a mortgage-to-rent scheme will add little because most of the people becoming homeless are renting.  They do not have a mortgage.  They are losing their rented accommodation.  By far the biggest reason is rent increases.  The Department is now recognising this reality and is increasing rent allowance limits.  It was turning a blind eye to what technically was fraud because the only people being defrauded were the poor families themselves with the under-the-counter payments they had to give landlords.  Many people not on social welfare are also struggling to pay rent.  The Minister spoke about the Tyrrelstown amendment, but the biggest driver of homelessness is landlords coming to tenants and stating they must sell the property and that the tenants must leave.  We all know this.  It is so obvious and simple.  The Minister spoke about a balance of rights.  As I said at the previous meeting, there is no balance of rights here.  A landlord does not have an equal right to sell a property at will and evict a family onto the street.  It is not an equal right.  Could the State not try to acquire these houses if the landlords really are selling them?  We could introduce a law to outlaw the sale of property except under a range of circumstances.</p><p>The range of circumstances could include that a landlord - I am speaking in this regard about a landlord of a single or small number of properties rather than of the vulture-type landlord - would have to prove that he or she would endure severe hardship if he or she could not sell the property, for example, as part of a settlement in the context of, say, family breakdown and so on.  The landlord could also be required to offer purchase of the house to the State such that the State could then maintain the tenant <i>in situ.</i>I do not believe half of the number of landlords who claim that they are selling their houses are actually doing so.  What they are actually doing is displacing tenants so that they can get higher rents.  We should call their bluff.  We should also allow reluctant landlords to move on if they really do want to sell and in that regard put in place a State scheme to purchase those houses thereby keeping people in housing.  <br/><br/>The only solution is to build more social housing where it is needed.  I am not sure if we will get to the issue of social housing today.  I do not like the clich&eacute;, &quot;social housing provision is not rocket science&quot;, but it is not.  There are concentrations of homelessness across Ireland.  Ireland is a small country.  It is not a massive country like China such that there is a need for a great deal of planning.  The homelessness issue in Ireland should be easy to resolve.  We know where are the homeless black-spots.  They are in Dublin, Cork, Kildare, the commuter belt areas and, sporadically, in other locations.  Surely most of the 47,000 social houses need to be in areas where they are most needed.  The problem is that this is not what is happening.  The Minister said he has met with many of the local authorities.  Has he met Fingal County Council?  Homelessness is a huge issue in Dublin.  A key area in this regard is Fingal, yet there is no plan to build social housing in the Dublin 15 area, except for ten units to be provided by a housing agency.  That is disgraceful.  The crisis is growing and nothing is being done to address it.  It is akin to a Stalinist plan: abolishing the barriers to planning permission and getting the houses built even though this will doing nothing to address the issue of homelessness because most of the houses that will be made available will be private housing that will be unaffordable.  I am more interested in social housing provision being progressed and in a real plan being put in place to target that provision in areas where it is most needed.</p></speech>

I will try to do so quickly, otherwise we will not get past this pillar.  I take on board some of the Deputy's points in regard to the rental market.  There is a great deal of stakeholder consultation needed to get the balance right in terms of any changes to be made to the rental market.  What we do not want to do is make changes that result in no new build for rental property.  We do not want to make changes that will frighten off investment.  At the same time, we need to address some of the issues the Deputy raised.  This plan does not go into detail in that regard but it proposes changes that I believe that are no-brainers.  For example, if a property fund sells a complex to another property fund and there are more than 20 units in that development, all the tenancies should continue through that sale.  The issue becomes more complex to deal with in a situation where the vast majority of rental properties are owned by landlords of one or two properties.  In that regard much more difficult issues arise, such as property rights and so on.  The solution is not as simple as a Minister putting in place a regulation that puts a moratorium on all evictions.  There are knock-on consequences to decisions such that if they are not thought through properly they can make the overall situation worse.</p> <p>  On the question regarding pregnant women, that is a 2017 commitment under the plan.  We intend to have a facilities that provide for ten to 12 women.  The locations for these facilities are currently being identified.  Services and supports will be provided by the HSE and Tusla.  We are trying to do as many actions in parallel as we can.  It is hoped we can move this action on early next year.  On family supports, I take on board the Deputy's comments in that regard.  There are a number of families dispersed across multiple hotel sites across the city.  We try to locate people close to where their original communities in terms of accessing schools, services and so on.  I take the Deputy's point in relation to transport and that the solution is not as simple as giving someone a bus ticket.  I will discuss that issue with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, who has pretty strong views on it, most of which I am sure the Deputy would agree with.</p> <p>  On vacant houses, we are planning to do a lot around vacant properties.  We have committed &euro;70 million to the Housing Agency.  It is already negotiating with banks in relation to the acquisition from them of properties that are currently vacant and linked to broken loan books, which the agency can then subsequently lease.  The agency will seek to maximise the impact, in terms of unit numbers, of that &euro;70 million.  The view is that it should be able to access approximately 1,600 new units with that level of funding.  The agency will also have fund-raising capacity from the lease of properties.  We are also introducing a repair-to-lease programme, which will be piloted in Carlow and Waterford.  Under this programme a local authority can approach a private landlord and offer him or her three or five years' rent upfront to ensure he or she can upgrade a property to make it suitable for rent.  In other words, rather just giving a grant to people with no guarantee of access to property for rent, we are linking the two.  There are lots of examples of people who on the passing of their parents have inherited a family home which is no longer being lived in but they do not want to sell it.  They are the type of people we want to approach.  We will offer them up to &euro;15,000 to upgrade the property in return for which we will takeover management of the tenancy on their behalf and ensure a property is maintained properly.  We are not only proposing to allow local authorities to do this, we are also trying to design a scheme to allow approved housing bodies to also do that, initially on a pilot basis so that we can determine that it works.</p></speech>

There is much talk about boarded up houses and empty properties, particularly in our cities.  Some of them are in public ownership but most of them are in private ownership.  We have done a lot in terms of reducing the number of voids.  Members will be aware of the many regeneration projects that are under way, which requires properties to be vacant for a period.  There are a number of properties in rural and urban locations that could be brought back into use for social housing or affordable rental accommodation and we will continue to look at ways of doing that more effectively.</p> <p>  In regard to rapid build, much of the private housing that will be built over the next ten years will be rapid built.  Rapid built houses are not the same as modular units.  Rapid build is the construction of walls, ceilings, windows and doors in a factory setting, which are then craned to sites and put together.  Much of the evidence suggest that these houses meet the standards of triple A rating in terms of energy management systems in a much more consistent way than conventional build because there is far less room for variance and error.  What they look like is a different issue.</p></speech>

Whether one uses slate on the outside of a house or whether it is painted or pebble dashed is an aesthetic issue.  The construct of the houses in Poppintree, which I have been in, is pretty good.</p><p>Obviously, we must make sure that we are building houses that look attractive, as well as houses that make sense from all the other management perspectives.  However, the idea that we are building tenements for the future because they are rapid-build units simply does not hold water.  These houses have 60-year guarantees on them and are not really any different from conventional construction.</p><p> As for the issues raised regarding staffing numbers to administer the housing assistance payment, HAP, we have a centralised HAP management office in Limerick for the entire country and there has been staffing there.  On additional staff, Senator Coffey probably sanctioned some of these posts in the past 12 months but more than 140 additional staff numbers have been sanctioned across local authorities mainly in the areas of housing, engineering, planning, design and so on.  To be fair, there are issues regarding the budgets that go with that.  While additional numbers can be sanctioned, in most cases local authorities must find the resources to do that and I accept this can be a limitation for some local authorities.  As for the thresholds that are put in place, they are linked to local rent, just as increases in HAP payments are linked to local rent.  They effectively are linked to the bottom third of the rental market in any area.  That was the basis for deciding what should be the increases in HAP and rent supplement.</p></speech>

While Airbnb is a solution for some things, as far as I am concerned it also causes problems in other areas.  We are trying to create long-term tenancies and certainty.  Airbnb is a short-term solution mostly for people who are on holidays or who are staying somewhere on city breaks and so on.  There are also issues pertaining to regulation, inspection, standards and all the rest of it.  Basically, Airbnb involves inviting somebody else into one's own home, as opposed to putting in place a tenancy that is tested and robust.  While I acknowledge there are checks and balances within the Airbnb system, I would not like to over-egg Airbnb's potential in the context of solving a homelessness crisis.  While that is my honest response, I am open to persuasion on these matters.  It has a useful purpose but in terms of managed tenancies and certainty for the future, there are issues in this regard.</p> <p>  I think most of the questions have been answered.</p></speech>

This is a welcome ongoing engagement that has to happen between all the stakeholders.  We, as Oireachtas Members, have a very important role to play in delivering what is a very ambitious action plan, Rebuilding Ireland.  I welcome also the fact the Minister is going round the country meeting local authorities, the approved housing bodies and other stakeholders.  That is critical because the nub of the issue is delivery of units and output to meet the crisis and the need that we all know is there.  It is important to continue with that.</p> <p>  All the schemes the Minister is running, the initiatives that have already been put in place and the new initiatives that will require legislative change, will require the support of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I hope we can get behind this to remove any barriers to delivery of units which cause homelessness.  We all have an important role to play, hopefully in the coming weeks, not months or years, in that regard.</p> <p>  The housing assistance payment, HAP, and the voids programmes are already proving successful but we need to see a further roll-out of those.  The purchase schemes are working for the local authorities and approved housing bodies.  The building of new units is the critical area.  Will the Minister elaborate on what changes have been made in the Department in the mechanisms for measuring output and ensuring delivery, whether through local authorities or approved housing bodies?  I know he will be going into this under pillar 2.  I recognise Mary Hurley, one of the officials who is now leading one of the sections in the Department.  A lot of staff, expertise and resources were lost on local authorities.  I know much ground work was done on rebuilding that capacity but now we need to support them, whether through staffing or with the assistance of the housing agencies, which have vast expertise available to advise local authorities and the approved housing bodies on demographics, house types, expertise and infrastructure.  We really need to remove the barriers now and build that capacity so that we can deliver output.  That is where most of the focus needs to be.</p> <p>  In respect of homelessness, one of the critical changes for which the Minister has managed to get cross-departmental and cross-Government support is in the area of mental health and children.  I believe, as does anyone who knows the complexities of rough sleepers, that it is not just a question of giving them a house.  They need critical supports for addiction problems and other issues.  The increase from &euro;2 million to &euro;6 million will go a long way.  I welcome that support from the Minister for Health.  We need to align the objectives across Departments.  For too long we have been operating in silos within government.  For the first time, I see an alignment across Departments that can really hit the homelessness problem that we all want to resolve.  That increase alone will bring vital support to help those who have addiction problems and other mental health issues to sustain their tenancies in accommodation that they may be offered.  I welcome that and we need to see more off it.</p><p> I have a couple of other points to make and I will be as brief as possible.  The mortgage-to-rent scheme was mentioned by the Minister.  I want to be somewhat critical here due to experience.  With regard to private households, the scheme is very limited in its success.  There have been refusals by housing bodies, in my opinion, often for spurious reasons.  One such refusal was issued on foot of a house having been modified.  In that case, an extension was added to what was previously a local authority house.  To me, it was a no-brainer but a reason was found to decline it.  That is merely one example.  Other examples relate to houses in rural areas.  In my view, there is discrimination in some areas with regard to the mortgage-to-rent scheme.  Whereas in urban areas they are accepted, if a person is trouble in a rural area, the application will be declined simply because the house is located in such an area.  That is not good enough.  I welcome the fact the Minister will review that by the end of the year.  I ask him to pay particular attention to the areas to which I refer because there is more scope to keep people in their houses under the mortgage-to-rent scheme if we can make it more flexible and broader in scope and ensure that reviews are carried out in a more sympathetic way.</p><p> I mentioned the Housing Agency and I will not rehearse what I have already said.  However, the agency is critically important in terms of assisting local authorities and approved housing bodies in achieving their targets.</p><p> Ultimately, it is important that, irrespective of our politics, we all get behind the ambitious programme the Minister has set out to the greatest degree possible.  The funding is there for the programme.  I accept that it will put significant pressure on local authorities but they need to deliver.  We need to support them and local authority members in whatever way possible.</p><p> My final point relates to a new type of devolved scheme - under which moneys up to a maximum of &euro;2 million can be disbursed - that was introduced at the request of local authorities whereby they, in cases where there is a need for smaller projects, can apply directly to the Department.  It was felt there would be fewer approvals required because once an application in respect of a project was submitted and approved, it would be up to the local authority to deliver it.  The downside for local authorities is that if additional expenditure is required or if unforeseen circumstances arise, they must deal with the situation.  The Minister might inform the committee regarding the success of the scheme to date.  It is only a new scheme but it has potential, particularly if local authorities could engage it in a proactive manner.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the important work he and his Department are doing.  This is the first time I can say that I have a Minister opposite me who knows what he is doing and who is listening and consulting.  The way the Minister is listening to questions at this meeting is important, as is the knowledge he has displayed in respect of his brief.  He is encouraging people to work together and I very much welcome that.</p> <p>  I do have a major criticism, but not of the Minister or his Department.  The real tragedy here is the families that will again be homeless in places such as Dublin tonight.  Every one of those families would be in an apartment or a house if those units which NAMA had offered to the local authorities in Dublin had been taken up.  Nationally, there were 6,700 houses offered by NAMA to local authorities and approximately 2,500 of them were taken up.  The Dublin local authorities, to their shame, refused more apartments or houses than they took up.  They refused 800 and took up approximately 600.  That is the reality of homelessness, but it is something we must deal with.  My concern is whether the Minister-----</p></speech>

The latter must continue to be the case.  Some local authorities around the country are excellent, while others have poor records.  The key point is the Minister's management of the process throughout the country.  There are different demands in different areas.  Obviously, the level of demand and the pressures that exist in some areas are more significant than in other areas.</p> <p>  I want to comment on the question of the rapid-build homes.  I represent a constituency in which such structures were built in the past.  Some of these homes do not have chimneys or front or back gardens.  A number of them literally fell apart after a short number of years because there was no proper structure to them.  I visited the ones in the Fingal area.  I am not a professional in any respect but, having examined them as best I could, they seem to be excellent.  They seem to fit in extremely well with the local environment and are high quality in the context of energy conservation.  On first inspection, I very much liked what I saw.  I would agree with the proposal that we would continue to build those houses.  If they have the 60-year warranty which the Minister said applies to them, then that is good enough for me and for everybody else.</p> <p>  There are a number of issues relating to local authorities.  I agree with my colleague, Senator Murnane O'Connor.  I would make two points.  I agree with her passion about this matter issue because she deals with people on a day-to-day basis at her clinic.  Many of the points she made are made to me at my clinic.  I am sure that is the case at other members' clinics as well.  In terms of the detail, it might be helpful if local authorities were to examine some of the points and have been made and communicate with us, through their representative association, on the very real problems that exist.</p> <p>  I have one additional problem - I do not know whether anybody else has encountered it - whereby a returned emigrant who sold his property before he left the country cannot now get on the housing list because he previously owned a home.  We are trying to attract emigrants back to the country.  I thank God that this year we will have more people coming into the country than left it, but they will not be able to get houses because they cannot get on the housing lists.  There is an issue in this regard which we must address.</p> <p>  The other matter I want to address - it goes to the heart of Senator Murnane O'Connor's point - is the fundamental issue of respect for housing applicants and for families, particularly in the context of acknowledging their needs.  Local authorities should not continue to conduct business through hatches at their offices because all of those in the vicinity can hear every detail of an individual's problems.  People can become very distressed as a result of what happens.  There must also be an adequate number of properly trained staff - the point in this regard was well made by the Minister - to deal with those who have social issues - for example, a drug addiction - or family problems.  As the Minister correctly stated, it would be good if we could get those who are homeless to return to the homes they may have come but only if they feel safe in them.  That is hugely important but nothing is currently being done about it.  People come into my clinic and I understand the issues they face.  If there was a proper, professionally-run agency to which one could direct them, it would be of great assistance.  Local authorities have traditionally offered a sympathetic ear.  However, that is no longer the case because of the sheer number of applicants.  As a result, the matter is just not being dealt with properly.  On foot of the fact that we will not solve the housing crisis overnight, we need to address the issues to which I refer and ensure that people are afforded the respect and understanding to which they are entitled.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, I may have to go soon.  I am of the view that we may need to discuss this matter again.  We may not finish our deliberations today even though that is our wish.  It is hugely important that the committee engage in open discussions of this nature.</p> <p>  I reiterate what I said earlier, namely, that the Minister is grasping the nettle.  I very much welcome that.  His job is not easy and, obviously, there will be lots of criticism.  However, the Minister is taking the correct route.  The funding is bring provided but there is a need for empathy and the understanding.  The need is being met, in terms of what we want to do, by everybody present at this meeting.  The programme put forward by the Minister is excellent and it will drive a solution to this problem in an open, transparent and accountable way.  It is in this room that the accountability resides.  The Minister's programme is the way forward.</p></speech>

It is important that he listens and engages.  I know began to do so when the negotiations on the programme for Government commenced.  This is a huge issue and we will be judged on our success or failure in grappling with it.</p><p>We have failed spectacularly, as a country, to deal with homelessness.  </p><p> There are a number of blockages, one of which seems to be inertia at local authority level, whether it is through a lack of staff or a lack of other resources.  There are too many stages to go through in the schemes that are on offer and I cannot understand why there cannot be a central design for each local authority, adapted to each site.  There could be a standard design for a number of four-beds, three-beds, two-beds and one-beds, and there would be is no need for architects to design different schemes for different areas every time a contract goes out to tender.  Other than the elevation of sites, the standards should be the same for each house.  At the moment there are delays as we deal with architects.  Architects have told me that when they make submissions to the Department they wait forever for an answer, causing delays of two, three or four years.</p><p> As Senator Murnane O'Connor said, the revenue limits are too low for people in employment or on low incomes.  If they are slightly over the limit they cannot get it.  The voluntary sector, in which I am involved, has a huge role to play.  Around 2006, there was a section in the Department dealing directly with voluntary groups who wanted to build houses.  These groups have a proven track record and they could deliver houses within a reasonable period, say 12 to 18 months from the time of acquiring a site.  That section, however, was abolished.  I do not know if that came from someone in the Department wanting to take back control, but such groups now have to go to five or six different venues around the country to visit different sections of the Department to get their approvals over the line.  That is wrong.</p><p> I echo what Deputy O'Dowd said.  Local authorities have lost a lot of staff as a result of cuts.  They need adequate trained staff.  People deserve dignity when they are standing in council offices and should not have to stand in a queue and take a ticket as if they were taxing their car.  It is a very personal matter and there should be more space so that they can be listened to.  In my own town, the closure of the borough council has put huge pressure on the front desk of the county council and there is not adequate space, resources or time for people.  It is difficult for staff and there needs to be more sensitivity in this area.</p><p> I am committed to working with and supporting the Minister as best I can to cut out red tape.  He has some responsibility for planning and there are some issues in my county in that regard.  At least half a dozen young couples, with jobs and the wherewithal to build, have sites on family plots but they cannot get planning permission.  Councils cannot house people, yet they are making it ridiculously difficult for people to build houses in rural Ireland.  They can and are willing to house themselves.  It would also kick-start the economy, especially in rural areas and small towns with small builders.  We will never get started with all the draconian planning laws we have.  We need good planning but there are now too many issues for people who want to build.  Provided they follow guidelines, they should be allowed to do so, but it takes forever to get a pre-planning meeting and to get feedback if there are difficulties.  The role of the local representative has also been cut.  He or she used to be able to mediate with neighbours on different issues related to sites, but it is now more difficult.  It is not that people wanted to bend laws - they just wanted to get planning permission for appropriate sites and on-site pre-planning meetings were very important for this.  A lot of time was saved by finding out at the pre-planning stage that a site was not suitable.  I know the Minister is to visit the councils, and he would be welcome to come to Tipperary to meet officials.  The county managers' association should be required to say why they could build thousands of houses in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s but nowadays they are delivering zilch.</p><p> The mortgage-to-rent scheme has been an abject failure and the figures are dismal.  Whether there is not a willingness to work with it or the guidelines are too strict, it is just not functioning.  It needs to be dealt with because there are many instances in which people could be kept in their houses.  Another issue is the purchase of houses by vulture funds, which is a total nonsense.  I will not even get started on NAMA because it will be dealt with elsewhere, but that agency has a lot of questions to answer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-14a.605" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2016091400002#O00200"><p>I will try to say one positive thing.  I welcome the fact that there is a serious discussion about this crisis, albeit very belatedly for a crisis that has been building up for at least the past five or six years.  There is a serious attempt to engage with it, but I am deeply sceptical about the capacity of this plan to deal with the scale of the problem.  This is primarily because it relies overwhelmingly on the private sector to deliver public housing.  I have read the Minister's plan in detail and in its graphs the biggest bar by a long mile is for HAP.  The graphs make it clear that, for every single year of its projected delivery of social housing, the private sector is bigger than any other category of social housing.  I do not believe that will happen.  It may happen in some areas but in my area it will definitely not happen.  I want to know what the Minister is going to do about areas such as D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  Given the caps, even the increased ones, why on earth would a landlord who is charging &euro;1,800 for a one-bedroom property and up to &euro;2,500 for two or three bedrooms sign an arrangement with a local authority for much less than that?  They are not doing this in any significant numbers, and when they do get involved they pull out just as quickly, as they did under the RAS scheme.</p> <p>  The reliance on HAP, RAS or leasing arrangements with the private sector means the quality of social housing is being degraded.  When a person gets a council house there are certain standards it will have had to meet and a clear line of accountability on the part of the housing department to maintain it and make sure it does not fall below standards, but that is not true with RAS.  In RAS, if there is damp or there are other problems that the landlord should remedy, the tenant is immediately in a quandary.  They do not know whether to raise the issue for fear the landlord will pull out of the deal and leave them homeless.  That is the reality, because the relationship is not a direct one between the local authority and the tenant any more.  Many tenants suffer in silence because they are afraid to point out problems of chronic damp lest they be flung out.</p> <p>  I wish to ask a straight question on rapid build.  The Minister said the procurement process for rolling out rapid build was not yet fully in place.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Clearly, the council wants a rapid build.  I cannot see an argument as to why that should not be bricks-and-mortar.  One could start a bricks-and-mortar project straight away and have something that is permanent, rather than having a 60-year lifespan, and an asset that is appreciating as opposed to degrading in value as is the case with a rapid build.  Rapid builds are as expensive, so I do not see any advantage there.  It is very telling-----</p></speech>

In the Part 8 for the project to which I refer, in an area which needs one-bedroom, three-bedroom and four-bedroom units and where most of the people on the priority emergency homeless list are those with a need for a unit with more than two bedrooms, every single unit has two bedrooms.

Building is taking place.  When it sought planning permission, there was a 20% allocation for social housing, which is being built, but we will now only get 10% of it.</p></speech>

I refer to some of Deputy Boyd Barrett's comments.  In mixed tenure development on public land we are trying to enure that we are building communities that have a mix of social, affordable rental and rented or owned private units.  We are trying to ensure that the advantages of diversity and mixed tenure benefit those communities in the medium term, as opposed to doing what we did in the past where large areas of cities were all private or social housing.  That does not maximise opportunities for many people, and it creates division across different societal types within Dublin.  That is not good.</p> <p>  If we are going to add between 30% and 40% to our social housing stock over the next five or six years, which we are doing by adding an extra 47,000 units to it, then I want to make sure that, where possible, we are integrating those social housing units within mixed tenure developments that have social, affordable, private and other variables of housing mixes.  That is what we are doing in O'Devaney Gardens, I hope, and will also be doing with some of the other regeneration projects that we will fund in the city and other parts of the country, and that is a good thing.  Some people may have an ideological difference of opinion, which is fine and I respect that view but I do not agree with it.</p></speech>

We have legislated for Part 5.  Unlike in the past, we are not going to allow developers to buy out that obligation.  Rather, we are going to require that there be mixed tenure.  One will see far more than 10% social housing in many private developments because as part of the funding model many developers are now talking to local authorities and approved housing bodies about selling a higher percentage.  We want to guarantee that in every new housing estate built in the country there will be social housing.  It will be the first time that will happen.</p> <p>  We want to use large, publicly-owned land banks much more strategically than we did in the past.  For example, there is the potential for about 600 housing units in O'Devaney Gardens.  If we only built social houses there we would have to do it in phases over a ten or 15-year period because my Department would have to fund every 100 or 200 units we built.  Instead, we will be able to build 600 housing units in one development.  Half will be social housing, 20% of which will be affordable rental units for the kind of people who do not come under the thresholds in terms of qualifying for social housing but still have real difficulty accessing houses.  Some 30% will be social housing comprising 200 units on the site in the not-too-distant future.  This will happen under a competitive process for the design of building integrated good communities in those areas.  It will transform that part of Dublin, quite frankly.</p></speech>

All of our top people here were there to answer individual questions on a plan that was largely put together by them.  I am the face of it but they put it together.  When we are trying to be as open and transparent about the information we have to ensure everybody is informed, I do not think it is overly fair then to start equating that with a meeting that apparently I was not even at.  That is not a fair reflection of what happened.</p><p> As I said, we will insist that Part V is implemented in full as opposed to the buy-out systems that were there in the past.  Part V is a bare minimum.  Many estates will go beyond 10% but it is up to local authorities and approved housing bodies to do the deals that are needed to make that happen.  I am not familiar with the individual case in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and I am not going to talk about individual cases.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-14a.688" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2016091400002#Q01400"><p>I am answering the Deputy's question.  Before the end of next year, 1,500 rapid build units will be built.  They will be in multiple locations, primarily across Dublin.  Different local authorities in Dublin are building different numbers and that is the way it will work.</p> <p>  Many people thought HAP would not work in south Dublin either but 1,200 HAP tenancies have been set up there and more than 500 homeless HAP tenancies have been set in Dublin.  I think HAP will work in time in D&uacute;n Laoghaire but there are other big projects and publicly owned land in D&uacute;n Laoghaire that can deliver significant quantities of mixed tenure, which will be about affordable, social and private housing on some sites, whether it is the Cherrywood development or other projects.  My understanding is that there are about 400 housing units either under construction or very close to being under construction within that local authority so we are moving ahead.  We recognise the need and pressures around social housing in D&uacute;n Laoghaire as we recognise them in many other areas.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Mattie McGrath, it is important to say that of the 12,500 housing units built last year, more than 6,000 were one-off houses in the countryside in places like west Cork and Tipperary, so quite a lot of one-off houses are being built at the moment.  We need to make sure that they are built in a way that is consistent with county development plans and local area plans.  There are obviously issues around ribbon development and there are different zonings, be they A1, A2 or A3.  I cannot get involved in individual planning cases but if there is a policy issue around that which the Deputy wants me to look at, I will certainly look at it.</p> <p>  In respect of voluntary groups and approved housing bodies, much of our new social housing will in some cases be built, leased or acquired by approved housing bodies.  I opened an interesting model last week, which is the NAMA NARPS model facilitated through Respond!, that involved the allocation of new units in Cork.  There are different financing and management models that will include a lot of approved housing bodies.  To help them, we are setting up a one-stop-shop within the Housing Agency, particularly around procurement and legal issues, to increase the capacity and economies of scale within approved housing bodies.  Many approved housing bodies in Ireland are quite small in terms of their operations.  There are a few big ones but many of them are quite small, especially the specialist ones dealing with elderly care and mental health.</p> <p>  In respect of stages and approval processes, the criticism that many of the projects that have been planned in recent years have been moving very slowly through the system is a fair one.  Some of that is financial while some of it concerns differences of agreement between the Department and local authorities around design or costing.  The approval process is under review at the moment and I think we will see significant improvements on it.  In fact, I think we are already seeing significant improvements on it.  We are now sending multidisciplinary teams composed of a planner, a quantity surveyor and an architect down for face-to-face meetings to try to short-cut an approval process as opposed to having a back-and-forth correspondence that may go on for months.  We also have a delivery unit within the Department whose job is essentially to project manage and work in tandem with the Department and local authorities to make sure barriers to decision-making are removed and that we get schemes moving as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  I take the points made by Deputy O'Dowd about treating people with respect.  Given the pressures, the number of people on housing lists and the number of families and individuals who are homeless at the moment, there is a danger that people dealing every day with many distressed people can become hardened to that and it becomes process-driven as opposed to more personalised and compassionate.  We might raise those points at a management level to see how we can deal with concerns around the respect and dignity that people need to be shown.</p> <p>  I take the point about people coming home and not being able to get on a housing list.  To be honest, I had not thought about it before.  If someone had a property and they sold it, they would have been a previous property owner and, therefore, there is a restriction.  Even if the person sold the property, if the property was in negative equity and the person still had debt, effectively he or she would not have any asset left either in cash or property and he or she would be restricted in terms of getting on a housing list.  That is something on which we will try to follow up.</p> <p>  I take the point about the NAMA offering.  I think that has been a source of frustration.  Some of the properties may have been in areas that were not suitable in the same way that many vacant properties are in areas where there is little demand.  I find it difficult to believe that if the figures given by the Deputy are right, and I think they are pretty close to being right-----</p></speech>

NAMA was certainly very critical of that when it appeared before the housing committee.</p> <p>  In respect of Senator Coffey's point, I am very conscious that many of the foundations on which we are trying build were put in place by Senator Coffey when he was Minister of State and by the former Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly.  It is hoped we will now benefit from some of that work.</p> <p>  In respect of the devolved scheme for local authorities, to put it simply, councils do not have to get sign-off from us at every stage for any scheme that involves spending less than &euro;2 million.  They can just get on and do it.  We are reviewing that at the moment because the take-up has been very low.  I would like to devolve more power to local authorities to be able to make decisions, but with that devolved power comes increased responsibility in terms of the financial management of the projects.  We will not have a situation where halfway through a project that should cost &euro;4 million, it looks like the project will cost &euro;6 million and local authorities come back to me asking for an extra &euro;2 million.  We cannot have that so we must have guarantees, assurances and checking mechanisms around making sure we get full value for money and that we have quality design and so on.  The principle of giving more responsibility to local authorities around financing and delivering these projects would certainly make life a lot easier for us with regard to getting approvals faster.  If we can do it, we will.</p><p>On the issue of removing barriers to output and capacity loss within local authorities, the Secretary General told me that the number is around 400 extra staff across local authorities linked to housing and planning in the last 12 to 18 months.  We are trying to get more capacity in there.  There is probably still some room for more, particularly in areas of real pressure like Dublin and Cork.  We are reviewing the mortgage to rent scheme to try to get better outcomes with that.  I think most of the questions have been covered.  If I have not answered them, please raise them again.</p></speech>

As we have drifted into pillars 2 and 3, I have some questions on them.  To facilitate other members, I am more than happy for the answers to be given to the committee at a later stage, be they in writing or whatever.  I will stick to the questions.  In pillar 2, the 47,000 units is broken down into 26,000, 11,000 and 10,000.  I had asked previously if it was possible for the committee to have a breakdown of projected targets for those.  For example, how many of the 26,000 units does the Department expect to be Part V, approved housing bodies, council new build and acquisitions?  If it is possible to have that breakdown today or at a later stage, that would be great.</p> <p>  With regard to the mixed tenure and the land initiatives, I believe what is being proposed on the land initiative is a really significant, big policy departure.  There is a need for this committee, and maybe the exchange earlier demonstrates that need, to have a dedicated discussion on the detail of this proposal.  I strongly favour, and have long argued for, a council-led mixed tenure estates.  However, if it is the intention of the Department to mobilise the land as an asset to get a private developer to build, there are big questions to be asked around this.  The first is whether the local authority sells the land at market value and retains the sale price to purchase another plot of land to develop another mixed tenure estate.  The second is whether the local authority is obliged to use the sale price of the land to purchase the social housing units.  They are two very different models.  The first option obviously has the advantage that a second site could be bought and more units could be produced, including more social units.  The first one is an end of the asset with regard to the social value of it.  There are a lot of issues in the mixed tenure model which need to be teased out.  With regard to the  housing delivery unit and the housing procurement unit, I would really like much more detail about those.  At the last meeting, it was said that there had been additional staff.  I would like to know how many, what they are doing and how they are doing it.  This information does not have to be provided today.</p> <p>  I had previously asked about the Irish Council for Social Housing fund which is mentioned in the plan and the blockage that is within the Registrar of Credit Unions, the Central Bank and the Department of Finance with regard to mobilising some of the Irish League of Credit Unions' money into that fund.  The officials were not in a position to give us any update on that.  Will the Minister indicate if he has spoken with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, and if is there any update?  Clearly, there is some money that can be mobilised, which does not go on to State borrowing, from the credit unions for approved housing bodies.  Where are we with that?</p> <p>  At the last meeting, I discussed the 400 households who are stuck in direct provision and who have the stamp 4 visas.  They cannot get out of direct provision partly because of language and cultural barriers and partly because they are still stuck on &euro;19.50 per week, even with jobseekers' allowance, because the remainder is subsidising their direct provision.  They cannot save for a deposit for HAP, etc.  Is there any plan to provide some direct intervention to assist these 400 families to get out of direct provision in which they should not be in the first place?  This is nothing to do with the direct provision separately but it is a big concern and it was not addressed at the last meeting.</p></speech>

Homelessness is concentrated in a number of locations.  My frustration stems from the fact that 40% of Dublin's homeless are in my constituency but the Minister has not prioritised meeting that local authority and asking why it has no plans to deal with the situation or explain what he can do to help them.  It is a bit blas&eacute; for him to say he has been to Waterford or Carlow when he knows where the key problem lies.</p></speech>

When councils say there is no demand for housing in an area, that is not actually true if they have not tested that demand.  One of the issues that has arisen is councils refusing houses from NAMA.  Houses are available but the councils do not actually ask the people who applied, or they do not advertise that homes are available at a location asking applicants if they wish to take them.  That is a huge issue.  If one looks at the Housing Agency's map of houses in Ireland, it is very clear that a lot of vacant homes are theoretically in the west.  Houses are offered to local authorities which could be available to rent but they say there is no demand in a particular area.  They do not actually test that and this is hugely important.</p> <p>  In Dublin, there are 40,000 vacant homes.  That is a huge issue.  I do not know if I am crossing into pillars 2, 3 or 4.  I think this is an area we should debate at our next meeting if that is okay.</p></speech>

With a council house, there are standards and the council is directly responsible to uphold those standards and the tenant knows who to go to.  With RAS or HAP, it is much more insecure because the landlord can pull out and the tenant is in a much worse position because if there are problems, and particularly when the rental situation is as bad as it is in Dublin, the tenant is terrified to go near the council or the landlord to say there is a problem.</p></speech>

I can only deal with the concrete reality.  Plans are one thing, and they look lovely, but then the concrete reality emerges.  The first rapid-build provision being pushed by a local authority proposes that they will all be two-bedroom units.  The reason it is proposing that, even though what is needed is a much more diverse mix, is that it wants to deliver rapid-build units.  If the proposal was for bricks-and-mortar buildings, we would have a mixed sustainable development, which would be good in the long term.  The Minister said in his response that we want to have mixed provision, build better communities and all the rest of it, but there is a proposal to build a substandard community because of the prejudice towards rapid-build housing.  If there was not such a prejudice towards rapid-build and we built bricks and mortar, which the people on the housing waiting list would prefer, we would have a mixed sustainable community.  Therefore, what was said was wrong, and it is being driven by the prejudice towards rapid-build housing.</p><p>The Minister said we could not have a <i>carte blanche</i>moratorium on evictions, because it is complicated and there are unintended consequences.  Can he explain to me why that is the case?</p></speech>

Reference was made to unintended consequences.  The big consequence that is of significance and that is at the bottom of this emergency is that people are being put out of their homes.  I am not that bothered about what other unintended consequences there might be if it stops people from being put out of their homes.  To be put out of one's home is a disaster.  Why can we not introduce a moratorium on evictions?</p></speech>

I do not mind their being deferred until then.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-14a.751" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2016091400002#S02200"><p>On mixed-tenure provision, the reality is that it will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis in terms of how we can best use the strategic asset of land banks in different circumstances.  Sometimes it will be a straight sale which can raise money to buy other land, as the Deputy said, and sometimes it will be to deliver and finance significant potential numbers of social housing units.  It will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, working it out with the local authorities, and we will do it in a way that gets value for money.</p><p>With regard to direct provision and the 400 families that were mentioned, we will certainly have 2,000 refugees coming into Ireland in the next 12 months and within the next two years I suspect that figure will be 4,000 plus their families, which probably will increase the total to nearly 12,000 people.  Obviously we will need to accommodate those people, and they are very much part of the plans.  Most of them will probably be accommodated through the HAP scheme, but there will also be other accommodation solutions.  When they come into the country initially they will need orientation and so on, which is what is recommended.  I take the point regarding the people who have been in direct provision for a long time and the need to work with the Department of Justice and Equality to make sure we provide more sustainable housing solutions for them.</p><p>With regard to Deputy O'Dowd's point, one of the commitments in the plan is that we try to move all local authorities to what is called a choice-based letting system. It is a little like having a small version of <i>daft.ie</i>within a local authority, which would enable all the people who are looking and waiting for houses to see what is available.  As houses become available, they are put up on the system and one bids for them.  Depending on where one is on the list, the person who is highest on the list will get the property.  The advantage of that can be seen if we note the  experience in Cork City Council, where the refusal rate was about 48% because people were being offered houses on the basis of where they were on the list as opposed to matching up their exact need with houses and so on.  Since the introduction of choice-based letting, that refusal rate has halved.</p></speech>

We want to get every local authority to work on a choice-based letting principle.  That will mean that if people say they will take a house, the chances of their seeing that through and not refusing it are much higher.</p></speech>

With respect to the so-called holiday homes that have been refused in some cases, part of the problem was that local authorities said there was no demand for homes in such and such a place.  There could very well be a demand for them, but the houses might have to be surveyed to see if heating can be installed or changes can be made to them.  I appreciate what the Minister has said.  That is one suggestion I would make.</p></speech>

The whole point of HAP is to try to reduce the vulnerability of some people who may be on rent supplement, whereby the relationship is with the landlord and the local authority rather than between landlord and tenant, to try to ensure that quality is more consistent and higher.  That is one of the advantages of HAP versus-----</p></speech>

Everyone who is renting deserves the protection of the State in term of the standards that they should expect from private rental accommodation.  That should apply to social tenants in the same way as to private tenants.  Obviously there is a risk there, which is the reason we have an inspection system.  The figure I got is that there is an inspection always within eight months of a tenancy to make sure that what we are being told is being provided by a landlord and what a local authority is paying for is actually being delivered.</p> <p>  The Deputy made many comments about rapid-build provision, but rapid build is not necessarily a preference.  This is about getting houses built quickly for people because we have a huge demand.  The majority of rapid-build units, just as in Poppintree, will be a temporary, short- to medium-term solution while longer-term housing need is provided for, unless we decide to start using rapid-build technology to get social housing estates built faster, which I expect will probably happen because that is the way the building industry is going.  It is not that with rapid-build only two-bedroom houses are built and they are the only ones being built.  That is not what we are talking about here.</p></speech>

We are trying to get volume into the system to start to deal with the housing needs of many families in a more proactive way.  Rapid build is just part of the solution and it will be a very small part in percentage terms.  I anticipate that most social housing estates will be built with conventional building methods.</p><p> The Deputy spoke about bricks and mortar.  There are a lot of bricks involved in rapid-build housing as well but they are pre-assembled in factories and they are brought in by crane.  That is the only difference.  We need to get away from labelling rapid-build housing as some kind of inferior product.  If it is an inferior product, we should not be using it.  That is all I want to say on rapid-build housing.  It is the third time we have come back to it.</p><p> In respect of the moratorium on evictions, it depends what type of eviction one is talking about.  We are looking at the broad rental market in terms of potential changes and we have said we would have a rental strategy in place by the end of the year.  We are looking at issues around security of tenure and rent predictability.  We are also looking at ensuring it is an attractive market for landlords because otherwise we will see a continuation of what has been happening over the last 18 months where many people have been taking their properties out of the rental market.  My understanding is that over the last 18 months, approximately 30,000 housing units have been taken out of the housing market-----</p></speech>

I ask him to note that he is protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence he is to give to this committee.</p><p>However, if he is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence relating to a particular matter and continues to do so, he is entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of his evidence.  He is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, he should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members should be aware that under the salient rulings of the Chair, members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> I invite Mr. Connor to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am deeply honoured to have been nominated by the Minister for Justice and Equality as chairman designate of the Charity Appeals Tribunal and to be here before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality.  My appointment as a member of the Charity Appeals Tribunal, together with the other members thereof - Ms Carol Fawsitt, Mr. Bill Holohan, Ms Karen Smyth and Ms Deirdre Kiely - took effect from 1 October this year.  I am grateful for the opportunity given to me to be a member of the Charity Appeals Tribunal and look forward to the opportunities and challenges that will arise from it.</p> <p>  The Charities Appeal Tribunal derives its statutory basis from Part 5 of the Charities Act 2009, sections 75 to 80.  I am a solicitor with 42 years experience in practice.  My professional involvement continues in the firm of P. O'Connor and Son, which was established in 1900.  I am currently its managing partner and there are 25 staff members of considerable skill and experience.  I continue to be active in legal practice, particularly in the areas of dispute resolution, including litigation, arbitration, mediation and negotiations, and in the provision of legal services to clients in estate, wills, wards of court, protection and assisted decision-making.  For the benefit of the committee, I set out my involvement in areas of legal practice, policy level involvements, business and sport.</p> <p>  I developed a family legal practice, steeped in tradition, to become a leading law firm in Connacht that is well regarded nationally, I hope.  I have extensive experience of advocating for clients in the District, Circuit and High Courts.  I have addressed all Irish courts, including the Supreme Court, on legal matters.  I have been practising arbitration since 1983 with extensive experience in commercial, property, insurance and other contentious matters.  I am a fellow of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators and I have acted as a mediator in commercial, property and other disputes since 2000.  I was appointed a notary public in 1977 and have served in four west of Ireland counties.  I have acted as coroner in Mayo since 1989 and I regularly conduct inquests.  I have been a council member of the Coroners Society of Ireland since 2006 and a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na disciplinary inquiry and appeal board since 2007.  I have been a member of independent appeals tribunal of Irish Prison Service since 2011 and I am currently serving as chairman of the Mental Health Tribunal, conducting more than 360 mental health hearings since appointment in 2011.  I have been a member of the Charity Appeals Tribunal from 2016, as the committee is aware.</p> <p>  On policy level involvements, I have provided leadership within the legal profession for 35 years, serving as president of Law Society of Ireland and chairman of a number of its committees.  I was president of Mayo solicitors' bar association and I have held other officer roles over the past four decades.  I served on the judicial appointments advisory board from 1999 to 2002 and the Court Services board in the same years.  I served on the appeals board of the Society of Actuaries disciplinary tribunal from 1999 to 2009 and the rules of the superior courts committee from 2002 to 2012.  I was chairman of a preliminary investigation committee of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority and I have been a member of its external panel since 2009.  I developed sports law and sports management expertise through roles such as director with Sport Ireland, national child welfare officer with the Irish Rugby Football Union and judicial officer for rugby competitions.</p> <p>  In business I was appointed to the Press Council of Ireland and served as a board member for two terms, totalling six years, and I served as council vice chairman in 2014.  I have been a director of the O'Dwyer Foundation, a not-for-profit charity, since 1990.  I have been a director and trustee of the Brabazon Park Trust since 1978.  I was a former director of Hope House, an addiction treatment centre established in 1995 from 1995 to 2002; DANA Exploration from 1991 to 1995; and IRD Kiltimagh Limited from 1991 to 2002.  I have been chairman of the National Sports Campus Development Committee from 2015 to date.  I was a director of the Irish Association of Suicidology from 1997 to 2002.  In other areas, I was a former chairman of the board of management of St. Louis Community School for 13 years and the board of management of University Hall SJ for seven years.  I am a former member of the Sports Council of Ireland.</p> <p>  In the sport area, I am currently a director of Sport Ireland and have been a member of Connacht Rugby professional game board since 2011 and chairman in 2014.  I was a member and chairman of the IRFU child welfare committee from 2007 to 2015 and have been a board member of the IRFU charitable trust since 2011.  I have been a member of disciplinary panels for World Rugby, European Rugby and the Six Nations since 2006.  I am judicial officer on those panels for rugby competitions.  I currently honorary legal adviser to a number of sailing, golf, rugby, fishing and other sporting bodies.</p> <p>  The committee will observe that I have and had a number of interests in the voluntary and charitable sector, particularly with the O'Dwyer Cheshire Home, Hope House addiction centre, the Irish Association of Suicidology and schools.  I have served on the board of management on a number of schools, both national and secondary, and I continue to act as a legal adviser to a number of charities, sporting and philanthropic organisations.  The establishment of the charities regulatory authority and now the Charity Appeals Tribunal are an important development in the oversight, transparency and accountability of charities in Ireland.  The Charity Appeals Tribunal is an important addition to the regulatory architecture applying to the charities sector in that it provides the right of appeal by a person whose application to the authority has been refused or in the case of an existing charity whose registration has been revoked.  I will not delay the committee in reciting the provisions of Part 5 of the Act save to say that it will be necessary for the tribunal to put in place rules for the hearing of applications, an appeal form and other related matters.  Work is already under way in the preparation of the necessary rules and procedures.  It is important to ensure that the appeal process will be fair, transparent and relatively simple and does not become cumbersome.  I envisage that most appeals will be made by individuals.</p> <p>  Charities are a very important part of Irish Society.  People in Ireland are extremely generous and deserve assurances that the sector will conduct its business in an honest and professional manner.  Charities should be open and transparent in their activities, particularly with regard to their financial affairs, so that public confidence in them will be maintained and strengthened.  The meitheal and community involvement for people less fortunate than oneself is ingrained in Irish people and society.  We are a generous nation.</p> <p>  The charity sector is involved in the collection and distribution of billions of euro each year and has an involvement with tens of thousands of people who are in need of support.  This is a vital addition to, and often a substitution for, State provision of materials and services.  The charity sector in Ireland is in a good place notwithstanding some high-profile difficulties and concerns over the past few years.  The introduction of the authority and regulator will give added confidence to Irish people in their ongoing continued support of this vital and important sector in Irish society.</p> <p>  Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il libh as ucht bhur gcuid ama a chaitheamh ag &eacute;isteacht liom inni&uacute; agus beidh m&eacute; ag s&uacute;il go m&oacute;r le bhur moladh.  Many thanks for giving the committee's valuable time to listen to me.  If members have any questions, I will be happy to endeavour to answer them.</p></speech>

It is important from the point of view of the committee and the public that we are aware that the tribunal&rsquo;s functions are rather limited.  They only really kick in if the Charities Regulatory Authority either refuses to grant charitable status or the Minister wants to appeal the granting of status.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Like any statutory body, it can only really function if it has a secretariat.  Section 76 of the Charities Act 2009 states that &ldquo;the Minister shall &hellip; provide the tribunal with such and so many staff as he or she considers appropriate&rdquo;.  Have any staff been put in place or is it too early at this stage?</p></speech>

In fact, I met with them last week and two of them are sitting here today.  Accommodation has also been provided in the Valuation Tribunal&rsquo;s office at the back of Holles Street.  It is a temporary measure but at least we have accommodation and secretarial backup.</p></speech>

Section 78 of the Charities Act 2009 states that &ldquo;proceedings before the tribunal shall be conducted in public&rdquo;.  Obviously, there have not been any hearings as of yet.  However, is Mr. O&rsquo;Connor satisfied he has a suitable forum available where the public can hear submissions be made to the tribunal?</p></speech>

As we have hearings, we will have to gauge whether we need different or greater accommodation.  Much of that will depend on whether the Valuation Tribunal is sitting as it has good accommodation.  If we need to have an overflow facility, we will be permitted to use those rooms as well.  There are some consultation rooms at the site as well which I examined last week.  So far, so good.  It is a living process.</p></speech>

He has considerable background and experience.  I wish him well in his new role as chairman of the Charity Appeal Tribunal.</p> <p>  There has been much discussion about the allocation of resources by the Minister to the Charities Regulatory Authority and staffing issues in the agency.  Is Mr. O&rsquo;Connor confident that the staff complement he has been provided with is adequate?  Will the staffing issues in terms of the investigatory powers and oversight of the Charities Regulatory Authority limit the potential future meetings of the appeal tribunal?</p></speech>

As far as I can see, the resources that have been made available to us thus far are adequate.  Time will tell, however.  I do not envisage that the tribunal will be sitting that regularly but we will not know until we see what sort of caseload comes up.  If an issue arises, I will not be shy in making it clear that we need additional resources.  For the present, the staff made available to us in the Department of Justice and Equality are very adequate and extremely helpful.</p> <p>  The staffing issues in the Charities Regulatory Authority are in the public domain.  As I understand it, the number employed in the authority is 36.  I do not know whether that is adequate or not.  The regulator or the chief executive, Mr. John Farrelly, would be the person to talk on that.  Now that Part 4 of the Charities Act, the investigative side of it, has been initiated, it seems the number of staff will need to be increased.  However, I do not know, as this is a matter for the Charities Regulatory Authority.  It is positive that Part 4 has been initiated at least.</p></speech>

It is important we have a consultation about them.  They are all subject to the approval of the Minister ultimately.  I am a firm believer in the use of plain language.  I edited a document some years ago for the National Adult Literacy Agency, NALA, on the use of plain language for legal or quasi-legal proceedings.  It is important we keep this process as simple as possible and not get bogged down in legal jargon.  That is the point from where I am coming on the drafting of the tribunal&rsquo;s rules.  Hopefully, they will be relatively simple for people to follow.  At the end of the day, it will be mainly individuals and not too many professionals coming before the tribunal.</p></speech>

We really do not know.  I do not think there will be a significant caseload initially but we will learn as it goes along.</p> <p>  I do not believe the tribunal will have involvement in Part 4 investigations.

I filled out a form on the website, <i>publicjobs.ie</i>and gave my various credentials.  A decision was then taken on my being appointed to the tribunal.</p></speech>

The question I wished to ask has been partially answered already.  It relates to how grounds for an appeal to the tribunal might work or how the tribunal's approach might differ from the way the regulator originally looked at it.  In other words, is there a framework or will criteria be laid down, a set of three or four grounds, for example?  Will it focus mainly on the decision of the regulator in a narrow sense or will Mr. O'Connor be interpreting it in a broader sense?  What is the type of framework under which an appeal will be able to reach his office having been refused by the regulator?</p></speech>

We are going to be confined, it seems to me, by section 39 of the Act which sets out whether a charity can be registered.  I would expect the regulator to be fair in its procedures and to be very careful.  The regulator must give a reasoned decision as to why an application is being refused.  If there is a refusal and an appeal, obviously the reasons given and the whole process will have to be considered by my office.  We want to keep it as simple as possible but at the same time we must be accountable and, more importantly, fair.  We do not want to start off with a situation where there is a judicial review of a decision of ours simply because we did not follow fair procedures.  </p> <p>  To answer the specific question, there would be a formal notice of appeal.  I would not expect that there would be too much detail in it.  The grounds on which the appeal is taken should be set out, but not too legalistically, as well as the reasons that the applicant feels the appeal should succeed.</p></speech>

There are a lot of very brilliant charities operating in Ireland but I am not quite sure I would be as positive about it being in a good place as Mr. O'Connor.  There are definite problems in the sector and the need for a regulator to be in place and to be given additional powers shows that is the case.  There is, however, a flip side to all of that.  I acknowledge the importance of transparency, openness and conducting business in public, but I worry about a charity getting caught up in a process between the regulator and an appeal which could do quite a lot of damage to it.  In the world we live in, if one searches Google for the name of a charity and the first thing one sees is an appeal to the regulator, even if the charity wins, that could be damaging.  What safeguards have been considered to try to minimise any potential reputational damage for charities which get caught up in this process?</p></speech>

There are approximately 7,900 charities registered with the regulator, arising from the original approximately 8,500 bodies that had charitable status with the Revenue Commissioners.  Since then, approximately 600 have dropped out.  They are all deemed to be registered charities so unless the charity itself wishes to cease to be registered or there are other reasons, that will not change.  The Deputy's question would apply to prospective charities, that is, those which have not yet been established.  It is very important that all charities when presenting a case to the regulator actually set out what they intend to do and make sure that they comply with the overall scheme of what it is to be a charity, the purpose of it and to make sure there is a public benefit to it.  I suspect, without naming any charities, that in the past there was a very general view taken that one could set up a body to help a few people in a local community and that could be regarded as a charity.  One then simply went to the Revenue Commissioners and got a charity number.  That will not apply, as I understand it, going forward and rightly so.  Otherwise, we will not have a properly regulated sector.</p> <p>  Those who set up charities to provide or to help do so out of goodwill but there is an onus on them to make sure that they are doing it properly, have proper objectives and that the powers of the charity are set out correctly.</p></speech>

I was not expecting the traffic to be so bad this morning.  This is my first meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality and while I am a little nervous, I am delighted to be here.  I do not have a specific question for Mr. O'Connor.  I simply wish to congratulate him on his appointment.  He is highly skilled, which is fantastic because the job requires a lot of skill.</p> <p>  I welcome the establishment of the tribunal.  My background is in the charity sector and I know of the difficulties faced by charities.  I also welcome the establishment of Charities Regulatory Authority because it is time for charities to get organised and to sort out their fundraising principles.  As we all know, recent times have been very difficult for the charity sector.  I think this development is fantastic and I look forward to observing the tribunal in action and possibly even working with Mr. O'Connor at some point.  I imagine Mr. O'Connor is facing into a busy time.  </p> <p>  To take up a point made by one of my colleagues, does Mr. O'Connor believe that there will be a lot of appeals?  What is his feeling on what will happen going forward?  Will there be many charities trying to see what is going on?  The Charities Regulatory Authority is only starting up now, in effect, and getting organised.  The issue with Console has made everyone more aware of what is going on.  What is Mr. O'Connor's feeling on how this will progress? Will many charities use the tribunal?</p></speech>

I share two things with her.  One is the nervousness that she had this morning and the second is the traffic problem coming in.  I nearly did not make it.</p> <p>  I do not know, quite frankly, whether we will have a large caseload.  I would hope that we would not.  It is important to remember, as others have pointed out, that when a group of people come together to form a charity now, they know there is a framework there that they must follow.  They should know what is to be done and hopefully they will get guidance and help from the various organisations out there that can assist them in preparing their application.  They must make sure that the trustees of the charity or the company limited by guarantee, as the case may be, understand what they are doing and make sure that they comply with the provisions of the Charities Act and other relevant legislation.  </p> <p>  I do not think we will have many appeals but I do not know for sure.  Perhaps at some stage in the future I can come back before the committee to outline how we are getting on.  By that stage I might have a better idea because it is always easier to answer that sort of question retrospectively rather than prospectively.  My answer is that I do not think there will be a lot of appeals.</p></speech>

I have listened to Senator Black's focus and recognise that Mr. O'Connor's office can only be activated by refusals by the authority or referrals by the Minister, as the case might be.  In terms of the role of the Charities Regulatory Authority and the appeals tribunal, does Mr. O'Connor believe that the full need is being addressed by the entities or structures that are currently in place?  Will they be able to address the concerns referred to by the Senator which are quite widespread in public opinion today <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>high-profile charities where significant payments were made to officers of those charities?</p><p>Senior figures working in the area of oversight of the health sector have, on many occasions, expressed concern that the HSE is funding entities without sufficient oversight or accountability.  Does Mr. O'Connor, in his newly designated role or based on his earlier experience, have a view as to whether or not all of these areas are now being adequately covered, addressed and provided for, or does he believe there is still a need to look at the formulation of entities which have been entrusted to ensure the highest standards and real accountability and transparency across the board?  This, ultimately, is what Se&aacute;n and &Aacute;ine Citizen want to see.  They want confidence restored.</p></speech>

They range from three or four people who come together for one particular purpose to large organisations which have CEOs and staffing and other issues.  It is a very diverse sector and is a wide fan across Irish life.  It is also a very important part of Irish life, as I said in my opening statement, and it needs to be fostered.  As I understand it, the Chairman asked whether the Charities Act 2009, and what has been put in place as a result of the Act, will be adequate to police charities and encourage them to do the right thing and to be open and accountable.  It is a major step but I do not know whether it will work out.  The Charities Regulator has prepared a first statement of strategy, which takes us to 2018.  That sets out what the regulator and the authority will achieve.  The Chairman's question is more relevant to that level than the level at which the tribunal will be involved.  We will be dealing with the small, focused area of appeals relating to failures to register and other such things.  In light of the way in which certain issues came to public attention in the past few years, it is timely.  The question of whether or not it could have been done earlier is one for policy and I will not get into it.  At the end of the day, the enactment is important, the initiation is important and the powers given to the regulator under Part 4 to carry out an investigation are also very important.</p></speech>

That suggests the tribunal has already met as an entity.  Has Mr. O'Connor met with the other four designated colleagues to determine and prepare the rules?  If that is not the case, by whom are the rules being determined?  I noted in the briefing which was circulated that it states that appointments come into effect from 1 August but Mr. O'Connor actually read 1 October into the record.</p></speech>

The members of the tribunal were appointed on 1 August.  There are five, as set out in the Act.  We met informally last week.  I did not want to presume anything as I am only chairman designate and until I have been formally appointed, it would be presumptuous in the extreme to do too much but the tribunal has been established so we will have to get up and running.  There is no point in waiting for the process to be fully completed before we have a meeting.  We discussed the broad parameters and principles of how we might run a hearing and what our rules and procedures will be.  I have drafted a set of rules, which will be circulated to all other members with a request for comments.  It will then go back to the Department for the approval of the Minister.  I want to keep it as simple as possible so that it is not too legalistic.</p></speech>
