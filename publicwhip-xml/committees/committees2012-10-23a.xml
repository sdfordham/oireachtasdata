I thank the officials from my Department, whom I have introduced, for their hard and detailed work on the review and for providing the committee with all the information it required for this meeting and in relation to its further discussions in regard to other sectors.  A large volume of information on allowances has been provided which it is hoped will be of help to the committee.  We are also available to provide further information if members of the committee feel that is useful.</p><p>  Last week, I briefed the committee on the overall aims of the review of public service allowances and the next steps proposed in each sector.  Today, I will speak about allowances which are common to two or more Departments within the Civil Service.  Members will be aware that the allowances review conducted by the Department is the first comprehensive public service-wide attempt to address outdated allowance-based pay structures across the public service, many of which date back to the 1920s and have built up progressively over the years to address many different issues at particular times.  The review to date is the first step of an ongoing process.  It is also only one element of a sustained programme of cost reduction and productivity increases across the public service.</p><p>  Members will be aware from previous discussions that the Minister, Deputy Howlin, and Government have set out a plan to reduce the overall cost of the public sector by 20% between 2008 and 2015, through a variety of different measures.  My purpose here is to speak on the review as it relates to the very small number of Civil Service allowances common to two or more Departments.  The committee has been provided with information in respect of those allowances, the cost of which to the system is &euro;4.7 million, with most being paid to the lowest paid grades in the Civil Service.  I will comment further on these allowances later.  I have also been requested by the committee to discuss allowances paid to Members and parties of the Oireachtas and I am happy to do so.</p><p>  It is important to point out that the term "allowances" covers a wide variety of payment types, namely, reimbursement of expenses, payments for qualifications held and allowances which were introduced in recognition of particular duties being undertaken.  In the context of the review, it was evident that many allowances were used or retained as a supplement to basic salary for particular groups.  This is particularly relevant in the context of those allowances pertaining to the Civil Service.  While they may have been introduced for a valid purpose, in particular to resolve a dispute in the era of pay relativities, they continue to be paid despite that justification for them no longer holds.</p><p>  It is our view that allowances should only be payable in circumstances that meet the criteria set out for the review.  Those criteria are that they should reflect the arduous nature of unsocial hours, including the need to remain on call at weekends and other times, clearly associated with the duties of posts, they should ensure work of additional value is actually received by an employer, or they should cover an actual cost accruing to the employee derived from their employment.  These are the important criteria set out as the basis for this review.</p><p>  The common Civil Service allowances are those in payment on the same basis in two or more Departments across the Civil Service.  These allowances form only a small part of the overall Civil Service pay bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-23a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kieran Coughlan" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012102300004#C00200"><p>I am glad to have this opportunity to address the committee on this issue.  In my letter of 4 October to the clerk to the committee I outlined under broad headings, the various allowances paid to Members.  Article 15.15 of the Constitution stipulates that provision be made by law for the payment of allowances to Members of the Oireachtas in respect of their duties as public representatives and for travelling and other facilities in connection with these duties.  Expenditure under these various headings has fallen broadly in line with other cuts in the public service generally.  I have circulated a detailed breakdown of these figures relating to each allowance.</p><p>  From this breakdown it is clear the principal allowance is the parliamentary standard allowance, PSA, which is provided for under the 2009 legislation which consolidated the allowances into one allowance, the PSA, with two tranches, namely, the travel and accommodation allowance, TAA, and the public representation allowance, PRA.  The scheme which came into operation in March 2010 was also innovative in providing greater transparency in terms of verification and coincided with a number of budgetary cuts imposed by the then Minister for Finance across the public service.</p><p>  To put the PSA scheme in perspective, since there is often incorrect speculation on what allowances our parliamentarians are provided with, the total spend on Members' expenses this year will be approximately &euro;11.7 million or 11% of the total parliamentary budget.  The corresponding figure for Members' salaries is just under &euro;20 million or 18.3%.  The total spend on allowances and salaries this year, therefore, will be &euro;31.7 million.  This represents a fall of approximately 16% since 2008 when the total spend was &euro;36.7 million and represents a tiny fraction - one thousandth - of total State expenditure for 2012.  Of course, this is not to belittle what is a significant sum or to say that we should not have excellent monitoring, audit and control systems around the expenditure, which we do, but simply to position the sums involved in the overall picture.</p><p>  All allowances bar two are statutorily based and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, as Mr. Watt indicated, is the regulatory authority who, under law, sets the rates and scope of the allowances.  The PSA is under review by the Minister.  A review was earmarked originally to be undertaken within a year of the new scheme but was delayed due to the 2011 general election.  For obvious reasons of a potential conflict of interest, neither the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission nor Members can set the rates or scope of these allowances.  However, as an aside and in view of the apparent persistent negativity in regard to any expenditure in this area, the question arises as to whether it is time for the Minister's role in setting the rates and scope of allowances to be changed to an independent body, as is the practice in other countries.  I suggest consideration of this option from the perspective of ensuring public trust in how these public funds are accounted for but also as it may help insulate our parliamentary democracy and our parliamentarians from unfair commentary that is corroding the public's trust.</p><p>  Longer serving committee members will recall that the higher body on remuneration used to include Members' allowances in its review in the late 1980s and 1990s.  While the review body decided subsequently in 1996 in effect to leave claims for improvements in expense allowances and facilities to the Minister for Finance, many of the key elements of the system of allowances as we knew it up to the change in 2010 arose from analysis and recommendations by the independent review body.  Unlike other Civil Service and public service allowances, Members' allowances, being statutorily based, are not amenable to being the subject of business cases.  For all of these reasons, it may be more appropriate to have the review of allowances for Members restored in the future to an independent body review mechanism.</p><p>  In the context of this committee's review of allowances, it is important to draw a distinction between allowances for Members and other public service allowances.  By definition Members of the Oireachtas are not public servants in the accepted sense of being an employee.  The allowances and expenses system for Members is thus not a regime of company expenses but a series of payments provided for in the Constitution and set mainly by law arising from election to or appointment as a Member of the Oireachtas.  The payment of the expenses incurred is subject to the normal system of Civil Service administrative controls, and the rates applicable for Members' travel and accommodation expenses are based on the rates payable to public servants.</p><p>  The role of the Houses of the Oireachtas Service is thus to ensure the payments are made in compliance with our system of financial controls and in accordance with the laws providing for them.  In this regard it should be noted the statutory schemes require self-certification by Members and thus operate to a very significant extent on trust.  That being said, there is a robust system of financial controls in place.  For example, the Members' public representation allowance has been subject to two independent external audits since its inception in 2010.  Moreover, in 2009 the internal auditor for the Houses of the Oireachtas Service conducted an audit of the payment systems and administrative control procedures for Members' allowances and the processing of these allowances was found to be satisfactory with many strong controls in place.</p><p>  I have tried to give a brief pen picture of the Members' allowance regime and to draw the distinction between these and other allowances under the committee's examination and I have emphasised, as with all public expenditure, that the expenses are subject to rigorous financial controls within the relevant law.</p></speech>

We have Civil Service controls in audit, and so on.  Our system of controlling the money is robust.  We cannot do anything about the fact that the law allows that the option be given to Members to have unvouched or vouched expenses.  That is set down in law and we have to work within the law.</p></speech>

Deputies, Ministers and Senators can opt for an entirely transparent system or for one that is at least partially unvouched.  I accept that Mr. Coughlan is not the person who set out the parameters of this system, but it is completely and utterly illogical.  It makes no sense to offer a Deputy, Senator or Minister the option of getting an annual allowance of almost &euro;9,000, unvouched and paid in two instalments, plus the balance in a vouched manner.  That looks extremely hokey, as it were.  The average citizen would say there is something not quite right about it.  It looks cumbersome.  Could Mr. Coughlan tell us the number of Deputies, Ministers and Senators who avail of options D, B and C, respectively?</p></speech>

I appreciate the documentation he has given us, but it is not sufficient for the committee to have an informed discussion on the subject.  We need to know the amount of unvouched payments.  How much money is going through the system in representative or secretarial allowances for which there is no paper trail?  It would be useful if Mr. Coughlan could provide that breakdown.  The overall figure is &euro;18.2 million.  What portion of that is not vouched and to whom is that unvouched portion paid?  Among those receiving these payments, can Mr. Coughlan distinguish Deputies, Ministers and Senators?</p></speech>

That payment should be also dispensed with.</p><p>  Let us look at the costs associated with the party whips.

I am not making a judgment on the integrity of any Member in the use of these moneys.  The problem resides with the fact that it is not vouched, and that causes a problem not just for the system and the taxpayer but for the Members because to safeguard all of us, surely the smart thing to do would be to have a system where we can all verify, in concrete terms, how much we received and on precisely what we spent it.  That seems to be good common sense.  I take it from Mr. Coughlan's head movement that he agrees.</p></speech>

I would find that very useful.</p><p>  I wish to raise one final matter with Mr. Watt regarding the party leader's allowance.  Understandably, hard-pressed taxpayers would question the existence of a party leader's allowance.  If we are going to reform politics and phase out corporate donations with all the negativity that brings, the party leader's allowance becomes all the more central in terms of funding democracy but, as with other things, it must be accounted for.  It jumps out as very odd that the allowances paid to each of the political parties must be accounted for, which is as it should be, but that payments made to Independent Deputies and Senators are not scrutinised in the same way.  Can Mr. Watt explain this system of payments to Independent Deputies and Senators and how much they account for in total?  I might be wrong on this and perhaps there is a system for scrutinising how much is paid and where that money is spent.</p></speech>

I think it cost &euro;7.4 million in 2011.  The payments for Independent Deputies averaged between &euro;39,000 and &euro;34,000.  As the Deputy specified, the system as it pertains to Independents is different from the allowances which fund the political parties.  This is a matter for our Minister.  I have written to the committee on his behalf stating that he would welcome the views of this committee in this regard and that he has given an undertaken to look at the question of the leader's allowance.  As the Deputy can appreciate, civil servants like me prefer to keep out of discussions on how the political system is funded.  That is only right and proper, but the Minister has welcomed inputs from this committee.  He is undertaking a review and he has made that clear.  He may have mentioned that when he came before the committee on the previous occasion.</p></speech>

I think he has said he would welcome the views of this committee in respect of these issues.

I will finish by giving a view on this to the Minister's Department in particular.  The era of unvouched expenses has to end and that is an absolute necessity.  The scale of the allowances being paid must be revisited with an eye to cost reduction.  Certainly, additional payments for duties such as the chairmanship of a committee or taking on the duties of Whip in the current climate simply must be abolished.  In saying this, I am conscious that the Department has made some progress and that savings that could be made in this Oireachtas will not be the be-all and end-all in terms of our economic fortunes but, none the less, it is important that, first, we are efficient and, second, as a matter of public confidence, taxpayers are assured that every effort has been made to modify and to save, and we start with ourselves when we look for cost savings.</p></speech>

A former Minister, Charlie McCreevy, in particular, reformed the system and built it up into what it is now.  I understand at that time there were very significant discussions with Members of the House about this.  The Minister has committed to looking at these.  He has said explicitly that he would welcome the views of the committee.  He will welcome the views of the committee in respect of where he should go in this area.</p></speech>

While I know we are focusing on amounts, it is also important to keep principles in mind.  We can talk later on about allowances in the public sector.  If an allowance is not justified as core warranted pay, then it should be reviewed.  If there is an expense for a Deputy or Senator that is not vouched, then it should be vouched.  We should keep the principles in mind and not just the amounts.  Some of the debate so far has focussed on the little amount of money it might save, but that principle should also be borne in mind.</p><p>  I wish to put some questions to Mr. Coughlan about the Oireachtas commission.

There were a lot of improvements in it in the sense that at that point there were various allowances, like miscellaneous allowances and telephone allowances, which were paid automatically to Deputies regardless of the usage.  These have now been transferred into a scheme where, potentially if they go for a vouched allowance, they are audited.  It is based on usage.  There are major improvements in that, plus the verification of attendance which was another big step forward.</p></speech>

It is probably better all round to follow the practice in other parliaments and go for an external body to review it.

In effect, for the Government parties, the first ten Members receive &euro;71,520, that is, there is a payment in respect of the first ten Members of each of the Government parties.  Thereafter, from 11 Members to 30, it is &euro;57,214 and for more than 30 Members, it is &euro;28,000.  There is a different regime for Senators and then for the Independents, I think it is &euro;41,000.  The amounts for the individual parties was up on the monitors a second ago.  The actual amounts for the different parties are included in something we sent to the committee and now can be seen.  This obviously is based on the votes cast in the most recent general election.  Members can see the position, which is separated out for the political parties and the Independent Deputies.</p></speech>

As I already have reached my 120 days of attendance, can I simply stay at home?  That system does not work and I can understand the reason Deputies from outside Dublin would be frustrated with it as well, because it is unfair to them.  While people expect Members to come in here to legislate and create laws for the land, they also want them to prove they are coming to work.  It seems somewhat bizarre and I believe there is a better and fairer way of doing it that would protect Members' reputations.  If it does not have the risk mentioned by Mr. Coughlan, it would be a good thing.</p><p>  I wish to turn to some specifics regarding the expenses that Members can claim.  I will look at my own as a Deputy, because I am trying to understand them myself.  Deputies have the vouched &euro;25,000 amount.  This gets paid as a fixed amount every month to each Deputy.  Deputies must then keep their own accounts and at the end of the year, one returns the amount one has not spent, if one has not spent it all.  I understand a random selection of accounts then is undertaken-----</p></speech>

The commission, after both audits, drew up guidelines to facilitate that because, as I stated, there were issues about what should and should not be included.  The guidelines were made on that point.  It arose from "expenses, including any statutory deductions, for the purchase of secretarial support, public relations, information technology ... training services under a contract ... [and] persons engaged or expenses incurred under Regulation 9 [of] the Regulations of 2008" and then ministerial staff employed under the guidelines on staffing.  There were a number of issues in the mix that Members themselves found.  I have described this as teething problems.</p></speech>

If a school visits and a Deputy treats the teachers and children to a Coke and crisps, they get criticised for so doing.  However, that is coming from Deputies' own salaries, which I consider to be correct.  There has been a commentary in the media about an allowance for dry-cleaning, but Members cannot claim expenses for that under their allowance system.</p></speech>

First is the travel and accommodation allowance, which is provided for under the legislation.  It is based on the distance from Leinster House.  We need to sign in - electronically or otherwise - a minimum of 120 times per annum.  For the record, I am at No 98 today.

The Houses of the Oireachtas simplified the administration of the expenses regime, if one likes to call it that, as part of the last change and it led to savings in staff costs.  Obviously, in the past people used to have to put in a claim each month for their travel outlining in a manual docket the number times they travelled to Leinster House and the payment came through in due course.  Is it just for administrative convenience that the amount to be paid for travel and accommodation is based on a Member's annual expected amount of travel to and from Leinster House and in his or her constituency?  For administrative convenience that is divided by 12 and we get it on a monthly basis.  Am I correct in saying that?</p></speech>

Mr. Coughlan mentioned the view of politics.  I would be slightly critical of how payments are issued to us and the same applies to Senators.  It operates as follows.  Based on the distance from Leinster House and if a Member travels his or her required amount per annum, his or her payment is divided into 12 equal instalments and he or she gets it by electronic payment at the end of each month.  We had a controversy in the month of August when many Deputies were not here.  Given how the Houses of the Oireachtas Service processes the payments, the public understandably came to the conclusion that Deputies were claiming and were being paid travel expenses to and from the D&aacute;il when many Deputies did not travel.  That system of payment was damaging to the body politic.</p><p>  At the end of each month the Houses of the Oireachtas Service knows how many times we clocked in during the month.  Given that it is in the service's computerised system it would not be too complicated to issue the cheque as follows.  If I travel to Leinster House six times one month, 22 times the next month and seven times the following month, I would get paid for that.  It should not be an administrative burden.  I do not need to submit documentation - it is all on the electronic fob.  During months when the D&aacute;il is in recess and over the Christmas period, when Members would not be travelling to and from Leinster House, we would avoid cheques being sent to Members for what the public rightly believe is for travel to and from Leinster House.  Instead of taking the handy administrative procedure of dividing the annual amount by 12 monthly payments, the service should pay it on the amount of travel undertaken and have it reflected monthly.  Then we might find a number of visits during the months of March, April and May and a lower amount of visits in July and August.  The payments to us would then reflect our attendance here, as they should.  Treating it differently has been damaging to the body politic.  There is no extra cost or saving, but that episode was damaging.  It was not because any individual Deputy was getting money he or she was not-----</p></speech>

There are two ways of looking at the fully vouched one.  Obviously, the fully vouched one subject to authentication is the most expensive one for the taxpayer.  That allowance is &euro;25,700 versus the unvouched allowance of &euro;15,000.  That is a difference of &euro;10,700.  It is more expensive for the taxpayer where we put in the vouched receipts and less expensive if we go the unvouched route.  I understand there has been much criticism here today about unvouched expenses but could Mr. Coughlan put the following figure into the mix?  Mr. Coughlan said earlier that 39 Deputies claimed the lower, unvouched amount.  If those 39 Deputies claimed the full amount, the extra &euro;10,700, it would be an extra cost of &euro;612,300 to the taxpayer.  If the 12 Ministers who are claiming the smaller amount claimed the maximum vouched amount, it would be an extra cost of &euro;96,000 to taxpayer.  If the 44 Senators claimed the maximum vouched amount as opposed to the less expensive unvouched amount, it would be an extra cost of &euro;253,000.  Moving from the unvouched and less expensive cost to the taxpayer would cost an extra &euro;961,300 to vouch.</p></speech>

I know they are subject to authentication and if a person does not spend or incur all that expense, they might have to return some money at the end of the year.  However, I am sure the majority of people on the vouched allowance claim the full allowance.  Is that the case?  I would assume so.</p></speech>

I will take the simplest one, which is the director's allowance.  A principal officer in a Department goes through a competition and is appointed to director - I believe &euro;11,000, &euro;12,000 or thereabouts is the increase in pay.  So rather than having a pay-scale director, they stay on the PO scale and they get an allowance.  It is analogous to the situation in the education system where a teacher is made principal and gets an allowance for being a principal.  That component is called the principal allowance when, of course, it should be a different pay scale for principal - absolutely.  It is just the way the system has built up over time.  Our preference would be - the Minister has said this - that allowances that are clearly pay for, as the Deputy says, higher duties for different responsibilities should be called pay.  That is the exercise we are going to have to engage in to clear all this up and clean it up.  Then one will have those elements that are not being paid for higher duties where there are different categories and focus on those.  I absolutely agree with the Deputy.  There are so many of them and the complexity of them is such that it is very difficult to get-----</p></speech>

There is a competition for that post.  Somebody gets an allowance for that job.  It is a job which involves being there all the time - weekends - always available to the Minister.  There are more responsibilities associated with the job.  It is a very responsible job to ensure that the Minister is looked after and so on.  So there is an allowance for that, which reflects higher duties and different responsibilities.  The position had been that one retained half of that when one left.  The policy now is that one will not retain that.</p></speech>

If one thinks about the director's allowance, that is clearly a new level and that should be pay.  For the private secretary to administer, there is an allowance for a period - for a defined period.  So that is higher pay for a period but in the system we have it is easier to say one is getting an allowance and then half of it is going to be taken away when one is no longer doing that job.  If one calls that pay, then people say "Well, you're going to then cut my pay when I return to normal duties."  However, the point the Deputy makes is correct.</p></speech>

The office accommodation is for people doing their work at home.  I presume the person would have to prove he or she has an office at home.  How is the uniform allowance verified?  Is that for someone who gets a uniform?  Presumably he or she must prove he or she still has it in order to get the allowance.  How does it work?</p></speech>

In respect of a service officer who is in receipt of an allowance, a much better system would be to modify the pay structures to reflect the reality of these higher duties.  A service officer who as a key holder is required to undertake extra responsibilities in terms of being on call whenever something happens receives an allowance of &euro;33 per week, which is not a considerable amount.  However, the allowance is in effect part of the service officer's pay.  The proposal in respect of these types of allowances is that they be reflected in future pay structures.</p></speech>

I had a look at the business case for this allowance, which states that given the huge increase in the use of e-mail in the past ten years, with a related drop in ordinary mail and so on, it is probable that the volume of franking required has diminished significantly and will continue to do so.  These are the types of outlying allowances which it appears are at the core of some of the difficulties that have arisen.  In my view a person whose job it is to operate a franking machine should not be paid an additional allowance for doing so.  How is it proposed to address this allowance?</p></speech>

The person assigned to the task was paid an allowance for undertaking this work in addition to his or her other duties.  It is a legacy work practice which is perhaps dated.  This allowance falls into the category of having to be amalgamated in some way.  Like the Deputy some people would wonder why a person should be paid an allowance for doing something which should now be an integral part of his or her work.  I do not know the history of that allowance but I am sure there was some deal done, which was part of an attempt to modernise the manner in which the postal system in the Civil Service operated.  I imagine that is what happened.</p></speech>

There is so much detail involved one might never establish anything.  There appears to be a few different parcels into which all of these allowances are being categorised, one of which is additional duties, which at a time in the history of the State were huge duties in respect of which people were paid extra.  These have been overtaken by the passage of time but the payment remains.</p></speech>

This gets to the complexity of the review in terms of the examination of 1,100 allowances, some of which date back to the 1920s and others which were added to for a variety of different reasons, including changes in technology, IR situations, the need to deal with a particular group of workers and so on.  We tried to put some structure on this in the context of justifying retention of the allowances for those currently in receipt of them, suspension of them for new entrants, abolition for all groups or amendment of them.  Some of the allowances may remain but will be amended.  For example, we considered issues such as whether as an employer we are getting value for money in terms of on-call payments.  We propose to abolish, modify and negotiate other allowances.</p><p>  We have tried, based on the criteria as set out by the Deputy, to put the allowances into different categories and to rationalise them in that way.</p></speech>

Their colleagues who were not blessed with children did not get this payment.  It was first paid in 1925 and was extended in the 1970s by way of equality legislation to women.  It is fascinating to look back at how individual aspects of allowances built up.</p></speech>

The Deputy will note from the table that 853 people received payment in 2011 in respect of availability for work on a Saturday.  The amount in respect of Sunday is lower.  Also included are on-call payments.  For example, part of the job of a small number of staff in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is management of the server for the public system.  They are on-call at various times to deal with issues such as cyber attacks and so on.  This is a feature within the system.  Various shift allowances are also paid.  We have asked Departments to examine whether we are getting value for money in respect of on-call allowances, whether we need a particular number of people on-call and if this is appropriate given how people are now paid and our current fiscal situation.  These types of allowances are referred to as premium payments.</p><p>  While in the Civil Service the amount paid out by way of premium payments is quite modest, in the health system they amount to &euro;400 million to &euro;500 million.

As such, core pay would not be paid on a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. basis, with additional premium payments for evening or weekend work.  The working week would be defined based on the business needs of the entity.  There have been some changes in this regard under the Croke Park agreement, including roster reforms and adjustment of hours worked.

Apart from the allowances I mentioned, there are none for grades above this in the Civil Service.  Allowances are not a feature of the system.  We have repeatedly made the point, but it does not permeate the public discourse because it can get noisy and confused, that a large majority of allowances are considered part of core pay and are for lower income groups and front-line employees in various sectors.  As the committee goes through its review in the coming week, it will see this is also the case for other sectors.</p></speech>

We have spoken about allowances in the public service and Civil Service and one knows what was expected of the paperkeeper or franker in respect of the allowance they received.  However, it appears we are locked into a system of payments and no one has related these payments to the costs involved in being a Member of the D&aacute;il or Seanad.  Such figures could be applied to the various allowances.  The reason I am raising this is because I have always argued allowances should be vouched.  Someone should quantify what it is all about.  My question is with regard to who will address this.  We fob in here for a certain number of days, but no one fobs me in or out of my constituency office when I work there.  No one physically checks on the size my office, how I conduct my business or how long I am there.</p><p>  Deputy McDonald referred to the Chairman's allowance.</p></speech>

I came here today and spoke about the allowances in respect of 35,000 civil servants and the &euro;4.7 million cost just in case the media have not picked up on that point.  This is a total of &euro;4.7 million in allowances for 35,000 civil servants.  I have been able to give the committee the numbers of people in each category and the spending on each of those and that is for a system of 35,000 people.  Our responsibility relates to those people and the other people who make the 292,000 in the public service.  We have many issues to deal with, including the troika and budgets.  The Chairman's questions are a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission and they are not difficult to answer.</p></speech>

That constituency office allowance was reduced to &euro;8,000 with no input from anybody here.  A Minister sets the rates and scope of it.  We have a professional input into it and benchmark against the office and rural and city areas but it is the Minister who sets the rates.</p></speech>

To take a simple example, we fob in here and nobody seems to take account of what I do in my constituency office.  I could stay in bed for the rest of the year once I fob in 120 days here.

Most of the little corner shops in the country will submit their affairs to the Revenue Commissioners every year.  They will pay their auditor and submit their figures.  Did the Houses of the Oireachtas Service look at the proposal that people should have their affairs audited?  Rather than the Houses of the Oireachtas taking the full cost of this, each Member would have his or her accounts audited and be investigated at the end of the year or some other time in the same way as the Revenue Commissioners would investigate small enterprises up and down Ireland.  </p></speech>

Could I get an explanation of some of the terms used initially.  In the column entitled decision taken in review, does the phrase "approved for payment to new beneficiaries" mean that it maintains for those new people?  Does the phrase "allowances subject to review or modification" mean that it is part of the 88 being reviewed?</p></speech>

We recognise that these are elements of pay that have affected allowances and need to be called what they are.  Apart from the delegates' allowance, which has been abolished, none of these is part of the 88.  These will be subject to review modification and will also be part of the medium-term approach in terms of pay consolidation.</p></speech>

Supervisory allowances are very clearly paid where somebody might be brought in.  There is a pay rate for the head services officer grade but there would be an allowance for somebody who is brought in, often after a competition, as a deputy supervisor or, as Mr. Watt suggested, as an officer in charge of a building subject to a head supervisor who is in charge of a complex.</p><p>   Allowances including the driving and franking allowances, many of which date from the dawn of time, were brought in to account for additional roles.  While a services officer may be paid according to a services-officer scale, some services officers have functions that were regarded as being of higher responsibility, certainly at the time in question.  Being in charge of a franking machine, for example, involves financial responsibilities so an allowance would have been introduced at the time in question to reflect responsibilities beyond those of a standard services officer.  Clearly, these pay structures are now not reflective of the sorts of normal flexibilities we expect of civil servants, including those at service office grade.  As in other sectors where allowance-based pay structures are in place, we intend to consider introducing a more modern pay structure reflective of the fact that one officer might have responsibility that is at a very low level while another officer might have a responsibility that is at a higher level.  The allowances, however, would not have titles such as "driving allowance" or "franking allowance".  The system would allow for the movement of persons into different roles.  This is work that has been done in a number of different areas; it simply has not been done yet for the services officers.  It is the sort of work we would like to do on the pay structures of services officers.  It takes time, however, because one must do pay banding, for example.  It is a more elaborate exercise than could be carried out in-----</p></speech>

An allowance was put in place when the associated duty would have been new or attached to a position of some responsibility, or, as Ms Buckley said, when it involved looking after a particular area.  We are trying to tidy it all up.</p><p>  The key issue for the committee is that there is a plan to rationalise the structures to have a more modern pay approach.  The amounts of money are modest and the numbers of people who claim the allowances comprise a small proportion of the overall number.  However, we accept that we need to finish the exercise and work towards a more modern system that would, in addition to addressing the allowance issue, define clearly the duties and responsibilities in a way that suits business needs of today as opposed to those of the 1980s or another period.</p></speech>

It is a very common experience, including in the private sector.  One determines the normal roles and functions of a person and then puts him or her onto a particular pay band.  Instead of saying that somebody who might occasionally drive a car or van for their work should get a particular allowance or half an allowance, one says that if an officer is on a particular pay band, driving a vehicle is a normal part of his or her work.  Therefore, driving on a particular day reflects the pay band and it is part of the flexibility required in a normal working arrangement.</p><p>  The description the Deputy read in the first column is a description of what the allowance was designed to cover when it was introduced or of how it has evolved over the years.  That is no longer fit for a more modern and more flexible public service.  We must move from that to a structure that aligns more closely with the normal flexibilities we require in employment.</p></speech>

There has been a significant reduction in the number of service attendants in the system.  There have been pay savings across the board, greater flexibilities and more redeployments.  We are always told of service officers doing much more, being spread across several offices because their colleagues who used to look after office X have moved on, etc.  The Croke Park agreement has delivered office micro-changes and the co-operation that exists now might not have been forthcoming in the past.</p><p>  To be blunt, we are engaged in a process with the services office in this regard and it is not our priority to go after allowances for the lowest paid groups in the public service, as they are few in number and account for &euro;4.7 million out of a pay bill of &euro;15.3 billion.  We are referring to 0.34% of Civil Service pay, a rounding error in the context of the overall pay bill.</p></speech>

As the information had been compiled, it would have been an interesting exercise to undertake and the committee would have learned a great deal.  Such a review had not been performed previously.  The information would have provided transparency as to how such matters operate in the public sector.</p><p>  The explanation for the forklift allowance might be the best in the world and retaining it might be justified.  As it dates back to the 1950s, I am sure that Mr. Watt will find something in the file explaining why it was granted.  However, a thorough business case for retaining it was requested.  In answer to the first paragraph, which asks what the employer receives in return for the allowance, the answer is "Driving a forklift".  The other questions of whether the allowance is cost effective and represents value for money are not answered.  This is not a business case.  I have made this point previously.  Like Mr. Watt, I am interested in the details.  The Minister is also interested, as we have discussed the issue.</p></speech>

Mr. Watt correctly pointed out that the total spend in question is &euro;4.7 million, with the numbers employed in the Civil Service at 35,000.  On this basis, it is small beans.  None the less, I will make a point about the work that is under way.  A system such as this does civil servants a great disservice.  Open to scrutiny as it is, in many cases it is subject to ridicule simply because the naming of the allowances is outdated.</p><p>  I recommend that the system of rationalising pay, be it via pay bands or another agreed method, protect the earning power of people on the lowest rungs and in the middle ranks of the Civil Service.  Previously, I told Mr. Watt and the Minister that any reform must have a keen eye towards equity within the system.  There are significant disparities.</p><p>  We can pick through each of the allowances.  The delegates allowance is gone, but while the allowances for unsocial hours, watchmen, office accommodation, uniforms and so on are worthy, we must see the wood from the trees.  The reformed payment system is the bigger picture.</p><p>  Mr. Watt stated: "No duty-based allowance is payable to senior management such as Secretaries General or assistant secretaries".</p></speech>

I apologise for being late as I was in another meeting.  The point made by Deputy McDonald is very fair.  Many of these allowances are doing a disservice to people in the public service, and a number of people I have met who are civil and public servants are nearly embarrassed by the legacy system that exists.  They want to see it reformed.  Where an allowance is pay for additional responsibilities, such a system also exists in the private sector.  People doing a different job would get additional pay, and calling it an allowance is a bit of a misnomer.  Such payments are grouped with allowances that are indefensible and outdated.</p><p>  If the witness has answered any of my questions, he should feel free to tell me.  I will certainly make my contribution to the committee's report on the business cases.  The phrase "business cases" leaves much to be desired.  I have read many of these and they are not really business cases because they are very sparse on detail.  In some cases they do not answer all the questions that have been put.  I take the point that resources are deployed to where the most savings can be made for the taxpayer but this committee will have quite a bit to say about the issue of business cases.</p><p>  We spoke about the 1,100 allowances but where do we want to get to in terms of numbers?  How far are we down the road?  I presume that even after we have carried out wonderful reforms and streamlined elements into core pay, there will be a number of remaining allowances.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-23a.550" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Watt" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012102300018#R01200"><p>I agree with the Deputy about the legacy.  Within the Department we are trying to deal with a variety of legacy issues across the public service in this and other areas.  There must be a sense of realism in that even with the burning platform of our current fiscal deficit, there is the issue of the system's capacity to address these within a timeframe.  I share the Deputy's views about allowances, and the way this has been portrayed has not been very good for the public service, with much misinformation in the public domain.  We must move on to modernise the structures, ensuring that pay reflects higher duties.</p><p>  With regard to the business cases, perhaps that was not the best way to describe many of the submissions, although some are better than others.  We welcome the views of the Deputy and the committee in that regard.  We initiated this process, which had never been done before, and colleagues deserve credit for providing enormous amounts of information and getting to the bottom of an element of the pay bill which was very unclear.  People did not previously have good sight on this but that has been remedied.  The Minister and colleagues should be commended on starting the review, although there has not been much credit because of how it worked out.  I accept the point about the business cases.</p><p>  From the 1,100 allowances, I suspect that after a certain period we will have a good deal fewer.  The best way to view this may be through the value of the allowances.  The main elements that formulate the largest part of the pay bill will be in some way incorporated into pay and there will be clearer pay scales and structures.  We wish for the qualifications and principal allowance for teachers, or the rent allowance for garda&iacute;, for example, which make up the largest portion of the pay bill, to be subsumed - as the Minister noted - into a sensible pay structure.  I imagine there will be fewer allowances and people will not have as much fun as we have had going through them all.</p></speech>

We will see how we go on that.  We indicated the end of February for the completion of that process.  There are other key issues in modifying pay structures in the medium term - it depends on different issues in other sectors - but the Minister has set out an ambition to modernise the process as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

Representatives of the Defence Forces and the Department of Defence were before us last week, as the witness is probably aware.  I have been critical of the Croke Park agreement for adopting what I see as a catch-all way of treating everyone, regardless of income, the same.  It has created a two-tier process in how we view different people in the public sector.</p><p>  When we had representatives of the Defence Forces before us last week, it was nearly embarrassing to be an Irish citizen, let alone a public representative, when we saw the measly salaries that some privates in the Defence Forces earn.  From what I can see, when the nation had money, rather than addressing the fact that some privates in the Army earned in and around the minimum wage, if not less, we threw them a few allowances.  Rather than grappling with the fact that these people were grossly underpaid and earning less than the minimum wage, we gave out the allowances.  As a result, we have created a system of allowances, some of which sound ridiculous.</p></speech>

The average pay across the Defence Forces is &euro;47,000.  For the average private, the basic pay is very low and just above the minimum wage.  For whatever reason, it does not seem possible to have a sensible and rational discussion about the pay bill or the public sector.  I will not mention the Croke Park agreement because Deputy Murphy might get upset again.  We do not seem to be able to have a rational discussion.</p><p>  The average pay in the public sector is &euro;54,000, with 80% of people being paid less than &euro;60,000.  That is not what I hear when I read the discourse and coverage.  We must continue to get the facts out there and have a debate in order that people understand that the majority of public servants are teachers, garda&iacute;, nurses, local authority employees and civil servants who collect taxes and make social welfare payments.  They are not the small number of so-called bureaucrats sitting behind desks on Merrion Street.  There are a few of us but not many.</p><p>  We need time to get across what a public service of 290,000 people is about.  We must detail what and who they are, the service they provide and their pay.  As Deputy McDonald noted, the majority do a great job and provide a great service to people.  We just do not hear that out there anymore and we do not hear the other side of the story.</p></speech>

It is an observation to think about more than a direct question.  We speak about office accommodation being provided in Leinster House for Deputies whose staff are based here.  That is fine and I have no issue with that.  I am just trying to separate them from those who are claiming.  I am also following on from questions asked by the Chairman.  He asked if anybody had checked out the cost of running a constituency operation, whether in Dublin 4 or west Cork.  The cost might be different.  I would link that to the remarks made by Mr. Watt.</p><p>  There has been about a 10% reduction in public service numbers in recent years.  Even in the Civil Service, the numbers have dropped by about 3,000.  Let me make a suggestion as a cost saving measure in regard to expenses for Deputies.  It is something I have suggested publicly on a number of occasions previously.  If Deputies choose to have their staff based in Leinster House, that is fine but if Deputies do not, they should be allocated space in government or a local government office in their constituency.</p><p>  Some 3,000 staff have left the Civil Service.  It was said that 127 of us have claimed a grant for setting up a constituency office.  I can think of no constituency where there would not be space in a government office, a Department which has been decentralised or a local council office.  We might not even need to go to the HSE. A formula could be worked out that a Deputy is entitled to 1,200 sq. ft of office space to cover staff and meet members of the public.  That could be allocated to a Deputy.  I believe there is excess space and probably excess furniture as a result of the 3,000 staff who have left.</p><p>  Some people might resist this and say the Deputy must be independent of the public service because sometimes we must battle with public servants and we do not want to meet them in the canteen at lunch time.  However, there is an opportunity, if people think outside the box, to provide space in public buildings.  There would be no basis whatsoever for Deputies to submit any expenses, vouched or unvouched, for constituency offices.  It would result in a major saving and a rationalisation of locations.  It could be done at minimal cost and it would remove Deputies from the process entirely.  People would see one's office in a government building in a town.  I am sure the OPW could offer a suite of facilities with the required space and suitable for any Deputy.  </p><p>  We are in an unusual position.  To do our job as semi-public servants, we have to source and pay for our own office accommodation, desks and telephones and then put in a claim.  No one else in the public service is expected to provide their own accommodation and seek reimbursement for the cost of providing their own telephone and photocopier.  We should be offered facilities in a government office in our constituencies.  It would remove this item from the debate.  I ask Mr. Watt to think about that.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to provide some information to the committee on the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, and its role in the agriculture industry.  I shall briefly provide information on the functions of ICBF and how technology is used by the organisation.</p><p>  ICBF was established in 1998 as a non-profit industry good and non-State body.  It followed many years of discussion around how the Irish cattle breeding industry might be better organised to remove duplication and increase the rate of genetic gain in our cattle.  It is a unique organisation, with its shareholders combining the farm organisations of the IFA and ICMSA, milk recording organisations and artificial insemination organisations - many of which originated from the traditional dairy co-operative structure - along with the dairy and beef breed associations.  Thus it is owned, one way or another, by farmers.  It provides services, directly and indirectly to all farmers in Ireland.  It is a genuine example of the potential of a co-operative type infrastructure when operated to its full capability.</p><p>  ICBF created a database to provide the information needed for effective cattle breeding decisions at all levels in the industry.  The most difficult aspect of any database is establishing a timely flow of clean, accurate and comprehensive data.  One of the key features of the ICBF database infrastructure is the removal of duplication in data collection.  For example, in 1998, a dairy farmer involved in milk recording and herd-book registrations would have to communicate on five occasions about a single calving event.  By 2002, with the introduction of ICBF animal events, only one notification of that event was required to satisfy all cattle breeding requirements.  The measure has saved costs, increased data accuracy, increased farmer participation and made cattle breeding information more relevant and valuable to all Irish farmers.</p><p>  ICBF has an annual budget in the region of &euro;5 million.  In broad terms, our income comes in the form of a tag contribution from farmers, which accounts for 20%, a Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine operating grant, which accounts for 20% and which covers the cost of activities the ICBF took over from the Department, service income, which is about 40%, and the national development plan capital grant, which accounts for the remaining 20%.  ICBF provides employment to 35 people and is based in rural west Cork.  It also provides a contract for a further 35 people in the provision of weight recording and linear scoring services throughout rural Ireland.</p><p>  I shall outline the functions of ICBF.  First, it generates genetic evaluations or breeding values for animals based on the ancestry and performance data available nationally and internationally.  It is licensed by the Department to generate national genetic evaluations.  Genetic evaluations can identify breeding lines that give more output for meat, as an example, and for the same level of inputs such as feed.  The outcome of the process is a breeding index for an animal expressed in euro which farmers can use to make breeding decisions.  All 80,000 breeding herds nationally benefit from these evaluations.</p><p>  Second, to facilitate the generation of genetic evaluations, ICBF collects animal performance data from a wide variety of sources, including calf registration and animal movement data in conjunction with the Department's systems, artificial insemination data, milk recording data, slaughter data, mart data, DNA or genomic data, health data in the form of laboratory results and on-farm data, and on-farm performance data, which will become increasingly important as the focus switches to cost of production profit traits.</p><p>  Third, ICBF plays a central role in beef and dairy breeding schemes.  These schemes identify the sires that will deliver a maximum genetic gain to the commercial herds.  It will ensure the next generation of livestock are more profitable than the previous generation.</p><p>  Fourth, the ICBF engages with cattle breeders across the country, directly and indirectly, delivering breeding information so that farmers can make profitable breeding decisions at the farm level.  This happens in the following number of ways.  Bull proofs are made available to the breeding organisations, such as artificial insemination companies, through a publicly available bull search which has more than one million searches per year; HerdPlus, ICBF's breeding information service, provides farmers with a mixture of paper based and web based tools for making informed breeding decisions; and the ICBF engages with stakeholders to increase awareness of the value of using breeding information to increase profitability at farm level.</p><p>  The ICBF is not in the software business.  It generates and distributes breeding information that farmers can use to make profitable breeding decisions.  It communicates that information using a variety of technologies, but the bulk of engagement with farmers is still via paper.  The need to communicate using the Internet is also critical, and in this day and age it is a basic requirement for any organisation.  One of the key challenges for the ICBF is to get the wider farming population to engage with the breeding information and realise it has a key role to play in securing the long-term sustainability of farming.</p><p>  The ICBF's ability to operate efficiently and effectively depends on its ability to utilise technology to its maximum in the capture of data, the calculation of breeding values through genetic evaluations, and the dissemination of the resultant information to commercial farmers for use in their day-to-day breeding decisions.  The ICBF has always worked constructively with the farm management software providers.  The backbone of their business was traditionally made up of three elements: electronic calf registration, the electronic herd register, and electronic premium-subsidy management.  The ICBF is not involved in any of these areas.</p><p>  The ICBF provides a start-up file that makes it easier for the software providers to get clients on board.  We also provide an ongoing integrated transfer mechanism that allows data from the on-farm software systems to interact with data from a wide variety of sources captured through the national ICBF database.  Thus, ICBF has in fact helped the farm management software providers to grow their business over the years.  It continues to implement a policy of data sharing and integration.</p><p>  Many countries are envious of the national resource which is the ICBF infrastructure.  This was made clear at the 2012 International Committee for Animal Recording, ICAR, conference in Cork, which attracted in excess of 500 delegates from more than 50 countries.  Other countries are grappling with the inefficiencies associated with not having a national industry-owned cattle breeding database operated on a not-for-profit basis.  For example, in New Zealand there is significant turmoil and an inability to generate official national genomic evaluations due to the main database not being industry-owned and operated.  In the US, various organisations are working together to get a collaboration agreement in place to allow the consolidation of data for genetic evaluation purposes.  Ireland has a system in place.  In the UK there is no level of integration at a national level in terms of cattle breeding data despite repeated attempts to establish such a structure.</p><p>  The ICBF is an organisation that caters for the needs of all breeders in Ireland, small and large.  It is at the core of the suckler cow welfare scheme which has played a key role over the past five years in sustaining the smaller, less profitable beef farms in the north and west.  All those farms would have received technical reports from the ICBF, helping to identify areas which can be focused on to improve profitability.  The ICBF plays a role in ensuring the traditional family farm can remain sustainable in the future.</p><p>  The ICBF database is facilitating a significant amount of all-island research on the breeding end and in our work with Animal Health Ireland, AHI.  The AHI uses the ICBF database as the backbone for the roll-out of its programmes.  The ICBF has played a key role in the bovine disease eradication scheme which will be rolled out to all 80,000 breeding herds in 2013.  This maximises the return on investment the State has made through various governments since 1998.</p><p>  The ICBF has worked closely with Teagasc since its inception and collaboration continues to provide a huge benefit to the agri-industry in Ireland.  It ensures a maximum synergy of resources.  Advisers are in a position to give better quality advice in a more efficient and effective manner than would be possible without the link-up.  This is especially so in the area of discussion groups that provide a forum for farms of all sizes to participate in a learning environment with peers to help sustain their businesses.  Likewise, the ICBF relies heavily on Teagasc to get the better breeding message to farmers.</p><p>  The ICBF is helping to lead the smart economy with regard to agriculture and delivers real economic benefits at the level of family farms of all sizes throughout the country.  In 2009, Ireland was the first country in Europe and the second in the world to deliver genomic evaluations to its farmers.  The ICBF, along with the breeding industry stakeholders, has played a key role in delivering more than &euro;600 million of genetic gain to the Irish agri-industry since 2002.  The work the ICBF does also plays a key role in helping to deliver the targets in the Food Harvest 2020 programme.  The ICBF, along with the wider industry, has a key role in securing the ongoing viability of family farms in rural Ireland.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-23a.587" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n Coughlan" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012102300006#G00200"><p>The other 35 are independent contractors who provide services under licence from ICBF, such as a weight recording service.  It was launched this year and is focused on getting better evaluation of beef herds and on linear scoring, which also focuses on beef herds.</p></speech>

Are resources an issue in the current economic climate for the coming five years when we are trying to achieve the Food Harvest 2020 targets?  What about the work of the ICBF in that regard?</p><p>  I am delighted to see co-operation.  When a company such as the ICBF carries out the work, the efficiencies and economies of scale cannot be compared with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It is an effective and efficient service, dealing with 80,000 herds with only 70 employees.  That says a lot about it.  Well done.</p><p>  With regard to the work of Teagasc, which is critical to the future of the agricultural sector, the courses throughout the country show agriculture is the new area to be in.  A few years ago, it was the construction sector and now it is the agriculture and agrifood industries.  The ICT area is very important for the transformation to the new range of technology.  If young farmers are to be attracted to the industry, the learning they must undertake is critical.  Although many Teagasc courses are full, is there potential to develop additional courses and to examine refresher courses for existing farmers and those who may not want to go back to college full-time but who may want to improve their ICT and e-mail skills in order that they can deal with the Department using the Internet rather than snail mail?  Mr. Coughlan mentioned that most communication with farmers is by letter, which is inefficient and costly.  If there is a way to become more efficient, it is through e-mail.  If one talks to a farmer of a certain age, however, the last thing he wants to talk about is a computer course or an ICT course.  This should be examined.</p><p>  The suckler cow welfare scheme, which Mr. Coughlan mentioned, was launched in 2008.  What is its importance and what are the views and thoughts of the witnesses in terms of securing moneys under that scheme and ring-fencing the budget?  What is its importance in hitting the targets under Food Harvest 2020?</p></speech>

How many farmers access the HerdPlus service each month or have done so in the recent past?  Is an accurate figure available?  Are there any issues with regard to competition in the sector?  Is there a potential conflict of interest with other organisations providing similar services or is it a case of comparing apples and oranges?  What is the difference?  Organisations appearing before the committee expressed the opinion that the ICBF was encroaching on their territory.  Is that a major issue or is the ICBF providing a different service?</p></speech>

We could have sat and listened for longer.  Mr. Coughlan talked about genomic evaluations for farmers and his desire to ensure the continuation of the small-scale farmer and the traditional farm.  Could these changes have the opposite effect?  In being so organised and technologically savvy, do we run the risk of emerging with only large farms?  The data and the capacity to gather data exist, which inadvertently drives us towards a factory farm landscape.</p><p>  Does Dr. Kelly's organisation have the capacity to sell its capabilities?  Could other organisations or companies hire the ICBF for its expertise?</p><p>  Is broadband an issue?  Many people feel pressure in this regard.  There will always be farmers who are reluctant to take part because they see it as a step too far.  Have the witnesses targeted the farmers for whom the prospect of computers and technology is a step too far?  Has such targeting been unnecessary?  The witnesses are very successful but there are always some obstacles in the path.</p></speech>

Resources continue to be a challenge and the ICBF must respond to increasing demands in trying to fulfil its role in Food Harvest 2020.  The Department, along with the wider industry, has been very supportive over the years in helping us, but resources continue to be an issue.  We have more and more demands and we run a lean organisation.  Nevertheless, the calls on us are increasing.  Genomic evaluation and cattle breeding technologies are exploding and it is a significant challenge to keep up with it.  However, it is important to keep up if we are to deliver on our role in the 2020 Food Harvest targets.</p><p>  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill referred to the suckler cow welfare scheme.  From the ICBF perspective, the scheme has provided the backbone of our ability to push on from a beef breeding point of view.  The slides in my presentation show that the trends in genetic gain on the dairy and beef sides are remarkably different.  We have not had the same progress on the beef side as on the dairy side.  The suckler cow welfare scheme has been the engine allowing us to get that in place.  A group chaired by my colleague, Mr. Michael Doran, has set up a new Eurostar genetic evaluation infrastructure for beef and it is ready to take off.  From the ICBF perspective, it is critical to maintain the data flow that has underpinned the suckler cow welfare scheme.</p></speech>

I can provide an example of the training manual used.  The manual is also rolled out to adult farmers.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-23a.595" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew Cromie" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012102300007#H00300"><p>It is timely that Mr. Coughlan has put up the slide with the graph.  I draw members attention to the purple line.  The animal events and cattle breeding database was established in 2002, as mentioned in Mr. Coughlan's presentation.  At that time we had a major increase in the number of herds involved in cattle breeding, increasing from a few thousand herds to 15,000 dairy herds.  The sire recorded animals in the cattle breeding database is 13 million to 14 million.  We have a database of animals with ancestry, which is key for genetic gain, and we have the phenotypic records which cover milk, beef, female fertility and all the traits of economic importance.  That has allowed us, together with Teagasc and its research team, in particular Dr. Pat Dillon's group, to generate genomic evaluations.  Genomic evaluations are generated through taking the DNA of known animal sires, looking at their progeny evaluations and correlating them with the identification of genes of most value to develop predictions in order that one can subsequently genotype any animal and get a genomic evaluation.</p><p>  As Mr. Coughlan alluded, we were the second country in the world to produce genomic evaluations in 2009.  The data in the database have allowed us reach that point.  As a consequence, 68,000 Irish farmers have an opportunity to access genomic evaluations.  Every farmer has that opportunity, not just large or small ones.  Senator O'Keeffe queried whether, over time, it will be larger farmers only who will have access to genomic evaluations.  I suggest the answer is "no".</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-23a.596" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1129" speakername="Susan O'Keeffe" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012102300007#H00400"><p>With the permission of the Chair, I wish to clarify what I meant.  Given the information is available and it is such a good tool, what I am asking is not whether smaller farmers have access but whether it is the case that larger farmers can exploit it better, derive greater benefit from it and can therefore grow, and whether this inadvertently is driving the creation of large farms.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-23a.597" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew Cromie" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012102300007#H00500"><p>As with any sector, there are issues of economies of scale.  Larger farms that are bringing replacements back into their dairy herds and beef herds that are breeding their own replacements will, by the use of genomics, be able to identify the sorts of animals they should be bringing onto their farms without having to carry the high cost of bringing in a wrong animal.  I am talking about the suckler farmer who has 15 cows and is reliant on every one of those cows to have a calving every year.  Two wrong cows with no calving will have a significant impact on his profitability.  In that case, genomics is giving that farmer an even larger percentage benefit.</p><p>  From the overall industry perspective and where it is positioning us in terms of Food Harvest 2020, we are now making levels of genetic gain in the dairy herd which are unparalleled.  That is a consequence of the database, Gene Ireland and Genomics.  We have every opportunity to repeat in the beef herd what we have achieved in the dairy herd.</p><p>  On the issue of the suckler cow welfare scheme raised by Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill, the scheme is giving us the infrastructure in beef that we have enjoyed in dairying.  We will move rapidly into the beef sector the thinking and the technologies we have developed in dairying, again working with the group in Teagasc to deliver the same potential benefits in beef, which are of the order of hundreds of millions of euro in increased profits.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-23a.598" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1129" speakername="Susan O'Keeffe" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012102300007#H00600"><p>Is the smaller farmer still more vulnerable?  Given that the ICBF has achieved so much in terms of productivity and one cannot stop investment in technology, what can the federation do for the smaller farmer, notwithstanding the niche benefit of giving him or her extra information?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-23a.599" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n Coughlan" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012102300007#H00700"><p>As Dr. Cromie pointed out, the technology is available to the smaller farmer and, potentially, he can use it more to his or her benefit than the larger farmer.  The key challenge is getting that message out to the smaller farmers because sometimes they are a little slower to engage or they have other enterprises to try to supplement their farming income.  The suckler cow welfare scheme allows all the suckler farmers, small and large, to engage, and that gives us communication with what, on the beef side, are mostly smaller farms.  Genomics will start coming in on the beef side and that message will be key.  The challenge is to get that message out to farmers through working closely with our colleagues in Teagasc, which has the extensification system, and engaging with the industry, whether at marts, meat factories, through Teagasc advisers, in the Irish Farmers' Journal or whatever.  The technology is available to the smaller farmers.  The challenge is to get that message out, and we are committed to doing what we can to achieve it.  The key point is that the genetic gain is on a profit per animal basis.  If this year's animal is &euro;20 more profitable, the real benefit to the national economy will be by ensuring all 2 million animals born every year are &euro;20 more profitable, which will give us &euro;40 million.  If only the top quarter is engaged, only a quarter of the benefit will accrue to the economy.  It is critical we engage with all farmers, small and large.</p></speech>

The average size of a sucker herd is 15 cows.  We are looking at that population.  One of the big advantages of HerdPlus and the triangular relationship between Teagasc, farmers and the ICBF is that, even if a farmer has very little understanding of what these indices, measures and reports mean, the Teagasc adviser who will advise the farmer has access to the information, with the farmer's permission.  As I stated in my presentation, it is a major step forward for a national extension service such as ourselves to be able to add value to the existing information.  The day has gone when advisers went out to preach practice to farmers.  It is very much a case of pointing out to them that, benchmarked against other farmers, they are not doing too badly or they are doing quite badly and, to improve, they need to concentrate on two or three things.  If one can put the farmer's own data in front of them, there is very little for them to deny.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-23a.602" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n Coughlan" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012102300008#J00200"><p>Deputy Deering's first question was about engagement with HerdPlus.  The key point is to remove this perception that HerdPlus is a piece of software.  HerdPlus is a package of breeding information relating to any given farmer's herd.  It benchmarks that information, perhaps within a discussion group or nationally.  Farmers engaging with HerdPlus means they are engaging with a combination of paper and web-based tools to assist them in making breeding decisions.  The information we communicate to the farmers is the key point, whether by web or by paper means.  These are just different mechanisms of communication.  Engagement with HerdPlus is an ongoing process throughout the year.  For example, when a dairy or beef farmer goes to a discussion group meeting and the discussion group facilitator uses a discussion group report which contains breeding information, that farmer is engaging with HerdPlus and with the information.  It does not matter whether the information is delivered on paper, by the web or by text message.  The focus of ICBF and HerdPlus is on breeding information.</p><p>  On Deputy Deering's second question about competition or collaboration or otherwise within the sector, I will ask our chairman, Mr. John O'Sullivan, who is a dairy farmer, to comment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-23a.603" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John O'Sullivan" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012102300008#J00300"><p>In response to Deputy Deering's question, I may best answer it by describing my experience over the years.  Our family milks a herd of dairy cows just north of Cork city.  We have a big emphasis on breeding because we are members of the Irish Holstein Friesian Association.  At the time of the advent of ICBF, along with our national obligation to register the birth of every calf with the Department, as members of the herd book we had to register the birth of every calf with the breed society herd book which is located in Rickmansworth in Herefordshire in England.  The association has 3,000 members and we were sending a registration fee of &pound;10, as it was at the time, for up to 100,000 calves.  This money was going over to Rickmansworth.  Everyone engaged in that exercise was employed in the UK.  With the advent of the database, we saw an opportunity to bring home this business and to have our own herd book in this country to provide services to our members.  I was the chairman of the association at the time.  We employed just one liaison officer to work with the 3,000 members and to solve any issues arising between the Irish breeder and the organisation in the UK.  As a result, we left the UK parent organisation in 2002.  We bought our own office in Clonakilty.  The organisation now employs 13 full-time employees.  The charge is &euro;13 per registration.  At this stage this is considerably less than the &pound;10 we were sending to the UK at the time.  That &euro;13 per registration stays here in Ireland.  The 13 full-time employees are not ICBF employees but without the benefit of the integrated database, our organisation would not be in a position to support having a herd book here.</p><p>  Similarly, we are involved in breeding and it is essential to measure the performance of our animals.  The milk is recorded monthly.  A milk recorder comes from our milk recording organisation, takes a milk sample and a print-out from the on-farm computer for the amount of milk from the individual cow.  The big advantage from the point of view of the milk recording organisation is that the information collected by the recorder and the resultant analysis of the milk sample is entered in the database which calculates the up-to-date milk yields and constituents for each individual animal.  I receive that report electronically from the database to my Kingswood herd programme.  That information is then retained on the Kingswood programme on my farm computer on my desk and is instantly accessible.</p><p>  We calve a lot of cows in the autumn because we supply the liquid milk business.  We have to make decisions with regard to which animals to use on our cows in three weeks' time, for example, when we start the insemination programme.  A big advantage of the ICBF database is that it provides access to bulls from all over the world who have been progeny tested in Ireland, the UK, the United States, New Zealand and Czechoslovakia, for example.  I can key in the name of a bull on the database.  With ICBF's involvement with an international organisation called Interbull, I can have information on how that bull's progeny could be expected to perform in Ireland.  I can then make an immediate direct comparison between the performance of that bull and any other bull I am thinking of using.</p><p>  I had the responsibility of doing the paperwork for the pedigree animals on our farm since I was 14 years of age.  The difference between how it was done when I was 14 to how it is done now is unimaginable.  I go to different parts of the world because of my interest in cattle breeding.  No matter where I go, there is no system anywhere else around the world that can compare with what we have here.  As a farmer I am very proud of the fact that our organisation, the Holstein Friesian Association, put a substantial sum of money as a shareholding into this organisation.  My dairy co-operative is a shareholder.  I am a member of the IFA and it put money into it.  We farmers are really proud of this organisation which we have financed and set up.  It is delivering for farmers.  We get a very small percentage of our annual budget from the Government to do work that was previously government work and which would cost multiples of our costs if it were still government work.  </p><p>  In response to Deputy Deering's question about competition, I answer by saying there is no competition but rather there is co-operation and significant efficiency and benefits delivered to all of us as dairy farmers.  As chairman of this organisation, I know I can say this organisation is delivering enormously for farmers.  If anything were to happen to jeopardise the work of this organisation, there would be a lot of disaffection among farmers.</p></speech>

I work with Teagasc on tillage and I concur that its work ethic and approach is very professional.  Farmers are only now beginning to come to terms with using a web-based as opposed to a hands-on approach.  Farmers love the interactive approach in general.  I was not surprised when a web-based sales programme did not work because I know farmers like to rub cattle and to look at them.  That is the farming tradition although it may not always remain so.  A two-tier system exists.  People like myself remember when computers were not in use but we have embraced them and there are others who will not bother with them.  We need to ensure the great work done by ICBF has a beginner's guide for users because some people are just starting out with the system.</p></speech>

Many of the matters to which I wish to refer in the context of IT skills and so forth have been dealt with.  As Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill noted, agriculture has suddenly become popular and sexy again.  Huge numbers of young people are trying to gain entry to agricultural colleges and I understand there was a deficiency of approximately 300 places this year.  How many of the young people to whom I refer took up the option of pursuing the course on the green certificate online when they could not obtain entry to one of the colleges?</p><p>  On knowledge transfers and matters of that nature, how is Teagasc dealing with people with learning difficulties?  I refer to those with Asperger's syndrome, dyslexia and other conditions.  How does Teagasc assist these individuals who can experience difficulties in completing forms required by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine?  Is there a programme in place to deal with them?</p></speech>

I pursued the course on the green certificate online.  In that context, does the ICBF have a role in devising the course?  I am aware that Teagasc has an involvement, but does the ICBF also contribute?  I congratulate it on the employment it has created since its establishment in 1997 and commencement of operations in 1998.  Who was responsible for establishing the organisation?  Mr. O'Sullivan has outlined his role, but were there others involved?  He may or may not wish to divulge this information, but what is the nature of the shareholding in the ICBF?  Is any of the shareholders in the ICBF a State entity?  I ask this question because at previous meetings allegations were made about interference by State entities in the market.  I would like the position to be clarified.</p></speech>

It was the view that one tag would be for the animal's lifetime and that we could associate every activity relating to said animal to its tag.  It was also the view that all information on the animal could be put on a database.  However, there was no such database.  A number of farmers and people from farming organisations came together and took a decision to establish a body to deal with this matter.  They agreed to put an interim board in place and the group advertised for a chief executive.  Mr. Coughlan's predecessor, Dr. Brian Wickham, who had been involved in creating the database in New Zealand, was recruited to set about establishing the ICBF.  It was through Dr. Wickham's work that shareholdings, who should be involved and so on, were decided upon.  Mr. Coughlan will comment on the nature of the shareholding.</p></speech>

Some 18% of the shares are owned by the artificial insemination companies, 18% are owned by the milk recording organisations and 18% are owned by the beef and dairy breeding associations.  That gives a total of 54%.  The other 46% of the shares are owned by farmers directly.  These shares are held in trust by the IFA and the ICMSA.  There is no State involvement in the ownership of the ICBF.  It is a non-profit, fully private entity.  One official from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine sits on the board.  This is because we are licensed by the Department.</p></speech>

Our green cert or level 5 and 6 FETAC approved courses are guided by an education forum, on which there is farmer representation but, as I recall, no direct ICBF representation.  We have significant content in the programmes, particularly the green cert programmes, in terms of the use of the reports generated through the ICBF and in terms of breeding.  Reflecting Deputy Barry's comments, we consider this to be at the cutting edge of breeding and of genetic improvement and it is also at the cutting edge of important farm management information and the use of it by farmers to make better decisions.  We justify it on that basis.</p><p>  On Senator Pat O'Neill's question on student numbers and student intake, we have succeeded in having a take up of in excess of 1,500 new students across all our colleges and local option courses this year.   A little more than half of those were college level entry at level 5 and level 6 and the remainder are taking part-time and online courses.  We realise we are struggling to keep up with the requirement.  I do not believe 300 people were left out of the loop this year in terms of training options.  We probably would have reduced that to somewhat fewer than 50.  Our obligation is to try to fit those in if they want to take up a part-time or online course during the year.  If not, we try to prioritise them and get them into a course in a college starting next September if that is their wish.  We have achieved in terms of  the intakes into the colleges.  We have around 140 additional places in our colleges this year, which was a major help when we came to address what looked like being a 300 or so deficit at the start of the year. The part-time courses that are run at local centres are very attractive to people who can work part-time or farm at home and participate in the programme.  </p><p>  On the specific question on people with learning difficulties, we reserve a percentage of places, 3% to 5% I understand are the figures, for those people in our colleges.  Normally we would take in 3% of people with learning difficulties who qualify under learning support and they are prioritised above other students but it is competitive.  If ten people apply and we only three places, we have to cut our cloth to measure as little if we have to refuse students.  There is the option that they would get into another college but not the college they sought to enter.</p></speech>

The support we provide is that we attempt to explain to them some of the complex terms and conditions associated with schemes and leave them with a clear idea of what is needed when they go home.  We provide a one to one support system for our clients at our offices and through the farm visits, which is a service that is available.  Advisers know the people in their community.  They know people who may have this type of difficulty, particularly when is it time for submitting the single farm payment application.  There is always a number of people whom an adviser will need to prompt in terms of their applications and so forth.</p></speech>

While funding is a problem at present, this issue is coming more to the fore.  It is not a problem for young people coming into agricultural college because many people who had a difficulty would have been diagnosed.  There are many farmers in their 40s, 50s and 60s who went through the education system and were told that they were no use and their difficulty was not diagnosed until later in life and now they face a challenge in dealing with the Department and filling in forms.  Teagasc should examine this problem.  Some people consider this difficulty is a private matter and they do not want it to be known, but if Teagasc was to introduce a helpline that would be helpful because this is an issue.</p></speech>

I clarify that I wear a few hats and there were some jokes shared about that before I came into the meeting.  I also chair the Teagasc beef stakeholder group in Grange because I am passionate about the industry.  I spent four years at a national livestock chairman in the IFA.  During that time I would have fought very hard for the ICBF, Teagasc and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to make more facilities available to farmers to free up the amount of time they spend inputting data into various different elements and to get the data back to farmers in a manner that would help them  farm level.  A number of Deputies and Senators raised the issue of data.  The data originates on farms in the first place in that it is a farmer who inputs it.  Therefore, it is farmers' data and I strongly believe they have an entitlement to get the best use out of it and it should be got back to them in a manner that is useful to them.</p><p>  Originally I would have put a lot of pressure on the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine regarding agfood, the registration of calves online, and the herd register.  From the outset my view on the herd register, with which some people would differ, is that it was only been used as a means to penalise if they had an inspection at farm level.  That was the only use I could see being made of it.  My recollection was that we were promised at the start that when the national database was up and running correctly there would be no need for the herd register at farm level, the blue book that was being filled in.  Many farmers would have got packages on the farm to deal with the herd register element at the start, but many people could not afford it or were not computer literate.  We have got to the stage now where farmers can register calves and notify their movements on line.  They can do it on a smartphone, they do not need to do it on a computer.  The herd register is available online to farmers.  It is a matter of moving with the times and that development is helpful.  </p><p>  Access to agfood has been great from a farmer's point of view and it has removed some of the paperwork that was involved.  It has been a major saving to the Department.  With every calf that is registered online there is less of a manual input required by the Department and less postage involved.  The same applies to the suckler cow welfare scheme, which was raised by a number of members.  There is a difference of approximately &euro;10 in the cost of administering that scheme online as against through the paper format  </p></speech>

Regarding all this data to be put into the system, whether from HerdPlus or through any other system, what protections are in place in terms of data protection in regard to these systems?  Can anybody get into them and see what I am doing as an individual farmer?  Is that information protected?  In terms of data protection, how does it work in regard to individual farms?</p></speech>

There is full data protection.  The farmer signs a form to give access to his data from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to the ICBF, and that is the foundation on which everything else is built.  Any organisation that needs to access that farmer's data has to get a specific authorisation, either electronically or on paper.  Whether access is needed by a milk recording organisation, an AI company, a breed association or a Teagasc adviser, that access must be specifically authorised by the farmer, and we control that at the database level.  Any farmer can turn on or off access to his detailed farm information at any time.</p></speech>

I thank the ICBF and the Teagasc representatives.  They may be aware that the invitation was sent to them on foot of contributions made by members of the private farm software companies who raised a point which has not been addressed directly here.  Nobody argues about the value of gathering the information.  I am a client of Teagasc, registered with the ICBF and a client of one of the companies and therefore I must be careful about what I say here but I understand how the system works.</p><p>  Dr. Kelly said that the DairyMIS survey was a development of what would now be considered a crude version of software but it was probably more challenging at the time than much of what has come through now.  In terms of finding through collaboration and a sharing of effort the most cost efficient way of gathering information and developing software product the question for Teagasc in particular, where I would imagine resources are tight, is whether there is a more cost-effective way of doing that in collaboration with some of the private software development companies which cover a multitude of types of software development, not just agri-software.  There are software builders who can do it, and Teagasc has had to outsource some of its roles.  Is it more cost-effective for it to do that?  Would it put pressure on its budgets to do it?  That is the general context of some of the concerns raised here on the previous occasion and it is only fair, in order to have a full discussion, that this point is raised.  Does anybody want to answer that question?</p></speech>

The two represented here are just two.  We use software in the pig industry.  The pig advisers use PiGIS, which is a commercial software.  On the tillage front some of our bigger tillage farmers have signed up with a non-Irish company which has an excellent tillage product.  It is very suitable for large tillage farms and their advisers have no hesitation in advising farmers to use farm software where they can demonstrate the need for and value of it.</p><p>  We do not want to be tied to a particular software.  Dr. Dillon might comment on that because some of the criticisms made against us is that we should not exclude software companies in, say, the development of a new national database for a particular area in the same way the ICBF has done for breeding, whether that is for grass, soils and so on where we have existing databases.  Mr. Dillon might wish to come in on that.</p></speech>

We must be aware that they are owned by Irish farmers and are for the good of Irish farmers.  We have the example of the ICBF database in terms of genetic evaluation on the animal side.</p> <p>An example is the ICBF database on the genetic evaluation of animals.  We envisage the development of a similar database for grass cultivar evaluation.  The scientific analysis suggests that grass cultivar evaluation should be done on farms, not in small manicured plots.  We need to be able to develop technologies in the same way as those on the animal side, bearing in mind that grass comprises our competitive advantage and represents an area in which we can make big breaks.  It is a question of developing a database to select cultivars that offer high performance under Irish systems, taking into consideration soil type, location quality and persistence.  It is critical for the industry to put a purely economic value on this as there are big gains to be made.  I am very positive after the discussion some days ago.  We need to drive on.  I have no doubt that we are only at the beginning in terms of what the databases can achieve for the industry.</p></speech>

Let me give one example.  With Teagasc, we are currently establishing a next-generation dairy herd.  Mr. Dillon and his team have 200 animals with an average EBI figure of 210, the highest in the country.  This herd is important as a national resource because it is ten years ahead of the average.  As from next year, when those cows calve down, all of the relevant data thereon will be collected.  All the really important economic traits that dairy farmers cannot record routinely will be collected, including data that are difficult to record, such as the incidence of mastitis and lameness, live weights, greenhouse gases and efficiency.  With our genetic indices, we need to have the correct data collected and imported into economy-related and profitability indices that will take the industry in the right direction.  The last thing we want is to return here in some years only to say we are not making the predicted genetic gain at all because we forgot to measure two or three traits that will have proven to be more important than originally envisaged.  This was the case with fertility for many years.</p><p>  We are working with Teagasc in the context of our ten-year plan.  We will also be working in this regard in the beef industry.  The key is that new data will be identified that dairy and beef farmers will have to record in the future.  We will need to include the data in international databases to generate genetic evaluations and management reports for the industry.  With regard to our getting caught up in the discussion on how the data should be entered into the database and who should have what role, I agree entirely with Dr. Kelly that we must avoid precluding ourselves from encountering constraints or otherwise in this area.  This is because if something results in a stopping of work on the fundamental material, one effectively stops the industry from growing and driving profitability.</p></speech>

We will have two sessions today.  In the first, we will hear from Enterprise Ireland.

The Chairman already introduced my colleagues so there is no need to repeat that.</p><p>  We have been asked to outline Enterprise Ireland's proposals for the new micro enterprise and small business unit and to draw reference to the proposed liaison with the local authorities on how this unit will assist micro enterprises in Ireland.  Before I take the committee through our presentation, it is important to say that the Government decision to establish local enterprise offices throughout the country, replacing the county and city enterprise boards, CEBs, is being brought forward by an implementation working group, which is chaired by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and includes members of all the key stakeholders.  These include county and city enterprise boards, Enterprise Ireland, the local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  This group has been charged with reporting back to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, by December and has been tasked with overseeing the practical implementation of the Government decision on the restructuring of the existing micro and small enterprise support structures with a view to creating an enhanced national enterprise support model.  </p><p>  The overriding objective of our work is to build on the already excellent work undertaken by the county and city enterprise boards and to bring to bear the input of the local authorities in developing an enhanced micro enterprise support system.  The committee will also appreciate that the implementation working group is engaged in reviewing a range of issues and decisions on key aspects of the implementation process have yet to be made.  A number of sub-groups are working through elements of the implementation process and these include functions and structures; service level agreements, which will underpin the relationship between Enterprise Ireland and the local enterprise offices; evaluation and approval procedures; and human resources.</p><p>  I will now take the committee through some of the key points of the statement.  I will preface my comments on the micro enterprise and small business unit by setting its activities in the context of Enterprise Ireland's overall objective on behalf of the State.  Above all else, Enterprise Ireland's objective is to develop capability to generate sales and exports and to grow jobs in Irish companies, which is critical for sustaining the economy.  In short, our job is to help companies create jobs.  Enterprise Ireland client companies employ, on a full-time basis, over 141,000 people throughout the economy, supporting direct and indirect employment which is estimated to total more than 300,000 jobs.</p><p>  I draw the attention of the committee to the fact that Enterprise Ireland client companies have a similar economic impact in the country to foreign-owned companies here both in terms of the number of jobs supported and also the estimated &euro;19 billion in annual expenditure in the economy.  The sales, particularly the &euro;15.2 billion in exports achieved in 2011, that sustain this level of local impact have to be won day in, day out by our client companies throughout the world.  Our job in Enterprise Ireland is to focus on all the elements of what a business or an entrepreneur needs in order to export successfully and create jobs.  More than 8,000 jobs were created by our client companies last year.  A similar number of jobs were, unfortunately, lost, mainly as a result of the continuing contraction of sectors such as construction and related business activity.  However, it is critical that the severe losses of previous years have now been stemmed.  </p><p>  This year has focused on encouraging investment and supporting our client companies in a move to a growth path.  In the first nine months of 2012, a total of 5,408 job commitments over the next three years, linked to Enterprise Ireland approvals to client companies, were secured.  Additionally, in the last two weeks, the Kerry Group announced the establishment of an industry-leading global technology and innovation centre in Ireland.  This &euro;100 million investment will create 800 jobs over the next four years, as well as 400 jobs in the construction phase, which will be part-funded by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation through Enterprise Ireland.  This adds to a number of significant announcements by indigenous companies over the past months, such as Dawn Meats and  EirGen  in Waterford, Shay Murtagh Precast in Westmeath, GenCell in Limerick, Technopath in Tipperary, Danone in Wexford and Cork, Copperfasten in Galway, Sysnet in Dublin and Eishtec in Waterford.</p><p>  A major aspect of our work is supporting indigenous start-ups each year and this is closely linked to the development of new sectors and clusters of job creation in the economy.  In the first six months of the year, 53 new innovative high potential start-up, HPSU, companies were supported by Enterprise Ireland.  Together, they plan to create over 900 new jobs by the end of 2014.  Both the number of investments and the number of jobs to be created are significantly up on the same period last year.   Over the past ten years, Enterprise Ireland has supported and invested approximately 800 high potential start-ups, which now generate approximately &euro;1.5 billion in sales per annum, of which 75% is exported.  These companies have directly created 12,000 jobs and account for a similar number of indirect jobs in the economy.  I would suggest that a quiet revolution has been taking place within indigenous industry over the past number of years.  Our efforts over the course of this year are likely to see us support the greatest number of high potential start-up companies ever supported by Enterprise Ireland in one year.  We have supported a total of 80 HPSUs against a target of 95 for the year and, in addition, we will have supported a further 60 emerging start-up companies under the competitive start fund, which is building a pipeline of companies in the economy which will help create sustainable jobs into the future.</p><p>  Underlying this end product of start-up companies support is a system of action which supports entrepreneurs in their efforts to set up internationally focused, innovative companies.  This includes the development of an effective and sustainable seed and venture capital system in Ireland, which provides the necessary finance for these companies, in addition to other supports aimed at increasing the availability of finance such as business angels and working with investors here and abroad. The provision of support through the community enterprise centres, CECs, in every county as well as incubation space across Ireland is often forgotten about.  Enterprise Ireland has invested substantially in CECs.</p></speech>

Enterprise Ireland does fantastic work.  I had the honour of travelling abroad with it to see the work it does there in addition to the work it does locally.  I commend it on the initiative launched yesterday for female entrepreneurs.  It is a niche that needs to be developed, and the initiative is a good start in that regard.</p><p>  I am not convinced that the association between Enterprise Ireland, county enterprise boards and, in particular, local authorities, is good.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-23a.651" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Hayes" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012102300005#D00300"><p>The Deputy asked a number of questions.  I will deal with his last question on the service level agreement first.  The service level agreement will be drawn up between Enterprise Ireland and each local authority and it will set out the broad parameters of the work we expect to be carried out based on a budget which will be provided to each LEO.  Much of the work they will undertake will continue in line with the work they are currently undertaking such as promoting entrepreneurship locally, helping a small business locally, and providing a range of supports in terms of management development and training.  We are in the process of drawing up the service level agreement and it is very early days.  It is part of the work of the implementation working group, and a broad draft of that will be available in the next few weeks.</p><p>  The budgets for the CEBs will be subject to the same budgetary arrangements as those that apply to any Department or to Enterprise Ireland.  We will go through that process in the next few weeks.  I expect the budgets that will be allocated will be largely preserved under measure one, measure two and the administrative support that is provided to the city and county enterprise boards.  The legislation is likely to be ready in the first quarter of next year.  It is primary legislation and work on it will depend on other priorities, but the drafting of it will take some time.  It will probably be the second quarter of next year at the earliest before it is fully operational.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland officials sit on the evaluation and approvals committee of all the city and county enterprise boards.  Therefore, we are well aware of companies and individuals that are coming through and the small companies that are likely to be in a position to progress to Enterprise Ireland.  While the initial priming support is provided through the city and county enterprise boards, we are quite aware of those with the potential to grow.  If there is a more appropriate and suitable product or service that can be provided to Enterprise Ireland, these are fast-tracked into Enterprise Ireland.  Our potential exporters unit is operating throughout the country and 400 companies have attended the various exploring workshops at which we encourage more local companies to export as that is where they can secure growth.  A number of CEB clients have attended those and are now attending the so-called get export ready workshop, which is a follow on to that.  There is a reasonable progression trend in place for clients to come from the city and county enterprise boards into Enterprise Ireland.  Some have gone on to become high potential start-up companies.</p><p>  On the so-called one to many approach, in terms of support, Enterprise Ireland has largely dealt with companies that have a staff of more than ten and the potential to export.  Our focus has been very much on exporting.  That is the world we have inhabited.  In terms of a new model, we will have to be one to many, as it were, rather than one to few.  A typical development adviser in Enterprise Ireland will have a cohort of companies that he or she will get to know quite well in terms of their business, priorities, management team, marketing priorities and financial arrangements.  For the smaller cohort of companies, the types of companies to which the Deputy referred, that would be reliant to a large extent on the domestic market, our centre of excellence unit will develop supports and information that will be available to all those.</p><p>  For example, in respect of our get export ready model, we examined models around the world as to what constitutes best practice and what other countries do.  We should examine what other countries do and learn from that.  We now have a benchmarking tool.  It would be worthwhile to go onto Enterprise Ireland's website and check the get export ready option, which goes through a number of steps, including whether a firm is ready, whether it has prepared, whether it has the necessary funding, whether its product is right for the market, what kind of distribution channels it needs in that market and what the competition is doing.  There is a checklist under that option.  We need to develop something similar for small businesses in order that they would be able to do a self-assessment check which would signpost them in the right direction.  Such a checklist would include whether they need a mentor, whether they need some further developmental support and whether they have sufficient resources.  That kind of a checklist will also be developed under the centre of excellence unit.  In the six months we have been operating with potential exporters, we have found that most of the work is done over weekends.  These are busy people trying to do business and win sales during the week and then they can access this tool at the weekend.  I expect something similar will be developed for very early stage clients and start-up businesses as well.</p></speech>

It is important when we talk about these issues that we contrast the position with what we are up against.  We are in the midst of probably the worst enterprise and jobs environment this State has experienced in 50 to 70 years.  For all the good that Enterprise Ireland has managed to do during the past year, there has been a net increase of six jobs with regard to Enterprise Ireland companies.</p></speech>

I revert to the six jobs to which he referred and I acknowledge that is true.  However, it should be borne in mind that effectively, we have come through an economic tsunami, both in Ireland and globally, and the wash-out of that still continues.  In that context, sustaining jobs is absolutely crucial.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-23a.656" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Hayes" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012102300006#E00400"><p>No, I appreciate that.  I am just coming back to it because the figures for this year thus far, which I have provided, are much higher.  I had the good fortune to work overseas for a number of years on behalf of Irish companies entering the market.  I assure members that business must be won and re-won all day and every day.  Regardless of whether someone wins a contract today to supply a major multiple or a systems integrator or a major telecommunications company, such business must be re-won day in, day out through innovating one's product, through research and development, further sales and marketing and through further investment.  Consequently, the 140,000 dependent jobs and the other 300,000 indirect jobs must be fought for all day every day.  Back in 2011, when competing against companies right around the globe, that was a major challenge.  This year, as I noted, we have seen an increase in that regard.  More companies are undertaking research and development this year than was the case last year.  More companies are undertaking job expansion programmes this year than last year and more companies are undertaking management development programmes.  These all are signs that companies are in a position to at least grow and develop and hopefully this will continue over the next number of years.</p><p>  As for the local authorities, the Government has made a decision in this regard.  Part of that decision refers to the one-stop shop and part of it refers to education.  I addressed a conference of county and city managers last Friday, at which one county manager made a presentation.  I detected therein that they are learning and that an education is under way.  While there is an education and a learning to be undertaken by them, they recognise that and this probably is the beginning of a process that already has commenced.  In respect of the jobs, I mentioned Enterprise Ireland's high-potential start-up division.  This pertains to high-potential start-ups only and does not include our established cohort of client companies.  However, over the past ten to 12 years, there have been 12,000 direct jobs.  Moreover, these are really sustainable jobs because they are in areas such as biotechnology, the life sciences, the Internet, gaming and telecommunication companies.  We have some superb companies supplying to global players in the telecommunications sector, many of which would not be well-known names.  However, such companies exist and employ 30, 40, 50 or in one case, almost 800 people.  The latter company won the entrepreneur of the year award last year and is planning to take the initial public offering, IPO, route.  Many such companies are working away and the jobs fallout therefrom is very low.  As for the failure rate, it is quite modest among such companies.  While I do not know the precise percentage, it is very small.  The main reason for this is Enterprise Ireland invests taxpayers' money and consequently, we ensure a real and significant level of due diligence is undertaken on each project in which we invest.  We consider it from the perspectives of the market opportunity, the technology - we will not have any firm coming through that lacks the proper technology - and the financial and the commercial viability of the project, because our money always must be matched by funds coming in from the private sector.  We will carry out a due diligence process in this regard and many of the entrepreneurs thank us for so doing, because they realise they have been through a fairly rigorous process in respect of assessing a project and usually are much stronger and better in consequence.  Such companies usually survive and many of them now are in the process of going through an accelerated growth programme because we also try to pick winners.  We try to support companies that will add value, create the jobs and hopefully will go on to become large-scaling companies into the future.</p></speech>

There is no question about this as our domestic economy still is pretty flat.  Consequently, to expand companies must develop exports.  Enterprise Ireland has an entire suite and range of supports for companies that wish to export.  It has 28 offices around the world, which provide coverage to more than 60 countries.  Within the past few weeks, we had 2,500 meetings for our client companies with the people we brought back from overseas.  They now are in the process of working through their export plans, which will include business accelerators.  In the case of companies seeking to get into markets that are complex and difficult, we will set them up with business accelerators.</p></speech>

Sometimes, the most successful companies who are exporting can be very small companies.  We are dealing with companies that employ six, seven or eight people who outsource and possibly subcontract part of their work.  We provide mentors and have close to 300 in Ireland, many of whom have international experience.  These will help, challenge and guide the companies and provide them with the necessary support.  They provide a very important part of it.</p><p>  In respect of the Deputy's point about clustering and working together, we have something in the region of 30 applications this week under a clustering programme, which again goes back to what the Deputy was talking about in terms of helping companies work together where they will be able to join forces and learn from each other.  Hopefully, there will be an announcement with respect to that programme over the next few weeks in terms of the applicants who have been successful.</p></speech>

I have been working with Enterprise Ireland in a different capacity over the years.  I have always found it gave everything and I know everyone in it works very hard.  In particular, I compliment it on its offices abroad and the work it does abroad.  Recently, I went on a parliamentary trip to Australia where we met people from Enterprise Ireland.  If I ever get an opportunity to speak to the Minister, I will encourage him to increase those 28 offices to about 48 because it would be fantastic if we had more of them around the world, especially where we are trying to get into new markets.</p><p>  I do not have a problem with failure.  Where there are entrepreneurs, there is risk and there will be failure.  The attitude in the US is completely different from the attitude here and we need to open up to that.  Most people who fail in business once will go on to succeed the next time or the time after that.  I would like to see far more turnover going into Enterprise Ireland than words about how many succeeded and failed because where there is failure, success usually follows.</p><p>  I am a bit concerned about some of the language we are using in connection with the report and LEOs.  Again, much of it is linked to exports.  My view of the LEO is that it was aimed at getting people started so I am a bit concerned about that.  There seems to be a mess in respect of the one-stop shop.  I thought that when the LEOs went into local authorities, they would use more of a one-stop shop approach.  If a business needed planning or support, everyone could work together.  The LEOs have been challenged by a lack of funding and considerable administrative costs over the past eight or nine years.  In particular, the funding has not been increased in the past four or five years.  My understanding was that when they were subsumed into local authorities, there would be streamlining where there was duplication of work and there would be better outcomes and efficiency as a result.  Again, that does not seem to be in the report but perhaps that is part of the implementation process.  Those are my concerns.</p><p>  My greatest concern is that I have not seen anything in the report about relationship managers meeting businesses locally.  Most businesses are usually small, employing one to three people.  They are trying to manage sales and deal with the bank, procurement and everything.  They do not have the time to look at all the websites or go through all the stuff Enterprise Ireland and the local authorities offer.  If we are to grasp the opportunity that exists in Ireland and globally, we must put people on the ground to help others get through this process.  Again, the clustering is fantastic and there many opportunities.  All the multinationals, of which there are 600, are more than happy to help small companies get off the ground, but for some reason we do not seem able to create the pathway for that to work smoothly.  The only way we can do that is to have people on the ground, which would be my one big ask.  Otherwise, it will just be changing the name of what is in place.  The reason we are changing it is because it is not working to its optimum level and we need it to work at this level in the challenging times we face.</p></speech>

Our attitudes are changing.  I am aware of one project this year involving an individual, which it always comes down to, which was supported because the individual had a previous business failure.  The investor backed the team because they knew they had learned something from it.  We need to spread that culture a bit more.</p><p>  I will take on board the Deputy's views on people on the ground.  We are working through the implementation groups at the moment and I will certainly take on board the Deputy's views in respect of people on the ground.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-23a.664" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1133" speakername="David Cullinane" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012102300007#F00600"><p>I thank Mr. Hayes for the presentation.  One of the areas on which I wanted to focus was regional development and regional disparities in respect of the work of Enterprise Ireland and this new unit, because we all want better outcomes.  The three issues I will raise are funding, networks and clusters and the concept of incubation centres.</p><p>  Mr. Hayes stated in his presentation that Enterprise Ireland will allocate individual budgets to the LEOs based on agreed funding guidelines.  He went on to talk about metrics which are all quite good in terms of the number of start-ups supported and the number of jobs created, but he did not deal with targeting resources where they are needed most in areas of high unemployment.  We know the Border counties and south east have very high levels of unemployment.  Mr. Hayes stated that jobs were created in EirGen, Eishtec and Dawn Meats in Waterford.  However, we know that unemployment in the south east is 5% above the national average and there are problems in the Border counties.  There is a need for a regional focus.</p><p>  The issue of networks and clusters is linked to that.  Again, Mr. Hayes stated that the unit will facilitate the development of sector and regional networks and clusters involving the clients of the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and the city and county enterprise boards.  That suggests it will facilitate the development of existing clusters.  I want Enterprise Ireland to look at directing the emergence of new clustering, where this is possible, in areas of high unemployment and not just focus on what exists at present.  One problem that could arise is that we could follow a pattern that has been set in respect of a lot of work that has been done but not look at whether we need to think outside the box and do things differently in respect of under-performing regions and areas.</p><p>  Mr. Hayes spoke about having incubation centres in each of the institutes of technology and universities and providing a supportive environment for approximately 300 companies and units in these centres employing in excess of 1,300 people.  There are areas that do not have third level institutions.  There are areas in the south east that do not have a university, so we need to ensure these incubation centres are linked to their nearest third and fourth level institution.  It is important for us to foster a culture of innovation, and the institutes of technology and universities can play a big part in that.  In the south east, the Telecommunications Software &amp;amp; Systems Group and the eco-labs work with existing companies.  We must ensure links exist and that we benefit from the innovation trade-offs that result from the links with the institutes of technology.  That means, however, that policy must fit and a joined-up approach must exist to ensure areas have the educational facilities to bring that about.  In the south east, there is the need for a university.</p><p>  My last point relates to job retention.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n mentioned the net increase of six jobs in Enterprise Ireland companies, and Mr. Hayes also mentioned that it is about retaining jobs.  Much work goes into keeping jobs, which is important.  Is there an idea about how we could do that better?  Sinn F&eacute;in put forward a proposal based on having a rapid response unit that could work with companies which have gone bust to see whether there are opportunities.</p></speech>

I will respond to the last point first.  We do respond where there are closures or where there is what we euphemistically call downsizing.  This is usually in the case of larger companies.  I will not list any of the names.  Where there have been significant closures, we have worked with other Departments and the IDA to help to identify whether there are other projects of relevance.  As a consequence of some of the closures and downsizing, there have been some very good spin-off developments.  We have helped by way of feasibility practices but obviously the people in question know the businesses best.  There is a cry or clamour when a large company closes because of the number of jobs involved but the Senator makes a very valid point that we should consider the resurrection of very small companies.  Perhaps given the new circumstances associated with the local enterprise offices, we should pay more attention to this issue.  Every single job matters.</p><p>  With regard to fostering the culture, the Senator is absolutely correct.  All the international indicators point to Ireland being among the most entrepreneurial societies on earth.  The reality is that we hold up very well when benchmarked, and various international reports suggest we are very entrepreneurial.  The most recent GEM report suggests that, in the areas of medium to high technology, we are ahead of the EU and OECD averages.  This, in itself, indicates our position.  It is borne out by some of the figures I listed on high-potential start-ups.  These are significantly ahead of many of their European neighbours.</p><p>   A programme covering the new local enterprise offices, which we want enhanced, concerns secondary education.  The earlier that one inculcates the spirit of entrepreneurship, the better.  The programme for second level run by the county and city enterprise boards should be encouraged further.  Each county will have considerable opportunities in this regard.  The authorities can work with the local secondary schools, ICA, ICMSA, IFA or GAA.  They should be able to work with all concerned in local communities to encourage people to work for themselves and start businesses as opposed to just looking for work somewhere else.</p><p>  There is significant involvement in the area of funding research within third level colleges.  There are two programmes leading to some outstanding successes.  The first is the Think Outside the Box programme.  This year, there were over 350 applications north and south of the Border from teams of students in third level institutions.  We have encouraged the cross-fertilisation of ideas so people in sciences and engineering can work with people doing business.  The best teams involve the cross-fertilisation of functions.  We have been running this programme for a number of years.  Up to the past year or two, many students have seen it as a rite of passage, or another project.  The students would have gone to Australia or sought a job afterwards but they are now much more serious in that they are starting businesses.  Out of the ten finalists this year, six are beginning to commercialise their projects and one is in the pipeline as a high-potential start-up.  There are some excellent ideas.  There is much greater willingness to develop a business as opposed to just doing a project for the sake of doing it.</p><p>  The other programme is the New Frontiers programme under the enterprise platform programme, with which some of the members will be familiar.  The enterprise platform programme was largely educational and the entrepreneurial business development side was relatively modest.  We have completely reformulated the programme.  There are nine programmes on their way to the 13 IOTs.  The last to start is in the Carlow-Waterford region, and it incorporates 15 business ideas.  There will be 150 in total.  We hope that, after six months, 100 new businesses will start up as a consequence of the programme.  We have been very impressed with the quality of candidates.</p><p>  I was in Waterford Institute of Technology in recent weeks making a presentation.  We ensure that we espouse our views in the third level institutions and encourage students to start up businesses, undertake feasibility studies, participate in the New Frontiers programme or obtain a Think Outside the Box award.</p><p>  On regional development, every single region and county is important in terms of retaining and increasing the number of jobs.  Our remit is primarily associated with Ireland Inc., in which it is important to have jobs.  I often ask parents whether it would not be better to have their sons or daughters working in Galway, Dublin or Cork as opposed to Dubai, Sydney or Perth.  It is important that we consider the issue from a national perspective in the first instance.</p><p>  Last week was the week of the Dublin Web Summit.  The reality for the companies in question is that Dublin will be the primary focus of their investment because it has the appropriate ecosystem.  This does not in any way suggest we do not wish to support businesses throughout the country.  We have supported over 100 community enterprise centres, practically in every county.  This year, we supported 37 business development managers.  I will be addressing these managers next Friday as they will be coming to our office for a conference.  It is a question of trying to encourage them to develop their businesses locally.</p><p>  Our competitive feasibility scheme was targeted specifically at the regions.  We had a pilot programme in the south-east and received over 40 applications.  Yesterday, I received information from our manager in the west, where we had a similar programme in respect of which there were 46 applications from teams and individuals.  The applications were from Galway, Roscommon, Leitrim and Mayo. With regard to regional development, that is our fourth roll-out.  Our final programme will be rolled out in the midlands over the coming weeks.</p></speech>

County Kildare, for example, received &euro;30.6 million, whereas the figure for Sligo was &euro;7.9 million.  In Tipperary, &euro;43 million was received and in Waterford &euro;19.6 million was received.  I take the point that inputs and grant aid do not in themselves paint the full picture, but they do tell us something about the fact that, for whatever reason, some areas are not creating jobs and the spirit of entrepreneurship or output is not what it should be.  If we just follow the current pattern and do not determine why some areas are underperforming and what extra supports, resources and tools can be given to those areas, we are destined to make the same mistakes again.  If we do so, we will end up reinforcing regional unemployment disparities.</p></speech>

Have we started to work on the potential for spin-off companies?  Mr. Hayes referred to the potential for cluster development in that location and the possibility of establishing an enterprise park.  When a major company comes into an area we should immediately target that area for spin-off companies, rather than wait for something to happen.</p><p>  I was a member of a county enterprise board and I am very much in favour of them.  They were able to target small start-up companies and people who had an interest in setting up their own businesses.  I am worried that we may lose the common touch of the county enterprise boards and their relationship with local people who want to start up small businesses.  Enterprise Ireland is focused on exports, as the witnesses have said several times.  Many small start-up businesses are focused on their locality and often on supplying the large enterprise developments we have been talking about, such as Kerry.  I am a little concerned about that.</p><p>  Could Mr. Richard Murphy tell us the timeframe for moving from county enterprise boards to local enterprise offices?  This question was asked but we did not get a clear answer.  Can we be sure local enterprise offices will be in place?  I am getting calls from staff of county enterprise boards asking what exactly is happening.  </p><p>  I am fearful of local enterprise offices being associated with county councils.  In 1997 or 1998, Kildare County Council set up a business park in Kilcullen.  Many people were interested in coming on board but because of the inefficiency and lack of experience of the individuals involved, only one company set up in the business park.  The rest of the park is lying idle.  County councils do not have experience in this area.  I am nervous of the future with regard to them.</p><p>  County enterprise boards are involved in many projects.  I am thinking of school entrepreneurships, for example.  In County Kildare, a small company set up by a young school pupil has gone international.  Many schools in County Kildare have become involved in this enterprise competition.  I would hate to see a programme like this being lost because funding to local enterprise offices was focused on setting up companies.  School pupils are the key people.  Secondary school pupils may even be too old.  If children are given the entrepreneurial roadmap at primary level, we will have a real chance of seeing them become entrepreneurs later on. </p><p>  Is there any cross training between Enterprise Ireland and county enterprise boards?  County enterprise boards run excellent training courses for people who start up businesses.  I hope that will continue and link with the experience of Enterprise Ireland which deals with companies at a different level, those with more than ten employees.  The work of Enterprise Ireland could be micro-managed down to a smaller level.    </p><p>  The joint committee is planning to put together a publication showing what is available to people who want to start up businesses.  Last Thursday evening, I knocked on a constituent's door and he asked me what was available in this regard.  He told me my own website had more information than he could get from Enterprise Ireland.  That is key.  When someone clicks onto a web page they want to know exactly what is available, what they are entitled to and what they can get.  Information should be made as simple as possible so that a small sheep farmer like myself can understand it.   </p></speech>

Our focus will be on not throwing out the good things.  Many excellent things have been happening, for example, the secondary school entrepreneurship programme.  We would like to see that moved back to primary schools and to build on the work of transition year programmes in secondary schools.</p><p>  The plan is that Enterprise Ireland will retain, enhance and continue to develop the capability of the county enterprise board staff as they move into the local authority.  They will be invited and encouraged to attend Enterprise Ireland training courses on subjects such as finance, strategy and marketing.  We will be working on export awareness development and on driving core skills in that area in the county enterprise boards.  How to do, how to tell and how to teach will be a core mission for ourselves.  </p><p>  While people may see artificial borders or barriers between Enterprise Ireland and county enterprise boards, they do not exist from a client perspective.  Current county enterprise board exporting companies have full access to Enterprise Ireland 's offices and services overseas.  We do not get into who owns whom.  If the client is capable of exporting, he or she is invited into the Enterprise Ireland international service network.</p><p>  I hear people say the focus may shift from micro to export.  The key word for us is "potential".  We want to build on people's potential to export.  We will help them to shape things such as value proposition and to become leaner.  We can bring the Enterprise Ireland lean engineering stuff down into small companies to develop them and encourage them to look at cost initiatives.  We would also like to see the seeding of new micro sectors so that games, for example, can come into a national perspective.  We want to start promoting companies in the Enterprise Ireland body of companies. </p><p>  We recognise there is work to be done in making our web page simpler, more stripped down and easier to access.  This needs to be done in association with entrepreneurs rather than with people in our area.  We would like to have the page logic tested so that people can understand it, work their way through it and point out difficulties so that the whole thing becomes simpler and easier to use.</p></speech>

Many people may wish to come together but they do not have the wherewithal to pull it together.  It needs some intervention by Enterprise Ireland to make it happen.  When we have evidence, we can encourage more companies.  The applications we are looking at this week involve CEB clients, non-agency clients, EI clients and IDA clients working together with up to 14 companies.</p><p>  There are other peer to peer and clustering initiatives that are not within the formal clustering programme where we encourage companies to help each other, be they large or small.

I thank Mr. Hayes for his very comprehensive statement.  There is no doubt that Enterprise Ireland has been extraordinarily successful.  Between direct and indirect employment, some 300,000 people are employed in companies supported by Enterprise Ireland.  That speaks for itself.  I had the honour to be on the evaluation committee of the very first Dublin City Enterprise Board.  The then city manager, Mr. Frank Feely appointed me to that.</p><p>  The county and city enterprise boards have made a major contribution to creating awareness of an entrepreneurial culture at a micro level throughout the country.  They have been innovative.  I do not support this move to subsume county enterprise boards into local enterprise offices.  I will spell out the reasons and will ask questions.</p></speech>

Under the current arrangement, Enterprise Ireland comes under the remit of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the local authorities are under the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  I have a major issue with that.  Most of the current enterprise boards have been very successful, although an odd one or two have not been as satisfactory as others.  When Fianna F&aacute;il was in government and at parliamentary party meetings, members would raise concerns about which county enterprise board was not working.  I think the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation by its nature is not entrepreneurial and did not manage the strategy for the enterprise boards.  That is not taking from my personal belief in their success.</p><p>  I see a major struggle between both Departments.  Civil servants are great at fighting turf wars.  Many county managers are very autocratic people.  We would love to think that they are visionaries and leaders, and they are thinking of their country first.  How will the county managers co-operate?  Will there be consistency?  I doubt it.</p><p>  The question of staff has been raised.  In times of economic turmoil it is very wrong to change direction.  The major issue is to provide jobs for people.  Some 87,000 people emigrated last year.  Why would one make a political decision in a time of turmoil to change a system that works well?  Mr. Richard Murphy suggested that the staff will stay focused but I do not believe that staff are happy about this.  Their jobs are at stake.  There are 124 people employed in the county enterprise boards.  Human beings, by their nature, will worry about what will happen to their jobs.  Will there be promotional and career development opportunities for the staff when these changes have been made? </p><p>  It makes good copy to read of a robust service development agreement between Enterprise Ireland and the local authorities.  My experience as an entrepreneur and a politician leads me to ask what sanctions Enterprise Ireland will apply to a local enterprise office that is not delivering its applications for start-ups.  Who will deal with the offices if they do not reach their target?</p><p>  Has Enterprise Ireland the resources to handle all the queries that will arise from the change in the structure?  I agree with Deputy &Aacute;ine Collins who states there should be twice as many Enterprise Ireland offices around the world for the great work it does.  How many applications are processed by the city and county enterprise boards at present?  How many actually deliver?  In my experience one must bore down into the domestic market before one can dream of exporting.  How will Enterprise Ireland handle that?</p><p>  We had a delegation from the Irish Exporters Association before the committee about one month ago.  They were seriously concerned about potential exporting companies that were not getting help from Enterprise Ireland.  I was amazed to learn that as I thought that Enterprise Ireland had an open door policy.  I think Mr. Hayes should meet Mr. John Whelan, the chief executive of the Irish Exporters Association, to find out about the hundreds of companies that cannot get official help to export their produce.  I think that is very important.</p></speech>

We will be adding into that what we would expect in terms of performance primarily around job creation.  That will then be set out as a target to be delivered by each of the local authorities or the new LEOs.  If they do not achieve it, the primary legislation states that a sanction will apply.  If it continues not to achieve it, the view is that it will be tendered for private people to come in and deliver what the LEOs are not delivering.  However, that is looking at it from a negative perspective.  In fairness, it is best to give them the opportunity to see what they can do.  I can assure Deputies that they will be given quite stretched targets to achieve as the Exchequer is giving quite a significant amount of money to job creation.</p><p>  As regards promotion opportunities for people who are transferring, those who elect to remain within the Forf&aacute;s-EI family will have the right to apply for promotional opportunities within Enterprise Ireland.  The others can apply for promotional opportunities within the local authorities should they see fit.</p><p>  As regards the criteria for exporting, as I said earlier, one cannot apply criteria to companies too early.  As long as it is not operating ineligible criteria for financial support, the company would, probably very early on, demonstrate some traits of good management - products that can sell beyond the local area.  Those are areas that we would get involved in both from a mentoring and training perspective, offering significant encouragement for them to consider exporting.  Exporting is not for everybody obviously.  It does come with a significant risk and is demanding in terms of management time.  We will seek ways of enhancing the capability of those companies as quickly as possible, either through putting extra resources on a temporary basis through mentors or through advocates in a more focussed manner than heretofore.</p></speech>

The staff are the most important people who will comprise local enterprise offices.  The word "culture" has been used and those working in county and city enterprise boards understand business.  They also understand how to challenge a business proposition and they understand the dynamics of a business.  In addition, they can read balance sheets and understand a proposed business plan.  It is crucial that those core skills are maintained in every single LEO throughout the country.  That is an overriding objective.  Business people should not have to work with people who do not understand business dynamics.  They may not understand the specifics of every single business but, nonetheless, there is a way to empathise and relate to a business person.  It is absolutely crucial that those skills are maintained.</p><p>  The Senator referred to the Irish Exporters' Association.  For some time, it has been said that there is a gap between the cohort of companies that Enterprise Ireland supports, which is in the region of 5,000, and a huge cohort of companies that are not being helped or supported in terms of exporting.  I know Mr. John Whelan quite well and while there may be some such companies, they are being catered for under two banners.  One is the launch of Going Global which is to attract service companies that were doing work on the domestic market but may never have thought of exporting a service.  One may genuinely ask how some services could be exported, but over the years companies involved in architectural services, quantity surveying, legal services and financial services have exported as a result of undertaking a feasibility study.  Through connections and partnerships with companies overseas, they are now in a position to export some such services.  That support service product is still there.  </p><p>  The potential exporters' service was established primarily to encourage, excite and energise a cohort of companies that was largely able to support itself through the boom years.  The cohort comprises companies involved in areas such as construction, service and manufacturing related to that sector.  We have already supported them, either through our online benchmarking tool, or on a one-to-one basis.  Today, we have an "Exploring Exporting" workshop in Tullamore.  We had one last week in Kilkenny.  We have had nine so far this year and will have another four before the end of the year.  As a result, we will have met individually with about 500 companies that are seeking to export.  That is a whole new effort to energise and re-energise.  It is open to any company, not just clients of Enterprise Ireland, but also to CEB clients or other companies, in any community that feel they have a product or service they wish to export.</p><p>  As Senator White well knows, exporting is not easy and one must first test out a product or service in the domestic market.  However, many companies do not have that luxury because the domestic market is so small in some areas that, almost from day one, they must consider exporting.  I am certainly happy to meet Mr. John Whelan.</p></speech>

Before we move on to supplementary questions, I have a few observations to make.  First, I want to congratulate Mr. Hayes and everyone else at Enterprise Ireland on their work in winning the Kerry investment.  I know that a lot of work went into that, specifically from his own section in Enterprise Ireland.  The team had to focus on that and it was not an easy win.  However, it was worthwhile and will certainly be of benefit to this country.  Hopefully there will be a knock-on effect.</p></speech>

Mr. Hayes must also be complimented on the net gain in jobs.  I recall having the same discussion during the boom times with a different set of people from Enterprise Ireland.  Even at that time, it was seen as a success to have a net gain because there were many losses in certain sectors during the boom time.  It is a major credit to be still winning and have a net gain at the end of the day, rather than a net loss.  Mr. Hayes should keep up the good work on that.</p><p>  While concern has been expressed about the proposed new LEOs, there is also an opportunity here.  We all have such concerns because there is a perception among many business people about how local government works.  While that perception may be right in some cases, it is not always correct.  For example, some local authorities have improved a lot through their economic development units.  There is perhaps a chance to merge talents and develop this further.  I look on this as an opportunity to get it right, but it is important that we do get it right.  Although the people in enterprise boards have done an excellent job, it is important to retain the excellent staff involved.  It is not a major panic that they are moving to work under a new name, provided that we keep them and their skills.  Enterprise boards have done well by being driven by the people working in them.  Some enterprise boards have not done well because the people in them did not do so.  In the majority of cases, however, good people drove them.  I am confident that we will still have them working under a new heading and under the direction of Enterprise Ireland. which is the key.  There is a fear that this will be directed to the local authorities but it is quite clear to me that the LEOs will be directed by Enterprise Ireland and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  We have to keep that business drive and that message needs to get out.  There should be an opportunity here to address the concerns that people have with their perception of county councils.</p></speech>

It has been incredible in these tough times.  However, I wish to ask about Enterprise Ireland's approach to job losses.  I only wish to highlight the issue and do not expect our guests to be able to answer fully, but I would appreciate it if they could answer.  The Workers Co-operative Network appeared before the committee a while ago.  It mentioned how successful co-operatives and that type of economic activity could be.  The model that we typically use to measure economic activity is foreign direct investment, FDI.</p><p>  The Workers Co-operative Network stated that in some countries, for example, France, legislation is in place to allow jobs and enterprise agencies to examine a company that is about to go down the drain to determine whether it is sufficiently viable to have life pumped into it.  Must we review our approach to companies that are going down the Swanee?  Is there a fresh way to determine whether they remain viable?  My impression is that there is.  Enterprise Ireland and other bodies, including the Legislature, need to ask themselves these questions.  Are other countries using better practices to save jobs?</p></speech>

It is important to point out that morale in some of them is on the floor due to what has occurred in recent years.  The Irish Exporters Association, IEA, referred to an inertia within the CEBs in terms of their dealings with small businesses.</p><p>  An emergency response unit was mentioned.  Spicer's Bakery closed in Navan and 70 jobs were lost over a period.  Could Enterprise Ireland organise a small group of skilled people to examine the various elements and ingredients, as it were, of that business and try to prevent it from closing?  Sometimes, large debts inhibit functional businesses and must be resolved.</p><p>  Until approximately 18 months ago, there was no State-wide export programme for CEBs.  Some CEBs delivered courses on exporting whereas others did not.  Most found it difficult to locate course providers.</p><p>  Was there a business voice on the implementation panel?</p></speech>

That could cover everything from, say, companies involved in catering, restaurants and retail.  By embracing them, they could offer best in class training, customer service management, financial access in terms of accounts and so on.  We have a focus that is inherited because of policy and EU rules in that there are certain companies that are eligible for the financial packages, and that will remain in place.  Those are companies which, for reasons of state aid rules and displacement, must have the potential to trade internationally.  That is only half the budget.  The other half, which is for the development of companies, management and capability, should be broadened.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-23a.743" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Avine McNally" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012102300014#N00200"><p>Thank you, Chairman, and I thank the members of the committee for giving me this opportunity to address the joint committee.</p><p>The points I will address have already been discussed, some at great length, in the earlier session.  While I will mention them, because they reflect the concerns of our members and of the organisation, I will not labour them.  </p><p>  The Small Firms Association is the voice of small business.  We represent approximately 7,500 small companies that employ fewer than 50 people.  Since the establishment of county enterprise boards, in a similarly difficult economic climate in 1993, the network has contributed substantially to the development of start-up and  micro-enterprises in Ireland.  They gave direct assistance through their advice and finance but they have also paid a key role - this point has been made - in raising the profile of entrepreneurship throughout society, particularly through their schools programmes and in partnership with my organisation through the emerging ethnic entrepreneur programme.  This is a key issue.   </p><p>  County enterprise boards have also been successful in leveraging EU funding, in addition to Government funding, to expand their range of services which they have developed and expanded as the needs of business have grown since 1993.  They have been strong in developing relationships in local communities, across Government and through many of the other groups within the business community.  This allows them to tap into a vast quantity of expertise and knowledge which has been supportive of many of their clients.  In the current economic climate much of the advice and support they give is voluntary and free and can add to the business knowledge of many of their start-up clients.  Many members of my organisation who availed of their services attribute their success to the support they received from their county enterprise board, particularly in the early years of their business being established.   </p><p>  The Small Firms Association has always been supportive of the stand-alone county enterprise board structure and of their strong presence throughout the regions.  While we recognise that efficiencies could be made, and the recent oversight of Enterprise Ireland is welcome to give the boards a national coherence, we have concerns about the movement into local authorities.  One of the concerns, which has been mentioned already, is the poor relationship the small business community tends to have with local authorities.  Many view their local authority as a mere revenue collecting body.  </p><p>  The proposed structural change will be damaging to the enterprise agenda.  It is difficult to understand how such a small group will survive in such a large organisation whose main priority is revenue collecting and imposing on these businesses that they are now are deemed to support.</p><p>  We are also concerned that small businesses need state agencies to be honest brokers in giving them the best advice for their organisation.  If this advice is to be influenced by local authority employees this credibility may, over time, be lost.  Some of these individuals may turn into gatekeepers in terms of collecting rates, licence payments and so on.  This could be an issue for the support that should be there for the establishment of small businesses.   </p><p>  A key concern is that we will lose the valuable time, expertise and knowledge that business people so generously give to county enterprise boards.  There is a concern that by moving into local authorities the service may move away from its core market.  </p><p>  We must also talk about money.  Budgets will be overseen and viewed by Enterprise Ireland, but in a local authority struggling to meet its budget how can we be assured that enterprise funding will be red-circled so that a council cannot, at some time in the future, view it as funding that is more essential for other services?</p><p>  With regard to some points raised by Mr. Tom Hayes in the earlier session, the Small Firms Association is supportive of the online support services.  We have been saying for a long time that they should be there.  Equally, we believe the knowledge and competence collaboration of the sectoral regional networks will be beneficial when they are established and are up and running.  The development of greater supply chains can be beneficial for many small and medium enterprises, both in working together and in linking with some of the larger agencies and companies that they may, traditionally, not have been able to access so easily.</p><p>  Listening to Mr. Tom Hayes, we had concerns about other issues, which have been discussed already.  A member of the committee asked what is the associated metrics.  We would like clarification of that.  I was concerned by the mention of enhanced services.  Enterprise Ireland mentioned enhanced services being provided through the new structure, but all the services outlined in the presentation already exist.  It would be good to have clarification on that.</p><p>  Without labouring the point, there is huge concern at the focus being moved towards export and internationally focused businesses.  While we recognise that the focus has to be on creating sustainable employment and on adding value to the local and national economy, we must bear in mind that the county enterprise boards support all start-ups.  While many of these are businesses that will never export or trade internationally they will trade indigenously and are very important for their regions.  This mandate must be protected.  </p><p>  In line with the EU Small Business Act, we believe there must be a full impact assessment of the implementation of this Government decision.  This assessment must be conducted from the perspective of the small business community and small business user, rather than a Government Department.  We also have concerns about the implementation process to date.  While we understand it is ongoing, we are aware that there has been little or no involvement or focus on the end users and clients.  We are also unaware of any action or analysis done to date by these implementation groups on how the county enterprise board clients and end users feel about the new structure and what they would like to see coming out of the new system.</p><p>  I thank the committee for their attention.  I will be happy to take any questions.</p></speech>

I know October is a bad month for you to come to the committee.  The Small Firms Association addressed the joint committee a few weeks to ago to discuss its pre-budget submission and unemployment, particularly youth unemployment.  You might like to use this opportunity to add some comments on those issues to your presentation.  We might have a chance to engage on those issues during the meeting.</p><p>  An examination of the black economy and its effect on small businesses is on the joint committee's work programme for December and January .  I hope you will be able to attend some of those meetings.  I know the issue is close to the heart of the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association.  </p></speech>

I represent the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME, which represents small and medium businesses throughout the country.  We have 8,700 members.  I do not need to tell members of the committee about the global and national crisis we are in and I will not talk about the need to restore stability and reignite short-term economic activity.  We are here today to discuss micro-enterprise, the small business unit and its liaison with local authorities.</p><p>  We are talking about changing a structure but we still do not have a national policy on entrepreneurship.  That is a massive indictment of the current and previous Governments.  We must develop and adopt a national policy for entrepreneurship and small business development.  I am asking the committee to put such a proposal at the top of its agenda, and in doing so to think small first. </p></speech>

On that last point, the committee can bring up the issue of developing a national policy on entrepreneurship.  If Senator Feargal Quinn were present, he would be very excited about that.  We have touched on that issue and talked about it in many ways without saying it as it is and focusing directly on it.  We can take on that issue and link back with the association on it.</p></speech>

It is a disgrace the association has not been consulted.  It says a good deal not about Enterprise Ireland but also about the parent Department that it did not even think to nominate representatives of the small business bodies to be on this body.  That is not a criticism of the Minister but of the Department that the users were not even consulted in what is the biggest change in the microenterprise sector.  That says it all about that Department.</p></speech>

Aonta&iacute;m go m&oacute;r leo.  Most of what the witnesses said has been properly articulated by previous delegations, although the witnesses have probably articulated the position in a stronger fashion.  On the issue about the confused relationship between the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, perhaps the people who are designing this are more clear on it but I do not believe there is a proper delineation of responsibilities that will lead to good outcomes.  I have been trying to ascertain whether we will have more, fewer or a mix of staff in the enterprise function and how that will happen.  We have not been told about that yet.  I propose the committee ensures the major concerns we have all articulated and those articulated by the witnesses in their evidence are sent to the Department of-----</p></speech>

It is disappointing that people who represent these bodies are not on the implementation body.  I would go further and say there should be a few entrepreneurs on it as well.  I would like that proposal to be forwarded to the Minister.  I do not know at what stage in the cycle we are in terms of when the implementation body will report back and what the next consultation will be.  I appreciate that the body will report in December but I am not sure where the process will go from there.  The body will report to the Minister but will that be the end of the process or will we have a say in it?</p></speech>

That is the reason we are having these presentations and going through this.  That is our job and we will be going through all this.</p><p>  I want to clarify that the enterprise boards are represented on the implementation body.  Some of the representatives from those boards could potentially be engaged in small business.  I will check that to find out the position.  I note the point that representatives of the association should be on the body or at least have a greater role in the process, and we can make that clear.  There is no problem about doing that.</p></speech>

I wish to ask the witnesses about an unrelated matter because Mr. Fielding was unable to attend on the occasion when the committee discussed this matter.  In terms of the announcements made under the jobs initiative on the PRSI exemption scheme, other long-standing initiatives introduced by the Department of Social Protection and the Revenue Job Assist initiative, what is the level of awareness of the members of the association of these initiatives?  How much does the association promote them?  Does Mr. Fielding consider they have been sufficiently promoted by the respective Departments?  Is there anything we can do to ensure the association's members are better informed about those schemes?  I apologise for raising an unrelated matter but Mr. Fielding could not attend on the previous occasion.</p></speech>

Which Department should have invited us?  Should it have been the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government or the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation?  This fell between two stools because the two Departments are fighting this one.</p><p>  There has been mention of shotgun weddings, shoe horning and culture.  There is no doubt that the culture of the local authorities in this respect will be the prominent and the dominant one and, if that is the case, we are making a very big mistake in terms of the seedbed of entrepreneurship.  People talk about the Kerry Group and how that business was started in a caravan.  While not every business starts in a caravan, it is started by one or two people.  We are taking that seedbed and giving it to people who know as much about entrepreneurship as my elbow knows about snipe shooting.  We are making a major mistake.</p><p>  The implementation body is to come back with an initial report in December.  This has been dragging on for a long time.  The former Minister in the previous Government, Batt O'Keeffe, started this ball rolling and it has been ongoing since then.  People working in local county enterprise boards do not know what will happen in this respect.  It is madness.  We are expecting them to go out and burst their chops, so to speak, helping small businesses to set up.  It is crazy.</p><p>  On Deputy Lyons's question on the level of awareness of the PRSI exemption scheme, we as an organisation would have notice of the PRSI exemption scheme, the Revenue Job Assist initiative and some 13 other initiatives brought in by this Government, all of which are included in our newsletter on a regular basis, at least every two months in the past year.</p></speech>

It would have been brought up in newsletters, as Mr. Fielding said, and it would also be available on the website.  One often finds with these issues that one can keep telling everybody, yet they will make contact by telephone because they have still not heard about it.  Only when it becomes a question on their radar will they start paying a bit more attention to it.  It is frustrating that the information is getting out there, but one often finds it is not being picked up as quickly as one had hoped or initially intended it would have been.</p></speech>

I do not care so much where they are to be situated as long as they are doing a good job.  We have to be fair.  I sat on this committee during the last 12 months when the CEB representatives came in.  We engaged with them over the fact that they were not delivering.  Their budget was &euro;23 million, yet the majority of it was going on administration.  The whole idea is to make this better.  We need to have people out on the ground.  That is where we need to get to.  It is about getting the right job done.  I am pleased that Enterprise Ireland is involved.  It will be part of its remit to be involved in this because that link has always been missing.</p></speech>

In fairness, having spoken to enterprise boards and in dealing with their customers, most of the staff are still doing their job and are implementing it.  They are not sitting at home, they are fully active and, yes, they are concerned about their future.  However, most of them recognise that the decision has been made.  I am not too sure if we can reverse that decision but we can certainly try to make it work better for everybody.</p><p>  Many issues have been discussed both in the earlier presentation and at our own discussion concerning what we want done with this and the changes being sought.  We all have doubts and concerns but there is also a huge opportunity to get it right.  If the committee spends some time on this, with the help of the witnesses, we might be able to focus on it with our list of what we want to ensure it works correctly.  I believe it can do so.  The committee will bring in the implementation body.  The Minister will be in attendance twice in December so we will have an opportunity to discus it with him also.  However, we need to focus on the fears, concerns and suggestions expressed by the witnesses, as well as trying to get them addressed and adopted.</p></speech>

The secretariat of the National Economic and Social Council is extremely grateful to the committee for the attention it is giving our work and for inviting us to discuss it today.  In late 2011, the secretariat of the NESC was asked by the Government to prepare two reports on climate change: an interim report on policy options which could close the gap to Ireland's non-emissions trading scheme, ETS, emissions in the compliance period to 2020, and a final report for the end of this year to develop the basis for the long-term transition to a low carbon economy incorporating the key messages of our first report.  These two papers will be part of the Government's programme or road map for the development of a national climate change policy and legislation.</p><p>  The work of the NESC secretariat over several decades has been to provide background analysis which frames the development of policy rather than making specific recommendations, which is primarily the work of Departments.  In addressing the framing of this issue, it is very striking the dominant framing of climate change has focused on seeking a binding global pact on targets and timetables; emissions trading as a central policy instrument; a particular model of the relationship between science and policy; and what we call an information deficit view of the many behavioural and attitudinal issues which everyone recognises are central.</p><p>  In embarking on this work our secretariat tended to share the assumptions which underpin this dominant set of ideas.  However, undertaking the work has forced us to think more critically about these elements.  This dominant approach has at times led to a highly dualist and divisive policy debate at international and national level and it has not achieved its central goal.  We believe, as we outline in the report, that a significant reframing of the climate change challenge is necessary and is already under way in international policy and thinking.  In identifying the pressures on the dominant framing we highlight the challenge which continually confronts the task of achieving global agreement.  We suggest we need to take a realistic and fairly hard-headed view of the ability of carbon pricing, emissions trading and existing technologies to address global warming.  We suggest organisational capability in firms and State organisations and the rule of consumer demand are often overlooked in the discussion on climate change which tends to reflect the emphasis in the discussion on the actions of states.  We suggest it is necessary to move beyond the information deficit view of behaviour change and get deeper into the practices and obstacles which can make it difficult or easy for households, firms, civil society organisations and public authorities to reduce their carbon production or carbon consumption.</p><p>  Our interim report also highlights the strengths and limits of the very heavy emphasis on targets and timetables which tends to dominate the politics and policy of climate change.  More than anything else perhaps, our interim report suggests the balance of attention needs to shift from how much emissions reduction to aim for to how to achieve decarbonisation.  Building on this framework our interim report contains detailed chapters on Ireland's existing policy, sectoral profiles and challenges in the areas of energy efficiency, transport, agriculture and land use, which relates to the question the Chairman asked, carbon tax and the possibility of purchasing credits.</p><p>  Drawing together our analysis of these various sectors and challenges we argue that in formulating a new climate change strategy Ireland needs to keep three precepts in view at the same time.  The first is economic prosperity.  Actions on carbon must be consistent with economic recovery, employment, fiscal correction and longer-term prosperity.  The second is decarbonisation.  The goal is gradual, permanent, widespread decarbonisation of the economy rather than compliance with specific targets and timetables.  The third is time.  Many of the actions, technologies and practices which can achieve decarbonisation take considerable time to make themselves felt.  This suggests Ireland is confronting very severe challenges and some opportunities.  In current conditions cost-effective actions for CO2 reductions on a predictable timescale in areas such as energy efficiency, transport, renewables and agriculture face significant constraints in policy design, human resources in the public system, public finance, the limited availability of credit in the private sector and the widespread deleveraging in the household and business sectors.  At the same time it is equally true that some of the measures, particularly energy efficiency measures, for addressing climate change can promote recovery and employment in the coming years.  Many of the measures we want to take mesh with long-term economic development.</p><p>  Overall we suggest a pragmatic approach with action on three tracks simultaneously.  Track one is to design and implement measures which makes sense and are feasible in the coming years on energy efficiency, taxation, transport and agriculture.  Track two, which we label "explore and experiment", is to use organisational networks to test and scale policy possibilities in a range of areas such as electrification of heating and transport, the smart grid, biomass, transport and agriculture.  This track reflects our finding that action on climate change usually occurs when the ball is given to an agency or organisation which has the ability to run with it.</p></speech>

Some countries, for example Denmark, have made significant moves towards the widespread use of electric cars.  I need not tell our guests of the well-established benefits of this, but how near is Ireland to the widespread use or embracing of electric cars?  Some companies are more proactive than others and the ESB has tried to encourage knowledge, awareness and usage.</p></speech>

Although that target was the subject of heated debate in terms of whether it was realistic or sensible and whether the provision of generous subsidies was feasible or wise, our instinct is that we will look back on what we are currently doing as having been wise and prescient.  The ESB has been given a significantly entrepreneurial role in developing its capacity in terms of the softer technologies of charging, albeit not the motor vehicles themselves.  This type of development is a wise move for Ireland, in that it will have a limited role in the motor industry and that there will be a diffusion in time, albeit not within the target period.  Ireland may gain some leadership in terms of the softer technologies of electric vehicles, the ICT as it were.  My colleagues may have more to contribute on this matter.</p></speech>

I might connect the issue with the question on animal waste.  The solution to the latter can be somewhat similar, that is, entrepreneurial activity led by agencies to try to figure out what to do.  When one examines the economics, using animal waste to reduce emissions is more costly than other options within the agricultural sector.  This alone tends to knock it out of contention when one considers the marginal abatement cost curve, MACC, carried out for us by Teagasc.  However, using animal waste is a good idea in terms of its impact on emissions, the environment, landfill and job creation potential, but we need to work with agencies to figure out how to do it in a cost effective way.  For example, the desk analysis implies the need for a centralised large anaerobic digestion plant.  It is interesting that companies such as Bord G&aacute;is are considering how to produce bio-methane gas from animal waste.  If anyone will figure out how to do it in a cost-effective way, it will be at that level.</p></speech>

We have just considered the report of the credit union movement on people's concerns about the cost of energy.  We are acutely aware that there is an issue at a household level.  It is essential that we link energy security and climate change by way of legislation and achieve returns by meeting our targets.</p><p>  We will discuss local government later.  Some London boroughs are meeting targets and drawing in community groups in a way that engages people more directly than, for example, asking the ESB to do some work.  Do our guests agree that we need to change people's mindsets in respect of transport and their homes?  According to the report, our homes produce 47% more CO2 than the average dwelling in the UK.  It is at this level we need to start engaging people.  At what point will we reach that stage?  I am concerned that we will have good policy and legislation, but that the public response will be behind the curve.  The public could be engaged earlier.  What can be done in this regard in the meantime?</p><p>  Ireland has a supply of 28 days of fossil fuel.  Given the recent economic earthquake, our attention has been drawn to our exposure to the lack of a longer period of energy security.</p></speech>

The report, as well as emphasising the role of key agencies on specific issues such as the role of the ESB in regard to electric vehicles and SEAI on energy efficiency, supports the view of SEAI that although retrofit appears to make good sense, in terms of payback for a household, there is no guarantee that is what will happen.  There are a range of obstacles to this, some of which might be overcome through more collective approaches such as, for example, estimation of possible retrofit if carried out on a house by house basis, the cost of which would be higher than that of a group or collective scheme.  In the long run, progress on these issues will depend on a high level of engagement.  Ireland, as we know, has a vibrant community life although to a lesser extent in the area of energy than in many other areas such as culture and so on.  A theme of the report, one which is emerging internationally, is the need to get beyond information campaigns to engaging households and communities more actively in ways that address the obstacles.</p><p>  The Deputy asked about energy security.  It is a matter for our end of year report, which includes the energy sector proper and the emissions trading large-scale energy sector.  The figure in this regard will be included in our end of year report rather than in our interim report.</p></speech>

Do they have any suggestions on what individuals, families and small organisations can do at no cost to them?  While people would like to do something, the perception is that doing so generally costs them in the long term.</p></speech>

Schemes which we strongly endorse, such as the green schools initiative, can only work if they involve communities.  While there is a cost involved, significant amounts of public money are not required.  The major action is that to which I referred earlier, namely, retrofit, in respect of which we all face a tricky challenge.  The public system has relied on a grant based scheme to incentivise retrofit and it has delivered significantly.  However, the current public finance crisis dictates a different approach now.  No one knows exactly what will be achieved through a pay-as-you-save scheme, which would require no upfront money from the household but would still yield the savings, energy and otherwise.  That is the key idea everyone is keen to explore.  Nobody is foolish enough to claim that they have cracked what that looks like.  The Government has announced its intention to explore this vigorously in the next year.  Our progress in retrofit will slow down dramatically in the next year or so given the switch from a funded to a private regime.</p></speech>

In the witnesses' view, how important is it to engage stakeholders directly in this process, including implementation, design and so on?  Some organisations are of the view that we should develop policy and legislation first, following which everything else will fall into place.  In my view, stakeholders should be involved from the outset.  We need to encourage buy-in and understanding if we are going to effect real change.  I am interested to hear the witnesses view on this.</p><p>  I agree with Deputy Murphy that we need to change attitudes towards energy efficiency.  The SEAI must be complimented on some of the schemes it has operated to date.  How do we go about supplementing those schemes?  The SEAI is currently running a community scheme, in respect of which it invited submissions from local authorities and community groups, which is very successful.  However, what we need now is information on the outcome of schemes, including on savings achieved and reductions in carbon emissions.  The pay-as-you-save scheme was mentioned.  We need to see more details on that scheme also.</p><p>  To what extent has the report addressed issues such as co-ordination between public authorities in terms of achieving a reduction in carbon emissions?  If institutions of the State are not addressing this matter in a co-ordinated, consistent fashion, how then can we expect citizens to do so?  We need to start with facilities in respect of which the State has facilities management, including public buildings such as schools, institutions, Garda stations, Leinster House and so on.  We need to show where the real reductions in carbon emissions are being achieved by way of new technologies and so on.  There are some measures of this type in place.  The SEAI, in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills, recently launched a new website for schools in relation to energy conservation and reducing carbon emissions.  However, we need to go beyond this.  Does the report detail how this type of action could be co-ordinated at public sector level prior to engagement at citizenship level?  </p><p>  In my view, many of the schemes previously introduced were priced way above what was possible for ordinary people, in particular in rural Ireland.  Elderly people do not understand geothermal renewable schemes and certainly cannot afford them.  I do not understand why we do not incentivise the replacement of an open fire, which is approximately 20% efficient, with a solid fuel stove, which is almost 75% efficient.  This would allow people to ensure proper heating of their homes at a much reduced cost.  I believe people would buy into this type of scheme, thus reducing our carbon emissions.</p></speech>

A scheme has been introduced in Denmark which commits to the upgrading, by way of insulation and so on, every year of 3% of state buildings.  Is Ireland taking this route in terms of energy saving schemes for State buildings, including Leinster House, local authority buildings, hospitals, schools and so on?  This is a critical issue in terms of the State being the largest landlord in the country.  Are we falling down in this regard?</p></speech>

That framework is consistent, if not identical, with the point made by Deputy Coffey, namely, that, to date the discussion around whether there is an institutional problem in terms of making and delivering climate policy has very much focused on if we need something different or extra at the level of central government strategy.  That is an important question, which is addressed in the final chapter of the report, although not in a definitive way.  We were anxious to make the point that low level policy, which includes agencies, communities, schools and so on, is as important as high level policy.  An intelligent discussion on the institutional challenge needs to focus on high and low level policy rather than on what killer advice agency could be invented.</p></speech>

This means a third party would become involved that has expertise in energy.  There are different models in how this can work.  It would seem an attractive idea for the public sector to engage with a third party that would initially undertake the investment, which would be repaid using subsequent energy savings.</p><p>  We identified the need for the State to help with the legal structures and develop a clear legal model to have standardised procedures and facilitate this taking place in both the public and private sector.  There is a role for the State in renewable heating and it can try to lead the market in that regard.  It would be desirable to open public procurement to renewable heating, which can be an attractive option in some parts of the country.  It is hard for renewable heating, with biomass as the main option, to be competitive with gas but parts of the country are not on the gas network and there may be a reasonably high demand for energy.  In those cases it can be a competitive option and there should be more consideration of it from the public sector.</p></speech>

How realistic are the 2020 emissions targets?  The witnesses made a comment about agriculture and food production and how we could be world leaders in efficiencies in the sector.  Will they expand a little on what could be deliverable in that regard?  I notice there is no mention of flood alleviation.  I live in Laois-Offaly and the Shannon frequently floods in the area.  It has been accepted that this happens every year but the effects of climate change have been felt this year more than most.  Flood alleviation should be a major part of the strategy in dealing with the effects of climate change.  What is the opinion of the witnesses?</p></speech>

If we continue existing policies there will be a substantial gap in meeting our targets, and it is projected that non-emissions trading scheme emissions, which are a national responsibility, will fall by 3% rather than 20%.  The Environmental Protection Agency has another scenario with additional measures, which is based on achieving stated Government policies and targets.  It assumes we will achieve fully the national energy efficiency plan and the renewable action plan.  If those can be achieved, emissions would fall by 11%.  That would bring us close to the target.  In the early years of the period there are set targets and we could be below them, meaning credits could be carried forward.  If the additional measures could be implemented, we would come very close to meeting the targets.  Nevertheless, it would be very challenging to implement all of them.</p><p>  The more likely outcome is there will be some gap.  If all the cost-effective opportunities could be implemented, we would be able to meet our targets.  There is also an option of buying credits.  We should initially seek to go as far as we can to meet these targets and there are options to make up a shortfall.</p></speech>

Ireland has, by international standards, relatively low carbon production of food, even if within our own national emissions agriculture accounts for a very significant proportion of that.  There are parallel developments in mind for that.  One is that over time it is possible - although not certain - that the international accounting framework for agriculture and land use, which is already evolving, will develop in a way suited to Ireland's interests.  Irish experts in the international accounting community are very active in that space but any kind of leadership position in food aspects of environment and climate depend on us doing to the highest possible standard what we claim to do.  There is a real connection between any case we make internationally about the way accounting might evolve and achieving the diffusion of the practices identified by Teagasc, which involve the lowest possible forms of carbon footprint in different kinds of agriculture.</p><p>  This is an example of a link between the out-facing and in-facing aspects of the issue.  The out-facing aspects include Ireland's position in this evolving UN and EU accounting system, which is changing substantially attitudes to land, forestry and perhaps, in time, agriculture.  Ireland's position in that space is only credible if there is a rigorous sign-up by all actors to the kind of standards and quality that Teagasc and Bord Bia identify at present.</p></speech>

Our work so far has been primarily about that but there is a strong reason to believe the incidence of extreme weather events is connected to climate change and there is no question that that involves new forms of adaptation.  Our work so far has not gone into great depth on the challenge of adaption to climate change, and our work between now and the end of the year will probably not do so.</p></speech>

One is whether, in the overall strategy, the balance between abatement and adaptation should be different.  I am loath to say something on that without thinking about it more but clearly the sharp end of it, such as the severe flooding that has occurred in recent years, is bringing to the surface water management issues in Ireland and there is no way we can avoid responding to them.</p></speech>

I apologise for coming in late.   For me, one of the major challenges the House faces over the coming months and year is to develop legislation.  I found the area of fuel poverty in the report very interesting.  The report refers to increasing the grant from &euro;3,000 to &euro;8,000 for retrofitting.  The pay-as-you-save scheme is about to be introduced, although it has been piloted.  The uptake may not be great because people are concerned about budgetary constraints.  Would it be a good idea to ring-fence some of the carbon tax income for grants to retrofit buildings?</p></speech>

In general, there is a strong view internationally that carbon taxes at the level they tend to be set are doing more work raising revenue than dramatically changing the use of fossil fuels and that part of that revenue is a resource to address climate change through other means, whether by supporting research and development on clean energy or by doing the kinds of things the Deputy referred to.  In general, there is a kind of logic in that but, at the same time, we are aware of how sensitive the issue of hypothecation of taxes seems to be within the system.  We would be reluctant to make a firm statement on that because there are so many other calls.  As I said, in a general sense, there is a logic in seeing revenue from such sources as a resource to address the problems, but I am reluctant to take a strong view on hypothecation.</p></speech>

That is a fairly definite statement.  Would it be it progressive, in looking at a levying a carbon tax, to ring-fence that and target it directly at people experiencing fuel poverty and at retrofitting many of our buildings and homes which were built in the 1950s and 1960s to very low standards to reduce their energy consumption?</p></speech>

Fuel poverty has been a key part of policy and of the work of, say, the SEAI, and it absolutely has to be.  We know the reluctance to extend the carbon tax to coal and peat reflected, in part, that distributive concern.  Our view would be that were the tax to be extended to those fuels, the distributive effect would have to be addressed through other means.</p></speech>

The plastic bag levy was effective for environmental reasons and in terms of how that money was spent.  If we took part of the carbon tax and targeted it towards retrofitting, increasing the insulation of homes would reduce our carbon footprint effectively.</p></speech>

That is the average investment we would like to see.  We were not proposing a grant at that level.  We took account of the current policy direction which has signalled that mainstream grants for energy efficiency are to be phased out.  The plan is that they would end next year and be partially replaced with a pay-as-you-save scheme.  That is the type of investment we would like to see supported.  Given the public finance constraints, we are not advocating a straight grant at that level.</p></speech>

It is something of a quirk of the approach that forestry is not counted, or land use change is not counted, in defining those 2020 targets.  In the figures we discussed, we did not factor in the savings one would get from forestry.  Clearly, from a long-term perspective, we should go beyond thinking purely in terms of compliance.  There is a significant effect in terms of forestry and it needs to be part of longer-term policy.</p></speech>

It mentions the possibility of a gradual increase in the carbon tax up to 2020.  We know that any increase in the carbon tax will lead to increased public transport costs.  Bus &Eacute;ireann and Irish Rail are cutting back on services due to higher costs.  It is affecting many areas.  We should be designing schemes that encourage people to use public transport.  It is very difficult to encourage people to use a system from which services have been withdrawn.

Any gradual increase in carbon tax will push up the cost of school transport and affect industry and agriculture.  We all know that trials and pilot schemes with regard to biomass and bioenergy crops were in operation over recent years.  They were monitored by the Department.  Generous grants were offered to encourage people to participate in these trials.  When the crops failed, farmers who were participating in pilot schemes were badly hit.  It has left a very sour taste in people's mouths.  Many people are reluctant to move into this area again.  I would welcome the officials' comments on that.  Reference has also been made to the possibility of revising the car bands.  That has happened over recent years.  Maybe those present will elaborate a little further on that.  Three or four bands are already in place.  The former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government revised the bands three or four years ago.</p></speech>

Perhaps Dr. O'Connell will respond to the other issues.  I understand the point the Deputy has made about the carbon tax.  I would like to clarify our approach to the carbon tax and the role of the carbon tax in climate change policy.  In other countries, the willingness and ability to impose carbon taxes and-or heavy emissions trading caps has historically been closely linked to the availability of alternatives.  The strategy we are talking about does not involve forcing the transport sector, for example, into change through the heavy imposition of taxes.  We are saying that a gradual increase in the tax needs to be accompanied by measures which make the alternatives more available and attractive.  For example, we can take vigorous action to encourage gas to be used in vehicle transport.  The strategy is not based on increasing prices heavily to force people to make changes.  Gradual tax increases, which can act as a disincentive to certain kinds of activity, must be combined with action to make alternatives available.</p></speech>

We met representatives of the IFA when we were preparing our report.  We are conscious that the Departments of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources are working to ensure a new scheme can be designed.  We would welcome that because there are big opportunities in this area.  Any new scheme has to be right if farmers are to be encouraged to participate in it.  We spoke on our way to this meeting to a representative of Bord na M&oacute;na.  It is encouraging that activity is taking place at that level, for example in terms of sitting down and working with farmers.  We know there is a demand within Bord na M&oacute;na for willow to be grown.  We just have to figure out how we can ensure the incentive structure is right, the scheme can develop and the product can be supplied.  I remind Deputy Bannon that 92% of all cars that are purchased fall within the first two of the seven bands.  In a sense, five of the bands are not doing much work.  If we believe they are too clustered, we will have to look at a new system that will provide for greater variety in terms of the way we classify cars.  The success of the last system led to the clustering of all the cars.</p></speech>

Could the officials be more specific in that regard?  Could they identify the areas that are covered in the document?  Mr. Cahill referred to the legally binding emissions reduction target that will have to be met by 2020.  Could he be more specific about the interim targets that will be required under the five-year carbon budgets?  How can we ensure these targets are met domestically without having to buy offset credits overseas?  It was suggested to me that an independent climate change commission, with the power to publish its own reports, should be established to advise the Government.

The success of the practices that have been proposed will be determined by whether they are taken up by a high percentage  of farmers.  It is important for detailed plans to be put in place now.  We know it takes time for improvements in the economic breeding index to be seen in the herd.  We need to know what will happen in the next two or three years.  Rather than waiting until 2020 to come back to this issue, it is important for plans to be put in place for these specific measures.  Those plans should cater for the support practices and farm discussion groups, etc. that are required to roll these practices out across more farms.</p></speech>

In our final chapter we discussed the institutional issue.  In the interim report we decided that rather than offer a firm view on the solution of whatever institutional problem people think there is, to lay out what we thought were the dimensions of the issue.  Our sense was that recommendations for new independent bodies are common and recommendations for redefining departmental boundaries are equally common.  Our aim was to try to prompt a discussion among the Departments and the other stakeholders on the issue.  To some degree we have found that discussion is happening.  People have been coming to us and saying it is very interesting to think about the outfacing and the infacing about the high level of strategic decision making and the front-line action.  So far we have remained agnostic on whether an independent commission is needed and whether, if created, it would be effective.  There is a widespread sense that the high-level decision making has not been as clear and crisp in this area as it might have been but that there are these other dimensions as well.</p></speech>

I thank them for attending.</p><p>  I wish to draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l)</i> of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of evidence they give to this committee.</p> <p>However, if they are directed at any stage by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her or it identifiable.  The opening statement and other documents they have submitted to the committee will be published on the committee's website this afternoon.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> The document we are discussing was published last week.  Members of the committee were displeased, to say the least, that they did not receive an official invite to the event and I empathise with them.  It was an unfortunate oversight, but I realise that the decision was not within the remit of the officials before the committee.  I thank them for appearing before it at short notice.  I acknowledge that we have received a lengthy opening statement, despite the fact that we did not realistically expect to receive one, given the short timeframe between the issuing of the invitation and its acceptance.</p><p> Local government reform is a significant issue, one in which we are all interested.  Almost without exception, Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas would have begun their careers on councils.  Local government is an innate part of the role of the individuals with whom the delegation is engaging.  We all know the system and its failings and how it should be reformed.  Members will focus on certain issues.  I call on the delegation to address how the new local government structures will be used to bind natural communities together in a community context.  This relates to its role in terms of economic units enhancing local development, job creation opportunities and the important role local government has to play with regard to industrial units, agrifood units and creating sustainable jobs in rural areas, as well as the critical role of the planning process, especially in trying to maintain the vitality and vibrancy of town centres.</p><p> Local government is for everyone on all parts of the island, not only those in town centres.  There is a critical role to be played in terms of areas not be covered by municipal district councils.  I call on the delegation to elaborate on the role municipal districts will play.  Obviously, there are reservations, in part due to the abolition of town councils.  We can see the streamlining of local government and, in particular, the role municipal districts will play.  They will have a role along the lines of that of area committees.  We are keen to see the establishment of better local government and the creation of strategic policy committees.  We want to avoid duplication and creating a system that, to all intents and purposes, is meaningless.  This must be real reform.  Reductionism is not reform; reform is led from the bottom up and the top down.  It is a strong role.  I am keen to tease out the issue of municipal districts, how they will be brought into being and the role the reformed local government sector will have in areas that are not town centres.  Substantial hinterlands in counties have never been covered by a town council.  What is to be the role played in respect of these areas in the future?  I call on the delegation to address these points.</p></speech>

We are due to be joined by another colleague, Mr. Aidan O'Reilly, from our community division.  He was unable to make it for the starting time, but I hope he will join us later.  </p><p>  We are grateful for the opportunity to brief the committee on the Government's recently launched document, Putting People First - Action Programme for Effective Local Government.  We are at the committee's disposal to provide as much clarification as we can with regard to the programme which was published on 16 October following Government approval.  We are keen to report to the Minister the views of the committee which could help to inform the more detailed development and implementation of the reform programme.  This opening statement outlines the main features of the reform programme.  It may help to set out a context for the committee's deliberations.  We will be happy to deal as fully as possible with its questions on the contents of the programme.  We note the issues the Chairman has drawn to our attention.</p><p>  The action programme sets out Government policy for reform in all the main areas of local government, including structures, functions, funding, operational arrangements, governance, the role of the executive and the elected council and engagement with local communities.  It addresses several fundamental issues in local government structures that have been problematic for several years, including outdated structures and the fact that the functions of local government are much narrower than in most democratic states.  It draws on the constitutional status which local government enjoys as the second tier of government in the State.  It also recognises the uniqueness of local government compared with other elements of the public service in terms of engaging with the public as citizens, as well as clients or customers.</p><p>  The programme is based on a strong rationale and purpose for local government which is expressed in the vision for the future of local government set out at the start of the policy document.  It states local government will be the main vehicle of governance and public service at local level, leading economic, social and community development, delivering efficient and good value services and representing citizens and communities as effectively and accountably as possible.  In keeping with that vision, the document contains a firm commitment that local government will not in the future be bypassed by the establishment of other structures of local administration outside the local government system, unless there is a compelling reason for doing so.  The logic of this principle is that it is wasteful and inefficient for local government in Ireland to be under-utilised.  Since we have an extensive system of local government that extends throughout the country, with more than 28,000 staff and a total spend of some &euro;7 billion, it should be used as fully as possible to perform the functions of public administration and service delivery at local level.  Local government, rather than centralised agencies, should be the first port of call to solve local problems, decide local issues and provide local services.  The action programme states the potential of local government will be maximised through effective, accountable representation and efficient delivery of services; a strong sense of local ownership and responsibility; and decision making close to the local community by those who best understand its needs and appreciate its potential.</p><p>  The programme sets out a course of action to achieve the vision outlined for local government.  The qualities and achievements of local government in Ireland are acknowledged, not least the response to the recent financial crisis, in respect of which, despite shedding 25% of staff and making savings of more than &euro;830 million, local authorities have maintained services at a good standard.  However, the shortcomings in the system and issues that need to be addressed are clearly and frankly identified.  The document identifies a key problem with local government for many years, that is, a lack of confidence and credibility in the system.  This was a key reason previous proposals to devolve functions from central to local government came to little.  Lack of commitment on the part of central agencies and perhaps unrealistic expectations of what could be achieved quickly were probably also factors.  There has been a reluctance to devolve functions that are standard activities of local government in most countries and a view that the current system of local government needs reform and modernisation to build credibility and confidence.</p><p>  The local government system is often seen as outdated with anomalies, inconsistencies and structural and other deficiencies.  These include structures that have changed little since Victorian times; a disparate array of authorities, many lacking the scale or resources to support significant functions; some small towns with their own council, while larger ones are without municipal status; boundaries that bear little resemblance to current realities; some neighbouring authorities that compete instead of co-operate; elected bodies with limited revenue-raising powers and, as a result, limited accountability, responsibility and self-reliance; fragmented operating arrangements, with duplication and diseconomies; and systems of governance, performance measurement and public engagement that have lagged behind best modern practice.  The action programme for effective local government aims to address the weaknesses in the system, enhance capacity and improve performance throughout the entire system.  This involves reform of all its key elements, including structures, functions, resources, operational arrangements and governance.</p><p>  Strengthening the role of local government is a fundamental aim of reform.  Several measures are being taken to bring this about.  Local authorities are taking on key functions in the economic and local development areas.  The incorporation of the micro enterprise support function was a landmark decision for local government.  This will be augmented by several further enhancements to the economic function at local and regional level under the action programme.</p></speech>

I will call the five spokespersons for each of the groups in the order in which I should call them.  I urge members to ask questions because if we give an opinion and then ask the witnesses if they agree with it, that is not asking a question.  Given the interest the committee has in this issue, this can be a very good, productive and robust exchange.  I will call the five spokespersons first and then I will take a group questions from other members.  I will take the first question from the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson, Senator O'Sullivan.</p></speech>

I welcome the delegation and thank Mr. Dowling for his presentation.  Is it fair to say that this policy, as enunciated by Mr. Dowling, has been in the process of being developed for the past ten or more years and that the officials' predecessors in the Department have been generally working towards this outcome?  Is that one of the reasons we have seen a steady diminution and devolution of responsibilities from town councils to county councils in terms of water services and so on?</p><p>  Mr. Dowling is no doubt aware that we in Ireland have almost the smallest local authority operation in the whole of the  EU in that each elected representative in Ireland at local level is elected by approximately 2,500 people on the register of electors, as opposed to approximately 1,000 in Denmark and significantly fewer than that in France.  Bearing that knowledge in mind, how does Mr. Dowling make sense of a drastic swingeing reduction in the number of elected members and a reduction in the number of local authorities and assemblies?  I cannot figure that out nor the rationale behind it unless it is a straightforward cost-cutting method and, if it is, I ask him to step forward and say so.</p></speech>

We hope we learned from the past and previous work that has been undertaken but the practical position is that there has not been a reform programme on a scale which has sought to tackle the range of issues.  The Deputy is right in that there have been difficulties in regard to the interplay between town and county structures and the reform programme is intended to resolve this for once and for all.  The Chairman asked about this point in terms of the municipal districts.  It is important before I deal with the Deputy's second question to spend a little time on this point, if that is appropriate at this stage.  It is crucial to the overall reform process that we would all have a shared understanding of what is intended as part of the municipal districts proposal.</p><p>  In terms of the facts, I will outline the principal features of the model.  It is important to do this because it will resolve the question that this is not some kind of a continuum of an approach in regard to towns when it is quite the opposite.  Our sub-county structures are intended to resolve a series of issues which have bedevilled local government as it has operated between the county and town.  There will be a comprehensive territorial configuration of each county into municipal districts.  We do not have that in place at present because some places have towns and often towns have formed there for simply historical reasons.  As I said in my statement, and Deputies will know this, many substantial towns do not have a similar structure in this respect and therefore there is an issue of coverage.  </p><p>  Second, members in the first instance will be elected to the municipal districts.  I understand the Minister said in the D&aacute;il earlier today that this is not a question of the abolition of structures but of generating new structures that integrate municipal representation which at present is currently undertaken through towns.  l believe the Minister would also emphasise his recognition and acknowledgment of the very strong connectivity  at local level in towns between elected members and their constituents.  The approach here seeks to build on that very strong relationship.  </p><p>  Third, there will not be a separate or parallel set of local authority members at the two levels.  This is critical in terms of resolving this issue as between the different levels of government.  Therefore, there will not be rivalry, competition or any inconsistency between what can happen within counties at the sub-county and county level.  Furthermore, there will be a single countywide executive or operational structure and no duplicate administrative or organisational overhead to eliminate the need for duplication of structures because in a sense there will be a single administrative structure which supports the representation of the municipal district level and the county level. </p><p>  The organisation format of local government will involve a single corporate entity incorporating the two elements of jurisdiction for the elected members, namely, the countywide level and the district level.  In a sense we will not have duplication of organisational structures, instead we will have different forms of representation which will come together to resolve these various issues.  </p><p>  This bring me to the question of functions.  The key emphasis here is on subsidiarity to ensure that matters which should be dealt with locally at the level of the citizen at municipal level are dealt with at the level.  We gave some examples in the statement and there are further examples in the action programme such as the local area plans, the housing services plans and so on.   On the other hand, and in response to a point the Deputy raised, we know there have been particular difficulties in trying to secure a coherent approach to planning where there can often be competing development plans.  We know equally that in terms of the engagement of businesses with local government there can often be competing issues between the rating decisions taken by individual towns and the rating decisions taken by wider country.  This approach seeks to resolve these issues which have stood in the way of previous reform efforts.  We do not underestimate the challenge involved in putting these arrangements in place but there will be significant legislation to do it, as I said in the statement.  It will have to be done well in advance of the local elections to give people time to prepare for that but there will also be time in terms of the preparation of the legislation when we can hear people's further views as to the way in which powers between the sub-county, the municipal district level and county level ought to be developed.</p><p>  As regards the overall numbers, and my colleagues may wish to supplement what I have said on these matters, the committee will recognise that there is huge unevenness in the ratio of representation throughout the country.  The restructuring will seek to ensure there will be greater evenness across that to secure an appropriate level of representation.  The Minister said in the D&aacute;il earlier today that the primary objective here is not to achieve financial savings but that given the economic position would we not be very inconsistent if we did not bring forward proposals which had a major benefit in terms of the public finances.  If we take the three central issues at present as being the need to create and sustain jobs, protect competitiveness and address the public finances, this overall programme, the Minister suggests, addresses all three through building new structures, modernising our approaches to efficiency and, hopefully, in time building greater confidence in our local government system.  We can draw enough inspiration from experiences abroad to show that we are on the right track in terms of the municipal approach trying to reconcile the different levels of government as between regional, county and municipal, and the doing of that will also hopefully bring about reductions and make the contributions local government has done during the past few years in terms of the public finances.  Mr. Conlan may wish to make some further comments on the municipal districts approach. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-23a.857" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Denis Conlan" time="15:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2012102300015#Q00100"><p>One point occurs to me that is relevant to the question and which has escaped much of the reportage, which is the policy document proposes that a significant range of reserved functions of the elected members will be devolved to district level.  This is a significant distinction from the current system of area committees, which really are advisory structures.  I also wish to make the related point that in respect of the historical trend regarding towns, functions and so on, it generally is accepted that the town authorities have become somewhat marginalised over the years.  If one considers different reports that have been published, I note a report was adopted in 1972 by the then Government, which effectively would have replaced the 80 town authorities by committees of the county council.  In 1991, the Barrington report contained two divided recommendations, one of which again recommended replacement of the town councils by area committees.  In recent years, the McCarthy report recommended the outright abolition of town authorities.  The local government efficiency review did not have in its terms of reference the authority to make recommendations on the structures but it recommended that rating, housing, roads and planning functions would be removed from town authorities.  Consequently, what is proposed in the document under discussion should be considered against that background.</p><p>  Part of the problem in the past regarding what one might call a dismissive attitude to town councils has been that the recommendations tended to be largely grounded on the considerations of operational efficiency.  The view was taken that towns are too small to be efficient and therefore they must go.  This document attempts to differentiate between the operational and the administrative element and the policy making, the role of the elected members.  This is an absolutely fundamental and key aspect of this action programme that must be borne in mind.  The document proposes that there be operational and administrative integration but devolved decision making across a significant range of functions to the districts and to members meeting as a municipal district council.  Moreover, as Mr. Des Dowling has stated, it will cover the totality of the State, including some very large centres of population that have no sub-county authorities at present.  This may be one relevant point to bear in mind with regard to functions, the trend in local government and the different views that have been taken over the years.  This is a significant change in that respect.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-23a.858" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/996" speakername="Michael McCarthy" time="15:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2012102300015#Q00200"><p>May I ask two questions in that regard?  They are cosmetic or aesthetic at least.  What will become of the premises that will be vacated in those areas in which town councils will depart?  Second, what will become of the staff?  Will they transfer to the county council or be offered voluntary redundancies?  I note that in the area I represent, five buildings will be vacated as a result of the abolition.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-23a.859" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Denis Conlan" time="15:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2012102300015#Q00300"><p>The ultimate decisions will be for the local authority as to what is the best and most efficient use of the buildings.  Clearly, there will be need for the municipal district council to have a meeting place and there will be an identity for the district.  It will be a wider identity in that effectively it will involve the town being joined by its natural hinterland.  However, it will be a matter for the councils in each case to decide, as part of their own financial dispensation and so forth, what is the best use to make of those buildings.  As for the staff, the staff of all town councils will become part of the unified staff.  As I noted just now, on the administrative side the proposal is for full integration into a countywide administrative structure.  As for how things go with regard to numbers and similar matters, that is part of the wider process.  It already is clear that the local government sector has reduced staffing more than any other part of the public service and the Minister himself dealt with this issue at some length today during Question Time in the D&aacute;il.  While a further reduction in staff of 500 is scheduled, it is clear they all will be managed within the framework of the Croke Park agreement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-23a.860" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/981" speakername="Sandra McLellan" time="15:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2012102300015#Q00400"><p>I thank the witnesses for the presentation and have one question in this regard.  How can the new chief executives be accountable to the elected members if the powers of such elected members are being eroded?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-23a.861" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Des Dowling" time="15:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2012102300015#Q00500"><p>I will try to break this down into its key elements.  The priority in the action programme obviously is to give emphasis to the role of the elected member in the first instance.  This is something to which we gave a fair amount of attention in the advance discussions on and subsequent preparation of the document because it often is the case that as they discuss these issues with us, even members themselves acknowledge they often underestimate the extent of the powers available to them.  The document sets out at considerable length the range of powers for the elected member, as opposed to the executives or the managers, as they are described at present.  The Minister sought to reinforce this emphasis by stating that in terms of a current approach, the elected council effectively should be perceived, in business parlance, as the board of directors and the manager should be perceived as being the chief executive and reporting to the council in that way.  There are two dimensions to this, the first of which is to recognise the powers elected members already have.  The second is to seek to try to enhance them and obviously, the operation of the municipal district approach should enhance that further in respect of pushing it down to the lowest possible level.  Thereafter, the manager or then chief executive - which will require legislation - will be clearly answerable in that regard and should report in the same way as does a chief executive to a board of directors in a business organisation.  There is the substantive issue but also the important issue of its appearance, that is, that the individual concerned is the chief executive but reports to the elected members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-23a.862" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Denis Conlan" time="15:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2012102300015#Q00600"><p>I will mention a few small points in this regard.  It is worth referring to chapter 11 of the policy document, which indicates that the reserved functions of the elected members are being added to, even in this programme itself.  There will be some new functions straightaway, such as the adoption of economic development, local and community and service plans.  There is a commitment to consider further additional reserved functions.  Moreover, in the legislation that must be introduced to implement these proposals, there is a commitment to making changes in the provisions relating to the powers of members versus managers that would strengthen the obligation on managers to comply with the policy decisions of the elected members.  In this respect, my guess is that some of the reportage perhaps again has created the impression of a reduction in members' powers by focusing on the provision relating to section 140.  This is something that tends to be latched onto a little bit and is presented as a wholesale reduction in members' powers but in fact, the thrust of the document is very much in the other direction and the change to the title and role of chief executive is consistent with that.</p></speech>

When considering the county council system and the county being selected as the core, it does not appear to me that anything much has altered.  While the area committees have been an improvement, much of what happened at town council level has not been a duplication.  Instead, there has been a community building role at that level, which is a soft service as opposed to some of the harder services which obviously are the bread and butter of county councils.  I am seriously concerned that the entire area of community building will be lost.</p></speech>

To start at the top level, the emphasis has been on trying to maintain a connection with the citizen wherever possible.  I know about the Deputy's own experience at town government level and anybody involved in that sector continuously emphasises this point.  The practical position is, however, that there is huge unevenness among towns across the country.  It has grown from a historical aspect rather than from a planned approach.  We have to move from the present system to try to achieve greater evenness.  As the policy document says, we must capitalise on that connectivity at a local level but in a way that does not compete with the interests of managing matters overall in the county.</p><p>  We should make a distinction between the way area committees have operated and what the new municipal districts will do.  The area committees deal with county matters from an area viewpoint, which is quite different to the range of functions town authorities have traditionally had and which municipal districts will have in the new configuration.  They are intended to be integrated at county level.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the connectivity the Deputy has mentioned, we should also acknowledge the duplication in various counties between town and county.  That is not in the interest of citizens who may wish to do their business in a particular way but may have both town and county offices in a particular area.  The programme seeks to rationalise that in a way that makes sense to the citizen, rather than from a bureaucrat's perspective.</p><p>  This will not necessarily be a quick process but it can only lead to a better outcome for ratepayers and taxpayers.  There will be work involved in rationalising offices.  Mr. Conlan has already referred to the extent to which council chambers and meeting places will be required for municipal districts.  In respect of functions at local level, certain service points have to be provided for people who want to do their business with the local authority.  As the Deputy's question implied, each local authority will have a different position depending on the current dispensation and the extent to which town authorities already have offices in the area.  Starting from now, authorities will put in place plans to lead to a better organisation.</p><p>  Earlier this afternoon in the D&aacute;il, the Minister covered regional government fairly closely.  The emphasis was to try to maximise representation at the lowest possible level, by securing election in the first instance to municipal districts and secondly at county level.  That will be used as the basis for provision of representation at regional level, rather than setting up a directly elected third and separate tier for regional assemblies.  Those are the main points I wanted to make.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-23a.870" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Des Dowling" time="16:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2012102300016#R00500"><p>The staffing issue is associated with existing office structures.  There are different staffing levels in each authority, which have developed incrementally over time.  They are a function of a variety of matters, including the authority's capacity to fund local services based on its own resources and the extent to which particular functions have been a priority for the elected council concerned.  The issue is the degree to which the current factual position can be made as even as possible within the existing structures.  Due to the approach that will be taken, we are building on existing town structures and dealing with existing hinterlands.  That gives the potential to draw on existing resources, so there should not be a huge mismatch between staffing and resources at municipal level, which can then be integrated into an overall county-based approach.  We are drawing heavily on what is already there, while hopefully filling in gaps where they exist.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions concerning the opening statement.  It was said that significant annual savings would be achieved through efficiency measures and workforce planning in local authorities.  Can Mr. Dowling expand on this?  Members will be aware that there is provision for a targeted redundancy package within local authorities, so how will this work?  Will county managers or the new chief executive officers be asked by the Department to recommend reductions of key personnel at certain levels, such as senior executive engineers, directors of services and other higher grades?  Will existing personnel covering smaller counties be asked to extend their remit across other counties to share services involving fire officers, veterinary officers, county librarians, arts officers and heritage officers?  Does Mr. Dowling think this can be achieved in the plan?</p><p>  I have another question concerning my own local authority in Sligo.  "Municipal authorities" is the name suggested for the sub-level of local government in the document.  Will some towns or cities be called municipal boroughs mainly for historic reasons?  I know it will apply in a number of boroughs.  Sligo Borough Council, for example, was granted this title in 1613 by King James I.  If the council was allowed to keep this name for historical and tourism reasons it would be a good step.  It would not in any way dilute the Department's proposal, particularly from a cost viewpoint.</p><p>  On page 54, the report refers to the establishment of a socioeconomic committee, SEC, by each city and county council, which will have responsibility for planning and oversight of all local community and development programmes.  The SEC will play a key role in decision making on EU and national funding programmes and interventions, as well as certain co-ordination functions of county development boards, which will in effect be replaced by the SECs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-23a.873" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Des Dowling" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2012102300017#S00200"><p>With regard to the overall question of savings, we did contextualise this in terms of the overall reform process.  The Deputy is correct that there is an indication that we would seek to achieve a further reduction of around 500 members of staff on a voluntary basis, specifically arising from an exercise in workforce planning.  The main objective was to recognise that as the local government sector has sought to reduce overall numbers, it can happen in an <i>ad hoc</i> way.  One of the tools we needed was to be able to look at each authority and have a template whereby one could judge the extent to which the structure was in keeping with the requirements and funding available.  Accordingly, the Department engaged with the County and City Managers Association, CCMA, to put together a workforce plan.  This was particularly aimed at administrative and management levels.  There would have been recognition that, in the reductions to date and partly due to demographic factors of an older workforce at front-line level, we needed to go faster in reductions at management and administrative level.  It was also recognised, however, that we needed to have a workforce plan that would provide a template against which that would be judged.  The additional 500 will be mainly at those management levels.</p><p>  It will be in line with the Croke Park agreement, as we averted to earlier.  There is a variety of means by which those reductions can be achieved, whether through redeployment or a redundancy package.  Overall, we want to get the least and optimal in terms of individual structures for local authorities.  Again, one can see significant variation across authorities on this.  The McLaughlin group originally drew attention to this.  For example, there were 230 people at director of service level.  That is now below 200 on the basis of the McLaughlin recommendation that it should be 190.  I would foresee it going below that level further through the workforce planning exercise.</p><p>  The Deputy referred to cross-boundary arrangements which already exist.  For example, Dublin City Council manages on a national basis the internal movement of hazardous waste while Offaly County Council has become the lead authority in respect of waste collection permitting.  While we want to progress a shared-services approach, it can happen at both national and local level.  The Minister has said that while he certainly sees the need for a single executive leader reporting to elected local authority members, he also sees significant scope for a shared services approach.  As regards the boroughs, the action programme does give recognition to this issue.  While the terminology and so on will be set out in legislation, it would be anticipated that one would have an arrangement equivalent to borough districts to recognise those locations where a borough council exists and take in its hinterland as well as retain the ceremonial and other civic elements of those structures.</p><p>  The SECs fits within the broader question of the relationship between local government and local development entities.  This has been the subject of examination by a steering group and the report of it was published with the action programme.  The task has been to recognise first the community function rests with the Minister.  Accordingly, there must be recognition that this community element has developed and has its own strengths.  In seeking to achieve the best alignment between it and local government, we must draw on both their strengths and the bottom-up approach which has been developed on the community side.  Alongside of that, there must be recognition that within counties the very best interactions and results in either the social or economic area are invariably achieved through good interagency co-operation.  There is very mixed experience in this but we need a structure which fully involves and takes in the community piece, as well as the funding and organisation of that.  The SEC is to give the appropriate emphasis to and recognise, as the action programme does, the role of local authorities in the economic area including the new local enterprise offices.</p></speech>

The action programme is quite detailed and has led to some confusion in the past week.  Last Saturday, I attended a special delegate conference of my nominating body, the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland, AMAI, at which more than 130 councillors were present.  To say they were confused would be an understatement.  Several questions were raised with me at the meeting.</p><p>  The establishment of the new local government system is arrived at by dividing 4,830 people into the population of the country giving a figure of 950 councillors.  How was this formula devised?  The original announcement was that there would six to nine councillors per district.  It has now increased to ten.  Is there further flexibility in that?</p><p>  Much play has been made of the abolition of section 140 of the Local Government Act 2001.  I have been informed strongly that most of the planning scandals came from other mechanisms of altering planning as opposed to provisions under section 140.  In rural areas, section 140 dealt with specific one-off housing cases involving families and family members.  Will the rest of the planning issues be examined which have been raised in the Mahon tribunal report?</p><p>  It is proposed to change the county or city manager title to chief executive officer.  My understanding is that chief executive officers implement policy but do not make it.  There is no reference in the proposals to the City and County Management (Amendment) Act 1955 which gives the managers most of the powers they have.  Will that legislation be rescinded?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-23a.879" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Des Dowling" time="16:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2012102300018#T00200"><p>I will ask my colleagues to address some of the wide range of questions raised by Senator Landy.  We have worked closely with the AMAI but I recognise this is a significant document and a new approach.  We will probably have to do more on the communications side to explain what it involves and this will happen as implementation proceeds.</p><p>  The Senator referred to the question of the boundary committee.  I do not have definitive information on that issue, although clearly it will have to proceed fairly quickly.  I expect that the Minister will make an announcement reasonably soon because, as we noted earlier, the local elections are the end point at which the new electoral structures must be ready.  It has been suggested to us that prospective members need at least 12 months in advance of the elections to prepare accordingly.  This would mean that the boundary committee needs to complete its work and provide a template that can be put into legislation by the middle of next year.  This is clearly a significant task but beyond setting out the timetable we have not yet taken a decision which can be communicated to the committee.  I do not doubt the Minister will be making his announcement as soon as he is able to do so.</p><p>  The other element is the legislation governing the structural aspects of the municipal districts and a range of other matters.  The approach in this regard will be to give ourselves as much time as possible in advance of the local elections but we cannot determine whether we will be preparing one comprehensive Bill or a number of smaller Bills until we study the details of what is involved.</p><p>  I will ask Mr. Conlan to answer the question on ratios but I will continue to answer some of the other questions the Senator raised.  Perhaps the media have put too much emphasis on section 140.  The Minister addressed this issue in the D&aacute;il today.  The practical position is that the number of uses of section 140 in very recent years has been relatively few but it is an issue to which the Mahon tribunal drew attention.  A range of other measures will be introduced regarding ethics in planning sphere and other areas.  In parallel with this reform process, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is considering an ethics scheme that would cover the entire public service and the Minister, Deputy Hogan, has indicated that any updating of the ethics regime as it applies to local government should fit within that broader context.  The Minister has stated that restoring public confidence in the planning system is a key objective and that he will be proceeding with the implementation of the 12 actions contained in the planning review report published in June 2012.  These will entail legislative change and consolidation, revised non-statutory guidelines and improved management systems in planning authorities.  A range of important initiatives are being taken in this regard but most of them are not within my own area.  </p><p>  The regional assemblies will have a range of functions.  We want to build on their successful involvement in regional planning guidelines and, as the action programme makes clear, we intend to develop an oversight role in how national policy is delivered at local level, as well as a regional perspective.  The question of the EU role will be addressed in time and it will ultimately be a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  However, the general desire is that all State authorities and agencies should seek to co-ordinate around the revised regional structures as far as is practical.</p><p>  I cannot provide precise details on how the funding arrangements between municipal district and county level will operate at this stage.  These matters will have to be contained in the legislation.  There will be a need for an aggregated budget which can be dealt with at county level.  We foresee some kind of block grant arrangements being put in place but it is important to recognise that the same members will be acting at county level and at municipal district level.  In a sense, the same people will be making decisions on funding.</p></speech>

They will be elected at municipal district level but they will come together at the integrated county level to make overall budgetary decisions which, in turn, have a local dimension.</p><p>  The Minister spoke earlier about the local property tax.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-23a.883" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Denis Conlan" time="16:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2012102300019#U00200"><p>Mr. Dowling has mentioned that I deal with the question of ratios and representation.  With regard to the budgets for the municipal districts, from recollection, the document states specifically that the overall budget for the county will have to take account of the decisions made by members at district level.  It also makes reference to a number of other possible ways of giving specific recognition to the district in the estimates and the funding process, for example, by taking account of it in the determination of block allocations, by taking account of the level of revenue raised within the particular district and - Deputy Murphy referred to this in the D&aacute;il earlier - the fact that towns, including non-rating authorities, have the power to add a certain amount through locally applicable charges.  Something along these lines is mentioned.  However, it will have to be worked out in greater detail in the development of the legislation.</p><p>  At regional level, the starting point for the functions of the new regional assemblies should be a combination of the functions of the current assemblies and the regional authorities subject to the point Mr. Dowling made about the next round of EU funding.  It has yet to be fully clarified and determined and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has the lead role in that regard.  The hope is that will be the starting point.  That means, for example, that the regional planning guidelines function will remain and the document provides that it will be significantly strengthened by expanding it to include regional, spatial and economic strategies, with a requirement that all State agencies engage in a more meaningful way with the regional authorities in adopting these strategies and that they adhere to them, particularly in the context of economic development with all of the economic agencies.  The problem up to now has been up that many of the agencies such as IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, F&Aacute;S and its replacement have had difficulty in engaging with the local government system at county level.  It has become difficult to do it with reduced resources and so forth.  The regional level, therefore, will have a much stronger role in economic development and ensuring there is a coherent approach across the region in order that different cities and areas will not be competing for inward investment with all the players involved at regional level.  The role of the regional assemblies in local government oversight functions is also additional.</p><p>  I refer to the ratios and from where the figures and so on come.  Clearly, there will be a significant reduction in the total number of elected members as a result of the changes proposed and, in recognition of this, the Government looked at the scope for increasing the number at county council level.  As a component of this at the district level, clearly in the current financial climate the scope for increased county and city level numbers was somewhat limited and, as a result, the overall number that emerged in the Government decision which is reflected in the document was 950.  It is from this figure that the ratio of 1:4,830 emerges.  If the total population is divided by 950, that is the figure that emerges.  However, the number per area will only emerge as the terms of reference for the electoral review are published and it is a matter for the Minister to set up a committee under the Local Government Acts and set out the terms of reference.  The report gives strong pointers in that direction.  It refers to the figure of 4,830 as a benchmark.  It also refers to the case for having a weighting for the distribution of existing municipal towns that have a local authority and other large centres of population that do not and for town councils and the city areas within the authorities that are merging in Limerick and Waterford.</p></speech>

That is very much a matter for the members themselves to determine.  They will have all these decisions to make for themselves and there is an expectation stated in the document that the districts will take a significant volume of local business away from the county council.  The Minister will not lay down the law in that regard.</p><p>  A good deal of one chapter of the report is devoted to economic development.  The Minister sees the role of local authorities in economic development as important and the integration of the local enterprise function into the local government system will be a significant development in that regard, in addition to the alignment of the local development sector which has a significant economic component and drawing on best practice.  It is probably a mixed practice currently in that some local authorities have achieved a great deal - others less so - in leading economic development and promoting the attraction of inward investment.  The role of local government is far from clear in terms of its legal provisions which will be clarified and strengthened.</p></speech>

It is refreshing to hear people who are members of the Government asking robust questions about this issue because I did not think it would happen and I congratulate the ones who have.  It is interesting and gives me some hope.</p><p>  The Department looked at other models of local government around the world, for example, in Switzerland.  What models did the Department look at?  Like anything, there is no point in reinventing the wheel when there are good versions of it already.  How will the proposed system enhance the role of a local representative when it comes to holding the executive to account?  Under the current system, it was the other way around.  My experience and that of many other people was that the more one held them to account, the less they answered the phone.  It is troublesome if that has not been improved.  </p><p>  When the Department looked at cost savings, did it consider the wages of county managers? In Roscommon, we pay the county manager 50%  more than is paid to the Spanish Prime Minister.  It seems that planning powers are being taken away from county councillors.  Why does the Department believe elected representatives are in a sense less trustworthy than un-elected people because that is what it suggests?  I would prefer someone who was elected and who I have the choice to put out if I was not happy with him or her making these decisions.  A member of the delegation spoke about how section 140 is rarely used.  I know of several occasions where councillors wanted to use it but they pulled back because they were afraid of the consequences of doing so.  In other words, the telephone would not be answered yet again.  </p><p>  If the Department was really interested in devolving power to the lowest possible level, why not have more town councils with more powers?  They do not necessarily have to cost money.  Someone once told me that all they could see in the reform was that the Department got rid of the cheap councillors and kept the expensive ones.  If someone from the delegation could answer those questions, I would appreciate it.</p></speech>

I have a few questions.  My first concerns the strengthening of the powers of local government and what is new in this plan.  Mr. Conlan mentioned the reference to district councils and I would agree with that.  It is important that we keep the name of the body.</p><p>  In respect of the regional assemblies, does the delegation see any difficulties with including Dublin with the eastern and midlands region because the demographics are so different between the city and the rural counties?  Does the delegation foresee any difficulties and was any consideration given to keeping Dublin on its own as a regional assembly?  Reference is also made to the oversight of local authority performance by the regional assemblies.  How does the delegation see that playing out?  Does the delegation think the strategic policy committees have greater potential than they have shown to date in some cases or does it think their role could be enhanced in this new system?  Finally, I have a local observation.  I am delighted Offaly County Council is the lead authority in waste permitting.  </p></speech>

Many of the issues I wanted to cover have already been covered so I will ask some specific questions.  The metropolitan areas are mentioned within the document and identified as being established within municipal districts.  What is the actual definition of the metropolitan area in this context?  Is any population threshold set for such metropolitan designation?  Are there any mechanisms in the new reform proposals that will allow metropolitan areas to adopt development plans for areas in adjacent local authorities, for example, through service level agreements?  Two examples are Limerick city, which goes into County Clare, and Waterford city, which has Ferrybank in County Kilkenny directly adjacent but is in that same urban area.  Many would agree that there should be some mechanism to allow the metropolitan or city area to adopt development plans for those urban areas through agreement.</p><p>  Mr. Dowling spoke about the amalgamation of Waterford city and county councils.  He said the identity and civic status of the city, including the office of mayor, will be maintained.  Could he define how will they be maintained?  There is a view that amalgamation will diminish the status of Waterford city as the gateway city of the south east.  What are Mr. Dowling's views on that?  Can he tell us how he would reassure those who say this that it is not the case?  Again, in respect of the amalgamation in Waterford, which is my constituency, savings of approximately &euro;5 million to &euro;9 million have been mentioned.  Can Mr. Dowling give details of how those figures were derived or where they were derived from?  </p></speech>

In respect of a point made by Deputy Flanagan about lack of trust in councillors, I return to my opening remark.  No matter what configuration one has in local government and there are many good ideas in the document, none of them seem to be predicated on reducing the number of councillors so why should we reduce the number of councillors by such a huge number in the context of Ireland having smaller number of councillors <i>per capita</i> than most of Europe.  I cannot get my head around what these municipal councils will be like.  I spent 22 years as a councillor at urban and county level and know what a town council is and what it is to be a county councillor.  They are two totally different job descriptions.  They involve different types of work, engagement with the public and demand.  Clearly, this municipal council will not be just like the area council and will be a different animal.  My town of Listowel has nine town councillors but has not had a county councillor since I was elected to the Seanad in 2007.  That happened for unusual reasons, much of them to do with the political dynamism of the place and family dynasties.  Will we have a situation where there will be a Listowel municipal council without a single councillor from the town and where the chairman of this new council could live 30 miles away, as do some councillors in the electoral district at the moment?  That does not add up to my idea of what a municipal council should be like.  If it is to be based around the municipal unit, surely the election process must be weighted to ensure the municipal town remains at the core of the municipal district?</p></speech>

The delegation might answer Deputy Flanagan's questions first, of which there were five.  They related to European models of local government, how the system could enhance the role of the representative in holding management to account and salary levels for managers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-23a.904" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Des Dowling" time="16:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2012102300021#W00200"><p>I will start and other colleagues may contribute.  With regard to the overall models, as I touched on earlier we drew inspiration from these rather than stating a definitive model exists which will fit in Ireland.  We participate in the Council of Europe which comprises very different experiences and we have looked further afield.  The manager system as we have it came from the United States.  We look at a variety of models.  The previous Green Paper set out some of these at length, in terms of harvesting previous work done.  However, when it came to it we were more guided by the variety of submissions made from within the country and the key issue has been to try to reconcile the viewpoints on town-based and county-based approaches.  As I stated, perhaps the way the municipality system works in France supports this.  Ultimately, we have had to develop an approach which is unique to here.</p><p>  Some of the other questions touch on the benefits of various forms of local administration - we will discuss Waterford later - and the idea of local identity, whether it be with a town or city, and trying to incorporate these into a model of governance which would work in Ireland.  The best answer I can give is that while we drew inspiration from various approaches and from looking further afield, none of them translate directly into the Irish context.  We have tried in the programme to put an emphasis on the elected member, and we drew inspiration from foreign models which seek to emphasise this.  The question of how to enhance this will ultimately be a matter for the members themselves over time.  We want to ensure members have as many tools as possible available to them.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-23a.906" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Des Dowling" time="16:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2012102300021#W00400"><p>One of the specific recommendations is to make the local government auditor available to elected members to provide them with assistance and information they might need to probe the executive with regard to financial matters.  Mr. Conlon referred specifically to examining legislation to ensure elected members can hold the managers and chief executives to account in this way.  Significant powers are already available but we are open to seeing how they can be enhanced further.  The audit is one element and a more general capacity to obtain answers from the executive would be another.</p><p>  We did not specifically deal with the question of managers' salaries because they are dealt with in a broader public service context with regard to overall senior management salaries.  The committee is aware of actions have been taken in this regard.  As with other posts, the overall rates have been reduced and the general arrangements for appointment have been brought into line with the Government's new approach using the Top Level Appointments Committee.  The Minister did not consider it necessary to deal with them other than how they have already been dealt with in these broader ways.  Of course there will be fewer county managers and chief executives under the new arrangements.</p><p>  We have tried to emphasise that section 140 is an issue, and we would be happy to hear more of what the Deputy has in mind with regard to its particular difficulties and its use or non-use, and how we can further ensure the weighting in decision-making is with the elected member rather than the executive.  Certainly this is the intention of the programme.</p><p>  With regard to the overall strengthening of local government, in the documents we have set out a range of functions which would move from central to local government and, in turn, those which would move from county level to municipal level.  This is the starting basis but it is possible, if legislation is being developed, to add to it.  I am certain the Minister will engage further with his colleagues on the move from central to local government in the first instance and then on the local element between city and county authorities and municipal authorities.</p><p>  I appreciate there will be as many views on the regional construction as there are variations.  In Dublin we have questions with regard to the city council and the three other local authorities, and when it comes to the region questions raised include what is the greater Dublin area, as this can include parts of Meath, Kildare and Wicklow.  Others may consider the eastern seaboard extending as far as Louth to be part of the region.  A balanced view must be taken on how to deal with these considerations, and the Government concluded the best way of trying to resolve this was not by trying to draw a line around Dublin city and county authorities but to deal with it as part of the broader Leinster configurations.</p><p>  With regard to Waterford, my colleagues will discuss section 140, strategic policy committees, powers and waste.  The overall savings of amalgamation are set out in the report of the independent group, and are assessed at approximately between &euro;5 million and &euro;9 million.  This is with regard to an overall budget of approximately &euro;127 million between the two local authorities.  It was felt this was a reasonable assessment of what would be achievable having regard to potential duplication of approaches.  It goes without saying corporate services and other headquarter functions have scope for efficiencies when the two authorities are brought together.  The Minister has been at pains to state this is to benefit Waterford as a whole.  Waterford is a very important gateway and this bears on the regional approach, of which Wexford, Kilkenny and Carlow are also part, which recognises Waterford's pre-eminence in the south east.  As the Minister stated in the D&aacute;il, it is quite possible to preserve, retain and build on the civic identity as part of this new configuration.  There is no competition between the broader county and the city, which ought to be the key point or pull of attraction for the area.</p></speech>

In the developing the report, a number of sources were examined as was the case with previous reviews.  In the sub-county area in particular it is valid to state the concept of a wider municipality rather than simply the built-up area of a town is very much in line with the European model.</p></speech>
