I do not anticipate this will be a contentious issue.  During an earlier debate it became apparent that placing the definition of &quot;intensive unit&quot; so far from the two sections to which it applies made the text less user friendly.  It is best to move the definition of &quot;intensive unit&quot; from the general definitions section to sections 19 and 20 as it is used only in these two sections and to make a few technical adjustments to ensure comparability between the two sections.</p></speech>

Concerns were expressed that the phrase &quot;a kind commonly kept for farming&quot; would exclude unusual or exotic species such a snake kept as a pet in a display cabinet.  We do not want the provision to be used as an excuse not to look after an animal that is uncommonly kept.  The original wording creates unnecessary ambiguity.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-27a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2012112700003#B01400"><p>I am happy to accommodate the replacing of the word &quot;necessary&quot; with &quot;reasonable&quot; in this section, but I am not prepared to do the same in the general animal welfare section because that would undermine the Bill's new approach towards animal welfare.  Section 8 deals with the prohibition on farm animals from straying.  I accept that some flexibility is needed in this regard.  That is why the wording &quot;take all necessary measures to ensure that&quot; is being changed to &quot;take all reasonable measures to ensure that&quot; animals do not stray.  I agree with the Deputy on the matter.  After a lengthy discussion in the Seanad, we agreed to prepare an amendment at a later stage.</p><p>  In respect of amendment No. 8, we did not deal with the commonage issues.  The general thrust of section 8 is to require that a fence, structure or building be erected to ensure animals do not stray.  There is, of course, an exception to this rule where a boundary is shared in a commonage area.  We need to accommodate this in the legislation, whcih is why amendments Nos. 8 and 9 do the same thing.  The legal advice we have received leads us to think our wording is slightly better, but essentially the amendments share the same motive.</p><p>  We have tried to understand the reasoning behind amendment No. 10.  I suspect it deals with mink farming in County Donegal, in particular, because that happens to be where most such farms are located.  I am not opposed to the amendment.  It adds a new subparagraph (<i>iii</i>) to subsection (1)(<i>b</i>) with the following effect:<blockquote>all buildings, gates, fences, hedges, boundary walls and other structures used to contain the animal are constructed and maintained in a manner that minimises -(<i>i</i>) the risk that the animal will stray,<br />(<i>ii</i>) the risk, or spread, of disease onto or from the land or premises on which the animal is kept,<br />(<i>iii</i>) the risk that the animal will damage the surrounding population of indigenous wild animals or the natural flora and fauna of the surrounding environment.</blockquote>Most of us who know about farming realise that mink can do extensive damage to wildlife if they are released into the wild.  We are happy, therefore, to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

I know about the damage that feral mink have done to birdlife and fauna.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-27a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2012112700003#B01600"><p>Given the conversation on fur farming we had last week, it is no harm to spell out in law the onus on farmers to ensure their mink do not escape.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-27a.31" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2012112700003#B01700"><p>I do not want to prolong the debate unnecessarily, but there are many unfenced commonages.  I understand farmers are liable if their cattle stray onto a road, but if sheep do likewise, the driver is liable for any damage done, which is the way it should be.  It is not possible to fence many commonages and one would not receive planning permission to do so.  I am delighted, therefore, that the Minister accepts my amendment.  I am also pleased that he is accepting the term "reasonable".  The best farmer in the world cannot always prevent animals from escaping.  The word "necessary" implies that one can always guarantee animals will not stray.  I refer, in particular, to the mountain sheep in the part of the world in which I live.</p></speech>

The amendment refers to &quot;a risk or a suspicion that disease is present&quot;.  As drafted, there does not need to be a suspicion that disease is present.  I am interested in the Minister's explanation for the use of this wording because it allows a wide margin in declaring a disease eradication area.  The purpose of the amendment is to limit this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-27a.43" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2012112700004#C01200"><p>The amendment would make no material change to the meaning; rather, it would merely change the tense of the verbs and, therefore, would not improve the Bill which has been drafted effectively by members of staff in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  The amendment would not improve on the work they have done.  The claim my team is making is that there is no material difference between what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is proposing and what we have included in the Bill.  If that is not the case, we need to discuss the matter and decide which is the better version.  We are trying to ensure the Minister can, by order, declare the State or part of it to be a disease eradication area for the purposes of containing a disease.  The amendment would provide that he or she could only do this where there was a risk or a suspicion that disease was present, whereas the section states "at risk of or suspected of being affected with disease in the area".  I am not sure what is the difference between them.  I am saying the same thing in that the area has to be at risk of, or suspected, of being affected with disease.  "Being affected with" is the same as "a disease being present".  That is our definition.  If that is not the case, I am happy to examine the matter.</p></speech>

There must be a difference.  If the Minister is willing to consult the Parliamentary Counsel before Report Stage, we can resubmit the amendment and he might be able to explain why the paragraph was not drafted in the way we have proposed.  We use straightforward English.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-27a.45" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2012112700004#C01400"><p>Section 9(<i>b</i>) states, &quot;disease is present there&quot;.  If we say &quot;disease has to be present&quot;, the Minister has to find an instance of the disease in the area.  If he or she knows it is likely to have spread into the area, he or she will want to close it down.  That is the flexibility a Minister should want.  If, for example, there is an outbreak of disease in west Cork and I know it is likely to spread into County Kerry, I will want to close off an area along the county border to prevent the disease from spreading.  However, while I cannot prove the disease has broken out in the area, it makes sense to close it off to prevent the disease from spreading to contiguous herds and so on.  I suspect we are looking for that flexibility, but I accept the speaking note does not state this.</p></speech>

Is that correct?</p></speech>

For example, a disease may be dormant for a period.  We are trying to cover areas in which disease is present, but the Minister should also have the flexibility to create a disease eradication area where he or she considers it is at risk, or suspected of being affected with the disease.  This precautionary principle should be factored in.</p></speech>

For example, cats and dogs get run over by cars.  Many people have domestic cats.  If someone allows his or her cat run about the back yard and it can get over the back wall and out onto the road, as most people do, has that person taken all necessary steps to ensure he or she has safeguarded the health and welfare of the animal?  If the cat gets killed, the question is whether the person took all necessary steps or all reasonable steps.  I believe it is reasonable to let a cat out, but if a person must ensure he or she has taken all necessary steps to look after the health and welfare of the animal, he or she would never let the cat out.  I rest my case.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-27a.64" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2012112700005#D00400"><p>The Deputy may have let the cat out of the bag.  I feel strongly about this and we had a long debate on this issue in the Seanad.  This and the valuation of animals, which we will deal with later, were the two areas on which we had the longest discussions.  If we were to introduce "reasonable" in Part 3, which is the most important part of the legislation in dealing with animal welfare and the legal responsibility of people who own or look after animals to actually look after their welfare, any time anyone was taken to court they would claim they did everything that was reasonable and refer to an excuse, such as being away for the weekend or not feeling well that day.  We do not have that approach to other legislation when it comes to responsibilities whereby people might be required to do everything reasonable to abide by the speed limit - one does everything necessary to abide by the speed limit by not going over the speed limit.</p><p>  In dealing with farm animals straying there is a need for flexibility for the reasons the Deputy gave earlier of animals straying, somebody knocking down a fence or whatever.  On the fundamentals of animal welfare and the principles relating to the prohibition of animal cruelty in the legislation and the responsibility on a person to safeguard the health and welfare of an animal in his or her ownership, we need to have legal clarity rather than deliberately factoring in ambiguity or flexibility.  The term "necessary" sends out a strong signal that a person is required to abide by the law in terms of animal welfare as opposed to being encouraged to do everything reasonable.</p><p>  The Bill specifies that a person should have regard to the animal&rsquo;s nature, type, species, breed, development and environment, and ensure that all buildings, gates, fences, hedges, boundary walls and other structures used to contain the animal are constructed and maintained in a manner that the animal is not caused injury or unnecessary suffering and so on.  Introducing the term "reasonable steps" to that type of requirement would make it almost impossible to secure a conviction for somebody who was cruel either intentionally or unintentionally.  It would dramatically undermine the purpose of the legislation which is to put a very clear line in the sand legally such that an animal owner has a responsibility and is required to look after its welfare.  That is why a person is required to take all necessary steps to do that.  Arguments will be made in a courtroom as to whether necessary steps were taken but there were other factors that meant that even though the person took those necessary steps there was still an animal welfare issue that was outside his or her control.  That is the normal legal wrangling that will take place.  Stating in the legislation "a person who has in his or her possession or under his or her control a protected animal shall take all reasonable steps" is too weak.  It does not send the kind of signal or gives the legal certainty we require.  Anybody with a decent barrister would ensure there would never be a conviction.</p><p>  I understand the Deputy's reasoning in the amendment and many people have made this point.  Even when we had this discussion in the Seanad, people accepted that for the previous section we replaced "necessary" with "reasonable", but that in the general animal welfare section, which is really the heart of the Bill, we need to keep the word "necessary" to keep legal certainty.</p></speech>

Domestic animals, particularly cats are allowed to roam.  Dogs are different and may be kept on a lead.  While allowing a cat to roam may threaten the health and welfare of the animal, it might equally be threatened by being kept in.  If what is specified in section 11(1)(<i>b</i>) is moved up to the top such that it applies to section 11(1)(<i>a</i>) and section 11(1)(<i>b</i>) then we are out the gate - the cat is over the wall.</p></speech>

The first subheading specifies:<blockquote><br />ensure that the animal is--(i) treated in a manner that--<blockquote>(I) safeguards the health and welfare of the animal,<br />and<br />(II) does not threaten the health or welfare of the animal or another animal,</blockquote>and<br />(ii) bred or kept, having regard to the species and the degree of development, adaptation and domestication of the animal and to its physiological and behavioural needs,</blockquote>The second subheading mentions: &quot;having regard to the animal's nature, type, species, breed&quot; etc.  A person must have regard to that anyhow.  I would be surprised if section 11(1)(<i>b</i>) did not also cover a cat running out, having regard to the animal's nature.  The nature of cats is that with some exceptions, they are semi-wild anyway.  My fear is that we would make nonsense of the Bill if we weaken the terminology.  If the Deputy wants to propose something else on Report Stage, I will consider it.</p></speech>

It covers all animals.  According to the legal opinion I have on this amendment, this proposal was discussed in the Seanad and, unlike the similar wording in section 8, it was agreed not to amend the wording from "necessary" to "reasonable".  This section is fundamental to the Bill.  Furthermore, while it is relatively clear-cut with regard to the buildings or fences and the requirement to stop animals straying, the scope for unscrupulous individuals to interpret "reasonable" to the detriment of animals in this section is too major to ignore.  We did make the change in respect of straying animals because animals stray and get knocked down as a result.  The heart of this section concerns the onus on the owner or the person looking after animals to look after their welfare.  People should have to do everything necessary to do that.</p></speech>

I will explain why this is the case.  What Deputies &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Pringle are proposing in amendment No. 15 is essentially to put the five freedoms into this legislation because for most people, they are the accepted measurement of whether one is looking after an animal properly.  These conditions include whether animals are in a suitable environment, have an appropriate diet, are allowed to exhibit normal behavioural patterns, are housed in a way that is appropriate and are protected from unnecessary pain, suffering, injury and disease.</p><p>  We are dealing with the five freedoms in far more detail in different parts of this legislation.  I can tell members the areas in which we are doing this.  The environment element is dealt with in section 11(1)(<i>b</i>).  Diet is dealt with in section 13 and behaviour is dealt with in section 11(1)(<i>a</i>)(ii).  Housing and safety from other animals is being dealt with in section 11(1)(<i>b</i>) 11(1)(<i>a</i>)(i)(II).  Being free from pain and disease is being dealt with in section 11 1(<i>a</i>)(i) and section 12.  It is not that we are not committed to the five freedoms and we need to be careful that we are not too glib about that because in a year's time, it might be a case of the six fundamentals.  At the moment, the five freedoms is the benchmark set in respect of animal welfare and I agree with that as it is a good thing.  However, amendment No. 15 does not change anything in the legislation but becomes repetitive and looks as if we are dealing with some of these issues in a way that is not as substantive as the way we are actually dealing with them.</p><p>  If one looks at amendments Nos. 25<i>a</i> and 49<i>a</i>, both of which are mine, one will see that we are trying to deal in a more substantial way with some of the issues in those five freedoms.  I am quoting all sorts of sections and it is very hard to follow if one does not have them in front of one.  For example, amendment No. 25<i>a</i> proposes to insert shelter and warmth, adequate light and ventilation and adequate exercise into section 14(3)(<i>c</i>) to deal with Deputy Ferris's wish to see light and ventilation included in the responsibility for housing an animal.  That is a good example of how we are dealing with the fourth freedom of housing, but doing so in a much more comprehensive way than just listing the five freedoms.  I can give members a detailed note before Report Stage, if they wish, to show in a very clear way how we are dealing with each of the five freedoms.  It is more comprehensive than simply listing them and then pretending that the job is done.  Within the different sections that apply, be they the cruelty, housing or code of conduct sections, we are dealing with all five items but dealing with them in the appropriate section rather than just naming them one after the other on page 13, which is what is being proposed.</p><p>  What I am proposing in amendment No. 25<i>a</i> is very similar to what Deputy Ferris is proposing in amendment No. 25<i>b</i>, and what I am proposing in amendment No. 49<i>a</i> is very similar to what Deputies Pringle and &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v are proposing in amendment No. 50.  I agree with the principles and sentiment behind what the Deputies are proposing but we are doing it in a comprehensive way.</p></speech>

The amendment seeks to include animals prior to, during and after entertainment or sporting events, and the case I would make is that the provisions should apply at all times, whether training or at an event, and whether events are sporting or not.  Later we will deal with a section on the concept of animals in a performance and we will go through issues such as dogfighting, cockfighting and animal baiting.  I am not sure what else I can say.  I do not think the amendment is necessary because it is already covered.</p></speech>

I appreciate the Minister has taken it on board.  In amendment No. 16 we suggest the word &quot;intentionally&quot; be included.  Acceptance of amendments Nos. 16 and 17 would mean section 12(1)(<i>a</i>) would read &quot;do, or fail to do intentionally, anything or cause or permit anything to be done to an animal that causes unnecessary suffering to, or endanger the health or welfare of, an animal, or&quot;.</p><p>  With regard to amendment No. 17, there could be an argument about what injury and disfigurement mean.  Is dehorning disfigurement?  T&aacute; adharca fada ar na buaibh thar lear.  However, there are no adharca ar na buaibh any more.  Presumably injury or disfigurement would cause unnecessary suffering, so it seems to be an over-elaboration and might lead to an unnecessary debate.  Surely the entire section deals with unnecessary suffering.  Somebody could argue it is disfigurement to cut the hair of a poodle rather than leaving it in its natural state.  The issue is whether it causes unnecessary suffering to the animal.</p><p>  With regard to section 12(2), I thought the transport of animals was covered elsewhere in the Bill so why is it included as a separate section?  Surely it is included in the wording of section 12(1)(<i>a</i>) as something one does.  With regard to section 12(5)(<i>b</i>), will the Minister outline the exact legal standing of the codes of practice he proposes?  In section 12(6), the Minister is in favour of reasonable grounds instead of being against them.  Amendment No. 20 proposes to delete the reference to reasonable grounds and replace it with &quot;evidence&quot;.  The argument is that &quot;reasonable grounds&quot; give huge powers to an authorised officer and may be open to abuse.  I appreciate the Minister has dealt with dependent offspring in amendment No. 22 and I will agree to this amendment.  In amendment No. 21 we propose to include the phrase &quot;or will be&quot; in section 12(8).</p></speech>

To shorten the list, we agree on amendments Nos. 22 and 23 because we are seeking the same end and I believe our wording is a little better.  I thank Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v for accepting it.</p><p>  Section 12 deals with the prohibition of animal cruelty so it and the previous section we dealt with on animal welfare are the key sections of the Bill.  With regard to amendment No. 16, we are trying to bring as much legal certainty as we can and we do not want excuses to be given such as that a person did not mean to do something.  Very few people are intentionally cruel to an animal and if they are it is an open and shut case.  Proving someone is intentionally cruel is very difficult in a court of law.</p></speech>

Section 16 of the Bill allows us to do so comprehensively.  I do not propose to accept amendment No. 16 because I believe it weakens the law.  I will accept amendment No. 17 because the issue of disfigurement is dealt with in a later section.</p><p>  Amendment No. 18 proposes the deletion of subsection 2(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>).  This section states: &quot;.....without prejudice to subsection (1) a person shall not.....&quot;.  We have retained the wording, which has been in place in animal cruelty legislation since 1911, namely, &quot;(<i>a</i>) convey or carry, or permit to be conveyed or carried, an animal in such manner or position as to cause that animal any unnecessary suffering, or (<i>b</i>) cruelly treat or beat, kick, ill-treat, over-work, over-drive, over-load, over-burden, torture, mutilate, infuriate or terrify an animal.....&quot;.  I accept that this is slightly outdated wording.  However, it is wording that remains relevant.  This section sets out the standards required in the transportation of animals, which is covered by legislation at European level, which applies in Ireland.  It is important the law is clear in regard to beating, kicking and over-working etc. of an animal, which is already provided for in legislation.  If someone can come up with better wording for this section, I will take a look at it.  I believe it is necessary to outline what is meant by animal cruelty.  This is what the Bill attempts to do.</p></speech>

There is a need to spell out in pretty blunt language exactly what is meant by cruelty.</p></speech>

In my view the word &quot;anything&quot; is undermined by the listing of specific actions, which would suggest that other types of cruelty not listed are not the same as those listed.  This in my view is overkill and undermines the word &quot;anything&quot;.  Perhaps the Minister would reflect on the matter.</p></speech>

I accept the Deputy's point in regard to listing specific actions, which creates categories in terms of actions listed and not listed.  We have rejected people's attempts to list animals in the middle of a performance or sport because this is already dealt with in the general wording of the Bill.  I will reflect on the matter rather than accept the amendment now.  I want to ensure nothing legal is being missed.  I will look at it for Report Stage.</p><p>  I was asked by the Deputy to explain legally what we are doing in the context of the codes of practice.  My understanding is that the legal position of codes of practice is that one cannot create an offence by a code.  To create a new offence one must do so by way of regulation or law.  We have many successful codes, including with farming organisations around farming and so on.  We have also introduced a new code of conduct in relation to animal welfare organisations, including dog pounds and rescue centres.  What we are proposing to do in a number of areas covered by this legislation is to work with the relevant representative bodies to work out acceptable codes and standards on how certain procedures take place, be it dehorning, disbudding and so on.  Likewise, if we want to do this in the blood sports area, we will put in place a code of conduct.  The value and strength of codes of conduct legally is that they can be taken into account in a court of law where a judge is making a judgment for or against whether a person or group of people are treating an animal cruelly.  However, they are not the determinant of the law.  That is my understanding of it.  Codes of conduct should not, for example, be seen by farmers as a threat.</p></speech>

The experience of codes of practice in this country has been somewhat limited but with the codes that have been introduced, the experience has been quite positive.  The Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council introduced animal welfare guidelines for beef farmers and a code of conduct was introduced as part of that process which is also a set of guidelines.  One can be more prescriptive in making codes of conduct mandatory or voluntary but we have options under the code of practice section that we can go through when we deal with that section.</p></speech>

Most people have insurance policies with plenty of small print that nobody ever reads.  My understanding of a code of practice is that it would not work unless it can be very simple, written in layman's language and is not too long.  It should cut to the chase.  Otherwise, people will be getting into something of which they are not aware.  There is a proviso that it is the intention of the Department to have an accessible document, written in ordinary and understandable English, which can be widely disseminated.  People must be aware of this basic stuff.</p><p>  The computer is a fantastic invention in some ways but one of the problems it has created is making everything too wordy.

The Deputy is asking me to remove "reasonable grounds" and provide for an authorised officer "who has evidence" for believing that a person is offending against the section.</p><p>  In this legislation we are trying to ensure that authorised officers can intervene before events happen, if possible.  One of the weaknesses of existing legislation in this area is that there must be evidence before action can be taken.  That means cruelty would have already occurred.  One of the fundamental changes this legislation is bringing into law is allowing us to take action early and issue a welfare notice, for example, which is a new mechanism.  Some people may see it as an on-the-spot fine but the idea is to try to keep people out of court unless they must be brought there.</p><p>  An authorised officer who has reasonable grounds for believing there is a problem should be able to take action on the back of it.  It is up to the authorised officer to subsequently show that there were reasonable grounds for this.  In other words, an authorised officer may get a call from a person whose neighbour is beating an animal at night, as can be heard from yelps and howls from the garden.  The officer could take action on the back of that if there are reasonable grounds to act, with a likelihood of cruelty occurring.  In a farming case, there may be a report that a neighbour mistreats animals or injects them with something that should not be used.  An officer would be able to take action on the back of that if there are reasonable grounds to suspect that something that should not have happened has occurred.</p><p>  If there must be evidence before such action, an officer would have to procure a warrant and put a case together.  That may be difficult without taking the action we are looking to provide for.  Later we will discuss how an authorised officer, under certain conditions, may enter a residential premises if there is reason to believe that evidence will be destroyed if immediate action is not taken.  I am sure we will have a discussion about the circumstances - which would be very restrictive - as to when that may be allowed.  This is all about trying to ensure that authorised officers can take action on the basis of reasonable grounds, as opposed to having the full onus of collecting and producing evidence before anything is done.</p><p>  This is about prevention as well as responding to acts of cruelty.  It is also about prevention of intentional spreading of disease rather than dealing with consequences afterwards.</p></speech>

If one receives a telephone call from a credible person to say somebody is injecting something into an animal which he or she should not be doing, one can act on this information.  One can ask that person to desist or stop doing what he or she is doing because one has reason to believe he or she is causing an offence.  That is the type of circumstance envisaged.  There are many others also, but that is the one that springs to mind.  We want authorised officers to be able to act quickly, rather than having to gather evidence before they can require somebody to stop doing something.  There might be a better example.</p></speech>

How can one stop so-called credible persons making all sorts of complaints because of animosity between two neighbours?  The authorised officer claims it is reasonable because Mr. and Mrs. Murphy said it was happening, but it was not happening.  In defence of having told somebody to desist with no real evidence, the authorised officer will say there were reasonable grounds to believe it was happening because he or she was told it was happening and the witness was credible.  Such things happen all the time.  The things that happen between neighbours in this country are unbelievable.</p></speech>

It is up to authorised officers to make a judgment as to whether there are reasonable grounds to take action.  Obviously, we must ensure authorised officers are properly trained to make an intelligent judgment.  If we were to decide not to include this provision because a neighbour might wish to cause a problem for another neighbour by falsely reporting something, we would simply have to allow cruelty to occur and gather evidence as we must do before taking action.  That should not be the position.  There might be exceptional cases where the complaints are groundless, but if that is the case, we should look at whether the person who reported it broke the law.  If an authorised officer has reasonable grounds to believe somebody is offending under the legislation, we wish to give him or her the power to intervene.  It is that simple.</p></speech>

If one looks at best practice in animal welfare legislation, for example, what has been done in the United Kingdom, we are trying to move from requiring proof from the investigating body before it can do anything to try to intervene early to prevent cruelty and the spread of disease.  It means taking action before things get serious or a minor welfare problem turns into a significant one.  There have been a number of cases not only of domestic cruelty but also of it happening on farms where animals were totally neglected for whatever reason and in some cases died.  There was a case in north Cork where a large number of pigs died of starvation.  I want to ensure we have the law on our side in terms of authorised officers intervening early in such cases, as opposed to taking a prosecution in an awful cruelty case after it has happened.  This legislation is about early intervention.  It is about authorised officers taking a minor action such as issuing a welfare notice.  It means saying to somebody: "What you are doing is not acceptable, but if you do X, Y or Z over the next three weeks, that will be the end of it."  That is the type of intervention we want, whereby authorised officers work with people to ensure animal welfare is improved as opposed to being obliged to wait for unfortunate and, in some cases, nasty incidents to happen and then having to mop up the mess and take a court case with the evidence available.  That is the way the law is structured and it is weak.  I do not wish to exaggerate this point, although I probably am, but it is important that authorised officers can get on with their job if they have reasonable grounds for believing something is wrong, as opposed to having to wait until they can gather evidence.</p></speech>

It comes down to ensuring the authorised officer receives the correct training and has the necessary experience.  We must be fair to the three parties involved - the complainant, the person who is the subject of the complaint and the Department.  Perhaps some guidelines should be attached to this in order that everybody will be clear.  I understand the Minister's point.  There were instances where one could see a major welfare incident was about to happen.  In one case it was due to financial circumstances.  Everybody knew it was going to happen and there was no point in leaving the animals to die and dealing with the issue afterwards.  However, we must protect people from spurious or vexatious complaints or an inspector who might have a God complex and decides he or she knows better than everybody else.  For everybody's benefit, perhaps there should be guidelines and protocols for engagement in this matter.</p></speech>

I welcome the report of the committee, and its publication is very timely and apt.  The ICT sector is a source of significant competitive advantage and one of continuing opportunity for Ireland.  We have focused on that, especially in our Action Plan for Jobs 2012, sections of which are devoted specifically to the opportunities in cloud computing, ICT generally and digital games.  We also recognise that we are seeing increasingly the convergence of technologies, with ICT becoming a major factor in opportunities emerging in other sectors such as the pharmaceutical sector and so on.  We have developed a very significant cluster in Ireland of IDA companies.</p></speech>

With the agreement of the Chairman and the committee, therefore, I propose to speak on the salient points to provide for more time for questions and answers.</p><p>  I will begin by introducing my two colleagues.  Ms Anne Forde from the higher education policy and skills section has responsibility for the ICT action plan, and Ms Breda Naughton is responsible for the national literacy and numeracy strategy and for the new framework for junior cycle reform.</p><p>  Both the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and myself have been listening to the requirements from both employers in the Irish small and medium enterprise sector as well as from the multinationals.  Representatives of multinationals are limited in what they can say because there is their own head office and sometimes they concentrate much of what they say on the education system.  I offer that as an observation; members can use it as they choose.  Listening to the employers, one would think that instant solutions could be found through the university system, but the path to third level education starts in kindergarten and in junior cycle.  That is the reason I want to address the question of reform of the education system.  </p><p>  My colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, is not present, but she would talk about the critical importance of preschool education for young people aged from three to six years of age or certainly up to six years of age.  This country got a wake-up call in the autumn of 2009 - some members were on the education committee at the time - when we dropped from fifth place to 17th place in the PISA ranking of literacy, and there was a proportionate fall in regard to science.  Everybody - including, I am happy to say, the then Minister and officials in the Department of Education and Science - said this was a problem.  The scale of the drop probably overshot the reality on the ground but nevertheless it galvanised us to respond.</p><p>  In terms of what we have done in the areas of literacy and numeracy - if we are talking about IT skills, these are the core building blocks - we have been complacent here for decades about the excellence of our education system, which we constantly asserted without reference by comparative means to other systems, although there is a long history to that.  We have changed the curriculum within the Department for primary school education in terms of the allocation of time to ensure that more time is made available for literacy and numeracy.  At the same time we have introduced and formalised a system of assessment which was already in place but is now standardised.  We benchmark, assess and measure at the end of second class, fourth class and sixth class, and from the autumn of 2014 we will be doing that at the end of second year in the junior cycle.  I will come back to that later.  </p><p>  We are putting a great deal of resources into getting continual professional development for teachers in this area.  We have announced the change - it will take time for it to occur - in the configuration of the provision of initial teacher education in Ireland.  Singapore, with a population of 5 million, has one college that deals with both primary and secondary school.  Finland, the poster child of education, has eight such colleges and Ontario in Canada has 13.  This lovely little country of ours has 19.  The international expert group which the Higher Education Authority brought into operation surveyed the situation and has recommended changing the configuration of those 19 colleges into new clusters or amalgamations of six.  In addition to that, the three-year course in education for primary school teachers will be extended to four years.  Many of the additional quasi-academic, first-start degree-type qualifications, which had little or no relevance to the teaching of primary school children, are being stripped out and the focus is exclusively on pedagogic skills.</p><p>  When somebody did an arts, science or commerce degree but always intended to go into second level education, he or she would do a H.Dip.  The H.Dip qualifications varied in quality and value because the college was only one partner in the provision of the course, the other partner being the school to which the student was assigned.  In some cases there was a looped cycle in which a student would leave school, go to college, do the H.Dip, come back to do his or her work experience during the H.Dip and, when he or she qualified, stay in that school.  The life experience of such students was therefore somewhat limited, and that is the case across the country.  That will now be a two-year cycle, as distinct from a one-year cycle, and it will be much more rigorously invigilated and examined, with the emphasis on teaching skills.</p><p>  On the reason for the emphasis on teaching skills, every piece of international evidence demonstrates, regardless of the ideological starting point, that good teachers produce great results.  Good teachers trump all other advantages or disadvantages.  Having the most IT-powered school or a pupil-teacher ratio of 1:5 is of no use if a teacher is bad.  It rests on the quality of the teachers, and in that regard we are very fortunate in this country.</p><p>  I was in Brussels yesterday, where they were moaning about the need to attract people into the teaching profession, to pay them more to stay longer in school, etc.  Currently, we have a nine-to-one application rate for primary teaching college places.  Hibernia College has a strong demand for conversion courses from people in their mid- to late 20s.  There are major structural changes in literacy and numeracy in education.  Some of them we will see quickly; it will take time for others to be embedded, but we have to start the journey.</p><p>  People have been talking about reforming the junior cycle for about ten years.</p></speech>

That is history.  I was persuaded very much by the breadth and depth of the most recent comprehensive recommendations from the National Council for Curriculum Assessment, NCCA, which were discussed in the Seanad and in the D&aacute;il, with positive contributions from the vast majority of people who spoke.  The difficulty was how to free up the curriculum, remove from it the backwash effect of the leaving certificate and the race for points, and achieve the kind of character, personality and skills formation the curriculum aspires to.  Within the Department, we were considering implementing the recommendations of the NCCA and came to the conclusion that the best way to do it would be to remove the sword of Damocles, which was the junior certificate State examination, at the end of third year.</p></speech>

I was conscious of the time in the case of both contributions but it was worthwhile listening to both Ministers, as it feeds nicely into what the joint committee is doing.  While doing so has left us short of time for questions, members can get written replies to questions if need be.  However, I appreciate that the contributions today from both Ministers were highly informative.  I will take all questions now and am conscious the Ministers must leave at 3.15 p.m.  If any questions have not been answered by then, perhaps members will be furnished with written replies to feed into their studies.  In short, the report Senator Clune has undertaken on behalf of the committee is like a rolling report that will be updated every couple of months.  In essence, the committee is engaged in continuous assessment, with which the Minister agrees in respect of education.  We will begin with Deputy Calleary, followed by Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and then Senator Clune.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-27a.189" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1071" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012112700007#J00300"><p>I thank both Ministers for the comprehensive presentations and on behalf of all members of the joint committee, I put on record their thanks to Senator Clune for the work she has undertaken.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, mentioned the word "improvements" in respect of the visa system seven or eight times but left it dangling there without giving members an idea of what they might be.  He might provide members with a suggestion in that regard or perhaps this is a subject he probably wishes to deal with in written form.  Second, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is in discussions with the Department of Justice and Equality on the subject of IT visas.  Is there a timeline or deadline for those discussions?  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, has referred to Commissioner Andor's figures that 700,000 ICT jobs would be available by 2015 and that the forecast shortage of IT practitioners by then will be up to 384,000.  Is this an issue Ireland will prioritise during its forthcoming Presidency of the European Union, given the importance of ICT professionals to both Ireland and Europe?  Perhaps shared initiatives could be conducted on a Community-wide basis and is this a matter to which the Minister has given consideration?  Finally, in the appendix to the Minister's presentation, he outlined that just over 2,000 jobs have been announced this year but I note the PayPal jobs are not included.  Is this simply a mistake?  Were they to be added, that would be 3,000 jobs.  How many of the aforementioned jobs will be filled this year?  How many will be filled from within the jurisdiction and how many must leave the jurisdiction?</p><p>  I have a couple of questions for the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn.  The benchmarking exercises at second, fourth and sixth classes are very important in respect of numeracy and literacy.  If something is picked up at second class or at fourth class level, it can be dealt with within the school.  However, what happens at sixth class?  When such a pupil leaves primary school to go to secondary school, does he or she get abandoned or is there a follow-through?  I acknowledge the Minister intends to follow through in the second year of secondary school but that will have been two years later.  Is there a risk that such students may get lost?  Second, does literacy pertain to traditional literacy, the English language, or will we be ambitious and consider IT literacy?  Will consideration be given to initiatives such as CoderDojo or the new languages our children must get into?</p><p>  As for junior cycle reform, this is the first time I have had the chance to hear the detail.  I believe the Minister needs to hit the road nationwide in this regard, as there is a complete lack of understanding.  The only discussion one will hear about junior cycle reform concerns the abolition of the examination.  Those of us who did the examination probably think those who will not be obliged to sit it will be getting away easy, but the proposals contain some interesting and exciting things.  As a general observation, this must be communicated, especially to parents, who are only hearing one version of what this looks like.  I was excited by the prospect of locally-designed short courses, which sound interesting.  The Minister indicated there was a menu of seven such courses and perhaps he could provide members with the aforementioned menu.  He also mentioned visits to industrial estates and activities that are already happening to a certain extent.  I ask that efforts be made to engage with real business practitioners as well.  I worked for a business organisation and rather than simply dealing with organisations, one must try to engage with real practitioners in the design of such courses, for them to be meaningful and not what one perhaps reads about in textbooks and so on.</p><p>  The institutes of technology and all the third level institutions appeared before the joint committee last week and the institute of technology sector is doing some phenomenal work.  In my judgment, it has been far more responsive to the events of the last four years then has any other sector in third level education.  However, to give the Minister an idea, the joint committee asked all the third level representatives how many places they were offering on courses pertaining to construction today, as opposed to in 2008, but members were unable to get an accurate figure.  While one would have assumed there had been a big drop, which had been replaced by IT, some work needs to be done in this regard.</p><p>  Finally, the Minister, Deputy Quinn, noted it has taken ten years even to get to the present position in respect of junior cycle reform and that it would be a further eight years before it is fully embedded in the system.  What changes will be made within the Department to ensure it will not be necessary to repeat this exercise and that the system can evolve to match the way in which the world changes as rapidly as is the case at present?  Can the Minister leave in place some form of system that measures and delivers change as quickly as the world is changing?</p></speech>

My first couple of questions are for the Minister, Deputy Bruton.  I applaud all the good work that is being done with regard to ICT development in this State, which obviously is one of those demand-led developments internationally.  I have a worry that when people discuss jobs in general, they often focus on the ICT sector very quickly and it is important to recognise that the proportion of the whole, that is, of all jobs in the State, made up by ICT is approximately 4.6%.  It is the second smallest sector in the State and while one must recognise the creation of a single job is a positive development, I believe one sometimes can get distracted by the shining light of ICT from the rest of the gloom with the result that one focuses in on a very small sector to the detriment of other sectors that would breathe more life into resolving the major jobs crisis we face at present.  I seek an understanding of what role the Minister expects ICT to play within the general economy.  Can he provide members with an understanding of what are his objectives for job creation in ICT in general?</p></speech>

This committee is examining the area of ICT and other skills.  Witnesses have told us of their experiences, particularly in industry, in assessing relevant skills.  We have looked at what the Higher Education Authority is offering as well as both Departments represented here.  ICT skills have been highlighted in the media and they come up repeatedly.  I commend the Government on the ICT action plan.  The response we have had from industry, both the indigenous and international sectors, has been very positive.  We look forward to the first conversion output early next year.</p><p>  The wording may not have been correct but we did not intend that somebody would get a visa to come here and look for a job.  The intention of the committee's report was for it to be job specific.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, has outlined his thinking in this area, including the fact that one job created at a higher level can create up to five jobs in the economy, be they IT graduates or from outside the IT area.  We found that the IDA seems to have a fast track if needed, but that was not the case with indigenous companies which did not seem to have that access and there was a timescale involved.</p><p>  I thank the Minister, Deputy Quinn, for his contribution.  I wish him well with the literacy and numeracy changes, particularly in project maths.  They will be very relevant as students transfer to third level. </p><p>  The committee has followed the various reports of the expert group on future skills needs.  That group has spoken to us about difficulties with languages and we have all read the headlines regarding PayPal in this respect.  The expert group on future skills recommended the establishment of a foreign language education policy across all education sectors.  I wonder how that fits with the Department of Education and Skills.  We also found that there should be continual dialogue on developing skills needs, given the overarching interaction between education and industry. </p></speech>

It is a long-term project, as the Minister pointed out but, given the sense of urgency, what are we doing about it right now?  I am conscious that a lot is being done but I want to make one plug for FIT, the fast track to IT training programme, which does not always get the credit it deserves.  Senator Clune mentioned the work of FIT in her report on ICT skills.  It is about upskilling people from a wide range of backgrounds and not just those who have a third level degree and need a conversion course.  FIT's track record speaks for itself.  I checked its website and found that the European Commission recently cited FIT as one of the most effective employability initiatives in Europe.  FIT has a strong collaboration with the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Social Protection.  If everybody else is talking about it, as we are, can we look at doing more of that if at all possible?  The elephant in the room is money but this industry-led, not-for-profit company has all the businesses represented on its board.  FIT has its finger on the pulse of what industry needs and can upskill people to create jobs for existing vacancies.  We need a lot more of that.  FIT has a strong and proven track record in this regard.  We must do as much as we can to continue the work of FIT and other such bodies.</p></speech>

Large employers get a lot of publicity when somebody goes over to the United States and brings back an employer who provides hundreds of jobs.  Small start-ups, however, do not seem to get anything like the same amount of publicity, yet there are hundreds of them.  In addition, every large business started as a small one.  Could we have a view as to whether entrepreneurship can be taught and developed?  I have spoken before about going down to Kerry and meeting Mr. Jerry Kennelly who has set up an organisation so that 600 transition year students can be taught entrepreneurship.  Mr. Kennelly taught the teachers how to develop that subject.  That is an important element for both Ministers, Deputy Bruton and Deputy Quinn.</p><p>  Senator Clune mentioned the role of modern international languages.  Some time ago, I visited Google and could not get over the amount of languages that were being spoken there.  Why are we at the very bottom of the pile in speaking another European language or an Asian language?  Is the allocation of so much time to teaching Gaeilge a hindrance to developing international languages?</p><p>  Over the weekend, I was at the University of Sterling in Scotland and was impressed watching 800 graduates there and the variety of their degrees.  I met the professor of aquaculture there.  They are doing that subject because they can see the opportunities in developing the seafood industry.  They seem to be responding to the market very well.  I was interested to hear the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, refer to Scotland as one of those countries to be admired.</p><p>  For a long time, we all believed that jobs would come from services and not from manufacturing, which would go to low-cost areas such as China and Eastern Europe.  Is there a possibility that we took the wrong decision there?  Very few countries have succeeded unless they are developing a manufacturing business, rather than concentrating entirely on services.</p></speech>

When government invested in skills in the past, it got a lifetime of use out of that skill set.  However, it has all changed and the pendulum has swung in the other direction.  To determine the provision of skills in five years' time is almost a guessing game, such is the fickle nature of this area.</p><p>  We should pay more attention to generic skills as a base skill set for a constantly changing economic landscape and the skills demands this makes.  Personal creativity is one of these generic skill sets.  One cannot teach creativity but people can discover it.  The best place for self-discovery is in the classroom.  In this country, we pay far too little attention to creativity.  We completely neglect the subjects whose source and heart is creativity.  One third of the primary school curriculum is supposed to be about creativity, such as dance, drama, mime, etc, yet we have the most haphazard arrangement for imparting these to young people.  The Minister took the straitjacket off the second level sector and allowed for the flexibility to have new learning experiences and formats.  However, I was disappointed there was little mention of the arts.  The only way self-discovery can happen is through the arts.  Creativity and generic skills should work more closely together.  What are the Minister's thoughts on this?</p></speech>

While English is the most spoken language in the world, students in Europe learn two languages, their national language and English.  We all know we are appalling at having a second language.  For all the time spent learning Irish in schools, very few second level graduates can speak it.  While I accept it is a political issue, has the Minister for Education and Skills addressed this?</p><p>  Graduate conversion courses provide an excellent opportunity for the filling of ICT, information and communication technology, vacancies.  We note that applications were well in excess of the 768 places available.  Has the Minister considered how he could give more opportunities to avail of this course?  Has he any initiative to boost the available places in response to this demand, while mindful of the need to maintain quality in the programmes?</p><p>  The national target is to double the number of ICT graduates to 2,000 per annum.  What is the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation's contribution to meet this target?</p></speech>

We need joined-up thinking on this between his Department and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation whose Minister chairs the unemployment forum for the south east.  If the region gets a technological university, it has to be about job creation.  That comes back to Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's earlier question to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  What type of and how many jobs are we looking to create in this area?  How can policy be joined up between the two Departments?  How can we deal with the concentration of tech jobs in Dublin, Cork and Galway and ensure they are spread more evenly between the regions?</p><p>  Last week we had several presentations from the third and fourth level education sectors.  They made observations on the all-Ireland nature of this area.  First, there is not a level playing field for A-level students from the North.  The maximum number of points they can get through their A-levels is 450 which is prohibits them availing of courses in the South.  In the North, ICT skills are a module at GCSE, general certificate of secondary education, level.  We would need a similar module at second level, if not at primary level, in this State.</p><p>  How do the long-term unemployed fit into this?  Structural unemployment has been seen by the Government as a priority issue.  We have many unemployed aged between 30 and 50 years who came out of construction or manufacturing.  Where do they sit in this policy of creating new jobs and opportunities?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-27a.198" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012112700009#L00400"><p>With regard to Deputy Calleary's question on visas, we will be looking at the number of rules that are involved and the time durations of labour market needs tests.  We have simplified procedures and should be able to reduce significantly the time and complexity involved in granting visas.  We have legislation coming through in this regard.</p><p>  We will use the Presidency to highlight the opportunities in this sector and have scheduled it into our programme.  It is difficult to give an exact figure for the number of jobs that will be filled in this sector by domestic and foreign workers.  Currently, 15% of those employed in the technology area are non-Irish and little over half of that figure are non-EU nationals.  Obviously, a higher proportion of new vacancies are being filled by non-Irish nationals than the existing threshold but we do not have an exact figure.  With 1,200 non-EU nationals coming into this sector, one could make a stab at the percentage.  We do not have an accurate number for the churn either, however.</p><p>  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n asked for the targets for this sector.  For internationally traded services, we have a target of 30,000 additional net jobs.  This would include financial services.  I will check to see if there is a disaggregated target for ICT.  I do not believe there is a specific figure which has been published but it would be regarded as a significant sectoral opportunity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-27a.200" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1035" speakername="Ruairi Quinn" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012112700010#M00200"><p>I will try to be succinct and to the point.  If there are any gaps, members should feel free to come back to us on them.</p><p>  There will be something called an education passport at the end of sixth class and one will apply to go to a second-level school.  When one is accepted, and only then, the school can ask to see one's grades and where one was.  The education passport will inform the parents.  The principal of the post-primary school will be able automatically to get it from the principal of the relevant primary school - data protection provisions will not apply.  That will enable a teacher of geography to know, for example, that Ruair&iacute; Quinn has a literacy or numeracy problem, etc., and it will not take until Easter to work out, through the 30 children in the class, who are the strong ones and who are the weak ones.  In fact, it is the group in the middle, the under-the-radar group, who get by because they do not stick out.  The weak ones and the bright ones do.  The purpose of this approach is to make the transfer seamless.</p><p>  On computer literacy, the children need to teach us computer literacy rather than the other way round.  Where would one start?  I saw it at a family gathering in August where an 18-month old grand-niece picked up an electronic device and was swiping the front of it and shaking it to see if it would work.  That is a big debate, much longer than time permits here.  The children are coming in computer literate and the format is converging into an iPhone-Galaxy type format with everything else in it.</p><p>  On a road show for the junior cycle we sent a document to all of the members some time ago.  We all get so much to read, it is not possible to attend to it all.  It is an interesting observation, given the reaction to it.  There are short courses prepared by the NCCA that are available, and then we will be working with communities that want to develop a short course.</p><p>  The number of construction places has dropped by approximately 50% within the institutes of technology sector since 2008.  On the future evolution post the NCCA, I do not think there will be the stasis that there was for ten years when conservative forces within the education system merely put a block on reform.  What will now have to happen, and will happen quickly, is a questioning of what happens to the transition year.  We hope to get many of the attributes in those three years and transition year is something that we must consider in the next year or so.</p><p>  There is nothing wrong with the leaving certificate curriculum according to professional educators.  The difficulty is the impact of the points system, which is the function of the CAO.  There are 14 points in the spectrum and one is never further away than 2.5% from one grade or another, and it is too rigid.  We can change that, reducing it to approximately seven.  Also, there has been the predictability in the questions that come up.  If one wants to look at that in some detail, there is a website with a paper by Professor &Aacute;ine Hyland, at <i>transition.ie</i>, in which she describes the way in which the admissions policy has distorted student behaviour resulting in a backlash on the leaving certificate, and, in turn, the junior certificate.</p><p>  On the two questions Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n raised, we want to get the clustering of local enterprise offices close to the campuses, particularly those of the institutes of technology.  A mission of the institutes of technology was to be as close to industry as is possible, to help that to develop, and to upskill the entire enterprise culture in the area and also provide education and training for their graduates.  There has been some drift among some of them in recent years and they are now refocusing.  The Hunt report recommends the maintenance of that strong dedicated technological sector which is what the institutes of technology are about.</p><p>  All-island utilisation of third-level infrastructure makes common sense - Dundalk to Newry, Letterkenny to Derry, the New University of Ulster and Sligo - because of the configuration of the Border.  It makes sense geographically to have east-west and North-South collaboration and we are exploring that.</p><p>  On the question of foreign languages raised by a number of members, there are nine applicants for every teacher training place in primary school education colleges, most of whom come from within the top 15% of leaving certificate students.  It is a cohort that most other systems in the European Union would die for.  Most of those applicants will have a language qualification.  Of the total of 54,000 who sit the leaving certificate, approximately 30,000 would have a modern language - predominantly French, then German and then Spanish.  It would be my intention down the road that we would get those primary school teachers who would have taken a modern language in larger schools because this is another issue, to be able to teach a foreign language if that is what is wanted.</p><p>  The foreign languages initiative was not considered successful.  There was much noise around the system when I decided to take it out and to reallocate the funding within the Department for the improvements in primary school education.  The NCCA did not recommend that this pilot scheme be made mainstream but it is something to which we must return.</p><p>  The space displacement and the merits-demerits of Gaeilge and learning a second language is a big topic for discussion.  The Secretary General made a major speech last week in Galway.  He is a Gaelgeoir with a masters degree in Irish from Trinity College and is well equipped to discuss the matter.  It is something on which there is no position in the programme for Government.  We must look at the issue.</p><p>  As an instrument for commerce, what PayPal has not stated to many publicly is that it was looking for native speakers in Dundalk, that Dundalk Institute of Technology went to PayPal asking was there any way it could help, and PayPal replied that there was not.</p> <p>If one is speaking Latvian on a helpline with somebody in Riga, one does not need to be struggling with a Dublin accent.  The person on the other end needs to understand the conversation clearly and properly.</p><p> There is a certain misunderstanding in regard to languages.  Companies such as Google will recruit native speakers out of choice to provide that kind of service.  I think we need a larger cohort of people studying languages but the focus has to be on ability to speak rather than a grammatical obsession with the modh coinn&iacute;ollach.  The census revealed that 12% of the Irish population are foreigners, many of whom are first generation.  Last Friday I took a group of people from the Chinese embassy on a tour of Leinster House.  The five translators on whom we relied were their children, who were attending school in Ireland.  It was wonderful to see them conversing comfortably with their parents and older members of the group.</p><p> I am not sure entrepreneurial skills can be taught in the same way as, for example, history.  It is a question of teaching by demonstration.  It is certainly one of the attributes we will set out in the 24 skills we are seeking to encourage but entrepreneurship takes many forms and manifestations.  Can one, for example, teach swimming from a book without getting wet?  Can one learn to ride a bicycle from a book?  I do not think one can.  If one equates books and teaching, certain attributes like cycling, swimming or entrepreneurship are more on the experiential side.  The task is to replicate the experience, which is why forming companies and banks during transition year is the way to proceed.  It is a different kind of learned experience to the traditional subjects like trigonometry and algebra.</p><p> On FIT, we have increased expenditure with F&Aacute;S from just under &euro;500,000 in 2006 to almost &euro;950,000 in 2012.  The programme has proven very successful, although we want to do more between my Department and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to address the immediate needs of industry.  Senator Cullinane spoke about the focus on the unemployed.  The target group for these programmes are the long-term unemployed, with 60% of participants coming from this cohort and 70% being aged between 25 and 49 years.</p><p> Manufacturing never left Germany but we are speaking about a very sophisticated form of manufacturing.  This morning I attended a breakfast briefing with a company which came to Cork as an IT manufacturing company.  Over time it transferred much of its fabrication out of the Cork area because the branch has expanded into the area of software.  However, the fabricating skill was retained in the company or had returned to it because of the sophisticated nature of its operations.</p><p> I agree entirely with Deputy Conaghan in regard to being creative.  He made similar arguments on a number of occasions and I know he is passionate about the subject.  Creativity is one of the set of skills we have identified in the curriculum breakdown of the NCCA.  The final comment I will make about the link between enterprise and education is that the children who started school this September will in 12 years' time be studying subjects that have not been identified and acquiring skills that do not yet exist for jobs that have not yet been thought of and problems that have not yet arisen.  I was asked many years ago to explain the difference between a technologist and a technician.  The difference is that a technician knows exactly how well to perform a particular task but the technologist knows why the task is to be performed.  We have to equip young people with the skills they need to analyse and solve problems.  That does not mean we should not offer short-term conversion courses but that should be the focus of the formal education system.</p></speech>

The purpose of the meeting is to consider a Supplementary Estimate for Vote 32 - Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  I invite the Minister to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-27a.210" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2012112700002#A00400"><p>I thank the Chairman and select committee for giving me the opportunity to present this Supplementary Estimate.  I am seeking members' approval to make provision for additional capital funding for the following: &euro;10 million for the Industrial Development Agency, IDA, under subhead 5A; &euro;3 million for the INTERREG enterprise development programme under subhead A10; &euro;738,000 for the Tyndall National Institute under subhead B4; and &euro;5 million for the programme for research in third level institutions, PRTLI, under subhead B6.  These amounts are being provided from an underspend that has arisen within the Exchequer allocation for Enterprise Ireland under subheads B4 and A7 of my Department's Vote.  The underspend has arisen because of reduced demand from companies for research and development grants and capital, employment and training grants and owing to timing issues in the payments to technology centres and drawdowns under the innovation fund Ireland's seed and venture capital fund.</p><p>  Approval to reallocate funding is being sought on the understanding that the amounts to which I have referred will be expended by the agencies in question before the end of the year.  With the exception of an Exchequer allocation of &euro;1 million under subhead 5, IDA Ireland's property function is self-financing.  However, due to the collapse of the property market, IDA Ireland is finding it increasingly difficult to generate income to meet obligations arising under its property programme.  Moneys generated from property sales in recent years have decreased substantially.  The funds which IDA Ireland has on hand to meet its obligations under its property programme have fallen from &euro;63 million at the start of 2009 to slightly more than &euro;8 million as we approach the end of 2012.  In addition to meeting the day-to-day costs of running its business parks, IDA Ireland has a number of other property related contractual obligations.  To ease the financial pressures on the agency, I am proposing to provide it with a further &euro;10 million in 2012 in respect of subhead 5.  Payment of mature liabilities before the end of the year will ease the financial pressures on the agency and enable it to meet contractual obligations that will arise in 2013 in respect of its property portfolio. </p><p>  I am pleased with the progress IDA Ireland is making in delivering its Horizon 2020 strategy, which sets out the agency's job creation targets over the period from 2010 to 2014.  This year was the best year in almost a decade in terms of the number of projects won and their job content.  We must do everything possible to ensure the strong flows of jobs and investments continue.  It is my intention that the proposals we are discussing, when implemented, will enable the agency to manage its resources, Exchequer and non-Exchequer, to optimum effect and successfully implement its Horizon 2020 strategy. </p><p>  On the proposal to allocate a supplementary amount of &euro;3 million to INTERREG, the 2012 allocation for INTERREG enterprise development under subhead A10 is &euro;3 million.  The INTERREG programme for the period from 2009 to 2014 funds cross-Border initiatives under several themes.  My Department is responsible, with its counterpart Department in Northern Ireland, for funding the enterprise theme.  I am proposing to provide an additional &euro;3 million to INTERREG to enable it to meet commitments that will arise in respect of a wide range of projects such as the construction of a technology enterprise centre in Carrick-on-Shannon, County Leitrim, to provide support to a range of innovate, high growth, technology based businesses in the region, and a managing training initiative aimed at improving the management capabilities of manufacturing and traded service sector companies in all the Border counties, North and South, through the development of leadership and management competencies.  </p><p>  From the inception of the INTERREG programme until this year, good projects were late coming forward for approval from the relevant European Union managing authority.  This meant the Departments rendered unspent funds back to the Exchequer for several years.  However, the programme is now getting into its stride and a wide range of projects was approved over the course of 2012 and these projects are under way.  All approved projects have gone through a rigorous vetting process and payments are made in stages.  By securing and paying an additional &euro;3 million for these projects at this point, we are proactively funding existing commitments and liabilities and avoiding a build-up of payments falling due in early 2013, thereby easing pressure on my Department's future capital budgets.  I have no doubt the Chairman and his colleagues will agree with me that INTERREG cross-Border projects should have a high priority for political reasons and that funding should be provided accordingly. </p><p>  The 2012 allocation for the Tyndall National Institute under subhead B4 is &euro;3 million.  </p></speech>

The projects he mentioned are very worthy and strong.  I am concerned it is coming from an EI underspend in the grant to industry.  The Minister glossed over that a little.  Will he give an idea of how much we will take from the EI spend?  When was the underspend in this subhead anticipated?  I cannot imagine EI giving money particularly as it has had really good programmes such as the women in enterprise programme which is completely over subscribed and will not have enough funding.  Will an additional allocation be made to EI for this next year?</p><p>  The Minister mentioned property related contractual obligations and the day-to-day costs of running business parks.  Will he go into a little more detail on this?  Given where we are now with regard to property has the IDA renegotiated its property related contractual obligations downwards in line with the markets?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-27a.213" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1080" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2012112700003#B00300"><p>My questions are similar to a certain extent.  We saw the figure of six additional Enterprise Ireland jobs developed last year.  While great work is ongoing, indigenous businesses often tell as they have difficulty drawing down grants.  In addition, sometimes after grants have been drawn down, so many steps are put in front of them they are better off not drawing down the grants and trying to complete projects themselves.  It is difficult to access.  It seems very odd that Enterprise Ireland, which focuses on the indigenous sector, which has crashed compared to the FDI sector, would have for the second year a transfer of its budget from it.  IDA property seems to be the source of a large chunk of the redistributed funds.  It would be interesting for the committee to find out exactly what these property costs were.  If money is being assigned to deal with a property portfolio we could get details on these property portfolios and the elements of costs requiring these annual transfers.  There is an opportunity cost to these transfers because they remove money from Enterprise Ireland and potential indigenous businesses and put it into property which at present is not an enterprise opportunity for the State.</p><p>  I have much experience with INTERREG and it does excellent work with regard to the PRTLI and the Tyndall National Institute.  I would be interested to see what its key performance indicators will be.  When we speak about foreign direct investment, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland we often ask the cost per job.  It would be useful for us to start analysing the outputs of the PRTLI and the Tyndall National Institute with regard to whether a cost per job key performance indicator exists or what key performance indicators are used.  It would help us measure comparatively the benefit of expenditure in these sectors as opposed to others.</p><p>  On page 32 of a document I have there is a section on jobs, enterprise and innovation which mentions an original Estimate and Revised Estimate for 2012.  The science, technology and development programme is reduced by &euro;5.738 million.  However, the totals for the original Estimate and the Revised Estimate do not show a difference of &euro;5 million.  The difference is &euro;738,000.  I do not know whether this is an anomaly or a print error but I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to it.</p></speech>

I refer to the &euro;5 million provided for research in third level institutions.  The Minister mentioned supporting universities.  He should provide members with a more detailed breakdown outlining where precisely the money is going.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-27a.222" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="16:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2012112700004#C00400"><p>As I indicated, the underspend was across a number of headings.  One such heading was the innovation funds, which have been slower to be drawn down.  Some of this arose from the delay after they were put out to tender, as some participants were slower to close off their funds.  It is a process in which they must raise matching funds.  Enterprise Ireland creates a draw-down profile on the expectation of a certain profile or speed with which they will ramp up.  However, they did not meet that pattern and, as a result, this was a significant area of shortfall.  Moreover, the Deputy correctly asked whether this was anticipated.  I refer to the manner in which Enterprise Ireland must put together its budgets.  It must make provision for all the approvals it has made in the past that are planned to mature.  As a result, the planned payouts in 2012 comprise approved projects from 2008, 2009 and 2010.  It is a mixture of fractions of approvals and as the Deputy can imagine, the approvals for 2007 and 2008 fell sharply.  This has been partially due to it being slower in the recession wherein people who had historic approvals actually postponed them and did not go ahead with them.  Many such projects require matching funds whereby a company with an approval for a certain amount of money must provide the matching amount and such a company may have postponed it for those reasons.  I note it has returned to a more normal spread and the sort of roller-coaster effect in the approval rates now has left the system.  This is in part a residue and in part people resiling from commitments they had planned.  However, even had one anticipated this development, as they legally were due to fall for payment, this was the reason there had to be provision.  It went across the entire range of programmes and was not simply related to research and development, as it also affected employment grants that had been committed, as well as capital and training grants.</p><p>  Another influencing factor was that back in 2010, ceilings began to be put on the advance commitments that could be made as part of a budgeting process and this also appears to have had an impact.  It is quite a complex matter but effectively, Enterprise Ireland is making a forecast of the draw-down of an historic stream of approvals and obviously, there is a series of factors that has led to the underspend.</p></speech>

While I appreciate all the draw-downs and whatever, I refer to all the other funds that probably could do with that money this year and the number of people who have been turned down because of the lack of capital within Enterprise Ireland.  While Enterprise Ireland is a superb organisation, it is always telling members that, like any organisation, it could do with greater resources.  However, it is one organisation that actually can do something with it and it just appears to be a large amount of money to be coming in during November and December.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-27a.226" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="16:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2012112700004#C00800"><p>Enterprise Ireland makes a projection of what will be the level of activity in this year.  It is a combination of the approvals it made in 2012 with those made historically.  Consequently, it is not all about making approvals, as it built into that figure a certain number of approvals made in 2012 that will mature in 2012 but much of the budget pertains to the previous years.  Consequently, one cannot suddenly ramp up programmes across the board on the basis of underspending but these particular allocations I seek today are maturing commitments.  They are ongoing programmes that can be met today in order that the Department has the scope in next year's budget to meet commitments.  I believe the best way to utilise the underspend is to put it into things one knows will mature.  If such commitments can be met now, it leaves the Department with greater spending capacity next year.  Interestingly, even though this level of underspend has taken place, Enterprise Ireland is set to deliver on the target for the number of job projects it would approve this year.  Moreover, its export sales are on target.  As of today, the companies Enterprise Ireland expected to support and the flow of projects it hoped to get across the line are meeting the targets it set for itself and metrics are available to show this.  Obviously, however, it is a disappointment that the innovation fund has not been taken up as quickly as would have been hoped.  One company did not fulfil to the extent that was expected and it will be necessary to have a replacement.</p><p>  As for the other issues raised, Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n raised the question of whether the draw-down of grants was cumbersome.  They certainly are not intended to be and if the Deputy wishes to send case studies to the Department, I certainly will have them assessed.  One hears how some people will rave about an organisation while others will state they have nothing but heartache when they deal with that organisation.  However, I would be happy to investigate any case in this regard.  In my experience, I find Enterprise Ireland to be particularly supportive and that it goes as far as it can with companies.  Obviously, it is dealing with State money and must be sure that proposals are commercially robust.  As for any cases that Deputies have brought to my attention, I must state the decisions being taken by Enterprise Ireland, if they were being questioned, were robust.  However, one certainly wishes to avoid having sand in the wheels of any of these schemes.</p></speech>

While the company was going to the next level of that programme, it found it far too cumbersome to engage with Enterprise Ireland in the delivery thereof and sourced it itself, albeit in a much scaled-down version, because obviously the company lacked the funds to provide for a full-scale on-site consultant itself.  While this was the experience of that company, from my perspective it would not be unusual.  I make the point that this is happening at the same time as the reduction of funds for Enterprise Ireland.</p></speech>

The other question was on property costs involved.  Essentially, the IDA is the property manager for all the enterprise agencies and there are contractual obligations.  Obviously, it manages property and at times, albeit much less frequently, acquires property.  It is obliged to honour some contracts but because they involve individual companies I cannot go into the details.  However, it sometimes makes decisions that involve making commitments.  I understand that I am not at liberty to talk about individual companies and contracts that might have been entered into.  Essentially, however, it is dealing with its own clients, planning its advance property, as well as planning land and building acquisition.  Obviously, it has a number of business parks.  It is part of Ireland's competitive offering to have an active property portfolio in this area.</p></speech>

The IDA is in the same bind when it comes to upward-only rent reviews.  It is caught with the rents it has so whether or not it has vacant property, which inevitably occurs, it is stuck with rents until the review date.  Many of them are upward-only rent reviews.  It is in the same category.</p><p>  I do not have the KPIs here.  Science Foundation Ireland has just produced its eight-year strategy up to 2020.  Obviously, one has things like licences, patents, publications in meritorious journals and the number of people placed from the centre in industry - it currently has approximately 30% and obviously SFI is seeking increase that.  Another metric is the extent to which it gets co-funding either from FP7 or from industry.  There is a separate one for industry and for other State funding.  The intention is to force it down the commercialisation route.  Spin-outs is another criteria.  There are eight or ten different ones and Science Foundation Ireland has set itself a metric of increasing those from the base position by a certain percentage.  In regard to placement in industry, it is from 30% to 50%.  It is seeking to double the number of spin-outs over a very long period of time.  I can get the Deputy the metrics for the Tyndall Institute.  Those sorts of metrics apply in all of them.</p><p>  In regard to the individual PRTLI referred to by Deputy Lawlor-----</p></speech>

Beidh r&oacute;l f&iacute;or-l&aacute;rnach ag an &uacute;dar&aacute;s maidir leis na pleananna teanga san Acht sin.  D&eacute;anann an Acht sin daingni&uacute; ar chuid de na pr&iacute;omhmholta&iacute; a bh&iacute; sa strait&eacute;is 20 bliain.  Iarradh orm freisin an bhfuil f&eacute;idearthachta&iacute; eile maoinithe at&aacute; n&iacute;os &eacute;ifeachta&iacute; agus n&iacute;os &eacute;ifeacht&uacute;la.

B&iacute;onn f&eacute;idearthachta&iacute; eile ann le hairgead a thabhairt isteach do ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; taighde agus fi&uacute; do ruda&iacute; praitici&uacute;la ar leibh&eacute;al na Gaeltachta.  Is f&eacute;idir iad a chruth&uacute;.</p><p>  Luaigh an Teachta Kitt The Gathering.  Sa phost at&aacute; agam faoi l&aacute;thair - t&aacute; m&eacute; mar sti&uacute;rth&oacute;ir ar ionad na dteangacha i Maigh Nuad - t&aacute; scr&uacute;daithe curtha le ch&eacute;ile againn don Ghaeilge.  T&aacute; ocht n-ionad againn ar fud na h&Eacute;ireann.  T&aacute; ionad againn in ollscoil i bPr&aacute;g na Seice.  T&aacute; ionad againn i Nua Eabhrac.  T&aacute; ionad in Ottawa.  T&aacute; ionad againn i dToronto.  B&iacute;onn muid ag pl&eacute; le diasp&oacute;ra na h&Eacute;ireann ar bhonn rialta.  S&iacute;lim gur f&eacute;idir cuid mh&oacute;r a dh&eacute;anamh leis an gcaidreamh sin a choth&uacute;.  B'fh&eacute;idir go gcuirfidh The Gathering t&uacute;s le sin.  B'fh&eacute;idir nach bhfuilimid ag d&eacute;anamh go leor sa Ghaeltacht ar bhonn foirmi&uacute;il leis an gcaidreamh sin a choth&uacute;.</p><p>  Mar shampla, tharla s&eacute; go raibh m&eacute; i bP&aacute;ras D&eacute; hAoine seo caite ag bronnadh teastais ar 45 duine at&aacute; ag foghlaim na Gaeilge san ionad at&aacute; againn ansin.  Is Francaigh thart ar 70% d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d at&aacute; ag tabhairt faoi na c&uacute;rsa&iacute; sin.  Is &Eacute;ireannaigh at&aacute; p&oacute;sta sa Fhrainc, srl., an chuid eile acu.  S&iacute;leann daoine i gc&oacute;na&iacute; nach bhfuil suim ach amh&aacute;in sa Bh&eacute;arla ag na heachtrannaigh at&aacute; ag iarraidh teanga a fhoghlaim anseo, ach n&iacute;l s&eacute; sin f&iacute;or.  T&aacute; suim ag daoine sa Ghaeilge agus i gcult&uacute;r na Gaeilge.  Teasta&iacute;onn uathu teacht go dt&iacute; &aacute;it ina bhfuil cult&uacute;r difri&uacute;il i gceist.  T&aacute; t&iacute;ortha an domhain ag &eacute;ir&iacute; n&iacute;os cos&uacute;il lena ch&eacute;ile; d&aacute; bhr&iacute; sin, t&aacute; daoine ag iarraidh ruda&iacute; at&aacute; difri&uacute;il.

First, the board is representative in terms of the skills it will need for the future, for example, when addressing the issues of strategy and policy that will arise.

However, I wish her the best of luck in the massive task she faces.  She has mentioned the reports suggesting we might have just 15 years to deal with this issue.  I believe that to be true.  I do not come from a Gaeltacht area and have massive difficulty in learning a language if I am not immersed in it.  I got a "D" in pass Irish in my leaving certificate examination.  I find it very difficult to learn a language by any means other than being immersed in it.  Every person in my leaving certificate class found it equally as difficult.  That is why Ms N&iacute; Ghallch&oacute;ir and other "seed savers" have such an important job.  They have the seed which they need to help to grow.  I need to go to places like the Gaeltacht to learn Irish.  The same applies to my children.  That is why it is so essential that people like Ms N&iacute; Ghallch&oacute;ir are successful.  Some of the people here and many of the people with whom I went to school would have learned Irish if they had gone to school drunk because they had that type of brain, but that does not apply to most people who are like me.  That is why it is so essential for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and the other organisations to survive.</p><p>  When I was growing up, brown bread was left for the poor people because it was unfashionable to eat it.  Rich people ate white bread until there was news that eating brown bread was better.  Now rich people are eating brown bread, while many poor people have to eat white bread.  The same applies in the case of the Irish language.  There was a time when it was spoken mainly by poorer people.  I am not trying to create a class divide, but that is my experience.  When I was in school, all of the rich children went to the Gaeltacht.  Perhaps they did not think they were rich, but to me, my family and neighbours they looked to be rich.  Many of them probably had the ability to learn it and they came back with a level of Irish that none of us could ever attain.  I wonder what Ms N&iacute; Ghallch&oacute;ir thinks can be done to make sure everyone can potentially go to the Gaeltacht.  For many, that is the only way the language can be learned.</p></speech>

I am telling the truth.  I got a "D" in pass Irish after studying it for 13 years.  Should we go down the Linguaphone route to get kids to learn Irish?  What are her suggestions, as I would hate to see the language disappear?  The world is becoming more and more homogenised.  I have said on numerous occasions at this forum and in the D&aacute;il that homogenisation is for milk, not people.  What can Ms N&iacute; Ghallch&oacute;ir do to make sure everyone on the planet will not end up exactly the same?  If some of us are able to speak Irish, we will be a little different.</p></speech>

I will come back to it.  </p><p>  If I may say so, as a teacher, Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan is being very hard on himself.  I am not sure there is anybody who is incapable of learning a second language.  There is nothing in any research to suggest that is the case.  Research shows that motivation is key in learning.  If one is determined to learn, really has to learn or wants to learn, one will do so.  I have mentioned that the languages centre in Maynooth organises a suite of Irish language examinations.  One of our best students this year was a Dutch lady living in England who had spent no more than a fortnight in Ireland but learned Irish to a very high level.  There is no doubt, therefore, that motivation is key.</p><p>  Deputy Flanagan asked about the role of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in this regard.  We are always aware that we have to give those who want to come back to Irish an opportunity to do so.  I see this time and again in my job because we deal with many adult learners.  We have to ensure the teaching of Irish is professionalised.  That is a mantra I use when speaking about this issue.  It is sometimes the case that those who teach Irish to adults are not qualified teachers.  People need to be trained in that sector for this type of teaching and support must be provided for them.  That is something we do at a relatively small level, for a number of reasons, in my current job.  We offer a diploma in the teaching of Irish to adults, the only one of its kind in the country.  There are 15 students scattered throughout the country taking the course which is sponsored by Foras na Gaeilge.  The idea is that we will train them to train others.  There are many excellent examples of good practice among teachers of adults.  In some other cases, the teachers are very passionate about the language, but sometimes passion is not enough.  One needs to be professional and receive proper training.  I agree with the Deputy that many people have learned Irish badly or have had a very negative experience of learning the language.  I assure him that many have returned to it and succeeded in learning it.</p><p>  Deputy Sandra McLellan asked about my background in linguistics and sociolinguistics.  Not too long ago somebody at work accused me of being an entrepreneur.  When I took up my current job 18 and a half years ago, I inherited a very small department with three full-time and ten part-time staff.  My department currently has seven full-time and over 30 part-time staff.  The exact figures tend to fluctuate.  Some 80% of my budget comes from outside the university.  I saw that there was an opening for the examinations we have introduced at eight centres in Ireland.  The Irish College in Paris had just opened as the Centre Culturel Irlandais and I noted that there was an opening for people to study Irish at the centre.  Likewise, we made tests available when people were starting to study Irish at New York University.  My philosophy has always been to do something about it when I see a gap in language provision.  While I would not like to overstate it, I am a bit of an entrepreneur also.  I am certainly used to looking for money.</p></speech>

She may have taken me up wrongly.  I am proud of the way I learn, but I learn in a particular way, as many do.  Evidence of this is the fact that after 13 years, 99% of the pupils in my class did not know how to have a conversation in Irish.  It was not that we collectively decided to be stubborn and that we would not try.  We tried just as hard as pupils in the other class, which was classified, apparently, as the smarter one.  I would not believe this because many in the not-so-smart class did better than those in the smarter class when they got out into the real world where practice was more important than books.</p></speech>

This has to be taken up as a serious issue.  The impediment is that the vast majority of those who teach learn easily from books without immersion.  This needs to be taken into account if Ms N&iacute; Ghallch&oacute;ir wants the Irish language to survive.  Otherwise we will put a massive amount of resources for 13 years into teaching pupils, including my kids.  At the age of ten years, my oldest daughter, in spite of the fact that I try to be positive about learning Irish, hates the language because of the way it is taught to her, and she is not in a house in which people are negative about learning Irish.  If Ms N&iacute; Ghallch&oacute;ir is serious about ensuring the future of the language, I ask her to take this into account.  We do not all learn from books.  Many - I suggest the majority - learn everything in life from practice, not from a book.  If the Irish language is to survive, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta must succeed in what it is doing and keep alive the place where people like me can go and learn the language.  Otherwise it is finished.</p></speech>

I draw to his attention the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person, persons or an entity either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also wish to advise Mr. McGuinness that his opening statement and any other document submitted by him to the committee will be published on its website after the meeting.  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

In this regard, it might be helpful to say a few words about the background to the setting up of the commission, its status and structure, the composition of the current board and existing and ongoing goals and to list briefly some of the commission's achievements since its establishment.</p><p>  The Western Development Commission was set up following intense public pressure and concern about serious economic and social decline in western counties during the 1980s and early 1990s.  It is a statutory body established under the Western Development Commission Act 1998 and mandated to promote the economic and social development of the seven counties of the western region, namely, Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon, Mayo, Galway and Clare.  It currently has ten members whose names are listed in the pack provided.  It is serviced by an executive staff of 12 operating out of offices in Ballaghaderreen, County Roscommon and functions under the auspices of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p><p>  The strategic goals of the organisation are to contribute to balanced regional development by ensuring the western region maximises its full potential for economic and social development; to promote the benefits of living, working and doing business in the western region; to support the sustainable economic and social development of the rural economy; and to provide risk capital for SMEs and social enterprises.  Some of the more notable examples of work done to date by the commission are listed in the appendices under appropriate headings.  Also included in the presentation pack are copies of recent reports and presentations.</p><p>  To give an overview of the current position, the region has made significant economic and social progress since the establishment of the commission.  That is not to say the commission is responsible for this progress; however, much of it was built on the growth of sectors now severely hit by the economic downturn, for example, the construction industry, the retail sector, other locally traded services and the public sector.  The employment and population gains of the past decade and the potential to build on what has been achieved will be undermined unless there is a continued strategic focus on the region.  In recent times substantial infrastructural improvements have been made, for example, the M6 to Galway, the strengthening of the electricity grid, greater access to broadband in rural areas, although much work remains to be done, and the first phase of the western rail corridor.  However, a great deal more needs to be done if enterprises in the western region are to operate on a level playing field with enterprises in other regions and if the region is to be attractive to investors and highly skilled workers.  This is the key to the region realising its full potential to achieve growth and job creation.  In this, the commission has strived to identify the western region not only as a key resource for Ireland but also a critical asset as a bountiful region on the periphery of Europe, with untapped resources unique to the location and landscape in areas such as renewable energy, tourism and the creative economy.</p><p>  The west still requires targeted support to maximise its employment potential and contribution to the national economy.  If the potential of lagging regions is not harnessed for the benefit of the national economy, there will be a waste of talent and opportunities and it will reduce overall national economic performance.  Regional development is not a zero sum game; growth in one region does not have to be at the expense of another.  Improvements in physical infrastructure generate productivity gains for local businesses and increase the attractiveness of an area for investment and tourism.  Access to quality road, rail and international air services, broadband and energy resources plays a crucial part in positioning the west within a modern global economy.  In a higher value, more knowledge based economy the efficient movement of people, knowledge and information is essential.  Improvements in infrastructure alone, however, will not be enough to unlock the west's potential for the national good.  The OECD has found that human capital is even more important than infrastructure as a determinant of regional performance.</p><p>  I am deeply honoured to have been nominated by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, as chairman designate of the Western Development Commission.  More importantly, as I took the invitation literally and was under the impression that the committee could veto my appointment, I am here to try to convince members that I am suitable for the job.</p></speech>

I wish him all the best in his role, which is an important role.  As a Galway and Connemara man, I know that the west of Ireland has lagged behind in development terms for many years.  I note there are a number of important projects to be brought to a conclusion, including the West on Track project, continuation of the M17 and the broadband project.  Connectivity in air, rail and road is hugely important if we are to develop tourism and business in the areas covered by the Western Development Commission.</p><p>  Energy is an important issue.  Perhaps Mr. McGuinness would outline the direction he would like to take in relation to wind, electricity, oil and gas and renewable energy potential so as to ensure the State gets the best dividend from the resources available to us and as many jobs as possible are created in the area.  Having worked in the audiovisual sector in my previous existence, I note the WDC has produced a number of good reports on the development of the audiovisual and creative sector.  I would welcome comment from Mr. McGuinness on how this could be harnessed.  </p><p>  In Mr. McGuinness's opinion, how could the commission's investment fund be best used to provide employment where most needed along the western seaboard?  As I understand it, WDC does not provide grant aid but invests by way of share capital, preference share capital, loans, etc.  Is this the best way to go in the current economic climate or does Mr. McGuinness envisage changing that model?  The commission expects a financial return on moneys invested and does not provide hand-outs to prop up businesses.  In Mr. McGuinness's view, what type of return on loans provided by the commission is fair in the current climate?</p><p>  I wish Mr. McGuinness well in his new role and wish the commission every success in the future in development along the western sea board, which development is badly needed.</p></speech>

One of the best documents I have ever read about the west, including County Donegal and the areas covered by Mr. McGuinness, is entitled, The State of the West: Recent Trends and Future Prospects, subtitled Blueprint for the West.  In July 2001 it outlined the spend that would be needed above and beyond what was being planned under the national development plan to enable the region to compete with the rest of the country.  The plan made various recommendations, including some those suggested by Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh.  Does Mr. McGuinness intend to produce a new plan, pulling together all of the issues faced in the area and taking a holistic view of everything, as a blueprint to drive us into the future?  I am sure he is aware of the mantra - it is starting to become boring at this stage -  "The Garda station is closing down; the small school is closing down and the GAA clubs are closing down."  I could go on, but I am sure Mr. McGuinness has heard it one million times before.  From what he said, it sounds as if he cares.  I am terrified, however, that in 20 years there will be no town of Ballaghaderreen or Castlerea.  Some will say I am being very negative in saying this, but I am not.  I want people to wake up to the fact that this could happen.  Will Mr. Guinness formulate a plan for the region, similar to the one produced in July 2001?</p></speech>

Ballina is very well represented today and I have just been informed that the clerk to the committee, Mr. Eugene &Oacute; Cruadhlaoich, spent 12 years there.  Perhaps that is why there were so many rows between the football teams.  There is, however, a more serious and important point to be made.  I am relieved that the Galway man has left, but we still have a Roscommon man present.  Does Mr. McGuinness have plans that would help Mayo to win the All-Ireland football final?</p></speech>

On behalf of the joint committee, I warmly welcome the Minister of State with special responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Lucinda Creighton, to brief members on planning for Ireland's Presidency of the Council during the first six months of next year.  It will be the seventh time we will have held the Presidency in the 40 years we have been a member of the European Union.  The Minister of State will brief us on the main priorities, the preparations made and the overall approach being taken by the Government.  Ireland's Presidency will be cost effective and efficient and provide us with a unique opportunity to contribute significantly to the European Union's agenda on growth and job creation and to further enhance Ireland's reputation.  We look forward to the Minister of State's presentation.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-27a.324" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1076" speakername="Dominic Hannigan" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2012112700004#C00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for her remarks.  She summarised the priorities extremely well.  I will focus on one area - the need to restore stability.  This relates to two areas, in particular, banking union and the European semester.  On banking union and the make-up of the supervisory board, we would like each country to have the same voice.  The proposal by some countries that membership of the board be based on population flies in the face of the concept of European solidarity and is something that would concern many of us.</p><p>  With regard to the European semester, the Minister of State mentioned that she envisaged a role for national parliaments and the European Parliament.  We had a meeting earlier today with members of the Party of European Socialists, PES, group in the European Parliament and we spoke about this issue and the need to have an input from both national parliaments and the European Parliament, particularly at three stages in the European semester and beyond - the annual growth survey, the formulation of country specific recommendations and the preparation of and debate on draft national budgets.  National parliaments require a role in all of these, as does the European Parliament.  It is not good enough to just leave it to the Commission and the Council.  Will the Minister of State tell us what the Irish Presidency intends to do to ensure national parliaments and the European Parliament have a real input which will not just be noted but also taken on board, as part of the European semester?  The Cypriots have prepared a paper on how we can improve the European semester process.  That is something on which we must work as part of our Presidency, but perhaps the Minister of State might elaborate a little on how she envisages the role and involvement of national parliaments and the European Parliament in the European semester.</p><p>  I wish to raise a small point to which the Minister of State might not be able to respond today.  It is a proposal that is being considered in Europe for a tobacco products directive.  It would impose mandatory plain packaging for every packet of cigarettes, as happens in Australia.  Will that directive be part of the Presidency agenda and does the Irish Presidency have views on it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-27a.325" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/971" speakername="Joe O'Reilly" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2012112700004#C00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State and her officials.  I am heartened and not surprised by her statement that we will have a Presidency of substance rather than bells, whistles, pomp and ridiculous ceremony.</p><p>  My first question relates to whether we should give greater priority to Bosnian accession to the European Union.  Should this be part of our priorities list for the Presidency?  The Minister of State and colleagues on the committee will be aware that when Lord Paddy Ashdown appeared before the committee, he was concerned that sufficient attention was not being given to Bosnia, both to encourage its democratic evolution and development and to deal with extremism within that state.  It would be a mechanism to do this.  He considered it preferable to have Bosnia within the tent.  What is the Minister of State's reaction to that thesis and the fact that Bosnia is very low down the list of priorities?</p><p>  I was disappointed to hear talk in recent days about reducing the amount in the budget for the Common Agricultural Policy.  I wish to make a couple of points on this issue.  It is a pity that people see the Common Agricultural Policy as a support for farmers.  It is far from this.</p></speech>

I also welcome the ambassadors and embassy staff.  There is only standing room today, which is a good indication of the level of interest in the Irish Presidency.  The next time Ireland will host the Presidency will be in 2027-2030 at the earliest.  That is a long time away.  This is a very important period to host the European Presidency and it is important for us in all the circumstances.  I wish Deputy Creighton every success during the Irish Presidency.</p><p>  I welcome the fact that the budget will be considered during the term of the Irish Presidency.  My colleague, Deputy O'Reilly, raised issues on the Common Agricultural Policy but I think the CAP budget has a better chance of succeeding under the Irish Presidency than at present.</p><p>  The European Union is a major contributor in terms of aid to the Gaza region, but the EU was sidelined in relation to the resolution between Palestine and Israel.  Egypt and America, but not Europe, were involved.  Ireland did not play a significant role, if any, in the settlement.  I believe we should be more active in that regard.  This is part of the portfolio of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  There are renegotiations in the World Trade Organisation during the year.  These should present exciting opportunities during our Presidency.</p><p>  Youth unemployment has been raised.  We could establish a European volunteer corps under the appropriate armies for peace.  We could create a situation in which one would utilise the skills of young people, tradesmen, carpenters, electricians and so on.  We should try to eliminate the shanty towns in the likes of Nairobi, South Africa and Haiti.  There is such demand to try to eliminate world poverty and create better living conditions.  We have the capability and capacity at this point for a five-year programme which would really make a difference.  Instead of sending only aid, which was misappropriated in one particularly country, we could look at providing a European peace corps, in which young unemployed people would be paid by the Irish State and then sent to be gainfully employed on providing services such as water, sewerage facilities and housing in Third World countries.  We could do something that would mark the Irish Presidency.  No other country has a finer tradition of giving to world aid.  Irish missionaries went to the Third World.  I would like to bring this idea to another level and intend to promote the idea of a European volunteer corps.</p></speech>

The Chairman raised the question of the banking union.  I agree with him on how the supervisory mechanism should be constructed.  It is important there is equality between member states.  It is also important that we take into account the concerns of non-eurozone countries in this context.  That will be tricky and difficult to work out but the most important thing is that we have a clear mandate from the European Council and a clear agenda to which all member states have agreed.  We must find a way to move forward and to overcome the legal obstacles and political difficulties that exist.  I have no doubt but that we will do that.  I hope the European summit in December will give the added impetus that is needed to ensure that by the start of the Irish Presidency we will have a legal framework with which to move forward.  The single supervisory mechanism is only the beginning.  I would be emphatic in saying that the Europe-wide bank resolution scheme and the deposit guarantee scheme are equally important.  We need a comprehensive banking union, as a single supervisory mechanism on its own is not adequate.  We will be driving that agenda forward during the Presidency.</p><p>  Our permanent representative has been consulting with the Cypriot Presidency, the Commission, the Parliament and other stakeholders at European level on the proposals in respect of semesters.  Everybody knows the semester system is only in its infancy.  We have lessons to learn from last year's experience.  I hope that we can bring positive changes to the system during the Irish Presidency.  The role for parliaments is a sensitive issue.  The Presidency does not instruct Parliament on its role.  Every national parliament is different, they have different procedures, and ways of handling things, but I discussed this with the committee this morning.  Perhaps there could be a role for the Oireachtas to lead off on this process of debating the semester system, particularly country-specific recommendations.  The CSRs are most pertinent to member states.  They are specific to each individual member state.  It is highly appropriate that national parliaments would debate the country-specific recommendations.  It also holds governments to account.  It is important that parliaments see this role.  It is not a question of the Commission beating members states with a stick but that member states would take ownership of the recommendations and parliaments holding their own governments to account.  I am very supportive of that.  Perhaps we could give more consideration to how the Oireachtas might be able to lead the process and encourage other parliaments to do the same.</p></speech>

On the problem of youth unemployment, which Deputy O'Reilly raised and to which I referred at a meeting this morning, what action does the Minister of State anticipate on this issue in the next six months?  While the unemployment rate, especially for those aged under 25 years, is bad here, it is much worse in some other European countries.  In Spain, for example, youth unemployment is in excess of 50%.  Will European Union funding be made available to national governments to address this issue in the next six months?  While I am aware that some progress and proposals have been made on the issue, will a comprehensive proposal emerge in the next six months to address this difficult issue?  We must ensure young people are able to enter the workforce and do not become alienated from the system.  I welcome members of the recently established Europa Society from University College Cork.</p></speech>

The greatest destabilisation factor across Europe is the high rate of unemployment.  The current position, in which many millions of people are without a job, is unsustainable.  Many billions of euro are being spent, as is appropriate, on sustaining people who are unemployed when this money could be invested in job creation.  Having examined statistics and factors across Europe, I note that unemployment, rather than stabilising, is becoming worse in some countries and has increased throughout the Continent in the five years since catastrophe struck.  The problem has the potential to destabilise Europe.</p><p>  The Minister of State referred to small and medium sized businesses.  The large number of job losses from such enterprises is often understated.  I estimate that we lost 1,800 small and medium enterprises in two years.  Many of the former owners of businesses that closed will tell one that, having made staff redundant and cut their costs, they were forced to close their business because the banks would not lend.  The absence of bank credit continues to be a major problem.  One hears the same argument made in debates in Greece, Italy and Spain, namely, that the banking system in Europe is not lending to small businesses.</p><p>  If a large industry closes with the loss of 300 or 400 jobs, we consider it a disaster while forgetting that small and medium enterprises with perhaps five, ten or 15 employees, are closing daily.  The European Union has not taken any initiatives to address the problem, although individual governments have introduced minor initiatives to address it such as the business enterprise schemes here.  In the coming weeks, statistics will be published showing the catastrophic effect on European economies of the large number of closures in the small and medium enterprise sector.  Does the Government have any definitive proposals for the sector which would assist the economy and the economies of other EU member states?</p><p>  My second point relates to the ongoing critical conflict in the Middle East, specifically Gaza. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-27a.337" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2012112700007#F00200"><p>I apologise if the Minister of State has only five minutes in which to answer all these questions.  I have a list the length of my arm but I will not go into them.  The Minister of State mentioned the priorities, namely, banking union, youth unemployment and the European semester - many of which fall into the Commission timetable.  What is being done differently in Ireland in regard to youth unemployment?  Are there any particular initiatives that will be approached in a different way by the Irish Presidency?  Youth unemployment figures have been mentioned: Spain, 52%; Greece, 54%; Germany, 8%.  What is being done differently in Germany in the area of training and skills?  Those are the types of issues that have to be dealt with.  How are we going to grab certain issues by the scruff of the neck and say we will do things in a different way and put our stamp on them during the Irish Presidency, rather than follow the actual timetable?  Rather than take up issues already in progress I suggest we put a stamp on the Presidency.</p><p>  Can the Minister of State provide the committee with an update on the all-Ireland angle and how it will be portrayed?  Are we going to promote all-Ireland food, the all-Ireland economy, all-Ireland tourism and so on?  Is that part of the image that will be portrayed?  Are we going to sell the island of Ireland?</p><p>  The Minister of State referred to the Bosnian position.  She mentioned the reform on the Bosnian side, and probably knows more about the region than me, but part of the difficulty is that the European Union has not encouraged Bosnia's neighbours to adopt policies that support its functionality.  There are still territorial difficulties, property issues outstanding, access to ports and so on.  One of the difficulties for Bosnia is that Croatia will impose a ban on products from Bosnia, such as milk, vegetable products, honey and so on, from January 2013, as they do not meet European Union standards.  If that issue is not dealt with properly, it will create instability in the region.  As this is a region coming out of conflict it is important that, while encouraging integration, we do not destabilise the economy.  Perhaps that is not a matter for today's discussion but it is an issue to which I would like to return.</p><p>  In regard to PEACE IV funding, the hope is that it will be signed off on during the Presidency.  That would be great news for Border counties, particularly people in the North.  Some of us visited the North in recent days where we met with various groups and witnessed the positive work that had been carried out under that programme.  Will the Irish side push for a PEACE IV funding, as a unique programme, which is not top sliced?  Is the British side similarly committed to the PEACE IV programme and has it been supportive during the discussions?</p></speech>

They are laudable themes which, I hope, will bring the desired results.  For example, promoting sustainable economic growth and restoring trust, confidence and stability are hugely important in the present climate and supporting growth and reform of the EU budget is excellent.  However, I am not sure what the European Year of Citizens will mean to people.  We have talked about that issue on a regular basis for as long as I have been a member of the committee, which is a long time.  I wonder what it means to people.  </p><p>  I wish to add a few issues that need to be adopted and used effectively in the course of the Presidency.  The first is the reaffirmation of the European concept, incorporated within which is the concept of cohesion, solidarity and enlargement in order to bring on board all the strands that have kept the European Union afloat for all these years that seem to have diminished and subsided into the distance.  I would also add human rights issues, apropos of the point made by other speakers.  It is not a question of whether we are on one side or the other in the Middle East conflict, we have to be on the side of fairness and adherence to the concept of human rights, wherever there is an abuse of human rights.  It is not a question of coming down on one side or the other but to try to do our best to be a positive influence for the benefit of all the people who live in that area.</p><p>  I support the point in regard to the diminution of the importance of the food industry or the budget, either of which is not in the interests of Europe.  It is utterly unbelievable that anybody would diminish the food industry or the budget at a time when there is starvation all over the world and people are asking questions.  A short-term gain might solve somebody's immediate problem but would create many other problems.</p><p>  The question of national parliaments is an important issue, particularly in regard to the European semester.  We need the semester because we need to note progress or lack of progress as the case may be.  The difference between the current regime and what happened in the Lisbon agenda was that nothing was done to review the progress of the agenda for a period until somebody discovered it did not work.  The problem is that not all parliamentarians in national parliaments are equally disposed towards the European concept, they do not have the same vision of Europe.  They have the vision of division and isolation and of not being part of it, but acting as if they were bystanders.  That is not the case with this country I hasten to add, but it is with some countries.  That is obviously for domestic political purposes and it is obviously beneficial to some people but we cannot go down the road indefinitely of nurturing Euroscepticism and hope we can have a successful Europe.  It does not work that way.  I strongly urge that the Irish Presidency adopt the rigorous pursuit of the reaffirmation of the European concept at this time.  </p></speech>

I would not agree with Senator Leyden that it could be a substitute for overseas development aid, and many people in the non-governmental organisation sector and in the Houses of the Oireachtas would probably have something to say about that too.

In speaking to the amendment, I note the strategy will be based on competing private health insurance companies and will represent the effective privatisation of the health services.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-27a.359" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="18:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE12012112700004#C00200"><p>Go raibh maith agat.  The principal objective of this Bill is the general statement of policy on the line of the health insurance Acts, including the amendments to be made by the provisions of this Bill.  It is an aid to interpretation of the Acts.  The health insurance Acts regulate how private health insurance is provided to ensure it is available to those who choose to purchase it on a fair and equitable basis.  It relates therefore to the 46% of the population who have chosen to take out private health insurance and the need for those individuals to be protected from any discrimination in that context.  Insurers are free to offer products and to set prices at any level they want subject only to compliance with certain minimum benefits outlined in the regulations made under the health insurance Acts.</p><p>  The principal objective sets out the purpose of the legislation and from this principle the other provisions of the Act flow.  It sets out in clear terms that insurers must offer the same product at the same price for each individual who wishes to purchase it.  No differentiation can be made between individuals on the basis of the status of their health, their age or their gender.  Of course all residents of the State, those with or without health insurance retain eligibility at different levels for health and personal social services via the public system.  The principal objective relates only to those who have chosen to avail of private health insurance cover.  The issue concerning the basis on which access to health services is available, whether that is on the ability to pay or health need does not arise in this case.  Therefore I reject the amendment.</p><p>  The Deputy mentioned some assessments of the Dutch model of care, where there is a multi-payer system.  I do not accept what the IMPACT trade union report states.  Let me point out that we looked at a number of models, including the Dutch model from the point of view of the multi-payer system; the UK model from the point of view of trusts for hospitals; and the North of Ireland from the point of view of the special delivery units.  We also looked at the way they ensure patient safety in Denmark and Canada.  We have taken from the different systems what we feel is appropriate and best for our service to patients.</p><p>  On the overlying issue, the Government's intention is to bring in insurance that is universal and available to all our citizens, so that nobody needs to worry about ability to pay as a barrier to receiving services that are based on fairness.  The service is based on medical needs and not on ability to pay.  It does not matter how much money one has, or whether one has a higher level of insurance cover; all one will get for the higher payments are <i>cordon bleu</i> cooking and five star hotel accommodation.  One will not get a colonoscopy or a hernia repaired more quickly.  That is critically important but it is not relevant to this Bill.</p><p>  I am not in a position to accept the Deputy's amendment.</p></speech>

We have yet to see the White Paper.  The Minister's intent is laudable.  I acknowledge his intent, but we differ as to the vehicle to give effect to what we share, the commitment to universal health care and access on the basis of need.  There is a gap as to how it is to be achieved.  We have no certainty on the Minister's position.</p><p>  The Minister has spoken about this aspect on many occasions and now after 20 months in office, we have yet to see all of this spelled out in real and substantive terms.  The IMPACT trade union did not present something it made up.  It has employed considerable time and effort in evaluating the situation and engaging with people directly in the Netherlands.  It is not good enough to dismiss its report outright.  There must be a basis in factual terms to their concerns.  This has been referred to by people within that system, interviewed on the national airwaves.  I believe that acceptance of the subsection <i>(e)</i> that I proposed in amendment No. 1 offers the certainty of the clear declaration of intent that I believe is important, indeed essential as we move forward in engaging on this very important reform.</p><p>  I took the time to try to find a way of improving a Bill to which I am not ideologically or in any other way committed.  However, I want to see it improved to the best I can.  I commend my amendment and I ask the Minister to reconsider it. </p></speech>

We could be accused of having establishing a two-tier health system, in that there is private health insurance and a publicly funded system.  Until we reach the point that the Minister is aiming for, though, funding health services will pose a major difficulty.  Nothing in the Bill provides me with confidence about what we will try to do or, rather, what the Minister will try to do, as I do not fully support the idea of universal health insurance in the form that he has proposed.  The White Paper remains to be published and I would have expected a broad discussion on that to be critical.  This is not just a policy shift.  Rather, it is a major Government decision.  The Minister claims that he has a mandate to do so, but the difficulty is that universal health insurance will cost money and the Government does not have a magical funding system.</p><p>  The market for private health insurance is diminishing, since even those who are taking out private health insurance and funding the sector are only doing so under considerable stress.  Inter-generational solidarity, community rating or risk equalisation, whatever one wants to call it, is falling on the shoulders of fewer people.  While this continues to be the case, insurers will increase their premia.  It is a vicious circle.  Does any provision in the Bill ensure that there will be no inflationary pressures on health premia over and above the norm?  A diminishing pool of people are funding inter-generational solidarity.  If the insurance market collapses because people exit the system or reduce their coverage, from where will the Minister get the inter-generational solidarity fund to support those who need it most?  Section 2, the critical component in terms of risk equalisation and amending the principal Act, contains no provision in this regard.</p></speech>

A main point that must be taken on board is the failure of insurers to date to address the underlying costs in the provision of private health care.  It is possible.  Everyone in this room has anecdotal evidence of people approaching them about procedures mentioned on their VHI bills that they did not have done.  Clearly, our insurers need a more robust auditing system, particularly the VHI.  That company is important.  Although it only has 57% of the market, it is responsible for 80% of the pay-out.  With a new chairman and CEO and with a clear direction from me, we have an opportunity to address the VHI's cost base in the provision of health care.</p><p>  I want more robust auditing.  It is astonishing that the VHI never had a clinical audit process whereby clinicians would challenge treating clinicians to explain why an unnecessary test was done and explain that the VHI would not pay for it and would impose a fine if it happened again.  This will save a great deal of money.</p><p>  We must also examine the manner in which we charge.  Currently, we pay <i>per diem</i> instead of per procedure.  One gentleman told me that it had cost him &euro;8,000 to have an MRI because he spent several days waiting in hospital.  The hospital would not release him.  It told him that he would have the scan the next day, that there was an emergency, that he would be held onto for another night just in case, etc.  We are all paying for this.</p><p>  We must also conduct a proper analysis of what we are paying.  Certain procedures used to take two hours and now take 20 minutes, yet we are remunerating the professionals at the same level.</p><p>  We can make serious savings out of the &euro;1.2 billion.  An attack on the cost of private health care must be undertaken by the VHI.  It is starting to do this.  We can make health care more affordable by reducing the cost of the care.</p><p>  Regarding the overall figure, an initial paper on universal health insurance will be published before the end of this year and a full White Paper will be published next year.  The point is to have a debate and provide guidance on how to implement the multi-payer model.  Such a model is our policy under the programme for Government.  Competition brings better results for the client, in this case the patient, the user of the service.</p></speech>

The Minister is correct, in that a great deal of unnecessary cost seems to be built into the health insurance system.  I will provide three brief examples.  Caesarean sections account for 36% of all privately insured births.  In the public system, the figure is 27%.  The HSE's target is 20%.  There is a major cost in this regard.  In the UK, most cataract operations are done under local anaesthetic.  In Ireland, we are still using general anaesthetic.  Similarly, many hip replacements are being carried out under general anaesthetic.  These types of costs must be removed from the system.</p><p>  The Health Insurance Authority, HIA, which appeared before the committee recently, has a responsibility.  We must examine its role in encouraging older people to consider their levels of cover and insurers.  Approximately 50% of people and the majority of older people are on the wrong health insurance schemes because they have not altered them over the years.  Anyone who has been on a scheme for the past ten or 15 years and has not reviewed it is probably paying significantly more than should be the case.  Naturally, older people are risk averse and are not prepared to change their schemes or insurers.  The HIA has a responsibility to drive this discussion and encourage people to examine their policies.  It has a kitty of &euro;8 million, a small portion of which could surely be used to work with Age Action and other organisations in driving an effective information campaign targeted at the group in question.  If older people shop around and drive down the cost, it will reduce the overall cost of the health insurance levy and risk equalisation.  Young couples are subsidising this inefficiency, overcoverage and overpayment of premia.</p></speech>

He has good facts about issues that need to be considered.</p><p>  The role of the clinical programmes in public hospitals has caught the eye of the VHI.  I have asked Dr. Barry White to engage with the VHI in this regard.  I have also asked Dr. Martin Connor to engage with it in terms of what we have been doing in the public sector that might inform it.  For example, paying per procedure instead of per day, which the public sector has started doing, will be informative for the private sector.</p><p>  I agree with the Deputy regarding the HIA.  We must examine its role in the matter he has raised and beyond.  It needs to be beefed up considerably because it will be responsible for ensuring that there will be no cherry-picking in the new system that we intend to create.  This will be quite a job and I imagine that the HIA will need to be given additional enforcement powers.  Underpinning the success in Holland is a strong insurance regulator, one that really regulates.  We will not go over the history of regulation in this country.</p></speech>

To paraphrase John Donne, nobody lives on an island entirely unto itself.  When everything else is reducing in price the cost of medical care should be reducing also.

When we go back to the substantive Act of 1994, as amended in 2001, and we transpose the proposed changes and the impact of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2012, we note that the proposed deletion of section 4 and what we are having deleted here by the acceptance of section 4 of the amending Bill states that where regulations are proposed to be made under (<i>a</i>) this section for the purposes of sections 7(<i>a</i>), 7(<i>b</i>), 8, 9, 10, 12 or 13, the listed sections are (<i>b</i>) any of the listed sections, a draft of the regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulation shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.  That is an important requirement as things stand and my sense of it is that with the Minister's proposed private insurance based so-called reform of the health system greater scrutiny and safeguards would be required.  I cannot understand why we would then seek to eliminate the requirement of draft regulations being laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas for their approval.  My reading of it is that that is an absolute requirement.  Members need to be wary of what is entailed in regard to section 4 of the amending legislation now before us. </p><p>  My amendment seeks, in page 6, lines 10 to 13, to delete paragraphs (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) of section 4 as it presents.  The purpose of that is to hold to the existing position which I would prefer to see strengthened in respect of the changes signalled regarding the role of the private insurance sector in our health care delivery system in the future but at this point it is imperative that we hold the position as it stands.</p></speech>

Unlike the previous risk equalisation scheme of 2003, which was mainly set out in regulations, the new scheme, including the rates for risk equalisation, credits and stamp duty levies, is strengthened in future by being set in primary legislation and the Houses will have ample opportunity to discuss the amendments.  Retaining paragraphs (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) providing for the Minister to make regulations and have them laid before the Oireachtas, therefore, would not be necessary; it will be in the primary legislation.  I do not believe the amendment is necessary.</p></speech>

It is not an issue of appropriateness.  Whether the Minister deems it necessary is up to the individual judgment of each and every one of us.  My sense of it is that it is a requirement, that it should not be removed from this legislation and that the potential consequences of it are worrying, to put it mildly.  I am very much of a view that the Minister's response does not remove my fears regarding this matter.  In terms of the complexity of dealing with legislation, I wonder if all members realise the impact of section 4.  Even with the little time we have had in terms of going back over the various items of legislation that have since impacted on the principal legislation in 1994, it is very important that there is clear understanding of what we are being asked to do here.  It is important that the draft regulations are presented before both Houses of the Oireachtas and must be passed by resolution before they can thereby proceed.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 17 provides replacement definitions for them.  Since I published the Bill, the Department has had very useful and constructive discussions with the private health insurers, through the consultative forum, on the various provisions of the Bill.  As a result of the discussions, I have decided to introduce an objective delineation between products which the Health Insurance Authority is satisfied provide for non-advanced cover and all other products.  This provides a more clearly defined definition for non-advanced products as those which will provide not more than 66% of the full cost of hospital charges in a private hospital or not more than the prescribed minimum payments under the Health Insurance Act 1994 (Minimum Benefit) Regulations 1996.  Any other relevant contract is a relevant contract which provides for advanced cover.  Amendment No. 8 provides for the definition of private hospital accommodation for the entire Bill rather than confining it to section 11.  Private hospital accommodation means accommodation in a private hospital, whether or not in a bed, or accommodation in a publicly funded hospital in a bed which is designated as private.</p></speech>

It refers to advanced cover but not to non-advanced cover.  It is on page 22 of the Bill.  These are explanations for a table of various descriptions, but in trying to follow the reference in amendment No. 7 to non-advanced cover through the body of the Bill, I cannot find an equivalent reference to the specific section referred to, which refers to advanced cover but not non-advanced cover.

This is reflected in amendments Nos. 5 and 6.  This period will provide a very useful window of time to insurers to trade into the new scheme.  A hospital stay incurred under contracts effective from 31 March 2013 will have a hospital bed utilisation credit payable from the risk equalisation fund, while the current rates will remain in place from January to 30 March.

Is there a mechanism in place under which a person can make a formal complaint in this regard?  For example, the Bill refers to "the sum of all benefits paid under the health insurance contract concerned referred to in that definition in respect of hospital in-patient services provided during the hospital stay concerned referred to in that definition of the insured person".

I was told recently by a person that he had been billed for treatments he did not receive, although it may have been an administrative error.  However, some people are being billed for treatments they have not received.  We were told at a recent meeting with the health insurers and the Health Insurance Authority that people should shop around.  The health insurers need to make things easier for consumers.  The Minister is correct that there is a need for them to be more open and transparent in what they do.</p></speech>

I hope the issue will receive an airing in the media.  People should be prepared to contact their insurers when they believe they have paid health care providers for treatments they did not receive or for additional days during which they were not in hospital.  I am sure the insurers do not wish to pay out money unnecessarily.  Private insurers want to make a profit and VHI wants to remain solvent.  Once the customer has contacted his or her insurer, the insurer should undertake to investigate the matter and correspond with him or her.  If this becomes a problem in so far as people believe insurers are not doing so, in particular VHI, I as the main shareholder on behalf of the public, I will take up the matter with it.</p></speech>

However, in response to market proliferation of products - I mentioned that while the figure provided in this regard was &euro;200 plus, in reality it was &euro;5,000 - and segmentation strategies designed to restrict access to certain products, the provisions for the notification of products to the Health Insurance Authority are being revised.  We are introducing two levels of cover.  The HIA requires time to evaluate product categorisation.  If types of health insurance contract were allowed to change during the course of the year, they could be changed in such a way that the stamp duty and risk equalisation credits applicable to them would no longer be appropriate.  </p><p>  My Department chaired three meetings of the consultative forum on health insurance which comprises the four health insurers, the Health Insurance Authority and my Department.  At these meetings the central focus was on the Bill before the committee.  The meetings provided insurers with an opportunity to participate in and directly contribute to discussions on a planned working of the scheme.  I thank the insurers for their constructive input and I am pleased to say that following consideration of the suggestions made, I have agreed to propose amendments Nos. 9, 11, 15 and 16 which will allow insurers an opportunity to trade into the new system and reduce the impact on their businesses of the revised notification periods.</p></speech>

We are all aware that health insurance premiums have at least doubled since 2009 and that up to 200 people a day are leaving the health insurance system.  It was reported again over the weekend that families faced an increase of &euro;400 per annum in health insurance premiums in a new round of price increases.  Officials of the Health Insurance Authority who appeared before the committee a few weeks ago said the provisions included in the 2001 Act on lifetime community rating would help to reduce the cost of insurance.</p></speech>

The only solution raised when the committee held hearings involved the 2001 Act.  As a result of universal health insurance, which will be introduced at some stage, we have been told this is not a viable option.  I am trying to put some kind of structure in place that would make it a viable option in the medium term.</p><p>  It is a complex issue and it will not be straightforward.  There is time in debating universal health insurance to consider how to build in that incentive.  I am not saying what the incentive should be.  The amendment would lay down a clear marker so that somebody already in the health insurance market who has paid premia for a long number of years would have some incentive to carry through into universal health insurance.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-27a.452" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/983" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="18:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE12012112700009#H00600"><p>I support the thrust of Deputy Naughten's amendment.  This goes back to my original point.  The difficulty I have is that there is there is no incentive for a young person to take out health insurance other than a belief that he or she may get sick.  The difficulty we have is that between now and the Holy Grail of the proposed universal health insurance, there is no reward for a person to take out insurance.  For the next number of years, regardless of how efficiently universal health insurance is rolled out, there is almost no incentive for a person to get into the private health insurance market.  There is no incentive in the Government's policy because people are making an assumption, based on the very difficult financial circumstances in which they find themselves, that there will be universal health insurance down the road.  In the meantime, if I decide to take insurance, what loyalty reward will I have over the next few years to when universal health insurance is introduced?  That is of major importance to a young person deciding to take out health insurance now rather than waiting a number of years when it is forced on that person.</p><p>  We have raised the issue in the committee on numerous occasions.  Nobody is able to provide an answer other than health insurance providers are putting plans or policies in place that may encourage new business.  At the same time, there is nothing that will give a person a reward for taking out private health insurance between now and the introduction of universal health insurance.  They do not know what the universal health insurance will be and will get no credit for making a contribution to the provision of health care.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-27a.453" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="18:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE12012112700009#H00700"><p>I believe the Deputy is missing the fact that a person's reward is in their cover, which is why 47% of the population have such cover.  However, the issue has been raised.  If we were moving to universal health insurance, I would certainly be aggressively pursuing the issue with insurers.  Is it fair that somebody in their 50s takes out insurance and gets the same rate as somebody else the same age who has been insured for 40 years?  It is an issue, given that we only have a couple of years to go to the implementation of universal health insurance.  It will not be fully introduced by 2016 but we hope to have it started quite well.</p><p>  I do not know what sort of incentives we could put in place that would work within the context of universal health insurance but I am quite prepared to examine the matter.  There were discussions with the insurers about this and I would be happy to discuss the matter again if there is some way of incentivising people to stay in insurance schemes.  The Deputies are quite right in that people who are younger and healthier do not see insurance as importantly as people who are older.  I am one of the people who have been with VHI all their lives.  I accept the sentiment of the amendment and we will look at it.  I cannot accept the amendment as currently constructed but we are well disposed to it.  It is a valid point.</p></speech>

That will give him the opportunity to consider it.  I accept that it is a complex area and it may not be possible for the Minister to formulate a simple answer.  I am not seeking such a simple answer.  We will have very detailed discussions on the implementation of universal health insurance.  If this is laid down as a marker, better brains than ours could formulate a solution.  We have many of the finest actuaries in the world in this country that could come up with some incentive.  If we write into primary legislation that in universal health insurance there will be an incentive, the Minister will be facilitated in signing a regulation to implement the section in the 2001 Act.  That would allow health insurers to tell people there is an incentive for people in their 20s or early 30s or 40s to take out health insurance over and above the reward of just being covered.</p></speech>

First, if UHI is in place in four years, and we intend that will be the case, it will be mandatory, as Deputy Kelleher is always keen to point out.  Therefore, the need for incentives does not arise.  Second, in the short timeframe that is available, it is difficult to see how we could do it, but we will examine it.  Third, it would not be possible to have an incentive put in place now that impacts on UHI when it is introduced, because UHI is about equity and people being charged according to their means and being supported according to their lack of means.</p><p>  The other problem with this is for those who have been working abroad and have returned here.  They might have paid insurance when they were abroad so it would be necessary to accommodate that if one was to do something.  Their commitment to insurance exists and they should not be penalised for having left the insurance in this country when they were not resident here for four or five years.  We will have a look at it but it will not be so easy-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-27a.457" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1177" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="19:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE12012112700010#J00300"><p>Perhaps the Minister will clarify and correct me if I am wrong, but I understood that the idea behind UHI was that incentives would be built in, from an insurer's point of view, to keep people healthy.  This relates to cost.  That is the idea behind UHI.  However, one must get the public to buy into that.  Why should a smoker give up smoking if there is no incentive built into it?  It will not be a level playing pitch under UHI.  It will be in the insurer's interest to provide some incentive to a person to give up cigarettes or lose an extra stone.  There must be an incentive built into it or UHI will not work and we will not get the healthier population behind it, which is the objective.  That is one of the flaws under the current Dutch system with regard to the number of people who are going for procedures whose necessity is questionable.  If one is to build that type of incentive into it, which I presume is the principle behind UHI, surely one can also include some incentive, whatever it is, for people who have paid health insurance for 30 or 40 years.  That would provide an incentive to grow the market in the current climate, which is extremely challenging and is haemorrhaging members.</p></speech>

This is just an acknowledgement towards health status but we need much more data in regard to chronic illness, etc. of the population to be able to have a much more accurate way to support the situation.

I would be very concerned about the use of bed utilisation as an assessment of health status.  I accept that putting something else in place will not happen overnight and that it will be complex.  I accept the principle of what the Minister said and that it may take a couple of months to develop it, and I fully accept that this legislation needs to be in place by the end of the year.  If that is the case, it is imperative a sunset clause is put into this.  I would have serious reservations about putting a bed utilisation provision in primary legislation which could kick the can down the road.  I do not believe it is a good assessment of health status.  In fact, I think it incentivises what all of us involved in the health service in one role or another believe is the wrong way to go, that is, driving people into hospital whereas we should be driving incentives to keep people out of hospital and treat them in the primary care setting in so far as is possible.  It runs contrary to everything on which we all agree.  If the Minister cannot come up with a better calculation in the short term - I accept it is not simple to come up with one - a sunset clause must be built into this.</p></speech>

We need to prioritise this.  I hate using the word "incentivise" but we must give people an incentive to stay away from the hospital and go to their primary care team.  I do not know how we are going to do that but it is important.</p></speech>

What we have to do is create a situation where both the patient and the insurer are incentivised to keep out of hospitals.  The risk equalisation scheme is attempting to do that.  As I said at the outset, we do not have enough information yet.  The Dutch use this system but they have nine different parameters to use in this regard.</p><p>  We are trying to increase the factors to be risk adjusted to include a measure of health status and, where available, pharmaceutical cost groups or diagnostic cost groups are used internationally as an indicator of chronic illness and attract risk equalisation payments accordingly.  They have been very successful in Holland in doing this.  While those data are not currently available in Ireland to the level of detail required, I am committed to developing proposals to risk adjust based on a measure of chronic illness when the necessary data are to hand.  It is an area in which I consider the market operators can be of particular assistance.  Once the required data are gathered, I intend to progress work on developing a usable risk adjustment measure for health status.</p><p>  In the meantime, this Bill provides for resource usage to be used as a proxy for health status as a risk factor.  Resource usage data are readily available and easy to verify and are used in other countries to risk adjust but this will put it up to the insurers.  We want to engage with them and we are putting it up to them to come up with some ideas as the operators in the market as to how we can help them insure people are treated at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely, efficient and as near to home as possible, which I think is something everybody here agrees with.  I do not see any problem with a sunset clause and I will certainly look at that for Report Stage.</p></speech>

Section 11A provides for a risk equalisation scheme for the purposes of assisting in the achievement of the principal objective.  Section 11B sets out to whom the scheme will and will not apply.  Section 11C includes a provision taken in conjunction with Schedules 3 and 4 to make payments from the fund of credits in respect of a hospital utilisation charge and the amount of premium to be paid from the fund in respect of age, sex and type of cover.  The rate of risk equalisation credit for 2013 to apply in respect of the amount of premium to be paid from the fund in respect age, sex and type of cover will also be inserted into Schedule 4 on Report Stage.</p><p>  Section 11D empowers the HIA to establish a fund as well as setting out what will be paid into and out of the fund.  It also provides that for the purpose of maintaining a sufficient amount of moneys, the Minister for Finance may advance funding to the HIA through a special account.  Section 11E requires the HIA to categorise each type of health insurance contract to allow for appropriate risk equalisation credits and stamp duty payments which will apply in respect of advanced and non-advanced levels of types of contracts.  The HIA will make regulations accordingly and enter the particulars in the register of health insurance contracts.</p><p>  Section 11F provides that the Minister will make regulations relating to the making of claims for risk equalisation credits under the scheme.  Provisions for a risk equalisation scheme are set out in this section as well as who it applies to, how it will operate and how an insurer can make a claim for risk equalisation credits.  The section provides the HIA with powers to establish and operate the risk equalisation fund as well as power to make regulations specifying which products it determines to be non-advanced cover.</p></speech>

The purpose of today's meeting is to get a briefing from the Minister for Justice and Equality on EU Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting to be held on 6 and 7 December 2012 and also the defence element of the Foreign Affairs meeting which was held on 19 November.  A briefing document has been circulated to members.  I welcome the Minister and his officials.  The Minister will brief the committee and we will follow with a question and answer session.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-27a.552" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2012112700002#A00300"><p>I thank the members of the joint committee for inviting me to address them on issues relating to the forthcoming Justice and Home Affairs Council and the recent Defence Council as well as touching on the priority issues of the Irish Presidency which is now just 35 days away.</p><p>  The Justice and Home Affairs Council brings together Ministers dealing with home affairs and justice issues, including asylum and immigration matters.  Members may be interested to know that while I sit through two days of meetings, I watch Ministers from other member states come and go because it seems that most other member states have three ministers doing the job that I do and they stay for a morning on the first day and others come in for the afternoon, and an entirely new group appears on the second day.  The Minister from Malta and I are the only Ministers who sit during all of the meetings.  On that basis, a productivity claim will be made.</p><p>  The topics under consideration at the Justice and Home Affairs Council have a direct impact on many aspects of the lives of the citizens of the European Union.  We have received a lengthy draft agenda for the December Council meeting which starts on 6 December and which will be the last Justice and Home Affairs Council of the Cypriot Presidency.  There may well be some changes to the agenda closer to the meeting.  It is not anticipated that the current agenda items will create any significant difficulties for Ireland.</p><p>  I draw members' attention to the briefing material on the Justice and Home Affairs Council agenda items, which has been provided to members of the committee.  At the December Council meeting, Ministers will be provided with an update on the state of play of outstanding legislative proposals for the establishment of the common European asylum system which the European Union is aiming to complete by the end of 2012.  Work on the common European asylum system commenced in January 2008 with the launch of the European Commission's policy plan on asylum and was then followed by its proposals aimed at having a uniform system of asylum across all member states.  The proposal recast the Dublin Regulation and revised the directives on qualification procedures and reception conditions.  Agreement has been reached on the qualification directive and the reception conditions directive.  Negotiations on the recasting of the Dublin Regulation, the Eurodac regulation and the asylum procedures directive have entered their final phase.</p><p>  Ministers will be provided also with an update on the current position of what is known as the Schengen Information System II.  This system is used for national security, border control and law enforcement purposes.  It is being further developed and, until recently, the revised version was expected to go live in early 2013.  The Commission will update Ministers at the Council on possible delays and on mechanisms being put into place to minimise delays.</p><p>  Three issues relating to terrorism will also be considered at the Council.  These are the annual report on the implementation of the European Union counter-terrorism strategy, the report on the implementation of the EU strategy on countering terrorism financing, and the Council conclusions on aviation security against terrorist threats.  Terrorism remains a threat to the safety and security of citizens across the European Union.  These reports will add to the debate on terrorism and will help ensure our security agencies have the tools to combat effectively those who would seek to harm our way of life and threaten the fundamental freedoms for which the Union stands.</p><p>  The freezing and confiscations of assets is an important issue for Ireland.  In March 2012 the Commission published the proposal for a directive on the confiscation of the proceeds of crime.  The proposal seeks to strengthen the European framework for the freezing and confiscation of assets through further common harmonised rules.  As members will be aware, the continued success of the Criminal Assets Bureau in this jurisdiction in depriving criminals of the profits of their activities has been internationally recognised.  The structure and powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau has been used as a model in some other member states.  We will work through the Council and throughout our Presidency to ensure domestic procedures are effective and that international co-operation is as successful as we can make it in the area of confiscation of criminal assets.</p><p>  Ministers will be provided with the state of play on ongoing discussions relating to the protection of the financial interests of the European Union.  Given the current financial difficulties facing the union and individual member states, opportunities that may exist to weaken the financial interests of the Union through fraud must be reduced and eliminated.  This is a common aim of member states.  While there have been some concerns expressed as to the correct legal base for this measure, work is continuing to ensure a robust and effective mechanism is put in place.</p><p>  There will also be an orientation debate on the proposal to create a European account preservation order to facilitate cross-border debt recovery in civil and commercial matters.  This initiative seeks to facilitate the recovery of cross-border claims for citizens and businesses, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs and to improve the efficiency of enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters concerning cross-border disputes.</p></speech>

There are different models of protection of human rights in the European Union.  One of the issues that has come to the fore in France has been the arrest under the European arrest warrant of a French citizen, Aurore Martin, who has been extradited to Spain for participating in protests that were illegal in Spain but would be legal in France.  It has been criticized by political parties across the spectrum from left to right.  The French Interior Minister has disassociated himself from it and has said this was a European decision.  The person concerned was arrested for a traffic offence and because of the nature of the warrant she was taken into custody and has been handed over to the Spanish authorities.  I ask the Minister to consider those criticisms of how it is being implemented.</p><p>  I have reviewed some of the reports of the meetings the Minister has had on defence.  In those meetings, including, for example, in meetings he has had with the Secretary General of NATO, is he asserting Ireland's position as a neutral country and our capacity to play a role in certain conflicts, most obviously in the Middle East and other evolving situations?  When the Minister meets the High Representative, Catherine Ashton, what is the interplay between him and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade?  Do they both sing off the same hymn sheet and have the same common set of objectives on behalf of Ireland in terms of what we might ask her?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-27a.560" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2012112700005#D00200"><p>Due to time constraints, I will avoid getting into a conversation as to what we mean by neutrality, but that might be an interesting debate for another day.  I presume we are not neutral when it comes to international terrorism.  We are not neutral when people get blown up on the underground in London or in Spain.  We are not neutral about cyber-crime, which has the capacity to cause major disruption in this country and others.  We are not neutral when we see conflict in other countries where we believe an intervention is required to bring about either peace enforcement or peacekeeping.  The term &quot;neutral&quot; is often bandied about without being analysed.  We are neutral in the sense that we are not aligned with any other army and will not declare war on anyone.  We are neutral for historical reasons in particular circumstances.  Within the European and treaty framework, our position is well stated and understood.</p><p>  In dealing with defence issues, what is our involvement with NATO?  We are part of Partnership for Peace, which provides for peacekeeping and enforcement in co-operation with EU member states that are members of NATO.  EU member states that are not members of NATO participate in Partnership for Peace and NATO is a lead organisation in the context of that arrangement.  For that reason there is a relationship, but we are not formally part of NATO in that sense.  There is connectivity.  A total of 21 members of the EU are members of NATO, while others are not.  In the context of Europe itself, Finland, Sweden and Austria are neutral states, but they have no difficulty in engaging.  There is a very important and constructive engagement which centres around peacekeeping and enforcement and playing our role in security issues in Europe, which is very important.  We cannot be in a position, as a state, in which we seek financial help from Europe but are not willing to help others who have difficulties.  As a state, we are recognised as possibly contributing above our weight.  The type of thing we do is ably described by the training mission in Somalia, which is a UN-authorised mission co-ordinated at EU level, with a member of the Irish Defence Forces effectively in charge of a multinational group training young people to be efficient soldiers in Somalia to support the government there and to address the terrorism that has bedevilled that country.  When I meet the Secretary General of NATO, I do not need to enter into a diatribe about our neutrality, what we are not doing and what we are against.  It is a constructive engagement on issues of common interest based on our playing a meaningful role in European security and defence policy in the EU context.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and I are absolutely <i>ad idem</i> on these issues.  We both attended the defence meeting that took place a couple of weeks ago, to which I referred.  The morning and lunchtime sessions concerned defence.  At the lunchtime session, the foreign Ministers joined the defence Ministers, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade was there for the conversation we had about Mali and the Council Ministers' meeting to be held.  A foreign affairs meeting was held thereafter.  </p><p>  We must adopt an approach that is realistic.  The pooling and sharing issue is important and indirectly relevant to all of this.  For example, in south Lebanon, we are engaged with troops from Finland on a UN mission rather than an EU one.  The first 12 months of that mission involved Irish troops solely and then the Finns joined us.  Pooling and sharing simply means that to an extent, when one is engaged in a joint peacekeeping and enforcement operation, everyone has equipment that is similar.  If one is working with Finnish troops, there is no point in having two communications systems that are incompatible with each other.  It also ensures that one has similar types of arms.  I will return to the point about armaments made by the Deputy.  In the current financial environment, there may be a particular type of resource that our Defence Forces would need on another UN mission.  It may not be financially necessary for us to acquire that particular resource at the moment but it may be that, in conjunction with a defence force from another state, members are trained in the use of that resource and it might be made available on a sharing basis.  There are issues of that nature that are important.</p><p>  In respect of armaments, from talking to Catherine Ashton, I am aware that she knows where Ireland stands on all of these issues.  We are playing an important and meaningful role.  One issue we are looking at is whether our naval service might play some role in Operation Atalanta off the Horn of Africa, where very substantial work has been done and where lives have been saved.  Occasionally, we need to get real on the issue of munitions.  When we send peacekeepers to southern Lebanon or Bosnia-Herzegovina or when members of our Defence Forces are in different parts of the world where they may be at risk, they do not go there with water pistols.  Our Defence Forces need modern resources that allow them to fulfil their capabilities at home and abroad and play a meaningful role in UN missions.  This means that they must have access to armaments and other resources, appropriate vehicles, tanks and whatever particular type of resource is required, such as guns or defensive protective resources.  Europe does need an armaments industry.  There is no point in having defence forces with bows and arrows, because we would be putting them in danger.  There is a need to be realistic about this.  Of course, since time immemorial, bad people have obtained armaments and done bad things with them, but to defend our sovereignty we need a defence force that has a degree of capability and sufficient armaments.  Therefore, these must be manufactured somewhere.  This country does not manufacture arms but Europe has an interest in ensuring this industry works efficiently.  We have an interest in ensuring that if there are resources we require, we can get them without unnecessary expense.</p></speech>

There has been a difficulty whereby some member states allegedly - and I deliberately use the word "allegedly" - seek to have the nationals of other member states extradited back to them for minor charges.  This is an issue being examined at European Commission level and is an issue I have discussed with Commissioner Reding.  It has not been a major problem for this country.  I know the UK has been particularly focused on two or three people whom the Polish authorities sought to have returned from England to Poland for minor traffic offences.  At the end of the day, the European arrest warrant is about ensuring we have in Europe law and order and freedom and security for individual citizens to go about their business.  If someone is charged with a criminal offence in another member state we have a mechanism which ensures he or she attends the courts and face up to his or her responsibilities.  I do not want to comment on the individual French case the Deputy mentioned and I am sure he understands my reasons for this.</p></speech>

With regard to the proposals on the protection of personal data, will the Minister examine proposals on dealing with the prevalence of the use of social media and networking sites to indulge in cyberbullying?  We have all seen the awful results of such behaviour.  Will he also examine proposals on the inaccurate claims being made on such sites and the use of social networking for inciting hatred or advocating law-breaking?  What proposals will the Minister consider?  Will legislation be required or does existing legislation cover these issues?</p></speech>

When people access social media sites or individual websites to purchase a product or research holidays, one way in which this area is profitable is through the accumulation of information about the product, holiday, reading or sexual preferences of individuals or their religious background.  Effectively, for a long time this information has been accumulated, commoditised and sold on.  This happens when individuals who believe they are engaging in a one-to-one exchange with a particular web page do not realise their information is effectively being harvested, accumulated, used and sold.  This is why people receive communications and spam about all types of things, although I have never quite figured out why for many years there has been a spam obsession with targeting everyone with offers of Viagra.  I have not quite figured out what it was I once did online to merit multiple offers----</p></speech>

At present if one is involved in business in this area throughout Europe one may have to register with 27 different data protection commissioners, so perhaps we might have a base commissioner with which one registers and this would apply throughout Europe.  It does not specifically deal with the issue of cyberbullying, which is a separate issue, although there is some indirect relevance to this in the context of trying to have material personally related to an individual removed, but some of the issues the Deputy spoke about would really arise under another heading.</p></speech>

Will the Minister give us a timescale for it?  Will it be finalised during this Presidency or will it go into the Irish Presidency?  Will the Irish Presidency have to lead on the drugs action plan which will follow?</p><p>  The issue of the right to be forgotten, which is linked to what Deputy Corcoran Kennedy stated, is being discussed at EU level.  Quite often people put information on the Internet when they are quite young and regret it afterwards.  I know this issue is also being discussed with the United States.  Will it be agreed and introduced?  It would mean one could ask for one's information to be removed from the web.</p><p>  I noticed much of the Minister's presentation had to do with asylum, and the issue of forced labour in the European Union is something about which we are concerned.  We had a very interesting debate last year on missing persons and I know the Minister was interested in it at the time, as was the Taoiseach.  Is there any possibility we might see something happening at European level with regard to missing persons?</p><p>  The committee visited the naval base in Cork recently and we were very impressed with what we saw.  The innovation and research being undertaken there is significant and important.  The Minister mentioned consideration is being given to sending one of our ships to the waters off Somalia to assist in the very important and successful work being done there.  I would support this.  It would be important for us to play our part there as much of our trade comes through that part of the world.  Even for a short period, if we can at all, we should have one of our ships out there.  The Naval Service is more than capable of playing its part and it is very important that it does so.</p><p>  Last week the Garda Commissioner came before the committee and he spoke about 25 criminal gangs operating in the State with international links.  I am pleased the issue of terrorism and the fight against organised crime will be part of the Presidency.</p></speech>

I propose that the committee consider both Supplementary Estimates together.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  They were referred on 20 November by the D&aacute;il to the committee with an instruction to report back to it by 29 November.  Under Standing Orders, the role of the committee is to consider the Supplementary Estimates and report it has done so by way of a message to the D&aacute;il.</p><p>  I thank the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, and his officials for attending and assisting in our consideration of the Supplementary Estimates.  I also thank them for the briefing materials which have been circulated to members.  I propose that the following arrangements apply to the debate.  The Minister will address the committee, after which each of the Opposition spokespersons will have an opportunity to respond.  We can then have an open discussion.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I remind members that in accordance with Standing Order 161, discussion should be confined to the items covered in the Supplementary Estimates.</p></speech>

I am afraid I was engaged in dealing with other matters.</p><p>  I thank the committee for making time available today to consider my request for a Supplementary Estimate for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Courts Service Votes.  I am pleased that on this occasion there is no requirement for additional funding from outside the justice Vote group.  In effect, therefore, this is no more than a technical rebalancing of year-end budgets between Votes within the justice Vote group.  Additional sums are being sought for the Garda and Courts Service Votes of &euro;8.5 million and &euro;5 million, respectively, which will be funded in total, with a bit to spare, from projected savings of approximately &euro;17 million in the case of the justice and equality Vote and in the region of &euro;1 million in each of the prisons and Property Registration Authority Votes.</p><p>  I am very pleased that the justice group of Votes has come in on budget in the current financial year, despite the many pressures on the sector.  It is a tribute to management across the sector that it has been innovative and resourceful in managing resources within budget and yet delivering an excellent service.  This, of course, did not happen by accident and the reform and cost containment measures implemented are having the desired impact from an organisational and budgetary perspective.  As I have repeated on many occasions, there is no magic formula to address the very difficult position in the nation's finances and it is incumbent on all of us to continue to work smartly and prudently to make the best use of the resources available.</p><p>  Turning to the Garda Vote, the net additional requirement of &euro;8.5 million arises after a number of overruns under some headings have been offset by the reprioritisation of expenditure in other areas.  The Commissioner, as Accounting Officer, has been aware of the pressure points within the Vote from early on in the year and taken the appropriate measures to address emerging overruns by reorganising budgets within the Vote.  However, in view of the many challenges within the Garda Vote and, in particular, the very high ratio of pay and pensions to other expenditure, there is a limit to the options available.</p><p>  The superannuation budget was set this time last year.  As members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can exercise the option to retire on full pension on reaching 50 years of age after 30 years' service, it is difficult to forecast definitively the actual number of retirements in a particular year.  As a consequence, while provision was made for approximately 375 lump sum gratuity payments in the current year, the likely number of actual payments is expected to be in the region of 470, which gives rise to a shortfall of about &euro;8.5 million.</p></speech>

I am sure the Minister is well aware of the reports from around the country in respect of the impact of the new Garda roster on court sittings.  In that context, members of the force are not attending in court to give evidence in cases where prosecutions are being brought.  Cases are subsequently being thrown out or are just not proceeding, for whatever reason.  It is often stated that the new Garda roster is having an impact in this regard.  This matter relates to the wider administration of justice, particularly if garda&iacute; are not appearing in court in cases where prosecutions are being brought.  Will the Minister comment on that matter?</p><p>  The Minister provided a ballpark figure of 13,400 in the context of the overall strength of the force.  We discussed this matter with the Garda Commissioner last week and he indicated that some 1,200 serving members will be in a position to retire in the next 12 months.  It must be remembered that the lead-in period in respect of training new recruits is two years and that the recruitment embargo is still in place.  The Garda Commissioner also pointed out that he has been directed by the Government to reduce the number serving on the force to 13,400.  What is the Minister's target number in respect of serving Garda personnel?  Where do we stand in the context of lifting the embargo on recruitment and training?  I ask this question in light of the two-year training period for new recruits and the number of people who might possibly retire in the next 12 months.</p><p>  The Minister referred to the funding being provided for additional Garda vehicles.  Such funding is welcome.  We are concerned they will complain there is never sufficient funding for the upkeep of the vehicles.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-27a.590" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2012112700005#D00300"><p>I will deal with the issues in the order in which they were raised by Deputy Collins.  The introduction of Garda rosters is a very substantial reform of the manner in which the garda&iacute; deal with their day-to-day duties.  I wish to reiterate my thanks to the two representative bodies of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the GRA and the AGSI, who have fully co-operated in the new rostering system.  It means that it is possible to put members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the streets and available to protect the community on the days and in the hours when they are required.  Until the introduction of the roster system last April, there could be as many garda&iacute; rostered for duty in Dublin on a Monday night as on a Friday night.  Garda&iacute; are under pressure on a Friday evening compared to substantially less pressure on a Monday evening.  The roster system facilitates the Garda Commissioner and those working with him to ensure that members of the force are available on the days, nights and at the times when they are needed.  The manner in which the new roster operates also provides a better work-life balance experience for members of the force.  I commend the members of the force for their work during the past year, including the manner in which they have adapted to the new roster.  I commend the Garda representative bodies for assisting with the support and implementation of the roster system.  It is often overlooked to acknowledge the extraordinary work of members of the Garda force.  They have had outstanding successes this year in the areas of drug seizures, the detection of fuel laundering, raiding grow houses, tackling organised crime, addressing issues of subversion.  We now know that Operation Fiacla which ran from 1 February to mid-October resulted in the extraordinary number of 2,500 individuals being arrested for burglary offences.  As of mid-October, in the region of 1,400 individuals have been charged before the courts.</p><p>  To deal with the question raised by Deputy Collins, it is crucial that members of the force attend court sittings when cases are heard.  Nothing in the rosters impedes the attendance at courts when cases are heard.  I am not personally aware of any substantial number of instances where this has occurred.  If Deputy Collins wishes to bring any examples to my attention, I will be happy to communicate them to the Garda Commissioner.  The rosters do not act as an obstacle to a member of the force attending for a court hearing when this is necessary.  Two committees, one chaired by the President of the Circuit Court and the second chaired by the President of the District Court have worked to ensure a co-ordinated approach for dealing with criminal matters at court level.  The State is in straitened financial circumstances and it is desirable that a limit is imposed on unnecessary expenditure.  I say this as the Minister for Justice and Equality but in circumstances in which I would not in any shape or form want to interfere in any way with the independence of the courts or of the Judiciary.  However, it would be helpful if when, for example, cases are adjourned that they would be adjourned to dates on which members are on duty but that is not always possible in the court system.  The rights of defendants have to be protected and there is nothing in the roster system which would prevent a member of the force attending a court when required to do so for the purpose of a prosecution proceeding or a matter before the court being dealt with on an interim basis.</p><p>  Deputy Collins raised the issue of members of the force who are eligible for retirement.  I am familiar with the hearings of the committee with the Garda Commissioner and the representative bodies.  It is always the case that there are more members in the force eligible for retirement than the number who actually retire.  A member may retire on full pension having achieved 30 years' service.  In the region of 1,200 members of the force are eligible to retire but there is no indication that the majority would wish to or intend to retire.  The force has many experienced members who enjoy their job and are committed to it.  They have substantial expertise and they are of an age when they can continue to remain in the force for a number of years.  There is no indication that those who are eligible to retire are all planning to retire suddenly.  The Garda Commissioner would have addressed that issue with the committee when he was here.</p><p>  Deputy Collins raised the issue of Garda numbers and the situation with regard to recruitment.  As the Deputy may be aware - I am sorry to return to this - the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government entered into the EU-IMF-ECB agreement which required substantial annual reductions in public expenditure.  Certain assurances were given that the numbers in the Garda force would be reduced to at least a figure of 13,000.  It was not impossible, based on the agreement, that the force would be reduced below that figure.  In fact, the current number in the force is 13,440 garda&iacute;.  When I first came into Government there were in excess of 14,500 garda&iacute;.  We are now under the eagle eye of the troika and we must bring down public expenditure.  I am very conscious of the desirability of a return to recruitment as early as possible.  We are not in a position to make that decision at this time.  I am not revealing any State secrets about the budgetary arithmetic but there will either be in the region of &euro;3.5 billion in reductions and fund-raising efforts for 2013.  The borrowings for 2013 will be &euro;3.5 billion less than in 2012.  Based on figures that are publicly available for some time, I anticipate that next year I will have a spend of some &euro;62 million less than I had in 2012.</p></speech>

As the Minister knows, this matter arose recently when he amended the Defence Vote.  He had under-projected the number of Defence Forces members who would take early retirement.  An issue seems to arise regarding planning for budgets and anticipating the numbers of members who will retire early.  This is related to the debate on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in which there has been a loss of experience in a range of areas.  This is constantly reported to us as elected Members.  Similarly, there was an under-projection regarding Garda vehicles.  We acknowledge that an insurance issue arises after a vehicle has been driven 300,000 km.  When this mileage is reached, a vehicle must be replaced.  One presumes there is a log of the mileage clocked by all vehicles.  Planning seems to pose a problem.  Will the Minister reassure us that this will not arise next year?</p><p>  The Minister enjoys good provocation and a good exchange and realises the reference to looking back nostalgically at a policing model that served the State well for over 50 years will elicit a response.  I am sure he has anticipated it.</p></speech>

The Minister should bear in mind the views of the Garda Representative Association and the Irish Farmers Association.  The word &quot;nostalgia&quot; is just not appropriate.  There are legitimate criticisms of the changes being made.  Will the Minister give us a little more detail on the national digital radio service?  Why does a budgetary issue arise in that respect?  What are we spending on consultancy services and outsourcing?  Does it represent value for money and result in benefits?</p><p>  It would be good to have a breakdown of the rents paid by the Courts Service.  I do not anticipate that the Minister can provide the relevant information now.</p></speech>

We will provide the Deputy with the information.</p><p>  With regard to early retirement, there is as much planning as can be done.  It is genuinely impossible to predict how many members of the force will retire in any one year.  There has been considerable variance year in, year out.  All that can be done and all any Minister responsible for justice has done is estimate the approximate amount needed and deal with unanticipated retirements as they arise.  The Deputy will recall that at the end of February there was an incentivised retirement scheme and that those who retired were not affected by wage or pension changes.  Some members of the force might not have retired had there not been such a scheme making it advantageous to retire by the end of last February.  This would have had an impact on the figures.  There is no such scheme in place.  The Deputy will have found that the Garda Commissioner is not in a position to state definitively how many members will retire in a particular year.</p><p>  With regard to Garda vehicles, there is a planning issue.</p></speech>

There is much public annoyance about the Go-Safe road camera contract because it is seen as a money game and numbers racket.  The Minister, however, stated the number of speeding drivers detected by the service provider has no effect on the level of the payment, a point the public do not know about.</p><p>  Regarding politicians looking back nostalgically on old-fashioned policing, we all know we live in the modern age and we have the "Love/Hate" scenarios in real life and very violent criminals.  There is nothing wrong with good community policing in any community, however.  I know from my constituency that there are more garda&iacute; on the beat regularly which is old-fashioned policing.  Any senior or retired garda will tell one that the garda on the beat is involved in the prevention of the crime.  I know they cannot deal with the heavies and the "Love/Hate" brigade on their own.  However, communities love the idea of garda&iacute; walking the streets, be it 3 p.m. or 10 p.m.  There is nothing wrong with good old-fashioned policing.</p></speech>

It is part and parcel of what is being done by the force.  It has a significant role in crime prevention, community relations and garda&iacute; knowing how to divert young people who may be creating minor difficulties from going on to creating major difficulties or a life of crime.</p><p>  On the retirement issue, the legal position as I understand it - if I am wrong I will communicate with the Deputy - is that a member of the force can give three months' notice in advance.  There are occasions when members seek to retire with less notice and the Commissioner tends to agree to that.  However, we cannot have a rule that notice should be a year in advance because people's circumstances and health change and one has to give some degree of latitude.  It is in consideration of the members of the force that there is some degree of flexibility.  It is important to retain that flexibility but it is an issue that can be addressed at the end of the year.</p><p>  The specific role of the Go-Safe vans is to discourage people from speeding and save lives.  This is why one can identify on the Internet where they are situated.  There has been a substantial reduction on road deaths over the past four years, to which the vans make a contribution.</p><p>  The Courts Service software is being put in place.  I do not have a final date as to when it will be up and running.  There is legislation that provides for attachment of earnings regarding fines and the software is being geared to cater for this.  I hope to see it up and running in 2013.</p></speech>

I remind members that this is a Supplementary Estimate, not the full Estimate.  I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Alan Kelly, and his officials for attending to assist with our consideration of this Supplementary Estimate.  I invite him to outline the requirement for this additional expenditure and how it is intended to fund it.  Two element are involved: additional funding of &euro;32 million for the CIE group of companies and &euro;300,000 additional funding for the National Sports Campus.  Perhaps the Minister will outline how he will source the finance for this additional funding.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-27a.615" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1088" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="16:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TR52012112700003#B00700"><p>Thank you, Chairman.  The term suits you well.</p><p>  This year the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport requires a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;4 million.  In addition, a technical adjustment for &euro;32.3 million is also required to reallocate savings between subheads within the Department's Vote 31.  Current and capital expenditure savings of &euro;32 million will be reallocated to subhead B7, public service provision payments, National Transport Authority public transport contracts.  On 24 July last, the Government decided to provide additional public service obligation, PSO, funding of &euro;36 million to C&oacute;ras Iompair &Eacute;ireann, CIE, to ensure the companies could continue to operate for the rest of 2012.  This brings the total subvention to CIE for this year to &euro;278 million.</p><p>  Each year funding is provided for socially necessary but financially loss-making public transport services.  Funding for such services is made available under the Vote for the Department by way of a payment to the National Transport Authority for public service obligation services.  The CIE group has had to confront a very difficult financial situation.  As in most business sectors in the State, the current economic environment is very challenging for public transport providers.  The cause of the problem is primarily the recession, which has caused a drop of over 20% in passenger numbers from the peak in 2007.  This has been partly offset by fare increases.  The group's revenue is down by over 11% from the 2008 level.  The PSO subvention has reduced by 21% between 2008 and 2012, and is due to fall by another 14% in the next two years.</p><p>  The removal of the fuel rebate is estimated to have cost the group approximately &euro;22 million, at a time when it has had to absorb even higher fuel prices.  In 2006 and 2007, as a result of the CIE operating companies expanding their network of services and growth in the economy, CIE experienced an increase in passenger volumes and revenues.  However, the impact of the economic downturn, which started in 2008, resulted in decreases in passenger numbers in each year from 2008 to 2011.  Once the expected increase in demand did not materialise as a result of the economic downturn, CIE was faced with an expanded network of services and reduced revenues which resulted in each of the operating companies incurring deficits in each of the years 2008 to 2011.  The exception was Bus &Eacute;ireann, which generated a small surplus in 2011.</p></speech>

CIE operates routes which are not busy.  There are some such routes in my constituency.  What is the future of those routes that are not making money?  Are there any plans to increase passenger numbers?  In various areas throughout the country I see trains passing by and not many people using them.  On the Cork-Dublin train the number of passengers has fallen drastically.  What action is being taken by the Department in consultation with CIE to increase passenger numbers?</p></speech>

Some &euro;3.2 million in sports capital grants was not taken up.  Has that been ongoing since 2008?  Is that available to be drawn down in 2013?  What are the implications of that?  There is also &euro;3.2 million for the sports campus.  This might not be the forum for asking about the delays, but I thought that was on schedule.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify the situation on planning issues at the Crusheen and Oranmore stations on the western rail corridor and the payments in respect of the automatic vending machines being deferred.</p></speech>

Following the tragedy at the National Aquatic Centre, the centre was closed.  How much revenue was lost as a result of that closure?  Considerable money seems to be made up in different areas.  The transport area seems to be hit very hard with many projects delayed, which is of concern.  There have been delays in the railway order for Luas Broombridge, the extension of the dublinbikes scheme and the development of the Hansfield station, which, we were all told, would have been completed.  I welcome that the &euro;4 million saved will help CIE, but I wonder if we will have a problem next year if we are making these savings now.  If we are relying on that &euro;4 million to make up the money for CIE this year, where will we be next year?</p><p>  I am concerned about the search and rescue helicopters.  Many people have been looking for the extra funding for the Irish Coast Guard.  It is a major issue along the coast and we seem to be delaying that further until August 2013.  At &euro;5.3 million it is a substantial amount of money.  Will we get it in 2013?  I am concerned that when we make savings such as this one, we do not come back and correct them.  Is that the intention with all of these?  Do we set deadlines?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-27a.625" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="16:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TR52012112700005#D00500"><p>I thank the Minister of State for outlining the reasons for the reallocation of the moneys.  The lack of coast guard facilities at Doolin has been on the agenda for some time.  I understood that moneys were not available previously in that subhead to meet the costs of the provision of that facility.  It appears that there is now, but it has been diverted out of the section to deal with the CIE issue.</p><p>  Overall at the end of the year some &euro;30 million remains unspent.  This is money that could be used for the so-called shovel-ready projects.  The Government and the Minister of State's party made considerable play about shovel-ready projects generating activity in the economy, yet at the end of the year we find the Department has &euro;30 million in spare cash.  It is an indictment of the Department and the Minister of State that it has not been able to drive these projects, many of them in capital areas, that would generate employment and increased activity.  I ask him to comment on that.</p></speech>

There is an increase of &euro;36 million in the CIE subvention.  I presume whatever cuts are made next week or in future weeks for next year's budget will be from the base of &euro;242 million and not the &euro;278 million.  I know the Minister of State is awaiting the detail of the five-year plan.  Is there a danger that we will be back in 12 months looking at this?  Fare increases have been highlighted as a way of filling the gap so to speak.  Are economies of scale at play that might lead to bigger problems next year in terms of the subvention required?</p><p>  Most of that additional subvention is coming from money allocated to capital expenditure.  Is it not unusual for additional current expenditure to be funded from an underspend on the capital side?  Can the Minister of State give us some guarantee that future capital expenditure will not be reduced by the amount being reallocated here?  Can he confirm that the various capital items he has highlighted will proceed and not be dropped at the expense of other planned capital projects?</p></speech>

If it is giving rise to increased energy bills at the National Aquatic Centre, how will it continue into the future?  On timely drawdowns by sporting bodies, I know of sporting organisations that were allocated national lottery money but were never able to draw it down.  Would it not be better to give them a much more realistic drawdown period and if they cannot draw down the money, it then goes back into the pot?  There is no point in sitting on money like that for years on end.  Perhaps we should consider some kind of amnesty for organisations that will not be able draw down at the end of that period.</p></speech>

It is purely a payment going over the threshold of 2012 into 2013.</p><p>  The Doolin facility is down in the plan.  We do not yet project it will be in 2013.  That is something that will be looked at and I will get back to Deputy Dooley on it.</p></speech>

That is something I will come back to confirm.</p><p>  On the loss of revenue at the National Aquatic Centre, this relates to a couple of one-off events in the failure of a CHP plant and also a tragedy that resulted in substantial revenue losses that needed to be accounted for this year.  Its operation thereafter is expected to be as normal.</p></speech>

CIE, as I stated on numerous occasions, is in a perfect storm between loss of revenue, loss of passengers, loss of the fuel rebate, the price of fuel also increasing and the drop in the PSO.  As we all will be aware, it is in an extremely difficult position.</p><p>  Deputy Walsh asked if I could give a guarantee that we will not be dipping into capital expenditure in the future.  I can never give such an absolute guarantee, but it is not our intention.  We have been in negotiations with CIE on ensuring that it will get to a position of strong viability next year.  We have had to put &euro;36 million into the group.  It has been done in stages.  The group has been set defining targets.  Obviously, we have had to submit this Supplementary Estimate for CIE in order to ensure its future.  That five-year business plan is fairly robust.  At this stage, we are nearly down to weekly meetings to ensure the robustness of the plan for the future.  We would be hopeful that the plan will make the group's services viable.</p><p>  On Deputy Ann Phelan's question on the future of public transport, some offer the panacea of certain liberalisation and privatisation.  Obviously, in certain circumstances we have had competition.  I am not somebody who is necessarily against competition but, in itself, it is not a panacea.  Public transport is not profit-making.  We have one of the lowest subsidised public transport services in Europe, although some do not realise that.  We must get to a stage where there is an integrated, viable and workable transport service in the country, dare I say it, combining both public and private operators, and that is what we aim for.</p><p>  As Deputies, particularly those in rural areas, will be aware, that poses difficult challenges.  For instance, Bus &Eacute;ireann had to examine its network.  Dublin Bus also had to examine its network.  Effectively, from an Expressway point of view, Bus &Eacute;ireann was in a commercial place.  To a large degree, it might as well be a private operator.  Having said that, I would receive a good deal of representations from Deputies stating that Bus &Eacute;ireann must continue to be in this town, that town or whatever town.  The fact of the matter is that these are decisions made by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  They are not decisions made by me or my colleagues.  One cannot say that the company must compete, break even and, dare I say it, make profits while also stating the company must enter into various different operations that make it uncompetitive.  It is impossible to do both.  The company must try to provide as good a public commercial service as possible.  That goes for Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  I suppose it is about the future.</p><p>  The future will involve a great deal of change as regards ensuring that there is integration across services.  I am glad to say that in the past year and a half there has been much progress in that area, and it comes under my domain quite a bit.  Whether it is the advancement of integrated ticketing, the issue of real-time passenger information, the advocacy of Wi-Fi, the national journey planner or many other initiatives down to simple provisions on public transport services, it is a matter of ensuring that consumers using public transport feel that the service operates to their requirements, is on schedule and is comfortable and they can do their business on it.  That is where we have moved in the past year and a half.</p><p>  Certainly, there are challenges, particularly for Irish Rail in the area of competing with other modes of transport and ensuring more consumers use its services.  In that regard, there are challenges in pricing.  There are challenges in how the company will entice more passengers.  However, Irish Rail has made strong moves in the past few months to improve its offering.  One will see from its website that Irish Rail has different pricing models and different service models.  It will take time for that to come into effect but it will have an impact in the future.</p></speech>

If they have not drawn down the funding and if they were planning to draw down funding beyond a certain threshold and then find out that it is over and that has not been communicated, obviously, that would be an issue.  I understand from my officials that the funding is no longer available and by its nature, they would have been notified of that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-27a.652" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1088" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="17:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TR52012112700007#F00200"><p>The answer is simple.  There was another allocation to road safety in this budget.  All the programmes have spent their budget.  There was an over-allocation.  They did not feel it warranted the use of that allocation this year and it was not used.  Having said that, the Road Safety Authority, with which we work very closely, is looking at variations in terms of its future programmes and should extra expenditure be required that will be provided for.  In this case there was no impact whatsoever on road safety campaigns or work as a result of the transfer of this money into this fund.</p></speech>
