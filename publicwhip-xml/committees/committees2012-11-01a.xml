Are these minutes agreed to?  Agreed.  The minutes of 25 and 31 October will be taken at our next meeting.</p><p>  Deputy Harris had indicated that he wished to raise the issue of Irish Aid and we had that down as No. 2 on the agenda, but we will wait and see if Deputy Harris attends and we can take it at that point. </p><p>  No. 3 is correspondence received since 25 October.  No. 3A is correspondence from Accounting Officers.  No. 3A.1 is correspondence dated 12 October 2012 from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, that was deferred from our meeting on 25 October 2012.  It is a minute from a previous report and we will take that at another date.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  No. 3A.2 is correspondence from 5 October from Mr. Ray Mitchell, parliamentary and regulatory affairs division, forwarding a note regarding the deal on the cost of drugs with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association.  This is to be noted and we will incorporate this note in our upcoming report on the HSE, which is being completed.</p><p>  No. 3A.3 is correspondence dated 25 October 2012, from Mr. Tom O'Mahony, Secretary General, Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  It is linked to correspondence under No. 3A.7 re providing information previously requested by the committee regarding CIE and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  This is to be noted and published.  There is a separate letter relating to the oversight of the spend from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Taking the two together, I think the committee could have a useful session with the National Transport Authority whose accounts are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and who has received independent audits of the public service obligations payments made to CIE.  We can table that for a future date, perhaps as early as possible now that we have the information.</p><p>  No. 3A.4 is correspondence dated 26 October 2012 from Mr. John Moran, Secretary General, Department of Finance, re providing information previously requested by the committee regarding taxpayers' money given to AIB for the purposes of mortgage write-downs.  This is to be noted and published.</p><p>  No. 3A.5 is correspondence dated 26 October 2012 from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, re providing information requested by the committee at its meeting of 18 October 2012.  This is to be noted and taken into consideration in the context of our upcoming report on the review of public sector allowances.</p><p>  No. 3A.6 is correspondence dated 30 October 2012 from Mr. Tom Boland, chief executive, Higher Education Authority<i>, </i>re providing information requested by the committee at its meeting of 4 October 2012.  This is to be noted and published.</p><p>  No. 3A.7 is correspondence dated 31 October 2012 from Mr. Andy Harkness, secretary and director of audit, Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, re providing information previously requested by the committee regarding CIE.  This is to be noted and published.</p><p>  No. 3C is individual correspondence.  No. 3C.1 is correspondence dated 26 October 2012 from Mr. John Curry re County Wexford Vocational Education Committee, to be noted.  This is an individual grievance issue, although it also shows up how the Department mishandled the issue and did not issue a reply to this individual's concerns for three years.  The resolution of this is not a matter for the Committee of Public Accounts, however, so we will ask that the Department and County Wexford VEC deal fully and openly with this individual's complaint and correspond with us concerning the response they issue.</p><p>  No. 3D concerns documents relating to the committee meeting of 1 November 2012.  No. 3D.1 is correspondence dated 17 October 2012 from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na forwarding details regarding payment of allowances in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to be noted.  No. 3D.2 is correspondence dated 24 October 2012 from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na forwarding details regarding payment of allowances in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to be noted.  No. 3D.3 is correspondence received 31 October 2012 from Mr. Martin Callinan, Commissioner, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, re opening statement, to be noted and published.  No. 3D.4 is correspondence received 1 November 2012 from Mr. John Redmond, General Secretary, Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, re opening statement, to be noted and published.</p><p>  No. 4 concerns reports, statements and accounts received since meeting of 11 October 2012.  No. 4.1 is Leopardstown Park Hospital, annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011.  No. 4.2 concerns the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland's annual report for 2011.</p><p>  No. 5 is our work programme which is now on screen.  It takes account of the schedule of meetings on the payments of public sector allowances in 2011 and also includes meetings scheduled up to 20 December 2012.  The meeting arranged with the HSE on Tuesday, 6 November will have to be rescheduled due to an issue with the availability of Oireachtas committee rooms.  The HSE representatives are available on Thursday, 8 November but only in the afternoon.  I propose, therefore, that we schedule the meeting for 2 p.m. on Thursday, 8 November.  Would members consider that to be an appropriate time?  The HSE representatives are not available on Tuesday or on Thursday morning so we have suggested to them to meet at 2 p.m. on Thursday, 8 November.</p></speech>

We had them booked and they agreed to come on Tuesday but because we do not have first call on the committee room, we were basically gazumped out of this room.  It will, therefore, be on Thursday at 2 p.m. to deal with the allowances issue.</p></speech>

Agreed.  Do members wish to raise any other business at this point?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-01a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012110100003#B00800"><p>I have a point regarding the report itself and how we will draft it.  We are having many very good meetings about this issue and are well into the trees, but we must also be mindful of the forest.  I would like first to have a discussion about how we are going to engage in drafting the report in order that when a draft appears in front of us, neither the structure nor the content will come as a big surprise to anybody.  I would be hopeful the agreement of it will be as straightforward as it can be.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-01a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012110100003#B00900"><p>I will ask the clerk to explain how we will get to that stage of the process.</p></speech>

First, the committee will have a full involvement in drawing up the report.  Primarily the conclusions and recommendations are where people go to first, so that will be the key issue.  I have a consultant who, as we speak, is looking at our meetings.  He is pulling all the information together.  We will be able, therefore, to pull together a lot of the information that has been given, especially the information on graphs that has come to us.  We will be able to put them into a series of chapters with the issues we have discussed.  It will be based around the issues that have arisen in the discussion in each meeting.  We will synopsise those issues.</p></speech>

When does the clerk think we will have a draft report?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-01a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Clerk to the Committee" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012110100003#B01200"><p>We will have a draft for the following week.  We may have to push back the launch because the HSE has pushed us out a small bit.  In order that members can have a full input into it, we will have one or two private meetings the following week to get to grips with it.  I would be anxious to have the first draft for members by Tuesday, 13 November and maybe have a meeting on Wednesday or Thursday in order that people have a chance to read it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-01a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012110100003#B01300"><p>Could I make a suggestion?  If we are going to have the launch on 14 November, and will have a draft report ready on 12 or 13 November, perhaps we should push back the suggested launch date to the following week.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-01a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Clerk to the Committee" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012110100003#B01400"><p>Yes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-01a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012110100003#B01500"><p>In that way, we will not get into a discussion regarding why we are changing the launch date.  We will name a date that gives us a week to do it.  We should be able to do that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-01a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012110100003#B01600"><p>We have to give as much attention to the actual report and its content as we did to all the hearings to date.  If individual members want to discuss this with the clerk, they should feel free to do so.  If extra time is needed as we work our way through the report and its recommendations, we will then give extra time.  The dates are just to give a reasonable structure but we will not rush into a final report.  It may very well be towards the end of November and something else may happen in terms of our consideration of the report, which will push it back by a number of days.  I do not think anyone will mind that provided we are all happy with the report at the end of the process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-01a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Clerk to the Committee" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012110100003#B01700"><p>I think that is the key issue.</p></speech>

If we get agreement on what the structure looks like, including headings, we will not end up with a big discussion at the very start with people saying they wished we had done it another way, and someone else disagreeing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-01a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012110100004#C00200"><p>Once the Health Service Executive submission is heard, we will probably look at a private meeting with a consultant to have an overview of what has happened to now and the structures being put in place.  If there are any difficulties, that would be the time to raise that issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-01a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Clerk to the Committee" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012110100004#C00300"><p>That is a good suggestion.  The HSE report is being drafted as we speak.  Nothing major will change with the HSE&rsquo;s details.  The general themes that we can take from all members&rsquo; contributions can be fed into it.  I will have an early draft ready for next week.  The more rough drafts one has, the better.</p></speech>

I look forward to discussing any aspect of the Vote with the committee.  I have previously supplied briefing material to the committee in response to several queries it has raised and on which it wished to have information.</p><p>  The strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 31 December 2010 was 14,377, all ranks.  The strength of the force on 31 December 2011 was 13,894, a reduction of 483 members.  The strength of the force on 26 October 2012 was 13,476 sworn members, inclusive of all ranks.  We are three members fewer today.  In total since 31 December 2010, 901 garda&iacute; of all ranks have retired or left the organisation.  On 31 December 2011, there were 2,074 full-time equivalent civilian staff employed in an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with a ratio of civilian to sworn members of 1:7.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remains committed to attaining a lower ratio.  However, this is influenced by the current public sector recruitment moratorium.  It must also be borne in mind that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na performs security, intelligence and immigration functions that are not performed by many of our comparator police organisations.  These additional mandates have an impact on the garda-civilian ratio.  The number of full-time equivalent civilian staff employed in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 26 October 2012 was 2,031.</p><p>  This year to date has been challenging and demanding yet An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has had much success operationally and organisationally with decreases in many categories of crime, reductions once again in road fatalities and many successes against dissident republicans intent on causing injury in either this jurisdiction or in Northern Ireland.  The efficient use of resources has been highlighted in the annual Garda policing plan 2012.  One of its objectives is to promote efficiencies and effectiveness in resource allocation and deployment so as to enhance the policing service we provide to members of the public.  However, I am conscious of the need to make the best use of State resources made available to me.  With this in mind, I have initiated constructive dialogue with our criminal justice sector partners such as the Courts Service, the Prison Service and the Department of Justice and Equality that will generate further efficiencies in the years to come.</p><p>  The 2012 budget for the Garda Vote amounts to &euro;1.325 billion, 8% less than the 2011 budget of &euro;1.439 billion which was also reduced from the 2010 figure.  The rapid decline in the public finances in recent years requires us all to do more with less.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not immune from the effects of the downturn in public finances and we continue to play our part in our nation's economic recovery.  The public and other stakeholders expect as efficient and productive an organisation as possible.  Indeed, the significant achievement already made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in delivering organisational reform is widely recognised.  For example, there has been the piloting of a new roster, the first in almost 40 years in the force, and the new performance and accountability system which is due for full roll out in 2013.</p><p>  In conjunction with these achievements, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also has a significant organisational development and change programme in operation encompassing my commitments towards the Croke Park agreement, the integrated reform delivery plan and the GRACE, Garda response to a changing environment, programme.  This programme has 39 projects either completed or in progress in areas such as a new service delivery model, district and station rationalisation, workforce realignment and an examination of specialisation in the organisation among others.</p><p>  Up to 90% of the Garda Vote is expended on wages, salaries and allowances.  Several allowances were first introduced by the then Government in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Allowances Order 1924 and 1926.  These allowances recognised the unique nature of the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and were awarded in many instances in lieu of basic pay rises over the years.  This uniqueness was subsequently recognised by both the Conroy commission in 1970 and the Ryan committee of inquiry in 1979.  The Conroy commission recognised the significant impact these allowances had on the morale of the organisation.  The debate around allowances has particular resonance in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na similar to other public service organisations and, indeed, has implications for the Croke Park agreement.</p><p>  The conciliation and arbitration process is one of the negotiating mechanisms which exists for the purpose of enabling the Minister for Justice and Equality, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the one hand, and the Garda representative associations on the other, to provide for the determination and validity of claims including pay and allowances.</p> <p> A further purpose of the conciliation and arbitration process is to secure the agreement and fullest co-operation between the State, as employer, and the members, as employees, for the better discharge of the functions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Indeed, it is a mechanism which has served the State well in that it has ensured the preservation of industrial harmony, while at the same time maintaining confidence and effectiveness in the Garda industrial relations machinery.</p><p> For over four decades this mechanism has been utilised by both sides in the initial granting of and subsequent increase in these allowances and expenses for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In the case of civilian employees, the trade unions that represent civilians in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to engage and work to ensure their members work efficiently in the organisation.</p><p> When the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, published the outcome of the review of public service allowances and premium pay on 18 September 2012 following consideration by Government, one allowance, similar to that in other public sector bodies, namely delegates allowance, was deemed no longer justified.</p><p> In addition, the Minister announced that arising from the review a number of changes will be made to the public service allowance regime which included certain allowances for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  These included classes of allowances proposed to be abolished for new beneficiaries and allowances which were subject to review and-or modification.  In addition, it identified classes of allowances proposed to be approved for new beneficiaries.  A total of eight allowances were identified within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for priority elimination.</p><p> Following this central Government decision, I have instructed, as part of the revised action plan 2012 for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the context of the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014, that the consultation process will now begin with the Garda staff associations with the objective of establishing a mechanism whereby these priority allowances to existing beneficiaries will be eliminated.  This process will include a time scale for the elimination of these allowances.</p><p> I will answer any questions the Chairman and committee may have for me.</p></speech>

The association represents 2,007 members of sergeant and inspector ranks.</p><p>  AGSI welcomes the opportunity to address the committee today and hopes the issues surrounding allowances in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which may be raised by the committee can be discussed and explained by this association.</p><p>  AGSI is anxious to dispel the myths surrounding the payment of allowances to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including ambiguity surrounding the amounts of payments made, taxation liability, the numbers to which the payments refer and the widespread belief that all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na get all allowances.</p><p>  The Croke Park agreement is working.  It has saved approximately &euro;1.5 billion in costs to date.  As the committee will be aware, it guarantees no further wage cuts in return for industrial peace and a far-reaching aggressive agenda for change across the public sector.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has progressively pursued these changes.  Moreover our members have delivered what was required to date and this has been publicly acknowledged by Garda Commissioners, Mr. P. J. Fitzpatrick, chair of the Garda implementation body, and the Ministers, Deputies Howlin and Shatter.</p><p>  I would like to remind the committee that we were subject to a wage cut, universal social charge, increased PRSI, increased insurance levies and a pension-related levy, all of which resulted in a reduction of over 20% in pay for our members.  Coupled with this, a 6% increase granted under Towards 2016 was withdrawn and, of course, will not be paid now.</p><p>  One significant change under the Croke Park agreement to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na comes in the form of working patterns of members.  Since changes have come into effect, officers now work a ten-hour day with a more relevant supply-demand ratio.  The resulting availability of more members on the streets has been commented on by the public.</p><p>  The Central Statistics Office, in a 2011 report, cites figures which show that public sector pay has fallen since 2008, while private sector pay has increased, and the computations exclude the public sector pension levy.  In addition, working time has increased across the public sector by an average of 5%, while in most private sector employment it has decreased.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na members still work on average a 40 hour week.  Employee numbers have reduced by 10% since 2008 with further reductions to come.  In An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the numbers are expected to be at a maximum of 13,000 by the end of 2013.  That is a significant reduction from current figures of approximately 13,350 and well down on our peak numbers a short couple of years ago.</p><p>  Considering pay across the public sector, 60% of employees earn under &euro;55,000, with 25% earning less than &euro;35,000.  More reductions in pay through allowance reduction or elimination, at a time when costs are rising in utilities, bank charges and mortgage rates, merely constrict further the spending ability of, and increase financial pressures on, moderate income earners.</p><p>  Allowances form a significant part of the core pay in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This was borne out in two Government commissions - under Judge Conroy and Professor Louden Ryan - two Government benchmarking reports and the conciliation and arbitration scheme for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It should be remembered that despite reports of huge increases under benchmarking, members of the AGSI were awarded a 5% increase while senior civil and public servants were awarded 16% increases.</p><p>  The report on remuneration and pay in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, known as the Conroy report, was presented to the Minister for Justice in January 1970.  The Minister's commission, under Judge Conroy, was established in September 1968 to "examine, report and make recommendations on the remuneration and conditions of service" in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In chapter two of that report, Judge Conroy makes reference to the type of person burdened with being a policeman, and the benefits to Government of his role, at page five, when he states that a Garda's powers and duties are with him whether he is in or out of uniform and whether on or off duty, and he is responsible for any error of judgment in exercising these powers and is answerable for any such error.</p><p>  Some 43 years later, this remains the case.  Members of sergeant and inspector ranks are tasked with responsibilities that no other individual in the civil or public service must bear.  Solely, we can deprive a person of his or her liberty; make life-changing decisions in split seconds; expose ourselves to prosecution-investigation by carrying out our statutory role; have our decisions scrutinised by an outside agency in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission or internally through Garda discipline regulations; be suspended without pay or at best with 90% of basic pay; be left without professional legal assistance, apart from the AGSI scheme; and, ultimately, be open to losing one's job for relatively minor infringements of the regulations.  Sadly, many of our members have lost their lives through the carrying out of their policing duties and many more are injured through assault each year.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is unique in this regard.</p><p>  This association has yet to see any other public servant targeted in the same way for the performance of his or her duties as an officeholder.  Most mistakes in other agencies are referred to as "systems failures" and often the result is that an undertaking is given that procedures have been put in place to ensure the same thing cannot happen again.</p><p>  It has been the practice that police in Ireland and the United Kingdom were paid a rent allowance if they could not be supplied with free accommodation.  This practice was established before the Desborough commission reported to the Government of the United Kingdom in July 1919.</p><p>  In Ireland, there is a similar historical aspect to rent allowance and other allowances in the Garda organisation.  I have a written submission, which I will leave with the committee, which deals with a selection of allowances which are targeted for elimination or restructuring within the Garda organisation.  I will conclude at that.  I thank the Chairman and members of the Committee.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-01a.42" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P. J. Stone" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012110100005#D00900"><p>Yes.  I thank the Chairman for giving us the opportunity for coming here today to address him and the committee.</p><p>  This is the first opportunity we have been given to address the issue in a public forum.  Much of the debate and discussion in respect of allowances has been conducted in an atmosphere of hysteria.  One matter it is important to point out in respect of the 11,100 members that I represent is that the allowances applicable to those known as front-line responders, the young men and women of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have to go to every call, amounts to approximately three in all: rent allowance, boot allowance and uniform maintenance allowance.  The notion that members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are in receipt of some 101 allowances is a misnomer.</p><p>  The question of the way the allowances are paid should be addressed in the context of the real meaning of what is an allowance.  For instance, when one talks about the earnings of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in respect of overtime, that should be clear and distinct.</p> <p>Equally, when one talks about earnings in respect of the payments for unsocial hours working, that should be clear and distinct.  To bundle that into some sort of notion of allowances puts a skew on the public purse in a way that I do not think gives a true picture or accurate reflection of what is required in terms of the policing of this State.  It must be remembered that when everybody else is curled up at night in their beds and comfortable, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to provide a service 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year.  Nobody with any sense of moral right would begrudge those members the entitlement to be paid, as is paid right across the public and private sector, commensurate wages in respect of what should be known as a shift allowance.  That is the direction in which we should be going and they are the areas that need to be addressed in the context of putting this right once and for all.</p><p> Equally in respect of the number of allowances which have been bandied about both in the public media and elsewhere, in reality the number of allowances which can be reflected accurately which could be taken as the amount that are in usage, in my view, is about 34.  They are paid for very specific reasons and they are paid for the purpose of ensuring continuity of service so that members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of my rank are able to do the job they are targeted and charged with by the Garda Commissioner.</p><p> There is one thing I would like to say to the committee and it is very important because it is lost sight of in respect of the force.  The majority of garda&iacute; will retire as garda&iacute;.  Some 80% of my members who joined the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will retire as garda&iacute;.  There is no facility within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for grading or grade structures as apply elsewhere.  It applies in European police forces where they have different grades and different structures.  That would have dealt with the issue of why people are paid a particular amount of money for taking on the responsibility of a particular job, but what it would have meant in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is that one would have had different pay levels for different members of the force.  That might not necessarily have been a bad thing, but this is the issue in respect of where we are from the point of view of the public perception of the way allowances are paid.</p><p> In the context of the negotiations we have engaged in, we have always stayed within the industrial relations mechanisms available to us, which have served the State well - the conciliation and arbitration machinery.  While I might not be particularly in favour of the way it has operated throughout the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in my service, I still have to acknowledge that it is a forum where we can go and make our case.  I know that when we have argued at that forum in respect of issues pertaining to our conditions of employment, it was always people from the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Finance present who ensured - to quote a Secretary General of the Department - that we pulled the ladder up after us so as to ensure that nobody else could effectively follow and pursue some claims that were agreed for garda&iacute; because of the unique nature of policing.  These things must be borne in mind in the context of now looking at whether something is justified.  While I respect, Chairman, that you and your committee are not doing that, it is important in the context of any discussion that is taking place that we do not open up another forum for negotiations because it is my contention that we have proved the point in respect of the entitlement of some of these allowances and we have shown quite clearly and illustrated that, in the norm, these allowances are much cheaper than that which relates to some of our European counterparts.</p><p> I might make a simple case on that.  A lot of outsourcing has happened with European police forces and in any analysis of that outsourcing, one will find that it actually cost more than it costs in Ireland in terms of the service we provide.  It has already been related by the Commissioner that we are a unitary police force.  We do everything from the point of view of investigation of traffic accidents to the security of the State.  In other jurisdictions some of those issues are handled by MI5, M16, etc., but we take on board every aspect and facet of policing and we do it with a proud tradition and with a degree of service that is second to none.</p><p> It is important in the context of a debate on garda&iacute; and their pay and remuneration that we clearly understand that some of the issues pertaining to pay and allowances are historical, outside our control and are matters which, in the context of any important review, could be addressed in a way that would not cause this type of concern into the future.  I certainly would be anxious to participate in that type of discussion and I look forward to the forum the Commissioner has alluded to being set up so that we can then make our business case in respect of the matters that are now before the committee.</p><p> It is also important to say that there is a great deal of frustration among young garda&iacute;, particularly those with about eight or nine years' service, who hear again through the media that the average pay they receive is in the region of &euro;53,000.  I have a payslip here that reflects the pay of about 80% of the members I represent and it can be sent to the Chairman, if that is what he requires.  The pay of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na - it can be clearly shown - is &euro;46,631 for a member with nine years' service - it is not &euro;53,480.  They get very annoyed and aggrieved when this kind of wage average is put out in the public arena.</p><p> I know the Chairman and the committee have a very serious task.  I know they are charged with looking after the public purse strings and reporting back to Government and making recommendations.  I sincerely hope, once they have had the opportunity to talk to us - to talk to our members, if necessary, beyond this forum - that their understanding will be much more and that they will have a greater degree of acceptance of the necessity for the continuation of the arrangements, perhaps in a different guise, as important for the proper perception and right of the Irish people who are paying our wages.</p></speech>

His opening remarks will form part of the record of today's meeting.  While the work of the committee is centred on the allowances, it gives the opportunity to the employer and those either in the force or in the Defence Forces or their representative bodies to come here and explain the allowances and take away some of the mystery from the public commentary on allowances whether it be in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces or any other part of the State.  I would like those present to view it in that way.  It is a positive move by the Committee of Public Accounts to give the opportunity to representative bodies and to the administration of the force in this case to come here and put their views on the public record and perhaps to correct some of the misinformation that is out there.  We have found it a very positive process and we have had very positive exchanges between all concerned.  We will have just one further meeting.  I would like the witnesses to avail of today's meeting in answering the questions the members have in order to clarify the different issues regarding allowances.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-01a.45" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1067" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012110100006#E00300"><p>I echo what the Chairman has said.  I do not believe any representative organisation or trade union appearing before the committee has anything to fear from this process.  This has been a very constructive exercise in recent weeks and has performed the function of busting some of the myths about public sector allowances that have been perpetuated in recent weeks and months.  I welcome the Commissioner, his colleagues and the representatives of the staff associations.  I put on record our thanks to the members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for protecting the people and the State.</p><p>  Approximately 108 allowances are payable to members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na across all ranks with an overall cost of in excess of &euro;214 million.  More than half of the allowances are taken up by payment for work at weekends, on public holidays, etc., outside non-core hours.  A quarter of the &euro;240 million is paid for the Garda rent allowance.  According to the figures we have, a total of 21.6% of a garda's pay is made up of allowances.  By any measure that is quite large in the context of the relationship between basic pay and allowances.  I know that overtime constitutes a large part of the pay of members of the force.  As with teachers, the pay structures for garda&iacute; are quite complex and cumbersome.  They have developed in a piecemeal fashion since the foundation of the State.  Representative bodies and members of the force over the years may not have been too concerned about how they were awarded provided that the money hit the bank account at the end of the week or month, which is entirely understandable.  As was correctly pointed out, many of the allowances have been in force since the mid-1920s.</p> <p>Many of them constitute core pay in my opinion.  What efforts have been made by the representative organisations to absorb or consolidate the allowances into core pay?  Were they content to continue to call the payments allowances when for all intents and purposes they constitute core pay?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-01a.47" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P. J. Stone" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012110100007#F00200"><p>It is probably not a bad thing that we evolved to where we are today in terms of scrutiny of some of these allowances provided that it is done in the context described by Deputy Nash and the Chairman.  A number of these allowances could be subsumed into pay in order to remove the idea that they are perks.  I am sure that is the way forward.  It is fair to say that the allowances were previously used to make up for increases in pay.  That is a pity in one sense because if, for example, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were paid according to the proper pay structures, the question of making claims to conciliation for this or that allowance might not have arisen.  Comparisons are constantly made with other forces.  A police officer starting in the London Metropolitan Police Service earns a salary of &euro;35,464, compared to &euro;25,745 here.  The same relationship exists throughout the service.  It is a pity that we have not arrived at a proper benchmark for pay of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  If that had been done 15 or 20 years ago we might not be having this debate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-01a.48" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Callinan" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012110100007#F00300"><p>I wish to make a couple of general points on the issue of allowances.  In the context of the 108 allowances outlined in the Deputy&rsquo;s question, the difficulty of being both descriptive and prescriptive in respect of a unilateral allowance for the Garda was recognised in my opening remarks and by subsequent speakers.  This is particularly the case given the unique duties applicable to the force.  Some of the allowances could certainly be subsumed into basic pay and I support the arguments articulated by others in regard to the various allowances that accrued to members of the force over the years.</p><p>  However, other issues arise which might make the process somewhat difficult.  I refer to the totality of the allowances rather than individual allowances.  The services provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have always been driven by demand.  This means we need the requisite number of people in the right place at the right time to meet demands.  As the pattern of demand will not always be uniform across the ranks, the nuance between those who are entitled to allowances and those who are disentitled, if I may use that term, would have to be carefully considered in most cases.  The issue also arises of operational police officers being available on a 24-seven basis, 365 days per year.  The third leg of the problem is discommoding people from their places of employment and asking them to be available for duty at locations other than their normal place of work.</p><p>  These issues have to be factored in.  Many of the allowances - no more so than overtime - are demand driven.  The need to match demand with the nature of the employment dictates where allowances should be paid and who should receive them.  I agree, however, that a number of allowances could be subsumed into basic pay.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-01a.49" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1067" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012110100007#F00400"><p>Mr. Callinan mentioned overtime.  The business cases that have been presented to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the figures we have seen in recent days indicate that overtime is a big issue.  A particular spike appears to occur with overtime for inspectors.  Four inspectors each earned more than &euro;60,000 in allowances and overtime.  That is an extraordinary figure by any stretch of the imagination.  Does a particular issue arise in the management structure when it comes to inspectors and, if so, what has been done to address it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-01a.50" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Callinan" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012110100007#F00500"><p>All of the figures for overtime are the result of demand for the services of the individual concerned.  A set budget for overtime is allocated to chief superintendents at the start of the year.  Inspectors are a divisional resource, in other words, they work to their chief superintendents and superintendents in their respective districts.  This means, for example, they are occasionally required to travel significant distances to service the courts.  As the Deputy will be aware, we prosecute in the District Court.  They are also involved in a considerable range of interfaces with committees, whether in joint policing committees, the health service, justice or the courts.</p><p>  They have a wide range of duties and their span of control must also be taken into account because as operational officers will have in their charge a number of sergeants and garda&iacute;.  At night, when we are all tucked away safely in our beds, inspectors are supervising and directing the officers in their charge. </p><p>  All of the overtime expenditure is carefully monitored, particularly in the context of the reduced financial and human resources available to us over the past several years.  Senior management is acutely aware of how that money is spent.  The figures substantiate what the Deputy has pointed out.  More than one third of the gross salary of inspectors is consumed by overtime and allowances generally.  This is not money that is thrown away like confetti at a wedding, however.  There are tight controls and structures around the allocation of overtime.  It is probably driven by the range of product that inspectors are expected to deliver.</p></speech>

This allowance has been in existence for quite some time and it obviously reflected a particular need at a point in time.  It is probably fair to say, however, that the vast majority of garda&iacute; above a certain rank own their homes.  Is the rent allowance paid to every garda who owns a home?

I will refer the Commissioner to a line in the business case returned to the Department that states that the allowance is typically paid "out of this fee".  The GAA, the FAI, concert promoters and so on pay a fee to the Garda to cover their events within the confines of the stadium, venue or whatever the case may be.  According to the 2011 figures presented to the committee, 2,262 garda&iacute; received a 1.5-time rate and a further cohort received double time in the context of the non-public duty allowance.  Does the organisation ever suffer a shortfall due to requests for a Garda presence at events?  If so, does the taxpayer foot the bill?  According to the business case, the fee "typically" covers the cost.  This suggests that it does not always cover the cost.</p></speech>

Generally, local Garda management sits down the organisers and discusses the policing plan - that is, the terms required to police the events effectively.  It has not always been the case that expectations are met in terms of the amount of money for which we ask.  In more recent times, however, committees have sat and rates have been struck with concert promoters, etc.</p><p>  There is always a debate on what is representative of public duty.  For example, sporting events have a community value.  Therefore, there are obligations on the Garda to act in the public interest and provide a certain level of service.  Large commercial considerations include concerts, etc.  There has always been a disparity, but we have narrowed it down.  When we enter a negotiation with a concert promoter or large sporting body, we generally set out the number of garda&iacute; required.  Depending on the day of the week, the time of day, bank holidays, etc., we factor in all of the allowances that the garda&iacute; would normally receive and match them with our invoice for the event.</p></speech>

This allowance applies to senior members of the force - superintendents, chief superintendents and others - who are expected to make themselves available during non-core hours, as it were.

The Deputy raised a point about rent.  To be accurate, the rent allowance was applied to the wages of members of the Royal Irish Constabulary in 1883.  The Irish State has mirrored many of the allowances payable to our British counterparts.  Some of the allowances at issue in this discussion have been subsumed into the pay of English and PSNI constables.  Strangely, some years ago the London Metropolitan Police Service abolished the rent allowance for new entrants, but has since reintroduced it.  If memory serves, it amounts to approximately &pound;6,580.  Under any benchmarking exercise, we mirror 95% of other police forces exactly, with the exception of pay.  This is particularly so in the PSNI's case, where new recruits early in their careers are better paid than garda&iacute;, as is outlined in figures I have provided.</p></speech>

There is a great case to be made for tidying up that list to reflect what is here in the list that applies to the members of my rank.  In the McCarthy report, Mr. McCarthy identified what we would call live allowances at approximately 54 and that probably would be nearer the mark because some of the allowances alluded to by Mr. McCarthy have been set out by the Commissioner in respect of other ranks, particularly on-call allowances.

The other ones the Deputy alluded to would not refer to Garda by rank and I hope I am not misleading the Deputy in that.  If one looks at Mr. McCarthy's report and the analysis he conducted at the time, he saw that there were 54 allowances.  I accept the point made by the Commissioner.  It is a bit like legislation in that it is on the Statute Book but whether it is utilised is the question.  If we were to look at that for the purposes of tidying up those allowances, this could reduce them but would effectively not change or alter them.  It is not about trying to con people.  I am merely making the point that there is a notion out there that garda&iacute; are in receipt of 108 allowances.  Those are the allowances that are applicable to members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na I represent.</p></speech>

I think they have 63 allowances.  Prison officers have 64 allowances while this list states that the garda&iacute; have 108 allowances.  I take on board completely the point made by Mr. Stone that some of these allowances will be duplicates, as Mr. Redmond noted.  There still appears to be a large number of them on paper in comparison to what I have seen in different organisations across the public service.  Does anybody have any comments on that?</p></speech>

In terms of looking at the documentation that came from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, if one looks at the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na radio technician allowance and the Defence Forces position, one can see they have the very same allowance but might be paying it to three people.  It is just the way some of those allowances are divided up.  They are the same allowance but payable to different people, if I am making myself clear.</p></speech>

To answer the Deputy's question, the fact that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a national police force and is so disparate in its different sections, covering everything from front line policing, traffic corps, community policing and various specialist areas, may account for the greater number of allowances than in the other services mentioned by the Deputy.</p></speech>

They made the point that every profession one could think of is replicated within the Defence Forces, from a surgeon to an engineer, because they need the ability to have that presence in other countries.  I still take Mr. Gleeson's point.</p><p>  This is the first session we have had in which overtime has been referred to as an allowance, although the Chairman or the Clerk might correct me if I am wrong.  In every other session we have had, overtime was separate.  Yesterday afternoon, we dealt with local authority workers and their representatives made the point that in a recent Labour Court hearing covering their members, the judgment was that an allowance and overtime are completely separate.  They are different things.  However, we are having a discussion here in which overtime is part of the allowance umbrella.  </p> <p>Is there any reason for that or is it just a cultural issue as part of how it has been managed?</p></speech>

Whether that should be the case I do not know.  The bottom line is that it is another expenditure that must be catered for so I do not worry about where it sits.  People could be forgiven for looking at the Garda Vote and seeing overtime as discretionary but I assure the committee that is not the case.</p><p>  People forget that we are a security as well as a policing agency.  The shocking and appalling events of this morning, with the outrageous murder of a prison officer, Mr. David Black, in Northern Ireland, demonstrate there are people on the island of Ireland, on both sides, who do not conform with or subscribe to the democratic process.  It is important, therefore, that I have a fund available to me to allow my officers to operate, particularly along the Border and when dealing with the so called "dissident" IRA.  The new rostering arrangement, where there are greater numbers of people on the streets at the time of greatest demand, does not always cater for the unique sort of duty the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must fulfil.  Many of them were adverted to earlier, we have all sorts of public order issues - demonstrations at Shell to Sea, Shannon Airport and Occupy Dame Street, and animal rights and similar groups to police, over and above our normal complement.</p><p>  Add to that our international, European and national responsibilities in the context of State security and preventing attacks against this State and Northern Ireland.  We have been extremely busy on that front over a number of weeks, particularly in the last three months.  That is why when focusing on overtime, I must have that spend available to me over and above normal wages and salaries.  That is the real point I am making.</p></speech>

It is an interesting observation for the purpose of the work we are doing that an allowance within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can include overtime but for others we have had in, it is seen as something completely different.</p></speech>

If we did not have a moratorium on recruitment and took in X number of people, could we arrive at a day when overtime would not be an issue?  It is my vision that the force would not require overtime to provide a policing service.  Equally, if the overtime bill for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is &euro;220 million or &euro;10 million, 80% of that goes back into Government coffers, which must be recognised in the context of the overall spend.  I take the point and I said at the outset that there is a need for some of these allowances to be addressed in a different way.</p></speech>

There are allowances in recognition of someone doing a greater amount of work, allowances that are in fact expenses and allowances that are used to compensate people for very specific work.  I want to illustrate the second with the business case submitted to the committee.  Number 12, which refers to the plain clothes allowance, is entirely appropriate.  Where people go undercover or do work where they cannot wear their uniform, they should get an allowance for that.  This, however, is to cover an expense someone incurs in doing their work and that is quite different from some of the other allowances we have discussed here.  How is something like this paid?  Does it go into the weekly wage or is it paid at the end of the year?</p></speech>

When we had a reduction in pay, the rent allowance was reduced.  Rent is now inextricably linked in respect of the Conroy commission and Mr. Louden Ryan and thereafter the public service arbitrator made rent pensionable in 1982.  There is no question that it is part of pay but it stands alone which raises the questions being asked by the Deputy and others about its relationship to pay.  It is part of pay and it is mirrored in the Defence Forces with the military service allowance, which is almost akin to the rent allowance for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That was done to give members of the Defence Forces a pay increase under the guise of a military service allowance.</p></speech>

I agree and take it this means in some cases, such as policing or teaching, the critical and unique circumstances are lost.  I met some representatives from the INTO in my constituency office this morning and they were able to make some very good arguments for some of the allowances they receive currently.  On the comment made by Mr. Stone, regarding &euro;46,000 for someone who has served nine years, I read in a newspaper over the weekend that I was earning &euro;235,000.  This was interesting and echoes what Mr. Stone said. </p><p>We are looking at the whole scale of allowances and it is therefore very useful for us to deal with an organisation where the system of allowances is not over elaborate.  I compare it with the Department of Education and Skills, for example, where there are probably from 350 to 400 allowances which have built up over time and amount to a sum of over &euro;600 million.  I realise education is a huge area compared to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p> It is useful for us to figure out how allowances evolved.  I am a bit of an allowance geek or wonk and have some questions on this.  What is the Garda experience of the creation of allowances, from the point of view of both the union and management?  Have the witnesses been involved in the creation of an allowance within the organisation and can they give a specific example?  I am also interested in how it is determined an allowance becomes pensionable.  Perhaps the Commissioner will start with that.</p></speech>

However, I suppose this goes back to my earlier remarks regarding allowances and where they came from and from where they originated.  The gentlemen on my left, who represent the bulk of the active service operatives on the ground, would from time to time, having listened to their members, bring to the table issues around allowances and would feel it is legitimate for them to raise at the conciliation and arbitration table the issue of a particular allowance for a particular cadre of officers.

I do not want to pick out a particular claim because we are not here to negotiate, but in order to give a flavour of what happens, I will take the example of a claim for dog handlers.  I would present that position to the Department of Justice and a conciliation meeting would be called, where we present our case in respect of that group of people.  The arguments around that case are very simple, in that these people have the dog in their care 365 days a year.  They are responsible for that dog when they go on holidays, must bring that dog home and must feed that dog.  There are a number of issues involved there.  The case is set out and examined in minutiae by the Departments of Justice and Finance.  Then after long discussion the criteria for paying that allowance are agreed.

Stone" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2012110100011#K01000"><p>First, allowances are divided into either pay allowances or non-pay allowances.  Non-pay allowances do not increase with increases in pay, but pay allowances do.  Some pay allowances are pensionable, but others are no longer pensionable as a result of a recent decision by the Revenue Commissioners.  I will not go into that, because it relates to the issue of plain clothes, detective allowance etc.  Detective allowance, for example, is not a pensionable allowance.  It is a non-pay allowance, but it is taxable.  Normally, allowances which carried an element of taxation became pay allowances for the purposes of pension.  The decision on whether allowances are pensionable are a result of Labour Court decisions, not just as a result of the conciliation mechanism available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, this does not apply to the detective allowance, which though taxable is not pensionable.</p><p>  How the radio technician allowance became pensionable relates to the case we had to make.  The Department of Justice tried to civilianise the radio technician system and we had no difficulty with that.  We had a number of people employed and they were going to continue to be employed.  However, under the Minister of the day at the time there was an embargo on recruitment.  When the advertisement went out originally and the pay levels were presented, they were the same levels payable to members of the Garda, but there were no applicants.  Therefore, the allowance was introduced to sweeten the offer for civilians who at the time were probably being paid a lot better in the private sector.  That is how that allowance evolved.</p></speech>

However, I take it from the last paragraph of the Commissioner's statement that he believes many of these allowances should be subsumed into pay and that the system is probably not the best system, but that it evolved over time and should probably have been done a little differently.  That is my understanding from what I have heard so far.  There is no major issue on this side, generally speaking, with regard to allowances provided by the Garda.  It is a question of understanding how the organisation deals with the issue of allowances as an organisation.</p><p>  The Commissioner mentioned the issue of civilianisation in his opening remarks.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has been involved in this issue for some time and has noted the lack of progress on civilianisation within the force.  Currently, the ratio is 7:1, whereas in comparable police forces it would be about 4:1.  The reasons for the lack of progress include the fact the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is involved in security and the moratorium.  Are they the only reasons this has moved at such a slow pace over the years?  Is there not some other reason?</p></speech>

The inspectorate's report shows that at senior command level, perhaps two out seven recommendations have not yet been brought to fruition.  That said, work is in progress on bringing about those final two positions.  In the wider context, we have over 2,000 civilians now.  The employment control framework, ECF, level is 2,074 and we are at approximately 2,031.  The moratorium is hampering issues around civilianisation.  That said, I can point out that the Garda vetting unit, for example, in Thurles is very heavily populated with a civilian cadre.  Of the 80 personnel there, some 75 or so are civilians.  In more recent times, command and control, the radio system in Dublin which is based in Harcourt Square, has been hugely civilianised.  In the Garda information services centre, GISC, in Castlebar, we imported a number of staff from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine who at the time were being sent to different areas.  Many areas of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are now populated with civilian support.</p> <p>There is currently, under our transformation programme, an assistant commissioner working on the whole area of civilianisation, and work is at an advanced stage.  Typically, what we are trying to do with these reduced numbers and with the indication that the moratorium is likely to be here for some time yet, is to ensure that the skill set within the cadres of civilian members is in the right place at the right time.  In other words, we are trying to ensure there is an organisational fit with the individuals.  That is work that is long overdue within the organisation.  It is exceedingly difficult to go beyond the moratorium at present.  We would dearly love to be down around a ratio of 3:1, which is the international norm.</p></speech>

He spoke about the policing plan and its objectives and efficiencies and effectiveness in resource allocation and deployment so as to enhance the policing service.  He spoke about doing a lot more with less and making the organisation as efficient and productive as possible, as well as achieving organisational reform.  There are a lot of challenges in all of that.  The garda&iacute; have changed and the new rostering system has proven that the force can change effectively.  We are in a situation in which, as a nation, we are changing because we are in an economic crisis.  Every organisation and Department is in that frame right now.</p><p>  With the Chairman's indulgence, I raised an issue with the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, Mr. Brian Purcell, when he was here last week - namely, the proposed plan to close a large number of rural Garda stations.  It is important, if we go down this road, that this is presented carefully to the public, particularly to those living in rural areas who are used to having a Garda station in their communities.  As I said last week, when such people, having heard that their town councils, local banks and post offices would close, hear that their Garda station will also close, will be very concerned.  If the plan is to reorganise in order to effect better policing - and having spoken to the chief superintendent in my area, that seems to be the plan - then that must be presented very carefully and clearly to the public when the list of stations to close, which could be more than 80, is published.  This is not a criticism, but my experience of the force is that it is sometimes very focused.  It is no reflection on Mr. Callinan, but there have been times in the past when it has had tunnel vision in the sense that it sets out its goal and does not consider the peripheral issues that need to be explained to the public.  The force needs to be careful in how it presents this programme of closures.  Obviously, personal issues will change with regard to this plan coming into force but I ask Mr. Callinan to comment on my concern regarding how this is presented and explained to people, if it is a plan to make policing more effective, particularly in rural areas.</p></speech>

We are painfully conscious of all of the sensitivities around station closures.  Indeed, just last week we had the bi-annual commissioners' conference in Templemore, where I assembled all of my senior command, from chief superintendent up, sworn and non-sworn.  It was a two-day conference and the first day was largely occupied by the issue of station closures and the type of policing service that we could provide into the future when X number of stations would close.  The second day was spent dealing with the corporate strategy.  As members will know, we are obliged under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act to provide a three-year corporate strategy and within that, an annual policing plan that services each individual year of the strategy until it is completed.  Any change to a district, division or boundary of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must to be included in the annual policing plan and those plans and the corporate strategy are placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is the legal aspect of the issue.</p><p>  Implicit in all of the discussions is how policing will look into the future with reduced resources, both financial and human.  Obviously, we have given careful consideration to a number of stations that have closed already and the closures that will happen in the new year.  We have, from the centre, pushed out through the organisation, through the assistant commissioners, down through the chief superintendents, down to the ground, to involve as many stakeholders as possible in the discussion as to what stations might usefully be subsumed into the station closure programme.  That has filtered all the way back up and we are at an advanced stage of planning now.  I will be in a position in the coming weeks to provide the Minister with my recommendations with regard to closure.</p><p>  However, the points raised by the Deputy concerning the programme and the sensitivities that are involved were very much on our minds when we were discussing the topic over the last few days.  Central to it is communication both with the public and with our own organisation when we have established what stations are going to close.  Typically, we were discussing the type of service that will be available to communities in the areas where the stations will close and what that service will look like after closure.  The plan has always been to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the organisation and is not, as I have indicated previously, a cost-saving exercise for the State, although there will obviously be savings.  I am on the record as indicating that somewhere between &euro;2,500 and &euro;4,000 would be a typical maintenance bill for stations, so that money will be saved.  However, in the overall context, it is not about savings but about providing a blueprint for future policing.  That is what we are aiming for and I am absolutely subscribed, to the last scintilla, to the points raised by the Deputy regarding communication.  However, before we get there we must establish which stations it may be appropriate to close.</p><p>  A lot of this work is running in tandem with the new rostering arrangements and undoubtedly there will be a requirement to cluster some resources in order to provide the service.  I was clear in saying to my officers that I did not want a situation to arise in which, if a particular Garda station was generally open in a particular area for a particular number of hours in a week, we would not match that service in that area at those times.  Then, beyond that, we must have a clear and succinct policing plan to follow the various trends, particularly in the area of crime, and meet the challenge of reducing crime in those areas.  Communication is very much a part of our programme.</p></speech>

When an announcement such as the closure of a Garda station is made it increases their uncertainty, and the normal route or standard of communication will not be adequate in this situation.</p> <p>That is why there should be an additional level of communication, double what we are used to, to inform people about what is going on.  It should focus on letting people know and explaining to them that the garda who was in their rural station will be utilised better for the community.  There should be a heightened sense of communication.  That is the critical issue.  I go along with some of the sentiments of some of the senior garda&iacute; to whom I have spoken.  They have suggested many garda&iacute; stationed in rural stations could be utilised better, but how that will take effect must be explained.</p></speech>

I have had a quick look at the allowances.  If I am correct, a total of 108 are listed, but it appears that in the order of 50 are live.  In the case of 38, nothing was paid; 15 people received one allowance, three received two allowances and four received three allowances.  A balance of 50 allowances are relevant to all.  Mr. Stone referenced approximately 34 for rank and file garda&iacute;.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

One thing that has come up often is that in many cases the descriptions have been in place for years.  The bulk of the allowances appear to date back some time.  Some date from 1926, while many date from 1970.  Are some of the allowances for the reimbursement of expenses as distinct from being allowances?  Will the Commissioner provide a quick flavour of the position?</p></speech>

These are legitimate claims brought to the table.  They are well debated and, as articulated, a recommendation is made to me for sanction to bring them into effect.  That is not to say that from time to time there will be a claim for a legitimate expense, but, generally, there is no crossover between the allowances and a claim for expenses.</p></speech>

I offer one case in point.  One must reach a particular level of expertise and be regarded as an expert witness before the courts to be a scene of crime examiner.  In some instances members undertake the training themselves.  This can be proved and it has been shown in the cases we have made to the council that garda&iacute; have expended their own money to bring themselves up to the level of competency required.  Equally, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has provided specific training to ensure the level of training they receive is also within the parameters of the law.  In a general way we make the case that the allowances payable are, in one sense, for the reimbursement of money they have spent, but it is not something reimbursed in the longer term.</p></speech>

Some five allowances account for a total of 86% of all allowance costs.  Mr. Stone made reference to the boot allowance, but I am not including it.  The rent allowance, the night duty allowance, the Saturday allowance, the Sunday allowance and the public holiday allowance combined appear to account for almost 86% of all allowance costs.  This is a common thread throughout all the groups that have appeared before us.  A small number of allowances account for a high concentration of allowance costs.  Clearly, these are core pay.  That is the point, although we are repeating ourselves somewhat.  It is welcome that we have management and staff representatives present today and I hope this will continue to be the case.  It seems to have evolved everywhere.  There is a vast amount of allowances, but a small number of recipients for relatively small amounts of money.  There is a need for dialogue to reorganise the allowances applied, a matter to which Mr. Stone made reference.  The Commissioner made reference to making the Garda more fit for purpose as a modern police force.  Will he be examining that aspect?</p></speech>

We spoke about the uniqueness of the job done by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Within the range of allowances, we are discussing nuances that do not lend themselves to universal application.  We have made this point already.  One must be careful not to arrive at a situation where one over-subscribes one rank against another.  We discussed the issue of inspectors and the fact that 36.7% of their gross wage was made up of allowances.  If it was to be ordained in the morning that the cadre of allowances to which Deputy O'Donnell is referring should be subsumed into pay, one could easily arrive at a situation where one would have an inspector on a higher salary than an superintendent.  One could see attendant difficulties in that case.  The matter requires careful consideration, but I would not go beyond that.</p></speech>

Bringing these allowances into core pay could have the effect of increasing pay levels throughout the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and garda&iacute; would be paid for not having to work unsocial hours.  The Commissioner must examine this issue in the sense that one must be able to put garda&iacute; out to work tonight from 9 p.m. to 7 a.m.  If everyone was on the same level of pay, one might not have the same warmth for such a tour of duty.  That is probably one of the principal reasons, no more than in any other occupation, a shift allowance is paid.  It compensates for the terrible hours worked outside the norm.  It is not as easy to subsume them into pay as one might imagine at the outset.</p></speech>

There is great respect for the Garda and generally this is an issue that comes up.  Will the Commissioner give us a flavour of the new rostering system and how it fits into the issue of allowances?  What are the costs of policing?  Will the Commissioner provide an overall flavour of what it means for policing for the ordinary person?</p></speech>

Foremost in our minds in these negotiations was the need, given the economic circumstances in which we find ourselves, to devise a cost neutral roster.  The essential difference under the new arrangement is that we have five working units rather than four.  The benefit in this for the public is that it provides for greater policing visibility, with up to 25% more personnel on the street where that is a requirement at particular times.  It is a very useful and valuable development.</p><p>  The new arrangement does, of course, present its own challenges for the organisation.  We are required under the European working time directive to ensure a social or life versus work balance.  As part of this, compensatory rest periods must be provided for within the system, which requires careful management.  It is a very useful programme of engagement for all our officers, particularly for the ranks represented here.  I am confident that it will complement what we are seeking to do in the future in terms of downsizing the organisation and operating without the types of financial and human resources previously available.  We are working through a number of industrial relations issues with our colleagues in an effort to reach accommodations.  The new system is not particularly easy, but it is in place and functioning.  I have spoken to members throughout the country, all of whom are very happy in principle with the arrangement now in place.  There are, however, issues that must be worked out by management in terms of the governance of the organisation.  The policing footprint for the future will be determined by the success of this new working arrangement.</p></speech>

There is a particular issue that is of concern to us, relating to attendance at courts.  It is an issue that is outside our control, as, no doubt, it is also outside the control of the committee.  The difficulty arises when members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who, for example, finish work at 7 a.m. have to hang around, because they have long distances to commute, before they go to court with a remand prisoner.  It is unacceptable, in this day and age, that there are no night courts, which would do away with the need to pay staff overtime to attend court sittings during the day.  However, we have no control over this matter.  It is an issue that must be addressed as a matter of urgency in order that garda&iacute; can finish work in the morning, go home and spend time with their families and get the rest they require.  The idea that they should have to stay on their feet for another three hours, for which they are not paid, is nonsensical.  This is a different argument, however, and the one bugbear I have regarding the new rostering arrangement.  The courts are a law unto themselves, but this issue must be addressed in the context of policing.</p></speech>

It is a pilot arrangement and has been in operation since the end of April.  It has one year to run, during which time it will be evaluated and feedback will be taken from members of all ranks.  In general, the feedback thus far has been positive, but there are some aspects which need to be addressed.  I am sure more issues will emerge as time passes, but it is probably a case of tweaking rather than a requirement for any major change.  All of this will become apparent as the months go on.  It is very important from our members' point of view that for the first time ever, the European working time directive is in operation within the Garda organisation.  The new arrangement will ensure members who have worked very hard and for extended periods will have adequate time to rest before resuming their duties.  As far as we are concerned, the new arrangement is mostly positive and we are delighted to have been involved in negotiating it under the auspices of the Croke Park agreement.</p></speech>

That is not clear from the documentation.  I thank Mr. Callinan for clarifying the position.</p><p>  Not unlike other entities which have been before the committee, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is suffering to some extent on foot of the fact that these allowances developed in an <i>ad hoc</i> way.  Mr. Stone made his organisation's position very clear, particularly in respect of the rent allowance and the fact that this forms part of core pay.  The parallel he drew with the Defence Forces in this regard was extremely accurate.  When the bicycle allowance was discussed earlier, it brought to mind Flann O'Brien's novel <i>The Third Policeman</i>.  I do not know if the Commissioner has read that book.  There is a consensus view among those on the opposite side of the table that what is needed is some form of consolidation in respect of the pay system.  The Minister has indicated that such a consolidation will be worked towards.  Has the Minister engaged in discussions with the Commissioner in respect of timeframe relating to the process of bringing rent allowance and other allowances within the umbrella of core pay?</p></speech>

There are different categories in respect of existing allowances and allowances for people who will come into the organisation in the future.  I am sure that is a debate which is going to continue for quite some time.</p></speech>

However, I have already explained the huge difficulty that would arise in trying to consolidate some of the others.  There would be inequality in trying to reach a universal threshold within some of the allowances.  For particular ranks there would be particular inequalities.  That has already been articulated by Mr. Stone.</p></speech>

Of course, they would be in a position of financial disadvantage if certain allowances were not available to them.  That is a given.  The Government has not provided any indication that recruitment will take place in the foreseeable future.  So the matter simply has not arisen.  Templemore is very much open for business and there are a number of courses ongoing at the facility.  Just last week representatives from the European Police College, CEPOL, were in Templemore to take part in a course.</p> <p>A number of courses feature regularly such as firearms, driving, and continuous professional development.  Courses of that nature are a continuum in the college, albeit at a reduced capacity.  None the less, the lights are on and we are open for business.</p></speech>

There comes a point when that argument runs out of rope because there is a stage at which not alone can one not do more with less but one cannot even do the necessities.  Therefore, recruitment will be re-opened at some stage.  Would it pose an operational difficulty for the Commissioner if he were to have a differentiation between current serving garda&iacute; and new recruits in respect of the kind of pay and allowances to which they are entitled?  Would it present a difficulty in terms of management or morale?</p></speech>

If that turns out to be the position, there may or may not be difficulties.  It is something that would have to be managed within that parameter.  I would be confident if recruitment were to open up tomorrow morning that people would batter down the gates to get in, regardless of the conditions.  None of us knows, but if it is the case that people are operating on different pay scales that is something for management to deal with at a given time.  I could not go beyond that.</p></speech>

The matter has been approached badly in terms of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the sense that one will create major difficulties when one brings in new recruits.  Whatever about keeping them on a pay level for a certain period, if one does not bring them into the fold, one will create major difficulties and relativities because in respect of the new pay arrangements, people will be choking each other to get promoted because, once they are promoted they go onto the scale of serving sergeants or inspectors.  This has been very badly thought out.  One could, perhaps, understand brand new scales being introduced to start on a particular day in order that people would know what they were buying into, right up to the rank of Commissioner, but the way the system has been approached is mistaken.  The big problem is that there was a lack of understanding about the fact that in some other sections of the public sector, people move onto different grades and therefore the pay scales take care of themselves.  In respect of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the young men and women who should be recruited immediately to provide a policing service must be treated with fairness and equity.  If that is allowed to proceed, while people might break down the door to get recruited, they will not be long in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when there will be levels of dissatisfaction that will be difficult to contain.  Now is the time to get it right before another forum such as this has to return in ten or 15 years time to address a major problem.</p></speech>

Such a division has opened up between incumbents and new entrants in terms of the new pension regime for the public sector.  It creates precisely the kind of difficulty Mr. Stone has just described.  For those charged not just with managing the force but building morale, and in particular in the kind of climate in which the Garda currently operates, it is most undesirable and unhelpful to have such a differential opening up.  I hope that in the privacy of his discussions with the Minister the Commissioner will consider asserting that point because it is entirely lost on the Minister.</p><p>  I was struck by Mr. Redmond&rsquo;s initial commentary where he said that the pay cuts for members have been of the magnitude of 20%.  I raise the matter because the figure commonly asserted in respect of pay in the public service is 14%.  Could he elaborate on the figure of 20% and how he arrived at it?</p></speech>

The cut is in the region of 20%.  First, let us take the 6% that was to be paid as a result of the Towards 2016 agreement that was not paid and will not be paid.  That is a fact.  That is 6%.  The general pay cut was 7%.  The pay allowances cut was 5%.  Subsidies and travel in the organisation have been cut by 25%.  The pension related deduction is now 10.25%.  The universal social charge is 5%.  I again refer to the unpaid pay increase of 6%.  The cuts are all different.  As percentages go they add up to far more than 20%, but they are not all pay cuts.  In the round it is between 20% and 25% of a pay cut that we have experienced overall.</p></speech>

At a senior level there was a slight difference in the way the cut was arrived at, but that is a different matter.  Those of us at sergeant or inspector level took those cuts in pay and associated allowances.</p></speech>

I do not know if you will allow the question, Chairman, but I will chance it.  In the discussion around the rationalisation of Garda stations, the Commissioner made the point forcefully that it is not a cost-cutting initiative and that it is about reconfiguring the policing footprint, or words to that effect.  From the point of view of the public it is and will be commonly understood as a fairly crude cost-cutting measure.  It will affect the confidence of communities who take heart from the fact that not only does the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na exist but that it is close at hand in an identifiable location.  The Commissioner has set out his position.  I would like to hear what Mr. Stone and Mr. Redmond make of the initiative to rationalise and close Garda stations.</p></speech>

We are very clear in our policy on the matter.  We feel it is a retrograde step and it will come back to haunt us.  The manner in which the matter has been taken on board should be examined in the context of an overall policing plan.  The Garda Commissioner is charged with the responsibility of running the force; I am not.  If I were, however, I would not close Garda stations.  I have said that on public record.</p></speech>

People expect a police service to be provided and are entitled to one.  It is important they are consulted.</p> <p>Their views and questions on how their neighbourhoods and communities will be policed ought to be taken on board following any proposed closures of stations.  As was pointed out, rightly, by the Commissioner, the savings are not excessive so there will not be a bag of money at the end of this process for anyone.  This is especially the case when, instead of maintaining a Garda station somewhere, another arrangement will be put in place whereby a community hall or other venue will be used to provide the service that would otherwise have been provided through the Garda station.  I have yet to be convinced that the aspects of the plan will work such that the community will be policed in the manner it deserves.  As representatives of first-line supervisors and first-line managers, we look forward to being informed and asked our opinion on the likely impact on our members.  I look forward to having those discussions in due course.</p></speech>

The call to formulate plans regarding the stations prioritised for closure went out from the centre, that is, my office, to the various assistant commissioners and chief superintendents, and it filtered down to the divisions and districts.  Information subsequently came all the way back up.  Following that, we began the process of examining the footprint in each of the stations.  A range of products came into play in the context of the consideration of the closure of the stations.</p><p>  The point must be made, however, that this is a matter of managing with very limited funding.  It is about managing resources to the optimum.  Garda stations are buildings.  If the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are not doing in a very proactive manner the type of work they are supposed to be doing, we will not have the types of efficiencies and effectiveness I spoke about.  I am not for a moment diminishing the perception and reality represented in the various communities.  Of course, we are alive to the sensitivities of all the communities in terms of the closure of Garda stations in the context of closures of post offices, banks, and so on.  This is a matter of putting in place a policing model that will replicate the system that obtained previously and which will, I hope, go beyond that.  It is question of smart, intelligence-led policing that will grapple with the types of problems that exist.  In a considerable number of the stations we are examining, there was no presence greater than one or two hours per week.  That reflects reality, I am afraid.  One must park this against the perception of taking down the Garda sign on the wall and what this represents for the community.</p><p>  One of the Deputies raised the issue of elderly people and the fear of crime.  Of course, communication is vital, and that is why the substantive portion of the discussion we had during the week was on those very subjects and how we, as managers, would formulate plans to compensate for the closure of the stations such that we can provide the type of service we are espousing at the point of closure.</p><p>  The rest of the discussion, which will be when we have our stall set out, will involve engaging with our colleagues in the associations and the wider community to ensure there is a loud and clear message that we will provide the same service or a better one to the affected communities.  That is a given.  It would be foolish to embark on a course of action resulting, intentionally or otherwise, in the failure to provide a service of the type that already exists.  It would be folly.  As a consequence of all the closures, there will be a cost saving.  I have indicated the type of variation that might obtain.</p></speech>

There will be a requirement on us to engage more smartly in our approach to policing and policing plans.  It is a question of intelligence-led policing.  I understand the fears that exist in communities and the concerns of colleagues and their representatives who are present today.  However, we must engage with reality, unfortunately.  We must put our best foot forward and operate according to the model of intelligence-led and smart policing that will produce the best results.  If this means having a cadre of people available to be out on patrol to tackle those who are committing crimes rather than having one person in a police station for a couple of hours on his or her own, it must be examined.  We need to have a cadre of people available to tackle criminals.  We need a very smart plan in place to deal with the issues that arise locally and nationally as we move the process forward.</p></speech>

Do many members of the force have to use their own cars and telephones?  What is the position on mobile telephones?  Perhaps I am wrong but I often assume garda&iacute; use their own private telephones in the course of their duties.  While I realise there are unmarked cars, which I will not describe and whose drivers might be confused with joyriders on occasion, I am under the impression that garda&iacute; must use their own cars sometimes.  In the context of allowances, what is the arrangement?  Is there an allowance for using one's own car?  Must one write down every single use of a car?  Can the delegates talk about this and the mobile telephone issue?</p></speech>

There are occasions when people would apply to the authorities to use their car on duty.  I will not discuss the operational reasons.  Generally speaking, these cases are the exception rather than the rule.  We will have heard a lot of talk and speculation in the media about the fleet and the unavailability of cars, and so on, but it is important to point out the position on vehicles.  I acknowledge and thank the Government, including the Minister, for providing me with &euro;3 million to purchase 171 vehicles this year.  They will be available very early next year to assist in what is certainly becoming a difficult fleet to manage given the age profile.</p> <p>That said, we have had 37 cars brought on stream in May in addition to the 171, so one is looking at 208 vehicles in the past 12 months.  That is something for which I am very grateful in the context of the economic climate in which we find ourselves.  It will go some way towards assisting in managing an ageing fleet.  The fleet is something which must be worked on year on year or else it will be quickly depleted.  We have been managing over the last couple of years to get vehicles, albeit in small numbers, but we have still managed to get those and we are very grateful for that.  I am working hard with the Minister and the Department to try to provide a funding stream into the future to replace some of the other vehicles, so there are works in progress.  There are certainly challenges for Garda management in providing transport for some of the operations for which we would like to provide transport.  That said, we have not yet reached the point where vehicles have become such an issue that we are unable to conduct our business very efficiently.  If one looks at the crime statistics right across the board, they are showing a reduction at all levels.</p></speech>

That has facilities for contacting the Garda information system, for example.  It also provides a secure network for communicating with colleagues.  Indeed, it has proven to be very useful in the past when members were under attack because there is an alarm button on it.</p><p>  However, people have used mobile telephones of their own choice.  Before we came to the full roll-out of the Tetra radio system, there may have been times when members might have been using their own telephones.  However, that is a personal choice for members.</p></speech>

In fact, we have more than enough, I am afraid.  It is something that is a matter in progress at the moment.  We are discussing with Government colleagues the need to reduce the number of radios.  As the Deputy is aware, the Tetra system provided for the blue light service, so the ambulance and fire brigade are catered for within that cadre.  Given the levels at which we are now operating, we certainly do not need that number of radios.  There is a cost involved, which we are trying to reduce.</p></speech>

I am not aware of any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who does not have an official mobile telephone supplied to him or her, who does not use their own mobile telephone on a regular and almost daily basis.  Because of the nature of policing and because most members are not issued with official mobile telephones, sending someone to a sensitive or confidential call necessitates mobile telephone usage.  People back at the stations, especially our members and those at the scene of serious and sensitive incidents, regularly use their mobile telephones privately.</p></speech>

They may have been told and have been instructed in the past not to use their own telephones and private equipment.  However, the job we do necessitates private and confidential telephone conversations.  To avoid blocking up the radio system, unfortunately, requires people to use their mobile telephones.</p></speech>

They may want to leave their radio free in case someone is calling on the radio for something else because when one is on the telephone, one is not on the radio.  One can only use it for one function at a time, but members regularly use their mobile telephones.</p><p>  As regards private cars, members, especially of inspector rank, use their private cars regularly.  We spoke earlier about the locomotion allowance, but members are obliged to supply themselves with a good private car in order that they can attend the scenes of serious incidents.</p></speech>

Quite a considerable number of mobile telephones, at a not inconsiderable cost, are issued to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na members who require them or to people whom management has indicated to us require them.  After that, there is a secure Tetra radio system.  For many years we have been complaining that we did not have such system, but we now have that.  Within that regime there is a back-to-back facility.  There are all sorts of ways of one colleague communicating with another without having to worry about whether one is interrupting a minor or major operation.  I therefore fundamentally disagree with my colleague on that issue.  People may very well be using their own private mobile telephones, but if they are, it is by their own choice.  As an organisation, we provide the appropriate equipment to members on the ground to have secure communication with one another.  As I have said, we are spending &euro;40 million every year to ensure that type of secure radio is in existence.</p></speech>

We will move on, as this is moving into the issue of technology.  While I note there are some old-fashioned allowances, such as bicycle allowance, boot allowance and so on, I refer to the level of training.  Is there an allowance for training?  As many garda&iacute; are not children, they cannot be well up on services such as Facebook and Twitter.  What level of training is provided within each division?  As everyone is aware, every time an incident takes place nowadays, it appears on Facebook and Twitter.  However, because of their age profile - I note they are not teenagers - most garda&iacute; are not fully tuned in and would not have a clue, no more than would many adults.  I am conscious of the importance of being forward-looking in this regard and wish to ascertain the level of training.  Is there an allowance to train people at divisional level?  While I acknowledge that someone, somewhere within the ranks of the Garda must be monitoring Facebook and Twitter, people should be trained in this respect down at divisional level.  Facebook and Twitter are as relevant to many people for the purposes of communication as are their mobile telephones.  The Commissioner might comment on this point because I believe the vast bulk of Garda members would not be tuned into it.  While that probably is a fair comment, I may be wrong and, if so, someone will tell me.  However, this is an impression.</p></speech>

The first point to make is that with social media and the way they are going, there certainly is a requirement to be skilled up in this area.  We have a computer crime investigation unit based in Harcourt Square, which monitors sites, reviews our social media policy and generally provides advice to our members and to communities.  We are working very hard with our colleagues in UCD to provide a greater skill-set base and knowledge in and around this entire area.  However, it is a vast subject and the idea of training up all the general membership to such a degree that they would be able to interrogate systems-----</p></speech>

The difficulty, for both law enforcement and the industry, is how to stop it.  What sort of sanctions does one impose?  What sort of legislation is required?

I will move to the subject of juvenile liaison officers, JLOs.  I note the Garda has 118 JLOs, who are paid a modest allowance of &euro;30 per week.  Given that JLOs probably deal with teenagers up to the age of 18 or whatever, I note that much crime begins at that age, before people move on to their 20s.  I presume that more crimes are committed by younger people than by older people.  Consequently, as an observation, I would have thought the Garda could do with more JLOs.  There are more people in receipt of a Gaeltacht allowance than a JLO allowance and I am sure there are more younger people committing crimes than there are people so doing within the Gaeltacht.  Consequently, I believe the numbers in this regard could be stepped up.</p><p>  I refer to the well-discussed issue of the closure of Garda stations.  I represent a rural constituency and am on the front line in respect of this issue.  However, I am as much concerned about the reduction in opening hours of Garda stations that heretofore were open on a 24-hour basis.  For example, Abbeyleix station was a district headquarters and formerly operated on a 24-hour basis.  Were its opening hours reduced to a nine-to-five basis or something similar, that would have a far greater negative impact on a wide area than would cutting further the hours of a station that only was open for a few hours each week.  As losing 24-hour cover has a greater impact, does the forthcoming plan envisage that many stations will lose their 24-hour cover?  I acknowledge that people break into houses during the day and so on but most crimes about which people are worried, in the sense of security, probably are committed during the evening and the night-time.  I consider 24-hour cover in Garda stations potentially to be a major issue.</p></speech>

This is about 24-seven policing.  While Garda stations are important in the entire regime of things, it really is about how we, as policemen and women, react to the service we need to provide.  There have been a number of gangland shootings recently and I will be appearing before the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality in a couple of weeks' time to discuss that subject.  However, there have been recent cases in which people were shot at 8 a.m. or 9 a.m.  Consequently, it really is about providing a 24-hour service.  I am afraid I cannot go into numbers-----</p></speech>

No. 13, which is the plain-clothes allowance for the poor Garda sergeant is &euro;11.60 per week, which amounts to &euro;603 per year.  However, in the case of No. 45, the plain-clothes allowance for the inspector, he or she gets &euro;13.22 per week, which is &euro;687 per year.  Inspectors get an additional &euro;80 and therefore must be expected to dress better when in plain clothes.</p></speech>

In other words, they get &euro;160 more per year than does the poor lad who is out chasing the lads at all hours of the night.

I simply am making the observation.  This issue also arose in yesterday's meeting in respect of local authorities, whereby different mileage rates applied depending on one's grade in the local authority, even though one still was driving the same car at the same cost.</p> <p>If a member is paid an allowance for wearing plain clothes, it is small money, but perhaps there should be a similar allowance for all members.  It should not be based on salary.   I do not know, but perhaps they have to wear better suits on official occasions.</p></speech>

The taxpayer is providing approximately &euro;636 million in overseas development aid each year, much of which is well spent, but in the past few days it has emerged that &euro;4 million intended to assist people in Uganda ended up in a government account there, which raises significant questions.  We should reopen discussion on Vote 29 on international co-operation and ask the chief executive officer of Irish Aid and the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to come before the committee for a special meeting to scrutinise how the moneys in the Vote are spent and check what safeguards are in place.  A number of questions, some of which were raised in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, are more relevant and topical now than when the committee examined the Vote.  There are also new questions about aid provided by the Government through NGOs versus bilateral aid, the checks and balances in place and learning from international best practice.  If the taxpayer is to be asked to continue to allocate such a large sum abroad - we have always been a generous nation - we need to know the money is going to the places the taxpayer intends it to go.</p></speech>

Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Before I invite Mr. Boucher to begin his presentation, is it agreed that the witnesses' presentation will be published?  Agreed.  That said, I thank Mr. Boucher, Mr. McLoughlin and Ms Carragher for their attendance this morning.  I invite Mr. Boucher to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-01a.332" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richie Boucher" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2012110100003#B00200"><p>I thank members for the opportunity to update the joint committee on Bank of Ireland's progress since we last met.  I am accompanied by my colleagues, Liam McLoughlin and Lynda Carragher.  We have provided the joint committee with a presentation in advance, which hopefully provides a reasonably comprehensive picture of our position.  The bank is a public company that is subject to the listing rules of the Irish, London and New York stock exchanges.  The presentation is a public document and is presented under the rules of the aforementioned stock exchanges.  All comments I make are governed by the stock exchange disclosure rules.  As the Chairman has suggested we keep this relatively brief, if it is acceptable to members, I would like to go through the presentation relatively quickly.  Clearly, however, if I have skipped or have not paused for long enough on any particular part of it, I am sure that will come up in our questions and answers session.</p><p>  I will turn to slide four of our presentation, which sets out, from Bank of Ireland's perspective, its strategic goals.  It is important to bear in mind that the bank raised a significant amount of capital in 2011.  Virtually all this equity capital came from the private sector and was provided by investors who believe that the Irish economy is recovering and that Bank of Ireland can support and benefit from that recovery.  The investors' investment case is that Bank of Ireland can become the pre-eminent bank in Ireland and they have provided the capital and endorsed the use of the bank's funding and infrastructure in support of this goal.  We in Bank of Ireland believe this is a time of both challenge and opportunity.  We believe that if we are the most focused bank, if we engage heavily with and work with our customers and if we derive new lines of business in our franchises, then we can establish ourselves as the pre-eminent bank in Ireland.  We are extremely well positioned in our core markets.  We have had agreed a European Union restructuring and viability plan and are the only Irish bank that has had such a plan agreed.  Under that plan, it is clear what businesses we have exited and what businesses we are in.  In accordance with the plan, those businesses that we are in, and in particular our Irish franchise, are those businesses to which we can devote capital and funding.  It clearly is one of our key goals to be strongly capitalised, thereby reducing our reliance on monetary authority and Government guarantees.  At 30 June 2012, our core tier 1 capital was 14%, which is a very strong capital ratio well in excess of any regulatory requirements.  Over the period since 2009, we have generated equity capital of &euro;10 billion, of which approximately &euro;1.5 billion net has come from the State.  We must ensure that, in the future, our businesses are sustainable and, in particular, sustainable from a funding proposition.  Over the past three years, we have worked very hard to grow our customer deposit franchises.  Our deposit franchise in Ireland has proved to be highly resilient and, in particular, we have grown a retail deposit franchise in the United Kingdom, primarily through our relationship with the United Kingdom's Post Office.</p><p>  Over the past three years, we have continued to reduce our cost base and costs are down by approximately 20%.  The stock market is expecting our costs to be approximately &euro;1.5 billion within the next couple of years and we believe this to be a sustainable target.  We are in the middle of a redundancy programme within our business and have taken a &euro;66 million charge in the first half of the year, which we expect to have been utilised by the year-end.  At the same time, we are continuing to invest in our businesses because we wish to ensure we are here for the long haul and it is not just about cost-cutting.  Therefore, we are investing heavily in payment systems and in branch networks in Ireland and in other parts of our franchises.  From our perspective, the raising of capital, restructuring and deleveraging our balance sheets and reducing our costs will not achieve our goals unless we grow revenue.  It is extremely important that we grow revenue as we cannot cut or restructure our way to glory.  In simple terms, the way in which we grow our revenue is to sell more products to our existing customers and to get new customers.  This is a key focus in those core franchises we have decided we are in and which have been endorsed under our European Union plan.  The Irish taxpayer has taken a considerable risk in supporting Bank of Ireland and has provided investments to Bank of Ireland.  Clearly, as an investor, it is our absolute goal that we reduce the Irish taxpayer from any support provided to Bank of Ireland, we reward any taxpayers' investment in Bank of Ireland and, ultimately, we repay the investment in Bank of Ireland.  As a public company, my colleagues and I work for our stockholders and our job is to ensure we have a sustainable business into the long term with good sustainable returns for those who have provided us with capital.</p><p>  As for the restructuring of the balance sheet shown on slide five, we have achieved our business sale targets.  We were required to sell &euro;10 billion of loans and we have sold those well within the discounts assumed for the prudential capital assessment review, PCAR, 2011 exercise and well ahead of the schedule that was set therein.  A total of 50% of our assets are outside of Ireland and our deleveraging initiatives are all outside of our Irish businesses.  I have touched on our deposits franchises, which have remained very strong and resilient.  Based on both the deleveraging and the deposit, at 30 June our loan-to-deposit ratio, which is a key target, was 136% and based on developments since that period, our loan-to-deposit ratio will have reduced further.  As I mentioned, our capital ratios remain strong.  Our market positions in our Irish and United Kingdom franchises are strengthening.  In particular, in July 2012 we signed an extension of our very important franchise with the United Kingdom Post Office, which extends our contract with the Post Office beyond 2023.  A total of 21 million people per week visit a post office in the United Kingdom and we are the chosen financial services provider.</p><p>  Turning to slide six, I mentioned that we continue to work on our cost programmes.  We have a redundancy charge, which we took in the first half of the year and, as I mentioned, I believe this charge will be fully utilised.  From the bank's perspective, the repayment period and payback on a redundancy charge of that note is approximately 11 months.  As I mentioned, we continue to invest strongly in our core franchise and in particular in payment systems.  The key task we have is rebuilding the profitability of the bank.  We believe we have made significant progress in capital raising, in deleveraging and in our cost initiatives but, ultimately, our route to profitability to repay taxpayers' investment and to provide a return to our other shareholders is through increasing the profitability of the bank and that is our focus in the future.  On slide seven, we explain in particular our balance sheet targets and as I have just advised, I believe we are well on the way to progress in that regard.  The rebuilding profitability targets are more influenced in particular by interest rates, economic growth and the self-help initiatives we are undertaking.</p><p>  Slide eight demonstrates the pressure under which our income has been in the first half of the year and the initiatives we are taking as a bank to try to enhance our operating profits.  The most important focus for us is to reduce the cost of raw material.  The cost of raw material to the bank is influenced by the cost of wholesale funding, by deposit pay rates in the markets and in the Irish market in particular, as well as in the cost to us of the Government eligible liabilities guarantee, ELG, guarantee.  We are taking a number of initiatives to reduce that cost of raw material.  Slide nine shows the breakdown of our portfolios, both between the different business segments and on a geographic basis.  Approximately 54% of the group's balance sheet is in mortgages, of which approximately half are in the Republic of Ireland and half in the United Kingdom.  The rest of our business is spread between Ireland, the United States and the rest of the world.  It is likely, in accordance with our strategic plan, that the proportion of our balance sheet in Ireland will increase and the proportion of our balance sheet outside Ireland will reduce, which is in line with our deleveraging plans.  Slide 11 demonstrates the impact that low interest rates, which are not reflected in the cost of money to the bank, are having on our net interest margin.  Our net interest margin reduced from the second half of 2011 to the first half of 2012.  We are taking a range of initiatives to try to address this and to improve our net interest margin.</p> <p>We anticipate that that margin will gradually start to improve.</p><p> Slide 12 deals with our costs, which I have already touched upon, but I am obviously happy to discuss that in more detail.</p><p> Slide 13 looks at our provisions and impairment charges in the first half of 2012 compared to the first half of 2011.  It demonstrates where the provisions are taken between our different loan books.  We provide significant further detail in our interim accounts.  Based on the trajectory of what we anticipate and if the economic environment, both in Ireland and the UK, continues at its current pace, we believe our loan loss charges will reduce further in the second half of 2012.  Key influences on our loan loss charges are commercial real estate in the Republic of Ireland and our Irish mortgages.  As regards the Bank of Ireland commercial real estate book, we have estimated for our provisions a peak-to-trough fall in commercial real estate prices in Ireland of 65%.  We see evidence of the market stabilising at that level.  </p><p> At the interim results announcement in August, I advised the market that from Bank of Ireland's perspective the pace of increase in the formation of arrears in our Irish mortgage book was reducing and that continues to be the case.  </p><p> Our assumptions for our loan loss provisions are based on a peak-to-trough fall in house prices in Ireland of 55% and then another 10% on top of that for sale costs, etc.  From our perception, the market appears to be stabilising at current levels.  Obviously the market is a mix of a number of different micro-markets, but our experience in the main urban areas - both in terms of our own existing book and the flow of new business - is that house prices seem to be stabilising at current levels.</p><p> Slide 15 demonstrates the mix of our deposits, in particular between Ireland and the UK.  The rationale is that we can fund our UK business through retail deposits and therefore it is a sustainable business going forward.  Our deposit target of &euro;75 billion to &euro;80 billion by December 2014, based on our experience in the period up to 30 June and since, looks eminently achievable.</p><p> I will now turn to slides 17 to 20, which deal with the two aspects of our business upon which there was a particular focus in the committee's invitation.  We have tried to demonstrate in pictorial form how we see our different tasks and initiatives.  One of our most important tasks is continuing to provide new mortgages in the market.  That is because it is a sustainable part of our business going forward.  We strongly believe in Ireland and that the Irish economy will recover.  We were provided with capital liquidity by our investors to support that recovery and to benefit from it.</p><p> In the first half of 2012, mortgage demand remained relatively muted in the economy.  We did about 40% of the flow of business in that economy and we have been heavily advertising our products and services.  In the period since, we have seen a noted pick-up in mortgage demand and activity in September and October.  We have come out with a wide range of new products and services, both for existing customers and to deal with customers who are facing financial challenges.  We have a significant number of staff involved in working on short-term and long-term solutions for customers.  We have more than 16,000 customers who are currently subject to mortgage forbearance or who have had their mortgages restructured.  Our mortgage forbearance and mortgage restructures are based on customers who can meet, in our estimation and theirs, at least the full interest on their mortgages.  Some 86% of those customers who are subject to forbearance or restructuring are fully meeting the revised arrangements.  While it is early days yet, we believe that our restructuring approach is benefiting a significant number of our customers, which is evidenced by the low level of re-default.  </p><p> We could probably spend a little more time on the SME sector.  A key part of our future business strategy is to be the pre-eminent bank in Ireland.  We are currently number two in business banking in Ireland, and it is our goal to be the number one bank.  A particular focus we have is on the SME sector, where we are number two.  We have a wide range and are a universal bank.  We have a distribution system in every part of Ireland, primarily through our branch network, which tries to reach out to our customers.  We have an internal target, which is also a target agreed with the Government, that we will provide &euro;3.5 billion of new lending to the SME sector.  From a Bank of Ireland perspective, we measure this target on the basis of new and increased lending.  From our perspective, new and increased lending is what derives revenue, and that is why it has our focus.</p><p> We obviously have a number of customers in the SME sector who face different challenges and we are working closely with them to help them restructure their businesses and look at their propositions going forward.  From our perspective in Bank of Ireland, we have a risk appetite in every sector because we believe that in every sector good business people can make money and can develop good businesses.  We are not closed to lending in any particular sector.  We have identified certain sectors which we feel have higher growth potential and we are devoting more resources to product innovation in those areas.</p><p> In slide 26, we try to demonstrate both for the market and for the committee where the different divisions are in the second half of 2012.  We have tried to point out that certain of our divisions have moved more quickly towards profitably.  Our Irish division continues to require the most work and therefore the contribution of our overseas and corporate divisions in rebuilding profitability for the group as a whole, as we restructure our Irish division, is extremely important.</p><p> I will now move to slide 27.  As investors and representatives of the taxpayer, we try to demonstrate what the taxpayer is getting out of its support for Bank of Ireland.  Our first task is to reduce the risk to the taxpayer from support provided by the taxpayer.  We believe that the capital we have raised, the restructuring and deleveraging, the cost-reduction programmes we have undertaken, the agreement of our EU viability and restructuring plans, and the enhancement of our franchises - including the franchise in the UK, further protected by an extension to post office contract - have been a very important part of reducing the risk to the taxpayer.  The most significant contingent liability the taxpayer has is in respect of the eligible liabilities guarantee or ELG.  Through a range of initiatives, particularly deleveraging and increasing our deposit franchises, we have reduced the liabilities under the ELG from &euro;136 billion at their peak in September 2008 to &euro;36 billion at the end of June.  They will have reduced further since that date.  Bank of Ireland notes that the ELG is due to expire on 31 December and we are prepared for that.</p><p> The State invested &euro;4.8 billion in cash in Bank of Ireland in the period up to 30 June 2012, and Bank of Ireland returned &euro;2.5 billion in cash to the State in that period.  The State's current investment in Bank of Ireland is a 15% shareholding, preference shares of &euro;1.8 billion which bear a coupon of 10.25% per annum, and a contingent capital instrument which is not part of our core tier one, which bears a coupon of &euro;1 billion per annum.</p><p> In summary, we are making progress against the priorities we have set for ourselves and that we have shared with our investors.  It is a very challenging environment, but one that we believe creates opportunities for us.  We will continue to build our businesses in Ireland and invest in our Irish franchises.  As regards our progress on deleveraging our balance sheet, it is self-evident that deleveraging is outside Ireland and outside our core franchises.  We will continue to reduce our reliance on the ELG and we are actively reducing the cost of money to us.  We have significant enhancements of some of our key franchises and our capital remains robust.  We are on track to achieve our goal of becoming the pre-eminent bank in Ireland.  The most important thing we can do in Bank of Ireland is to have a strong focus on all of the objectives that are under our own control and that we can influence.  That is our target going forward.</p><p> I will be pleased to take questions now.</p></speech>

I thank the delegation for attending this meeting as I believe an important public service is being provided by the committee, particularly with the live broadcast on television.  Many citizens watching this meeting believe it is important to hear the answers from the banks because they have had significant support from the State and its citizens.  The people feel they should be the boss.  We, their representatives, are asking the questions.</p><p>  One issue not dealt with in Mr. Richard Boucher&rsquo;s presentation on revenue growth was standard variable rate, SVR, mortgages.  Is that part of the bank&rsquo;s strategy in revenue growth, on top of selling new products and getting new customers?  Yesterday, AIB gave a fairly stark outline of where it sees SVRs going in the short and medium term.  What is Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s assessment of this?</p><p>  Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s mortgage resolution options seem to be mainly concerned with moving people out of their houses.  In its submission, the terms &ldquo;assisted sales&rdquo;, &ldquo;voluntary sales&rdquo; and &ldquo;trade down&rdquo; are used.  Surely, we should be trying to keep people in their homes.  There are other options open to the bank such as the shared equity scheme.  Has it considered this as a way of keeping people in their homes?  I do not see any mention of a deferred interest initiative which was a recommendation of the Cooney report, commissioned by the previous Government.  How many mortgage-to-rent arrangements has the bank undertaken?  That has been flagged as a major answer to mortgage difficulties but it does not seem to be happening.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-01a.339" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richie Boucher" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2012110100005#D00600"><p>Our SVR is designed to be competitive in the marketplace.  It is our desire to continue to grow our business.  To do so, we need to cover the capital we deploy, potential loan losses as well as costs and overheads.  Our current rate is competitive as evidenced by the flow of business we are getting.  Our rate is not the only criterion but also the terms and conditions of our mortgages.  Our products are designed as such that they are commercially sensible for the bank but also help in growing a long-term franchise.</p><p>  I cannot predict where mortgage rates will move.  The primary driver of mortgage rates in our case is the cost of the raw materials &ndash; money &ndash; to us.  We also try to provide different ranges of products to customers including fixed-rate products which allow people to protect themselves from further interest rate rises.</p></speech>

It is determined by the cost of the raw materials - money - to us.</p><p>  I would be very disappointed if we gave the impression that our primary focus in restructuring mortgages is to move customers out of their homes.  Our primary focus is to maintain them in their homes as it is in their interest and commercially sensible for us.  The mortgage solutions we provide to our customers are primarily designed to maintain them in their homes.  In particular, we look at the level of sustainability of the debt.  We have invested much time, effort and money in getting external advice to look at solutions which are commercially sensible for us and our customers.  The evidence of our focus on keeping people in their homes is the 16,000 mortgages we have restructured and modified, of which 86% are meeting the full terms of their revised arrangements.</p><p>  We continue to look at a range of other solutions available to us.  We are required by the Central Bank to have a long process of engagement and go through various phases of pilots.  We have piloted several solutions.  Based on our evidence, what we believe can work for our customers and what is commercially sensible, we will be rolling out several of these schemes over the next several months.</p></speech>

From our perspective, a restructured and modified mortgage can only be done on the basis the customer is able to meet the full interest payments.  The majority of our customers who have arrears or difficulties can have their mortgages restructured.  A significant issue we face in working with our customers to restructure their mortgages is the extent of unsecured debt outside of the mortgage that was provided by the bank or others.  Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s primary focus is on the mortgage repayments.</p></speech>

A reply to a recent parliamentary question I tabled shows that only one mortgage-to-rent application has made it completely over the line and the indication is that it was done by a sub-prime lender, neither by AIB nor Bank of Ireland.  It would be an observation that maybe the sub-prime lenders are more realistic about current house values than the two pillar banks.  Has a difficulty for Bank of Ireland in the mortgage-to-rent scheme been, because a price must be arrived at with the housing agency, whether the local authority or one of the voluntary agencies such as Cl&uacute;id agrees the valuation of those properties?</p></speech>

From outside observation, this would seem strange because the sub-prime lenders are very much the pariahs of the sector.  They seem to have a more realistic view of the property values.  Mortgage-to-rent is critically about realising the true value of the property because it must be converted from a mortgage and sold to a housing agency, with the tenant who was previously the resident remaining in the property.  Key to that is realising the real value of the property.  Is Bank of Ireland struggling with that?  Is Mr. Boucher of the view that property prices in the residential sector are approaching what might be considered normalisation, they are not undervalued and they are at their real value?</p></speech>

From a market point of view, it is important that we disclose to the market the assumptions we have made.  The assumptions we have made is a peak-to-trough in Irish house prices-----</p></speech>

The price of an average house in this country is based upon the average wage by a certain multiplication.  Since 2009, the Central Bank has given direct guidelines to Bank of Ireland and other banks as to what are lending practices.  If one takes the average house in the country, applies the average industrial wage and multiplies that by three or four because one must allow for an LTV of 90%, my observation would be that we are at proper house price values, not at an undervalued market.</p></speech>

I should have made it clearer in my opening remarks that we believe that house prices are stabilising.  Our assumption was at 55% plus 10% in the event of a realisation.  We believe that as a realistic assumption.  It is not a homogeneous market.  There are a number of different micro-markets.  There are different prices.  We believe that prices in particular urban areas have stabilised.  In some rural locations, it is more difficult.  Price discovery is difficult.  One of our issues, because of the low level of transactions in the market, is ascertaining an appropriate price discovery.  It is important that we take a realistic view.</p><p>  Working with customers who are builders or developers, or in terms of repossessions, Bank of Ireland has been involved in the sale of more than 1,000 houses in this market and we are informing ourselves on those views.  We look not only at what house prices are stabilising at, but at the rental markets.  We have a buy-to-let book.  We obviously keep a close eye on rentals in the buy-to-let book, and we see that rental levels are stabilising.  Those are all indicators to us that they are stabilising, but I would concur with the view that in certain rural locations it is very difficult to get a market-clearing price because there is not enough liquidity.  We try constantly to take a realistic view of the value of our collateral.</p><p>  What I try to say in the assumptions is important.  We cannot absolutely predict at a future point in time where we go.  It is important that we try to demonstrate to our investors, and for anyone interested in our stock, or as creditors, what are our assumptions underlying our provision and forecasting.</p></speech>

I note Mr. Boucher's presentation states that Bank of Ireland is targeting to approve &euro;3.5 billion in lending in 2012.  I suppose my first observation is the absence of the words "new lending".  As I understand it from yesterday, some of Bank of Ireland's competitors are including in the &euro;3.5 billion target set by Government reapplications for overdrafts and for other facilities.  What percentage of the &euro;3.5 billion is new lending to SMEs, farmers and new businesses?</p></speech>

I am confident that at least 97% of the &euro;3.5 billion will be new or increased lending to existing or new customers.</p><p>  The lending will depend on the utilisation of the customers.  For example, if we approve term loans to customers likely to draw it down, an overdraft, an invoice discounting facility or a revolving credit line, it will depend on utilisation.  Our experience heretofore is that overall utilisation of new lending approvals is approximately 50%.  When it comes to overdrafts, the utilisation is lower.  Overdrafts utilisation, in our experience in the year to day, is approximately 42% or 43%.</p><p>  Our goal is to generate revenue, and restructures, etc., do not generate revenue.</p> <p>The &euro;3.5 billion figure is a target that Bank of Ireland has agreed and we welcome it because we have a target for growing our business.  We are not in the business of shuffling numbers to make them look good.  Ultimately, we are provided with capital and liquidity to grow our business.  The target is &euro;3.5 billion and from our perspective it is new and increased in so far as we can be statistically accurate.</p></speech>

A significant number of our customers who have cash are paying down loans rather than reinvesting in their businesses.  We are making provisions and, therefore, we write off certain of our loans.  The stock may or may not increase.   It is our ultimate goal to increase the stock of lending because this is what drives revenue from our perspective.</p><p>  The most significant element of our new or increased lending is to existing customers for different purposes.  Some of it involves other banks refinancing with us, including in particular customers of banks which are exiting this country.  That is included in our figures.  A customer who comes to us to refinance a loan from Bank of Scotland, for example, is included in our figures because this is a new or increased loan from Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s perspective.</p><p>  Loan demand varies across sectors and segments but the primary demand is for working capital.  We have limited demand from customers for finance for mergers, acquisitions or new investment in property or equipment.</p></speech>

I am not sure that many of the 15 or 16 politicians in this room would disagree that the people who come to us continue to find it extremely difficult to access credit, particularly in the SME sector.  Can Mr. Boucher indicate how many applications are not formal?  Bank of Ireland is approving 84% of loans for those who have completed the credit application forms and have been fully vetted by branch managers or relationship managers.  These applications go up the line in a protected fashion because they have been thoroughly vetted.  What percentage of loans never reach the point of formal application?</p></speech>

That may result in an inquiry which we can follow up.</p><p>  It was suggested at our last meeting with this committee that we might keep track of inquiries that do not follow through.  We are pursuing that suggestion and my colleagues have targets to meet in respect of such inquiries.  However, it is difficult to provide a level of statistical accuracy as to what is an informal inquiry.  Based on my personal experience and observations, successful business people are relatively persistent because they believe in themselves and the future of their businesses.</p><p>  We are not playing with numbers.  Our strategy is to grow our business and our revenues.  We want to generate as much business as we can.  We recognise that in a significant number of the applications we handle every week we will be making decisions on the margins.  I know that some of the customers to whom we decide to advance money will have subsequent difficulties repaying their debts.  I also know that we will decline some of the customers who could have repaid us.  This is not an exact science.  We are trying to generate revenue on an ongoing basis.  Where our colleagues in the business generation side see that an application they have recommended has been declined, they have a right of appeal through a separate appeals process.  We do not make money by saying &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</p></speech>

Since 2009 Bank of Ireland has deleveraged from &euro;140 billion to &euro;90 billion.  How does he expect to achieve his target of deleveraging a further &euro;8 billion to &euro;9 billion over the next two years?</p></speech>

Further deleveraging will primarily come from running down books we have outside Ireland.  The most significant of these is the UK mortgage book.  Approximately &euro;18 billion of those mortgages are within the UK subsidiary and a further &euro;12 billion are outside of it.  These are naturally running down.  We are also running down certain corporate and business banking portfolios outside Ireland.  Our deleveraging is all based on an ex-Ireland strategy.  It is easier for us to pursue such a strategy because the markets are more liquid, customers have different refinancing options and we have proved that we are able to sell loans in those markets.  Based on the analysis of redemptions and repayments in the two years to date, we believe the target is realistic.</p></speech>

We are investing millions of euro in the fit of these branches and the capability within branches in terms of in-service technology as well as online and mobile services.  We are freeing up branches to provide a greater degree of high quality service advice to our customers and to work with customers in difficulty on a face-to-face basis.  The feedback from our customers indicates that our footprint is important in allowing them to engage with us on a face-to-face basis regarding new mortgages and cases of difficulty.</p><p>  Our focus is on reducing the cost to serve by looking to local businesses to support the branch footprint.  We will merge certain branches in urban areas where they are located side by side or very close to each other.  We also plan to open several outlets in the coming months, including two before the end of the year.  We always keep the footprint under review.  We examine our locations to ensure they are optimal and if they are not optimal we will seek to relocate.  Our focus at present is on our own footprint rather than considering an expansion into other footprints. </p></speech>

Our prioritisation is to restructure and modify those mortgages that can be done more quickly.  As in any of these situations we must try to make decisions on the best way we can prioritise our resources.  As we make progress, in particular at moving more quickly through our system mortgages that can be readily and quickly modified and restructured, then we can spend more time on those that are much more complex, and in particular where there is engagement with third parties.  The buy-to-rent scheme, for example, does involve a third party in terms of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  There are certain things that are in our control.  I am not seeking to apportion blame.  The primary responsibility for managing our mortgage book, managing arrears and dealing with our customers is with Bank of Ireland.</p></speech>

Mr. Boucher has said the bank wants to disengage from the ELG and that when the guarantee runs out on 31 December, it is ready for this year.  Is he satisfied the bank will be able to raise money on the markets without a guarantee?  Is that the proposal regardless of whether the guarantee is extended?  Is it the objective of the bank in 2013 to be able to raise finances without the guarantee?  That obviously would have an impact on the State because last year the bank provided more than &euro;449 million to the State as a result of the guarantee.  What is the proposal from the bank?  Is it to go without in 2013?</p></speech>

We can do it.  We came off the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme.

He also stated the bank's customer analysis pointed to how important it was for customers to be able to engage with the bank face to face.  In the past 12 months, however, the bank has removed a link between branches and customers.  When one telephones a local branch in Scariff, Miltown Malbay or so on, one gets through to a central call centre and it is not possible to speak to the branch staff with whom one has built up a relationship.  The bank has maintained the ability to telephone the branch in the Law Library, but ordinary people in counties Clare, Kerry and Donegal are unable to telephone their local branches.  Does this demonstrate an ability to interact with staff?  As people now realise, banking is about relationships.  Does Mr. McLoughlin accept that part of the reason Bank of Ireland did not lose as much as other banks was that it maintained a more traditional practice of building relationships with customers?  If so, why is it seeking to make interacting with branch staff more difficult?</p></speech>

The general sense we have from our feedback is that it is better to have the ability to speak to customers when they want.  For this reason, we use contact centres, predominantly in Kilkenny, to support our engagement with customers there and then.</p></speech>

Through these centres, we also provide customers the opportunity to have a message sent to their branches to deal with their calls at a later time.  We are conscious of customers' requirements.

My experience has been the exact opposite.  Whenever I telephoned a branch, someone picked up and helped with my query.  As recently as yesterday, I spent 20 minutes on hold trying to get through to one of the bank's call centres.  Is this acceptable?  If Bank of Ireland hopes to grow its business through increasing its customer base and the services provided to same, will it achieve this aim by call centres putting customers on hold for 20 minutes?  They cannot contact their branches.</p></speech>

My understanding is that Bank of Ireland has been wholly unco-operative in that regard.  Does Mr. Boucher not think that if it was sold at its current market value, even if that is slightly depressed, it would provide an opportunity for the bank to mark the State's support for it by giving that building to the State as a cultural amenity or centre?</p></speech>

We are making considerable efforts to give cash returns to the State and, which hopefully we are, to repay the investment of the State through cash and working through our strategy.  All assets of the bank are available for sale at any time at the right price.  Our College Green branch is our main branch in the centre of Dublin and the main branch for the extremely important franchise of Trinity College.  It has more than 35,000 customers.  We have a footfall of 1,000 customers per day and it is by far our largest branch.  We have reconfigured our branch network around that and it is also our cash centre in the centre of Dublin.  For those reasons, it is an extremely important commercial asset to us and our customers.</p></speech>

For example, under the bank's new regime, customers must keep &euro;3,000 permanently in a current account or incur charges.  Agencies like the Consumers' Association of Ireland and those at the coalface of people enduring poverty and difficulty have heavily criticised these types of extra charges that hit ordinary people.

Where there was a reduced payment but still more than interest-only, where amortisation of the principal had changed, there were 1,950 cases.  In 2,267 cases, the mortgage term had been extended.  There were 216 various other solutions, as I tried to outline to Deputy Doherty.  Those figures are for those who are not in arrears.  For those in arrears, the figures are 2,579 on interest-only, 428 making a reduced payment, 176 term extensions and 120 other arrangements.  The total for owner occupiers, both not in default and in default, is 6,965 on interest-only, with 2,378 making reduced payments, 2,443 term extensions and 336 other arrangements.</p><p>  Based on the available information, the quantum that have moved from interest-only to other sorts of solution will have increased as a proportion of that number.</p></speech>

Term extensions also lead to extra burdens of interest.  We put this question yesterday to the other bankers and Mr. Boucher's counterpart in AIB had the nerve to give us a lecture on moral hazard as it pertains to owner occupiers, those people who are stuck with exorbitant and extortionate mortgages as a result of blatant speculation in building land and house prices.  Why will the bank not consider a write-down for owner occupiers to the real value of their homes and a recalibration of mortgages on a monthly basis to the equivalent amount?  That would remove massive amounts of stress from those who are trapped in this nightmare and release badly needed funds into the domestic economy, shops and services, which would help to regenerate the gutted domestic economy with all the downsides of mass unemployment.  Has Mr. Boucher thought about this or discussed it within Bank of Ireland or with the other banks?</p></speech>

The vast majority of our customers are paying their mortgages so we have a responsibility to those customers and to all of the stakeholders in the bank, including our creditors, depositors and share holders.  Our goal is to keep as many people in their homes for as long as we can.  We set out for the customers what we can and cannot do for them.  In the vast majority of cases, 86%, where customers have had mortgages restructured or modified, they are able to meet those terms.  That is what we are doing in Bank of Ireland.</p></speech>

It would not take a financial genius to put in place a structure whereby, if there was a sudden massive spike, it could be taken into account.

The fact is the bank is still hugely overdependent on capitalisation.  Its loan to deposit ratio is approximately 136% and its financial engineering is still very fragile, even after that capitalisation.  The asset side of the balance sheet shows that 73% of the balance sheet loan assets are in mortgages, property and construction related loans.  This goes against a bank tradition ten years previously which was completely different.  Why was there not a more open, transparent and honest discussion with the Government pointing out that until the rehabilitation and restructuring of the bank took place - for the sake of the bank and its viability rather than for shareholders - capitalisation should have been by way of creditor capitalisation rather than by bringing in a 35% shareholder which is now the dominant shareholder in the bank?  The amount outstanding on the market is 50%, the amount held by the State is 15% and the amount held by this consortium of investors is 35%.  Therefore, it is a schizophrenic organisation.</p></speech>

Circa &euro;5 billion of equity capital has been generated from liability management exercises with bondholders.  In the capital exercise we did in 2011, circa &euro;2 billion came from liability management exercise, circa &euro;1.9 billion came from a rights issue with existing shareholders or participation of new shareholders, including a consortium which came together for a particular purpose, and circa &euro;300 million came from the State.  Therefore, liability management exercises have contributed a significant amount to the recapitalisation of the bank.  By their nature, liability management exercises are bonds being bought in at a discount on their face value, which means the bondholders have taken a loss or have switched from a bond into equity in the bank.</p><p>  The &euro;1.9 billion raised from the bondholders in 2011 primarily came from 95% of bondholders in the first liability management exercise, who went for an equity option.  Therefore, they ended up with a significant stake.  My information is that many of those bondholders subsequently sold out of their shares and these have been taken up by other market participants.</p></speech>

The bank has &euro;7 billion in provisions against a loan book of &euro;80 billion - about 8.7%.  Considering this is all in mortgages and property and construction related lending, that is probably very light provision.</p></speech>

We should look at the maturity of the assets and at how easily they may be collected on.  As mentioned, many of them are 35-year assets.  The likelihood is that the borrowers are not in a position, based on their current, prospective and sustainable earnings, to repay their loans, whether businesses or individuals.</p><p>  I would like to draw attention to the tracker element of loans.  The mortgage book involves loans of a total of &euro;27 billion.  Domestic tracker loans make up 57%, &euro;20.5 billion, and investment trackers make up 81% of a total of &euro;6.7 billion.  Tracker loans are very expensive for the bank to carry.  Yesterday, we discussed the point that if average interest rates, at 4% on the standard variable and non-tracker loans, rose to 6%, that would be a 50% increase, but borrowers are only barely hanging in as matters stand - after restructuring, continuing on interest only loans, stretching out the loan or other strategies or non-appropriate restructuring.  This means the bank is in a perilous position on &euro;27 billion worth of loans.  It is not impressive.</p></speech>

Tracker mortgages are expensive for the bank, but they include a presumption of the cost of funds over the next 20 years.</p></speech>

I would like to echo the sentiments expressed by Deputy Higgins.  It is time to look long and hard into the worthiness or unworthiness of the behaviour of the institutions over the past number of years.  There is time to do some rehabilitation as well as restructuring.  It is not all about numbers; it is about people's lives, families and businesses.  Private debt, in addition to national debt, is a huge millstone around the recovery of the national economy.</p><p>  We must be brave.  It is about time the precedent set yesterday by the chief executive of Bank of Ireland's competitor bank, who took a reduction of 15% from the capped ceiling, was followed.</p> <p>The Taoiseach, who spends every single day, from 6 a.m. until midnight, working for the people of this country is on a fraction of the salaries and pensions of people in the banking sector.  </p></speech>

It would also put those whose accounts have already been restructured into a more favourable position whereby they could free themselves of a huge debt burden sooner.  Why would Bank of Ireland not consider writing off the negative equity, which would help the country and the tens of thousands of distressed mortgage holders, many of whom are in distress through no fault of their own?  Indeed, some of the distress was caused by the activities of Bank of Ireland.</p></speech>

However, as Deputy Higgins has pointed out, a lot of those people are in pretty miserable circumstances, even though they may just be able to manage the restructuring arrangement the bank has agreed with them.  The bank has the whip hand, let us be honest.  However, it is not a very good situation and it means that such people are trapped in a pretty awful debt situation for a very long time to come.  In addition, if I understand correctly, there are approximately 16,000 restructured mortgages and all of those people would not be in restructured arrangements were they not in some difficulty.  Most of that difficulty arose from the bubble period and the consequences of the property crash.  In addition, approximately 9.22% of the bank's overall mortgage book is in arrears and that figure is rising, year on year.  It has risen from 5.89% in June 2011 to 9.22% this year, which is a very dramatic increase.</p></speech>

I estimate that Bank of Ireland has 32,000 mortgage customers who are either in restructured arrangements or in arrears now and a significant number of additional customers who are getting into distress.  Mr. Boucher says that the problem is slowing but I do not see the evidence for that.  Why does the bank not consider writing off the unsustainable portions of these debts that arose during an exceptional period, namely a property bubble, which Bank of Ireland helped to stoke up?</p></speech>

The beginning of the letter states that the bank wishes to share with its valued mortgage customers some interesting findings from research carried out recently among similar homeowners who have mortgages on a tracker rate.  The research was conducted by RED C in August in 2012.  To be honest, from reading the letter it appears to try to trick people with tracker mortgages into engaging with the bank to move to lesser or higher interest rate mortgages.  To me that is the ugly face of banking that we have seen.</p></speech>

The data conducted by RED C in August 2012 on behalf of the Bank of Ireland found that customers on tracker rates believe that lower payments and rates of interest are the most appealing feature of their mortgage.  A significant proportion, 75%, of our customers with tracker rates believe the ECB rate will increase in the next five years.  The majority of customers, 84%, are concerned about the resulting increase in mortgage repayments.  If, like these customers, you have concerns about increasing mortgage repayments we may have options that can afford you more certainty of repayments at affordable rates, giving you the benefits your current low rate but without the risk of increases over the next five years.</blockquote>The letter continues: &quot;We will be calling you over the next week to discuss the options and to answer any questions you may have. If this timeframe is inconvenient...we will contact you...please contact the following phone number.&quot;  The date of the letter is October 2012.</p></speech>

However, the customer's ability to repay is different from the security piece.  We assess on the basis of a customer's ability to repay.  This is not a pawnbroking business.  We look at the customer's ability to repay.</p></speech>

My understanding of negative equity is that if a person owes the bank &euro;500,000 and his or her asset is worth &euro;300,000, whether he or she is on the dole or earning &euro;1 million per year, that loan has a negative equity of &euro;200,000 attached to it.</p></speech>

If someone enters into a debt settlement arrangement on secured debt, particularly in respect of a house, and if an agreement can be arrived at by the bank, the personal insolvency professional and the borrower or borrowers, at the end of the debt settlement period - under the proposed legislation this will be up to six years - is it the bank's understanding that the borrower or borrowers could keep the house?  Is it also its understanding that, as part of a debt settlement arrangement, an amount of debt could be surrendered by the bank to the borrower or borrowers?</p></speech>

The document with which we have been supplied indicates that the underlying loss between December 2011 and June 2012 increased from &euro;722 million to &euro;907 million, a rise of 24%.  Therefore, the most recent figures supplied to the committee indicate that the position on the investment the taxpayer made - involuntarily - in September 2008 has depreciated by 24%.  The document also indicates that impairment charges rose from &euro;901 million in the first half of 2011 to &euro;978 million in the same period in 2012.  This is despite the fact that on page 8 of the document a statement is made to the effect that "Impairment charges below the level incurred in H2 2011 but remain elevated", whereas, in fact, they increased.  A similar statement is made on page 13, namely, "Impairment charges remain elevated but have reduced from the level in H2 2011".  Someone who stopped reading at page 8 or page 13 and did not read as far as page 26 would have obtained a completely different view of the position on impairment charges.  Such charges have actually increased by 9% or &euro;77 million.</p></speech>

Unlike the statements to which I refer on pages 8 and 13, when one reaches page 26, one realises that the amount rose by &euro;77 million.  The overall performance of the bank is also in decline and that is of concern to the people who made the investment, particularly in the context of the fact that the underlying loss increased from &euro;722 million to &euro;907 million.</p><p>  I am concerned by the statement on page 9 to the effect that Bank of Ireland is 73% a property-based institution.

The Gallery has heard it enough this morning.  Before I bring in Deputy Shane Ross, Mr. Boucher must clarify a few points.  There has been wide acceptance that his engagement with the committee on a number of questions has been at a minimalist level, if I could even call it that.  I wish to put that on record.</p><p>  An issue has been outstanding since Mr. Boucher came before the committee and I still have not got my head around it.  A question was put to Mr. Boucher, as it was put to AIB, on the absolute cost of the institution reducing the standard variable rate on domestic mortgages by 0.5%.  The figure we got from AIB yesterday afternoon was that private dwelling houses on its domestic book is worth approximately &euro;14.3 billion and a 0.5% reduction would result in a loss of &euro;71 million to AIB.  On the figures Mr. Boucher gave us this morning, the domestic book of Bank of Ireland is approximately &euro;21 billion and if the bank reduced its standard variable rate by 0.5% its loss would be &euro;29 million, approximately a third less than AIB.  Could he explain to us how it is the case that a smaller loss would be incurred following a 0.5% reduction given that the loan book is bigger?</p></speech>

We have fixed-rate mortgages and standard variable-rate mortgages.  We disclose the trackers.  With regard to the standard rate and variable rate, our figure may be lower than that of Allied Irish Banks, but I am not familiar with the numbers of the latter.</p></speech>

Yesterday afternoon, AIB was asked the number of mortgages with a shortfall that it has allowed to be surrendered voluntarily and its policy on shortfalls.  We seem to have received a very vague response from Bank of Ireland on the matter.  The AIB officials advised us yesterday afternoon that 140 properties were surrendered with a mortgage shortfall.  The response of Bank of Ireland to date has been that it has a responsibility to maximise the recovery of all moneys owed by customers and that it has a comprehensive arrangement and process to work with customers to find solutions that can work for them and the bank in this regard.  Bank of Ireland states that, as a last resort, it may have to instigate a formal legal process.  That is not answering the question; rather, it is symptomatic of some of the replies we received this morning.  It indicates the bank is not really engaging with the process in a serious manner.  It also means it is not engaging with this committee in a serious manner, which is of equal concern to me.  What is Bank of Ireland's position on the issue of voluntary surrenders where there are mortgage shortfalls?  What is the bank doing in this regard?</p></speech>
