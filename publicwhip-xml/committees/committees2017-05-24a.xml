    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-24a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1319" speakername="Michael Healy-Rae" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017052400002#A00400"><p>I am very proud that we have engagement with our MEPs from the island of Ireland.  On behalf of the committee, I warmly welcome all the MEPs who have managed to be here today.  This is a very important engagement for us as a committee.  We follow all the work of the MEPs in Brussels and Strasbourg and we hear how hard they all work on the very many issues they deal with.  In some ways, we mirror that hear, so it is important for us to join together periodically.  Of course, they are always welcome to join our discussions and meetings but by virtue of their work and the need to be in Brussels and Strasbourg, we realise this is often very challenging.  This will be a slightly different engagement in that the MEPs are not witnesses in the traditional sense; rather, it is an open engagement.  They are all very much at the coalface of European developments, so we appreciate their willingness to share any views, advice or recommendations they have.</p><p>I will go off the script and say to the MEPs that I and the committee are very grateful to them for taking time to be here.  I was very glad earlier to be with Ms Mairead McGuinness, MEP, the Ceann Comhairle and our Vice Chairman and to congratulate Ms McGuinness very much on her recent appointment and wish her the best of luck.  When we came back from our trip to meet all the MEPs recently, the Senators were quick to put it on the record of the Seanad, and we Deputies to put it on the record of the D&aacute;il, that we are very proud of our MEPs.  Whether they be Independent, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, Sinn F&eacute;in or whatever, we are supportive of the work they do.  At this critical time of Brexit, I believe that now more than ever there is a very important focus on the work our MEPs do and the representation they give us on the European stage, so it is great to have them here and I very much appreciate their presence.</p><p>Before we proceed with the engagement, I must read out a reminder on privilege.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p> On how we might structure this engagement, six items were suggested by members of the committee and Members of the European Parliament: the relationship between the European Parliament and national parliaments; the White Paper on the future of Europe; the EU budget and the Multi-Annual Financial Framework after 2020; the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union; amendments to Regulation No. 883/2004 on the co-ordination of the social security systems; and the European pillar of social rights.  I propose that we cover these in order and have an open and frank discussion on them.  The first item is the relationship between the European Parliament and national parliaments.</p><p> Considering the role of Ms Mairead McGuinness, MEP, I invite her to start the discussion.  I aim to keep the meeting to approximately one hour and 20 minutes, if possible and within reason.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-24a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mairead McGuinness" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017052400002#B00200"><p>I thank the Chairman for allowing me to open the discussion, principally because of my role in the European Parliament, namely, that of Vice President, responsible for relationships with national parliaments.  I also thank the committee for its recent engagement.  Since the Brexit vote, we have had deeper engagement, not only with colleagues in the Oireachtas but also Members of many national parliaments.  Perhaps it is something on which we need to build.  We always say we could communicate better and meet more often.  Today should be more about how we do it rather than the aspiration because committee members and I want to work better with national parliaments.</p> <p>  All of thee issues are linked.  The first will have an impact on all of the others on the agenda.  The future of Europe depends on our having stronger and deeper relationships with national parliaments.  We would like to be here more often and perhaps committee members would like to be in Brussels more often too, but it is just not possible.  Therefore, we have to find other ways.  We have formal structures.  I will be with some of my colleagues here in Malta for the national parliaments meeting at the beginning of next week.  Committee members come to Brussels.  It is the informal engagement we need to deepen.  Perhaps we need to consider engagement with specific committees, be they on agriculture, agriculture policy or other matters.  Fisheries, for example, will be a significant concern in the Brexit negotiations.</p> <p>  Ironically, Brexit has brought national parliaments closer to the European Parliament because they need to understand our role and we need to understand theirs.  Let us build on this and hope we can have a stronger relationship that will work for people.  That is why we are here.</p></speech>

I call Mr. Kelly.  We will take speakers in groups of three.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-24a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n Kelly" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017052400002#B00400"><p>Cos&uacute;il le mo chomhghleacaithe, t&aacute; an-&aacute;thas orm bheith leis an coiste inniu.  M&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas as ucht an cuireadh agus as ucht dul go dt&iacute; Parlaimint na hEorpa c&uacute;pla seachtain &oacute; shin.  Bh&iacute; an-chaidreamh eadrainn agus leanfaidh s&eacute; sin ar aghaidh amach anseo.</p> <p>  I agree with Ms McGuinness that Brexit has focused European minds on the future of Europe.  Part of the failing that led to Brexit was a lack of true engagement with citizens.  Subsequent to the vote, we found out that many of them were googling, "What is the EU?"  One of the ways to communicate further with citizens is through national parliaments.  If we have closer liaison and discussion, we will obviously have closer relationships with citizens.  One cannot bypass national parliaments or regional governments at European level and say one is going to engage with citizens directly.</p> <p>  My next point is on legislation.  The more input we have at national parliament level, the better our legislation will be.  Many of the proposals we receive have a direct impact on individual countries.  While we often engage with vested interests and stakeholders, we probably do not have enough direct input from national parliaments.  We receive it from the Permanent Representation which does a great job in Europe, but perhaps we should have more discussion at committee level with the elected representatives on how we should proceed.  All that would help us to create a Europe that was more connected to its citizens through more engagement with national parliaments.  Committee members have made a great start by coming to meet us.  We have come to meet them.  That has to be positive and we look forward to further engagement.</p> <p>  It might not be the sexiest thing ever to be involved in European affairs because it does not always attract the attention of the media.  Nevertheless, it is very important because most of our legislation - 60% - starts at European level.  Therefore, we have to communicate properly with the directly elected Members of national parliaments.  That is a good start.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-24a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1319" speakername="Michael Healy-Rae" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017052400002#B00500"><p>I thank Mr. Kelly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-24a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Marian Harkin" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017052400002#B00600"><p>I will be brief as we do not have much time.  </p> <p>  I agree with what Ms McGuinness said: in a way, today should be about how we communicate and what specific channels we can put in place.  As Mr. Kelly said, dealing with legislation at European level is not all that high profile, but ultimately it is our work.  For example, one of the items on the agenda is the co-ordination of social security, pertaining to Regulation No. 883/2004, which I am shadowing in the main committee for my group.  I would welcome very much an opportunity to meet interested Members of the Oireachtas from the relevant committee to discuss issue.  The co-ordination of social security is a very important issue.  If we want to discuss it later, I will be happy to do so.  For now I am staying with the question of how we communicate.</p> <p>  I was very pleased recently to see a reasoned opinion from both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad on the restructuring directive.  They stated it did not comply with the principle of subsidiarity.  During the years I have seen many reasoned opinions from other parliaments.  I am sure the Oireachtas has issued them in respect of other committees, but the one I saw was one of the first pertaining to mine.  It is a sign that this committee is fully and totally engaged at this point of the process, which is before it even comes to the Parliament.  It is happening slowly.  At one time I was a member of this committee sitting on the other side.  I note that there is a huge difference between then and now.</p> <p>  Mr. Kelly talked about citizens.  As Members of the European Parliament, one of the things we can and often do is ensure access for citizens to the Commission on various issues.  All of us do this regularly on matters that affect citizens and also Members of the Oireachtas.  On my way in to the meeting I met Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice and we discussed a certain issue.  Mr. Luke "Ming" Flanagan is also involved.  It is about the abstraction of water from Lough Talt in County Sligo.  Irish Water is linking with the Commission, as are we, to determine whether we can find a solution to a local problem.  It happens at different levels.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-24a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1393" speakername="Terry Leyden" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017052400002#B00700"><p>I welcome the delegation, particularly the four representatives from my region.  The longest serving is Ms Marian Harkin who was in the old Connacht-Ulster constituency, followed by Ms Mairead McGuinness.  Mr. Luke "Ming" Flanagan and Mr. Matt Carthy are new Members.  The region is very well represented today and I am very impressed.  I also welcome Mr. Se&aacute;n Kelly who represents the South constituency.  Also welcome is Ms Martina Anderson who is from Derry and represents the North.  This is the first time we have engaged with her.</p> <p>  During the years we have dealt with all sorts of issue such as the Maastricht and Lisbon treaties, but we never thought we would be dealing with Brexit.  When I was a Minister of State with responsibility for trade and marketing, we were dealing with the Single European Act.  It was a long time ago, but my point is that the British were so engaged and involved that there was no debate and no divisions as such.  They have contributed so much to the European Union in the past 30 or 40 years that their exit is quite a blow.  We will not go into that matter as the facts are facts and we are where we are.</p> <p>  The European Parliament will play a more important role than ever before as far as Brexit is concerned.  Its Members, especially Vice President Mairead McGuinness, are in a particularly good position to link with the other parliaments.  Consider the matter of trying to explain our situation, involving trade worth &euro;1.2 billion per week and a 499 km Border with the North.  From my experience of attending COSAC meetings which the Chairman has also attended, I believe nobody is particularly concerned about us.  When I was in Estonia recently, I was told that there were 70,000 Estonians working in the United Kingdom and that they would not enjoy the free movement arrangement the Irish would have when the negotiations were completed, as if to say, "Don't cry for me Argentina; you are doing okay."</p><p> There is a long way to go.  As I understand, the European Parliament's decision has to be unanimous, or at least by a majority vote in the European Parliament.  We have only so many MEPs.  They do all they can, but it is a small number in a big house.  Looking down the road, Spain has a veto over Gibraltar.  Can someone please explain to me how they could get a veto over Gibraltar when we do not have a veto as far as Northern Ireland is concerned?  That surprises me, and perhaps someone could try to extract that somewhere along the line.  </p><p> Finally, it might be a political point from the witnesses point of view, but we will be losing our MEPs from Northern Ireland.  Will the British MEPs be redistributed?  In that case, we would end up with only a single extra MEP, as I understand it.  We have a very strong case of claiming the Northern jurisdiction, and that three MEPs should be elected from our constituency to represent the people of Northern Ireland in the European Parliament in the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-24a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017052400002#C00200"><p>I welcome everyone here today.  It is great to see all the MEPs representing all the parts of the island.  On the relationship between the national Parliament and the European Parliament and where all this is ending, in the past year or so Brexit has focused people's attention on the growth of a very right wing ideology in many parts of Europe.  In many places that ideology is very racist and xenophobic and is throwing up all the things with which we have serious issues.  Its growth is based on dissatisfaction among many people in many member states, particularly on the periphery, regarding their economic circumstances, where they see Europe going, and how they consider the European structures as something that are distant from them and not something with which it is easy to engage.  I welcome what Ms Harkin said and that there are efforts being made in that regard.</p> <p>  The impression among many people is that Europe is an elite club and not something that ordinary people have either access to or a good relationship with.  If we are really serious about doing something around Brexit and all the issues which flow from it, we need to look at that seriously.  It is not only the responsibility of the people elected to the European Parliament, but also to the people elected to all the other parliaments, to try to ensure the direction in which all this is going is arrested and brought back so that people will once again feel that the European institutions are for them.  Would the witnesses agree that we need to have a greater level of accountability, transparency and supervision of all the European policies that flow to places like this committee from Europe?  We regularly have to scrutinise various directives and information that come from Europe and the nub of the issue is the attempt, particularly by France and Germany and the bigger countries who they seem to come together, do deals on the future of Europe and then dictate to other countries what will happen.  I would like the MEPs' views on this aspect.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-24a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1399" speakername="Neale Richmond" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017052400002#C00300"><p>I welcome the MEPs.  It is rare for some of them to get back to Dublin or Ireland on a Wednesday, but green weeks are made for things such as this and it is great to have everyone here.</p> <p>  On the level of engagement between the Oireachtas and the European Parliament, this is the second time we have met this year following our trip to Brussels.  There have been various other opportunities either within our own political families or otherwise, but we do not meet enough.  We need a lot more engagement not only with this committee, but all the sectoral committees shadowing the work the MEPs are doing in their committees.  Do the MEPs have any thoughts or solutions as to how we might better achieve that?  Previously, this committee would have met on a Thursday to try to facilitate those returning, but that is not feasible either.  We also tried the dial-in mechanism once or twice.  Could we see how we might work more closely as Deputy Martin Kenny said, on directives or legislation not on a party basis, but on a committee or representational basis?  Similarly, this would apply if they are working on reports or opinions which are coming into the European Parliament and which we will then have to scrutinise.  How can we work together and occasionally put on the green jersey, to use that horrible phrase?</p> <p>  It will become really apparent with the ECJ ruling, issued two weeks ago, regarding upcoming trade deals.  We have had fairly feisty exchanges in this committee over CETA and TTIP.  We have disagreed and that is fine, but we all agreed that there was not the necessary level of scrutiny of those trade deals.  From those of us of my political background, as a keen supporter, we are constantly fighting a battle but those who oppose those deals are saying that we do not discuss them enough.  How can we ensure that those deals are discussed in order to identify potential problems or issues or to sell them?  This is a responsibility that national parliaments will have to adopt and it sums up the crossroads that the EU is at now.  For so long, support was taken for granted, yet in this country we have seen in our referendums that we do not have a great history in that regard.  We see in its ultimate conclusion, Brexit, that people have lost faith in the European institutions, although some of them never had faith in the first place, or it was taken for granted.  Aside from the obvious core positives, when people think of Europe, they think only of endless directives or myths about straight bananas and ridiculous things like that.  The level of disengagement is extremely worrying.  </p> <p>  I spoke about the Oireachtas, the European Parliament and hopefully the Assembly working closer together, where possible. in the future, but also within national parliaments.  The Council of Europe, on which Senator Leyden still sits, has delegates from national parliaments and in the history of the European Parliament, there were delegates from the Oireachtas until the dual mandate was abolished in 2007.  We very rarely get to meet our counterparts in other EU parliaments.  We have had a lot of engagement with people from the House of Commons and the House of Lords in recent months for obvious reasons but, bar the occasional visit from the big counties, by which I mean Germany and France which are sending delegations here - they are very welcome and it is perhaps eye-opening - how can the European Parliament fill that gap through national parliamentarians from the soon-to-be 27 member states engaging either within their political families or none, depending on where they belong?  We need to know what EU affairs committees are doing in Spain, Estonia or Croatia to see how we can act.  There is co-ordination at European Parliament level and a history there, but we will have to have greater engagement.  National parliamentarians are required to engage under the Lisbon treaty and the recent ECTA dealings, but how do we facilitate that?  Do the MEPs have any suggestions on how we might bring about that greater co-operation?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-24a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1413" speakername="Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017052400002#C00400"><p>It is great to see the MEPs here today.  Normally when I am at committees such as this or discussing these matters in the Seanad, I am one of the few who voted to remain but it is good to see a fellow-Remainer here in Martina Anderson MEP today.  I recently travelled to Brussels with a delegation from Border Communities Against Brexit and we met most of the MEPs.  Unfortunately Luke "Ming" Flanagan MEP was tied up on that day so it is good that we can engage with him this afternoon.  I was in the Seanad for a debate earlier so I am slightly late and I apologise.</p> <p>  In the course of all our engagements on the issue of Brexit, the Good Friday Agreement must have primacy.  I have serious concerns on the nature of what the European Union's constitutional affairs committee referred to as an alteration of the Good Friday Agreement as a result of Brexit.  I have raised this in the Seanad and at the Seanad's Brexit committee with a range of people who have come in to present to us.  I have deep reservations about such a unilateral move, and the legality and political intent of that undermining and alteration of the Good Friday Agreement, which is the result of a vote taken by people by this State to endorse its structures and its all-Ireland and east-west strands.</p><p>Do the witnesses have a view on that statement by the committee?  What is the outworking of that and what can MEPs continue to do to ensure that unilateral and unwanted alteration of the Agreement's structures does not take place?</p><p> What is becoming increasingly apparent regardless of the nuanced views on Brexit and its complexities is the growing consensus that there are two ways to mitigate against a hard Brexit.  A blind man on a galloping horse could see that we are in for a hard Brexit.  That is the political and ideological trajectory of the Tory party in England.  As mandated by the D&aacute;il, one of the ways to mitigate against it is a special designated status.  What engagements have the MEPs had on that proposal?  How has it been received?  What would it look, taste and smell like for people living across the island?</p><p> The second way to mitigate against a hard and unwanted Brexit is the natural outworking of the Good Friday Agreement, that is, a poll on Irish reunification.  In some of my dialogue and engagement in Brussels recently, that featured in discussions with colleagues from across the EU and the political spectrum.  It is a perfectly legitimate democratic aspiration and we should not be sitting back waiting for it to happen.  Rather, we should modestly or, indeed, proactively work to try to bring it about.</p><p> What struck me about the North's 56% vote to remain was that it came from all shades of political, traditional and cultural backgrounds.  The recent attainment of a guarantee that Ireland in its entirety will be returned to the EU if and when we reunify the country will add considerable food for thought for people.  If the witnesses could refer to these matters, it would be useful for us.</p></speech>

I am delighted to be present.  This is the first time that I have had an opportunity to present to the committee.  As members know, Brexit negotiations formally commence on 19 June, 11 days after the election.  It is important that we get a clear and, where possible, united view among everyone here not just among MEPs or committee members, but across all political parties in Leinster House.</p> <p>  Brexit is incompatible with the Good Friday Agreement.  Of that there is no doubt, and we must all be clear on that point.  Consider the strands of the Agreement.  For instance, the Assembly does not have the power to establish its own laws.  That is incompatible with EU law.  Of the six North-South implementation bodies over areas of co-operation, take the Food Safety Promotion Board as an example.  How do we deal with the prospect of having two different regulatory standards on this island?  That is where the damage will begin.</p> <p>  The British Government is driving towards a hard Brexit, which means a hard Border and hardship for the people of this island, particularly in the North.  We have had benign soundbites about there being no hard Border, but we must ensure that, as the European Parliament's resolution stated, there is no hardening of the Border.</p> <p>  Senator Leyden mentioned our relatively small number of MEPs, yet we were able to secure 516 MEPs' support for the preservation of the Good Friday Agreement in all of its parts.  That means something - that there would be no hardening of the Border and the unique and special circumstances.  We have been on a diplomatic offensive since before the vote.</p> <p>  I will give the committee an insight into the negotiations.  I am working closely with the steering committee in the European Parliament and other MEPs have relationships with some of its members.  We have been able to insert into the negotiations the issues of transparency, strengthening the reference in the Council guidelines to rights and standards and the requirement that nothing undermine the objective and commitment of the Good Friday Agreement.  Regarding a point that Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile raised, this competes and conflicts with a report from the European Parliament's Committee on Constitutional Affairs, AFCO, which asserted that Brexit required an alteration to the Good Friday Agreement.  That is a no-go area.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-24a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Martina Anderson" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017052400002#D00400"><p>Those of us who went through what happened will not allow the Agreement to be re-opened, renegotiated, reworked or rewritten in any way.  We know the damage and danger of doing that and where it would take us.</p> <p>  The committee members are probably aware of the key priorities, given that they have been outlined: citizenship and people; finance; and Ireland.  Much focus and attention are being given to the situation in Ireland.  Europe is very aware of the peace process, including the political process and the Good Friday Agreement.  It has contributed to peace funding via PEACE I, II, III and IV.  We all have particular views on Europe and the need for Europe and we critics engage with the EU.  It needs reform and there are differences in opinion as to how that reform should proceed.  Today, however, I will focus primarily on the implications of Brexit.</p> <p>  The negotiations will follow a four-week cycle or rhythm.  The first week will be the preparation stage, which will involve the European Parliament.  The second week will be an exchange of documents between the EU and the British Government.  The third week will entail four or five days of intensive negotiation and the fourth week will see a debriefing, which will involve the European Parliament again.  The European Parliament will book-end every four-week period.</p> <p>  There is a clustering of committees.  The first round of negotiations, which will deal primarily with citizens' rights, will involve the employment committee, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, LIBE, of which I am a member, and the Committee on Legal Affairs, JURI.  Like Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, I have an Irish passport.  I do not have a British passport.  In fact, I have two Irish passports because I have been afforded the opportunity to have a diplomatic passport by the Irish Government.  I speak on behalf of more than 500,000 in the North who have Irish passports.  Therefore, we are EU citizens and the issue of reciprocal rights must be addressed in the context of preserving and protecting the rights of those in the North.</p> <p>  There must be public debate.  We got the issue of transparency included in the negotiations, so we must advance the public debate when the negotiations formally commence until 19 June.  If there are to be four strands of focus in the negotiations and one of those is the Good Friday Agreement in all of its parts, we call on the Irish Government to ensure that there is no hardening of the Border.  We hear nonsense about a "frictionless" Border, whatever that means, and other terminology.  We cannot have a hardening of the Border.</p> <p>  The EU refers to the need to protect the integrity of the Single Market.  Obviously, it does not want cheap and unregulated produce coming from Britain.  Britain is not self-sufficient in terms of food, so the concern is that Britain will engage in trade deals to import cheap food that will not meet the same regulatory standards.  Therefore, the whole island of Ireland will need to be protected.</p> <p>  We must consider where the Border can and should be located.  The South will need mitigation measures, including financial support.</p><p>If a border is erected, it should be in the Irish Sea, not on the island of Ireland.  As Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile and others have touched on, if the Good Friday Agreement is to count for anything, the principle of consent needs to be considered.  We were guaranteed in the Agreement that the constitutional position of the island and of the North would not change unless we gave our consent.  That was a big pill for republicans - who believe that the country and the people are sovereign - to swallow but we swallowed it in the context of the support for the Agreement.  We did not consent to Brexit.  This will be the biggest constitutional change to happen in Ireland since partition.  We need to engage and talk about how to take forward the choice that has been given to us and outlined in the Agreement through a unity poll because it is clear with each passing day that an increasing number of people are talking about what form and shape the new Ireland would take.  We need to engage those who have concerns about that.  We would like the Government to adopt the position of the D&aacute;il to seek special designated special status for the North within the EU.  The majority voted for that and the majority of political parties in the Assembly are anti-Brexit.  We need to ensure that becomes the Government's position.  I could talk for Ireland on this issue and I appreciate the opportunity to engage with the committee.</p></speech>

The pleasure is all mine.  The more often we do this, the better.  Senator Richmond asked a good question about what we can do to improve this co-ordination, and he answered it by saying green week is the perfect week to do it.  We need to find the time and we should meet between four and eight times a year.  Currently, I am covering files on land use, land-use change and forestry, which will impact on the number of forests grown in Leitrim in order that people can intensify in Tipperary.  We need to have a debate.  I am shadowing a file on fertilisers that could lead to a change to the nitrates directive, which could solve our problems with spreading slurry based on the calendar rather than when it is or is not raining.  All that is going on.  I am also drafting a document on whistleblowing in the environmental sector for the environment committee.  That needs to be brought to this committee in order that we can have an exchange of views and in order that MEPs can show what they are doing.  It would ensure MEPs are trying hard and are doing what the people of Ireland want us to do, rather than simply taking decisions in the dark.  There is a danger of that unless we engage more with the committee.  We have the time to do it because of these green weeks and we have to find the time to do it.<br/><br/>As many speakers have said, we have engaged more with the EU and spoken more about it since the Brexit referendum.  Connected to the relationship with the European Parliament and national parliaments is the fact that our national broadcaster, to which we are forced to pay a licence fee, which would be fine if it carried out its mandate, does not show what happens in the European Parliament except for a time at which people arrive home from the pub when they are drunk or just before they go to bed.  The European Union and what happens in its institutions is vitally important to us.  It is a sick joke that RTE will not broadcast coverage of them at a time everyone can watch it.  If 12 midnight is prime time for current affairs, why are &quot;Prime Time&quot; and other current affairs programme not on then?  They are not because nobody would watch them.  If a politician's goal is to make people fond of the European Union and its institutions, hiding what we do has proven to be a major success.  There was 88% support for the EU in the most recent poll.  Why would RTE want to show what MEPs are doing and talk about the EU?  If we talked about the EU, people might be a little more sceptical and questioning of it.  I suggest that in the immediate aftermath of the Famine, people in Ireland knew more about what was happening in the House of Commons than they do about what is happening in the European Parliament now.  I have visited schools over the past number of years where I have spoken to educated people.  They do not have a clue about what we do or what the parliament is about.  They do a brilliant job teaching children but very few of them know anything about this topic.Two years ago, I was asked by a businessman whether I was still the Mayor of Roscommon.  Perhaps that is my fault.  However, we need to get people to engage.  We need to stop hiding the EU and the European Parliament and put them on national television.  We also need to come in and out of this committee room.  I need to hear the opinions of members on proposals such LULUCF.  Most people do not know what is that.<br/><br/>Last year, we celebrated 100 years since the seed was planted that grew into this State and what that meant.  The European Parliament is currently planting a seed.  We are deciding and what seed we will plant and what fertiliser to put on it as we discuss the White Paper on the Future of Europe.  Have members heard about it?  If not, they should google it and there will be a few hits from around the world.The <i>Longford Leader </i>and the <i>Roscommon People</i>are in the top ten.  This is about our future and where Europe will be in 2025.  No one is talking about that and it is as though that does not matter but the committee needs to discuss its consequences.  We are not going to carry on as we are because that is not working.  The second outcome is nothing but the Single Market.  Many countries might like that but others will not.  The third is those who want to do more should do more, the fourth is do less more efficiently and the fifth is to do much more together.  This debate has been going on since 1 March.  There is meant to be a series of debates on the future of Europe.  Where is it?  Nobody is able to tell me.  It is important that we talk about this because doing much more together, according to the document, means full engagement with NATO.  I would prefer to go with the third option.  We need a debate in the Oireachtas and on our airwaves about what are the other political parties' preferred options because we do not know.  I have done a tour of all the local radio stations - there is no chance the national stations would want to talk about it -  and each of them said they would ask their local politicians their opinion on the White Paper.  I have heard nothing since.  I would love to know those opinions and that is why it is important to engage.  It was important to engage last year to celebrate the Centenary but it is even more important to engage now to make sure we do not sleepwalk into a united states of Europe if that is not something we wish to do.  Some people were called conspiracy theorists when they came out with this in the past but it is down in black and white in the White Paper and we need to talk about it.<br/><br/>From the point of view of our budgets, it will mean we will be in the same position I was as a member of Roscommon County Council.  Ireland will get a block grant, centrally decided and we will have to take it or leave it.  Perhaps the majority of people will think that is a wonderful idea but we do not know because we have not consulted them.  I have asked a series of people where this dialogue will take place.  I asked Commissioner Hogan at the launch of the White Paper and he suggested that the MEPs, including me, do it. I asked the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs and he reckoned that it would be a divisive process.  That was not really very hopeful.</p><p>Last week I asked Jean-Claude Juncker where the process was but he could not tell me.  Two days' later, in the plenary in the European Parliament, I asked Donald Tusk.  We are a country with 88% support for the EU and one would imagine we would be only delighted to do this.  What did Donald Tusk say?  He did not answer the question.  All of this is going on now and we definitely need to know about it.  The best way to know about it is for us to come in here more often and engage with the committee.</p><p> Maybe someone can tell me where this process will take place because it will go back to the European Parliament by September.  It will have discussed it with us at that stage.  In its own words, it will have "harvested" our opinions, which it sounds like something from that sci-fi, "V" but, by September, it will not be doing that anymore.  Tick, tock, we have three months left.  It is time we engaged.</p><p> I am a sceptic, I ask questions and I am proud to say that.  I want to work with our European neighbours but I would like people to engage in what that means.  What does it mean when 88% say they are in favour of the EU?  Does it mean they want their children to end up in a European army?  Does it mean they do not want budgets?  What does it mean?  We need to know that because it is kind of important.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the invitation.  I agree, without repeating what has been said, that this is an important engagement that should be repeated as often as possible.</p> <p>  We are in a big, arguably defining moment in the European Union.  At some point in the not-too-distant future, there will be treaty change and that treaty will, more than likely, have to be put to the Irish people.  I hope when it comes to that point, we will have a national conversation that deals with the content and direction of that treaty and that we can make an informed decision, but we need to start that conversation before the referendum is called and the treaty is effectively locked down because we know what will happen at that occasion.  We will be told we need to vote "Yes" for jobs and either we support this treaty or we leave the EU, and we will have conversations around that.</p> <p>  There has been a difficulty and we need to acknowledge that the EU is in a challenging period.  The most welcome political development of the past year or so was the fact that only 35% of the French people voted for a fascist.  However, the citizens of Europe are ringing alarm bells and we need to listen to and engage with them.</p> <p>  If one looks at where the problems in which the EU finds itself arise, I would go back to the European Union constitution agreed by European leaders and put to electorates.  The electorates in France and The Netherlands rejected it.  That was the moment the EU could have woken up and realised it needed to change direction.  Instead, it came up with a formula by which it could effectively agree the same constitution but rework it in such a way that it would not have to be put to electorates.  The formula it found was the Lisbon treaty, which was a convoluted series of amendments to existing treaties.  It achieved its goal and managed to avoid having to go to electorates, except, as the committee will be aware, in our case.  The Irish people voted, not once but twice, and people had their own positions in relation to it.  Sinn F&eacute;in is the only party in this country that can say hand on heart that it accepted the democratic decision in every referendum that has been put because we accepted the democratic decision of the Nice treaty on the first occasion and even though we lost on the second occasion, we accepted that, and likewise, with the Lisbon treaty.</p> <p>  There was a promise given by David Cameron, when he first became leader of the Tory Party, that he would put the Lisbon treaty to a referendum in Britain but because of pressure from the European institutions, he back-tracked on that.  We would be in a much better situation today had he upheld that promise and the people of Britain had that referendum because we would not have the Lisbon treaty, but more than likely, we would not have Brexit either.</p> <p>  Something the committee needs to be aware of when we talk about this important engagement is the fact we are a really small delegation in the European Parliament.  There are 14 MEPs from the island of Ireland.  There are, to put it in context, 24 UKIP MEPs.  It is incredibly difficult for us to remain on top, in so far as we would like, of every development coming through the European Parliament and we need to recognise that.  There are 14 Irish MEPs out of 751.  When one puts it in context, the Germans have 97.  Almost one in seven MEPs is German.  Arguably, because of its population, it could be entitled to even more but one can see the difficulty of smaller countries asserting themselves in the European Parliament.</p> <p>  Luke 'Ming' Flanagan is correct on this point.  Not a single Irish journalist concentrates on European Parliament activities.  I am sure there are times when Members of the Oireachtas, as elected representatives, become frustrated that the good work they are doing on committees, in the Seanad and in the D&aacute;il is not getting picked up.  Imagine a scenario where there was not a single journalist based here and where the only time one showed up was when a foreign speaker visited or something along those lines.  The media in Ireland have a role to play to ensure we engage with people.  The Government, and I accept MEPs as well, have a responsibility.  </p> <p>  I visit schools, and during Green Week, we usually spend a lot of time visiting schools.  When I ask students if there are aspects of the EU they do not like, they will always name four or five decisions the EU has made they do not like.  In many cases, they are surprised when I tell them that, as much as they have every right not to like those decisions, it is not entirely Europe's fault because for every one of those decisions, an Irish Minister has sat at the Council table and signed off on it and usually his or her predecessor then points his or her finger at Europe.  We need to ensure there is a connection between what is happening at European Parliament level and at Council level and how Irish representatives are responding.</p> <p>  I am pleased Senator Richmond mentioned the CETA trade deal.  It is a big deal.  I am very critical of the deal, what it entails and how it can be managed.  Many Irish people will be surprised to hear that deal is currently being provisionally applied - in other words, it is being implemented prior to national parliaments having a vote on it, and our Minister accepted and signed up to that deal, despite the fact the only conversation or vote that was taken in the Oireachtas was a decision by the Seanad to call on her not to do that.  There has not been a debate or a vote in the D&aacute;il, despite the fact the Minister and the Taoiseach have been all over the world selling this deal that they have no democratic mandate from the Oireachtas to do.  It is a problem on which we and the committee need to work together to resolve.</p> <p>  Brexit is the biggest challenge we face as a country.  Notwithstanding all I have said in terms of a critical analysis of the EU and why it needs to change, the prospect of having one part of our country in the EU and another part outside it will be politically, economically and socially destabilising and could have serious consequences.  The Irish Government is not doing enough to address it.  Going back to the issue of media engagement with European institutions, there was a torrent of positive media on the Irish Government's position with regard to the Council position on Brexit.  It is not strong enough.  It is not as strong as the European Parliament's position which, in itself, we would like to be stronger.  Many will say the Irish Government had a diplomatic coup because it got what it asked for in the negotiations.  It did not ask for enough.  It has not been putting forward a strong enough position that will defend the rights of the people in the North who voted remain and defend the rights of the entire island and economic or our political institutions that are under threat as a result of Brexit.</p> <p>  We need to up our game.  That means we need the MEPs from across this island as well as committees, such as this one, engaging with each other and engaging with the Government, and putting pressure on the Government to ensure it accepts the majority decision of the D&aacute;il by demanding special designated status, and to go forward at a European level and demand above and beyond what is currently on offer.</p><p>The latter is not going to address the needs and wants of people not only in the Border region but also across the island.</p></speech>

Naturally, Brexit is dominating all our thinking and will continue to do so because it looks like we will continue to have this volatility and uncertainty.  The UK will be a full member for the next three years and perhaps there will need to be a transition beyond that.  This means that the UK will have its full complement of MEPs.  Could the witnesses tell us what will happen after that date, be it 2019?  When do the witnesses believe the negotiations about the so-called seamless Border we want will get serious?  Nobody wants a hard Border.  Are we not being led to believe that until the UK decides how much it will contribute to the budget for the next number of years, no serious negotiations will start?  Perhaps that will not start until some time later this year after the German elections.  I would like to hear our guests' comments on that.  There seems to be huge uncertainty beyond natural uncertainty and we are not even approaching the starting point.  They are the serious matters for us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-24a.31" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1360" speakername="Se&aacute;n Haughey" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017052400002#G00300"><p>I thank the MEPs for their presence and for their work in putting the Irish case to their colleagues in the European Parliament.  They have done great work so far but, obviously, have a lot more work to do given the fact that the final deal or deals must be agreed by the European Parliament.  Taking up the point made by Mr. Luke 'Ming' Flanagan, MEP, the Commission published the white paper on 1 March.  As Mr. Flanagan rightly said, five options are being considered.  I understand that there are to be six reflection papers on all sorts of issues, including developing the social dimension of Europe, deepening the economic and monetary union on the basis of the five presidents' reflection paper on harnessing globalisation of June 2015, the future of Europe's defence and the future of EU finances.  Is there any sign of those reflection papers being published given the timeline the witnesses outlined to us?</p> <p>  In respect of the option of a multi-speed Europe or those who want to do more - option 3 - it seems that Germany, France, Italy and Spain are pursuing that particular agenda, which must sound alarm bells for us.  Such a multi-speed Europe could involve increased co-operation on defence matters, co-operation on security and justice matters and closer co-operation on taxation and social matters.  We need to have a debate in this country about the future of Europe.  Obviously, this has come to a head with the Brexit vote and the widespread realisation that many people are alienated from the EU.  As a result, this debate is very timely.  It seems that it might be in Ireland's interests to have a multi-speed Europe because there would be some things we would not like relating to the other member states pressing ahead but perhaps this will lead to us being left behind.  The Union started off as a partnership of equal member states.  Will we move away from that?  There is also the option of further integration of the EU.  I do not think there would be much support among the Irish public for further integration of the EU.  I think Mr. Carthy said there would be treaty change.  I would not like to sell a referendum to the Irish people on further integration.</p> <p>  I agree that this is a debate in which we need to engage.  This committee needs to discuss that in the coming weeks.  It is on our agenda.  Can the witnesses give us a flavour of the views in the European Parliament across the political groupings - not necessarily their personal views?  What is the general trend with regard to where we are heading?</p></speech>

We value the opportunity to have a one-to-one discussion with our European colleagues.  I do not accept the negativity associated with the Brexit negotiations.  The Government has long since established the priority relating to the Good Friday Agreement and all that goes with it, such as the necessity of ensuring that no Border will arise during the course of these discussions that was not there before and the need to ensure the continuation of the single market and the customs union on the island of Ireland.  I do not accept that we have a weakened position or that any stone has been left unturned.  I believe the opposite is the case.  Independent commentators have repeatedly stated that the Irish MEPs and the Government, Ministers, ambassadors and the diplomatic corps have been exceptional in the way they have driven Ireland's case in the context of Brexit.  That is the first thing we need to establish.  People can have their own independent opinions but that is a fact.</p> <p>  I have been a supporter of the European concept since 1973.  I have campaigned in favour of every referendum held on Europe and have spoken on public platforms during each campaign so I am committed to the concept of Europe for a reason that is quite simple to everybody.  This country has developed beyond belief within the EU.  Ireland has become a major player.  We have shown what we can do.  We can achieve heights we never thought possible.  Ireland can now be regarded as a major player on the European scene to such an extent that in the aftermath of the economic crisis we experienced, we have led the field in the context of recovery.  Of course, there were huge sacrifices by the Irish people but we proved what we were capable of doing when given the chance.</p> <p>  That is the point relating to the future of Europe as well.  Of course, there are changes but we need to be careful not to go down the road of ensuring that every country in the EU will impose its own will on the Union because the bigger the country, the more its will is imposed.  We need to bring what we have committed and what is advantageous and complementary to the concept of Europe to the table of discussions in Europe as it is now emerging and will emerge in the future.  We have the opportunity to discuss all directives in committees and they have all been discussed in committees from time to time.  Each lead Department has a sub-committee that discusses all directives coming from Europe.  Sometimes we are successful and sometimes we are not but the point to remember is that it is all very fine for people to blame Europe when it suits them and that is what happens.  This is why there is an antipathy towards Europe.  It suits some people at national level in all member states to blame the Europeans and say they are the cause of problems.  We should remember that it was not the EU that put up the barriers and barbed wire to greet the refugees a year and a half ago.  It was a well-known fact that it was individual member states that put the barriers and the razor wire to greet the refugees coming across the borders.  We should separate the blanket blame of Europe for an identification of where difficulties arise, what caused them and how we can resolve them.</p> <p>  Ireland is not leaving the EU.  It is a fully-paid-up and committed member of the Union and that is what we must establish.  It is within the capacity of the British Government to negotiate a situation that allows us to do the things the Taoiseach, various Ministers and Opposition Members have already set out, that is, retain what we have had relating to the all-island trading situation, including the customs union.  It is possible for the British Government to agree to that.</p><p>That is a matter for it.  They are the people who are leaving the Union.  It is also possible and a natural progression within the European Union that we will be in a position to trade with the UK afterwards, along with all the other member states.  We are part of that group no matter which way we turn.  It is quite a strong position to be in.  Far from being negative and pessimistic about the future, we have a great deal to play for.  It is all to play for.  In fact, we can come very well out of the debate which is now taking place and which will ultimately take place with our European colleagues.  I have no doubt that we will be successful.</p></speech>

I go back to the very first thing that Ms Mairead McGuinness asked today, namely "How?".  We can talk all day, but at the end of the day how do we sit down and have an interaction that is meaningful and which will have an impact on my role or that of any of the other MEPs on legislation?  I think Ms McGuinness was also there when we had a dial-up one day from the Parliament.  I am not talking about the opinion stuff, but when someone is in charge of or shadowing a legislative dossier that impacts here, there should be a connection set up with a sectoral committee.  It might be the person who initiates that or someone else.  I might want to initiate it for example.  I am shadowing the accessibility Act, which is legislative, and 883, which is a hugely important document.  Who do I contact?  I am a bit like Henry Kissinger who asked "Who do I call if I want to call Europe?".  Who do I contact to get feedback from a relevant committee on that issue?  That is the first question.</p> <p>  I will not talk about Brexit because a great deal has been said.  I agree with everything that has been said.  I do not want to be party political, but if one were to rely on the newspapers, one would think the only people who worked on this were from the Government.  I accept that they did a great deal of good work.  Equally, however, a lot of people in the Parliament put huge effort into this to ensure that Parliament's resolution was as positive as it is.  That is never recognised.  People think we are a talking shop in the Parliament and that we do not do a great deal more.  I will not get into that debate.  We have heard enough about it.</p> <p>  I agree with Ming that we need to discuss the White Paper because it is out there.  Deputy Haughey asked about some of the reflection papers.  The one on globalisation was discussed the week before last in the Parliament and I spoke on it.  Indeed, I raised the issue of the trade deals and the recent judgment from the ECJ which did not make a judgment on the rights and wrongs in relation to these investment courts.  That has yet to come.  Thankfully, the Belgian Parliament sent that to the ECJ.  The court said that all member states had to agree individually to the inclusion of the investor court in any trade deal.  That is an issue the committee will be discussing here.</p> <p>  To finish with the White Paper, it requires discussion.  It must be a reasonable discussion in which we look at all of the options.  People will have various options but within the next year or two we could be on that road.  We may not be, but we could be.  The Oireachtas needs to discuss it as well.  They have also come forward with a lot of policies under the social pillar.  To mention one or two, they came forward with a work-life balance directive which, for the first time ever, proposed a carer's leave directive and parental paternity leave.  That is the package under the social pillar, of which there are five different aspects.  That is ongoing and being debated at length in the Parliament.  I am not sure, however, whether people are aware of it.</p> <p>  Deputy Martin Kenny referred to the EU as an elite club.  I have been an MEP for 13 years and as I sit here I wonder if this is my fault.  Am I not doing enough to tell people what happens at European level?  Am I not meeting enough people and going to enough schools?  Am I failing to engage?  Without blowing my own trumpet, and I presume it is the same for everyone here, I could not do more than I do.  Is there is a democratic deficit and do people see it as an elite club or is it just a phrase people use?  All MEPs engage extensively nationally and throughout their constituencies.  There are only 11 of us, however.  If we are going to say that, we have to be able to say what more needs to be done to bridge the gap.</p></speech>

I am with Ms Harkin about the use of terms like "elite club".  None of us regards ourselves as part of an elite.  We are elected by people on the ground.  We fight to get elected.  It is important to say that we represent part of the institutions so there is sometimes that view.</p> <p>  People are talking about the future of Europe in Ireland.  One of the scenarios that is not in the paper is disintegration.  People should not underestimate disintegration which can happen by accident or design.  Brexit has been a wake-up call and it is making people understand where Europe works as well as charging us with the responsibility to fix those things which are not working.  It is an opportunity.  People I meet are talking about Europe.  My colleagues mentioned visits to schools.  I was at a school in Kiltimagh yesterday which had references on the walls to the First and Second World Wars.  We are forgetting the history of Europe.  Sometimes people say it is boring and that we should forget the past.  The day we forget the past is the day we will rue.  If we do not remember our roots, which are in peace, we will not have a future.  Indeed, the peace process in Northern Ireland was assisted greatly by the European Union.  I am always happy to go to a school.  The children talk about conflict and war and then we talk about what Europe has done to build peace.</p> <p>  The White Paper is not about picking an option and running with it, it is about opening a debate.  That debate happens everywhere.  I do not know if it should be structured.  Certainly, I am having meetings about it all the time.  Others are doing that also.  It will not be a case of picking three or four.  It will be pieces of each.  The first question we have to answer is whether we believe the concept of Europe is worth defending, protecting and fixing.  If we do that, we can work towards solutions, taking into account that other countries might have different views.  We can work together to find a solution that moves us, hopefully, in a more positive direction.</p> <p>  I was in Letterkenny and Martina Anderson was also there.  We had a very important meeting on Monday where we spoke to stakeholders about Brexit.  The fishing sector is one about which I am very concerned because there could be war at sea, apart from the trouble we will have on land.  The real tragedy and sadness I have around Brexit is that the people of Northern Ireland do not have an assembly.  An assembly would be a good way for the political voices to be heard.  We face a UK election in which the issue of Brexit and its impact on the island of Ireland is not sufficiently or at all being addressed.  I am happy that I can articulate the concerns of stakeholders from Northern Ireland and not just listen to them on a Monday but reflect them with Michel Barnier and my colleagues in the EPP.  Elmar Brok sits on the Sherpa committee of the Brexit negotiators.  He came to the Border region and he really saw.  Seeing is believing.  He also travelled into Northern Ireland and met community groups.  He reflected very strongly his concern about the great fears in Northern Ireland for Brexit.</p> <p>  While we are here today to worry about the difficulties, people should not underestimate the progress we have made and our capacity and responsibility as politicians to find solutions.  Regarding Brexit, we have to put our fingers in our ears until after the UK has its election in the hope that some of what I hear or read on Twitter will be tempered when the negotiations begin.</p><p>It will require both sides to go into the room with less emotion than perhaps currently exists.</p><p> I suggest that I can address some of the individual concerns separately through email or through another conversation.</p></speech>

I will touch on some points briefly because I realise we are conscious of time.  There is a major discussion around engagement and meeting.  Surely it is not beyond possibility to get a timetable to match Oireachtas Members, including Senators and Deputies, with MEPs to enable them to meet up on a more frequent basis.  I was elected in 2016.  I am not aware of any regular or frequent meetings to exchange views.</p> <p>  Perhaps the reason Brexit has happened is because many people have felt in general terms a disconnect between national and European politicians.  Many may take the view that much of the policy and legislation is being given to them in a dictatorial way rather than their having an input into how it affects them.  That is important because when we meet people on the street on a weekly or daily basis, they say their issue is that they are not being listened to and that some of the policies and legislation that come through are not reflective of their views or of how they affect people.  There is an understanding that there is a major disconnect between Europe in different countries, including Ireland, as well as between the various stakeholders, including businesses and private individuals.  We need to consider how that can be resolved and dealt with before it becomes a greater issue than it is at the moment.</p> <p>  One outcome from Brexit is that it has brought this problem into focus.  I have a suggestion for when the various policies that MEPs are involved in or shadowing are being drawn up and which affect Ireland.  I suggest that process could be linked into the appropriate Department at national level.  From there it could be sent to the various committees to get feedback.</p> <p>  There is no doubt that legislation is coming from Europe as it has done before.  It has affected people across all sectors of the community in many ways.  Europe has been positive, but negatives have been attached to it as well.  Some of that has happened and people feel it at different levels.  Politicians have had no input in that regard.  That is an issue and it cannot be beyond the bounds of possibility.  We should not be scratching our heads too much or wondering how we can communicate and engage better.  That is something that we should consider and it should be possible to fix it easily enough.</p> <p>  I am keen to hear the views of the MEPs present and the views of their fellow MEPs.  What is their view on the Irish position and special circumstances or status applying to us, given all the issues we know about?  There is no point in me outlining them again.  What is the view on protecting our interests as a small isolated island with a small population that depends heavily on exports?  With that in mind, what discussions are happening regarding exports to the UK?  It is a market on which we are heavily dependent.  The same applies to exports via the UK.  I know from being involved in the small and medium-sized business sector that this is a major problem.  What discussions or supports are engaged, when this is happening at European level, to consolidate the Irish position and to ensure that it does not negatively impact on us, if at all?  That is important especially in the food and agriculture sectors and everything that goes with them.</p> <p>  We are talking about Europe and the future of Europe.  Many countries might start to think that it is trendy to leave Europe based on what happened in the United Kingdom.  There is anecdotal evidence suggesting that if a referendum was put to people in other EU countries, they would consider leaving the EU.  Bearing that in mind, what is being done at European level to ensure that Europe is seen as a positive thing and seen as coming back to engage with national governments and the people they are representing to ensure that it is all-inclusive and reflective?  That piece of the jigsaw has been disconnected in recent years.</p></speech>

If we are committed to an engagement here, we should not be putting the word of so-called independent experts in front of what he brandishes as individual opinions of MEPs here.  As Ms McGuinness has said, rightly, all MEPs come with a vast mandate in their own right.  When MEPs are raising legitimate concerns we should not simply dismiss them and put independent experts, nameless as they are, ahead of them.  In that spirit, I wish to reference the comments of my colleague, Deputy Martin Kenny.  I do not share the view that when he was referring to an elite club he had MEPs in mind.  I believe it was those elements of the structures that do not necessary have the mandate that Ms McGuinness and her colleagues have.  That is the concern for us.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the absence of the Northern Ireland Assembly.   I would love to see it.  We could have the assembly up-and-running tomorrow if the political will existed to fulfil outstanding agreements.  I do not believe it is too much to ask that those agreements are implemented.  However, we are not going to get into a political discussion on that.  The point I wanted to make was that when we had the assembly, the British Government put little stake in the views of it.  As the British Government has absolutely no support for the expressed democratic mandate of the people in the North, why would it listen to the assembly?  It certainly did not listen when the assembly was up and functioning.</p> <p>  We have talked about the arrangements of the Good Friday Agreement and other issues of a cross-Border nature.  The elephant in the rooms is any manifestation of a hard border.  For me, the question is the exploitation of the re-emergence of a hard border by people who are opposed to the peace process.  We know that the Irish Government is scoping out sites for customs checks.  It has conceded as much on the floor of both Houses.  This comes back to the point Ms Martina Anderson made earlier about the platitudes and plam&aacute;s around no return to a hard border, borders of the past and frictionless borders.  What engagement have MEPs have thus far to ensure that from a European perspective there is no return to a border?  If there is a return to a border, then surely that is a definitive clear physical alteration and undermining of the integrity and sanctity of the Good Friday Agreement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-24a.41" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n Kelly" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017052400002#J00500"><p>I thank the committee members for all the contributions and thoughts.  MEPs, the Irish Government and Irish civil society have done a great job thus far in ensuring that the concerns of Ireland are taken into account.  This is reflected in the position of the European Parliament and the position of the Council.  Michel Barnier is a member of the EPP.  This process started when I, as leader of the Fine Gael delegation, wrote to Mr. Barnier and asked him to meet all Irish MEPs.  He did so and we have been engaging as a group ever since.  That is important.</p> <p>  The Irish position is now one of the three major points.  The other two are easy enough and are controversial because they involve the rights of European Union citizens and United Kingdom citizens.  Our concern relates to the Border.  There is recognition of it.  As Ms McGuinness has said, we have done a good deal of work and we brought them to the Border.  Michel Barnier went to see the Border.  This is where we need to keep up the flow of discussion.</p> <p>  Ms Anderson and others have mentioned transparency.  As the negotiations go through, we have to see how things are progressing to ensure that the commitments in place now are honoured.  That will be a task for us.  That is where we need to relate to the committee and that aspect will be important.</p> <p>  Senator Coghlan referred to the big issue, which is the question of the exit bill for the British.  That is going to produce a major dispute.  There was a dispute on the question in the European Parliament last week.  Essentially, the view of the European Union is that a commitment is in place and the programmes and projects and so on are under way.  These have to be funded and they will certainly be funded until the end of the multi-annual financial framework.  Last week, Michel Barnier put it to the British people that when a person goes to a restaurant, before he leaves, he settles the bill.  That is where it is.</p><p>There is going to be a lot of discussion on that.  Unless the British change their attitude, it will be difficult.  At the moment, they are playing to their electorate but if they change, it will be possible to do these things.</p><p> I am the only Irish member of the International Trade Committee of the Parliament, INTA.  I am totally in favour of trade deals and we have benefited more than any other country from the Canadian deal on account of having a lot of interaction with Canada.  The European Court of Justice made a decision last week on the Singapore agreement, which will apply to future agreements and to CETA.  The ruling states that most of the deal comes under European competence but that the dispute resolutions system, the ISDS, has to be negotiated and agreed by all Parliaments.  This will help rather than hinder the situation.</p><p> Deputy Durkan spoke about blaming Europe.  Unfortunately, one of the worst culprits is our EPP colleague, Mr. Orb&aacute;n, the Prime Minister of Hungary, and I said so much at a meeting of the EPP group last week.  I criticised his populist approach and for blaming Brussels for this and that and I am hopeful that the message will get through.  As the Deputy pointed out, such people are part of the decision-making process and in Mr. Orb&aacute;n's case this is as a Prime Minister and in the European Parliament.</p><p> Marian Harkin asked who we could speak to about our files.  I am involved in the climate file and am dealing with renewable energy, the energy performance of buildings and energy efficiency.  I could talk to Deputy Eamon Ryan and his colleagues but I need to speak to more members.  Engagement at national parliament level is important.  All the lobbyists come to us.  They have vested interests and that is okay but we need politicians in national parliaments, and not just the Greens, to give us a broader view.</p></speech>

The negotiations are scheduled to end in March 2019.  Under the current allocation, this will mean no more MEPs in the North.  However, the first phase of the negotiations is about acquired rights as Irish citizens and, under Article 9 of the treaty, we should receive equal attention, while Article 10 states that we should be directly represented.  We would argue that the Irish Government should get additional seats, and not just the one to which Senator Leyden referred, and that these should be on a range of bodies.  As Deputy Durkan said, there is sometimes a blame game but all of us have heard horrendous news today, about something which is happening day by day at the moment.  Some 30 people - men, women, little boys and girls - have drowned in the Mediterranean because member states want to keep them out rather than keep them safe.  The support the Parliament has given to Frontex in this area and the role the latter has played are alarming and shocking.  The Mediterranean has, to quote Pope Francis, turned into a &quot;floating cemetery&quot;.  It is Europe's sinking shame.  Shame on all of us who witness it but do nothing about it.<br/><br/>Senator Coghlan spoke about the negotiations.  The British Government wants the negotiations to take place in secret but transparency is important.  Deputy Martin Kenny referred to elites and Deputy O'Rourke mentioned the disconnect between the EU and its people.  The Commission has too much power.  It has the power of initiative but it is not an elected body, it is not like the Council and it does not represent the people.  There is a list of reforms that need to be made.  The Europe citizens' initiative was referenced by Matt Carthy and there was a finding last week of the European Court of Justice in this area.  State-aid rules need also to be looked at.<br/><br/>Let there be no doubt about one thing: we want an assembly in the North.  We need an assembly predicated on good governance based on respect, equality and integrity.  The late Martin McGuinness confounded the naysayers ten years ago by establishing the Executive with the late Ian Paisley.  It was Martin McGuinness who called time on the <i>status quo</i>and said that there would be no return to it.  Deputies and Senators will agree that an assembly needs to be built on good governance based on respect, integrity and rights.<br/><br/>Deputy O'Rourke also asked about how a special status was being discussed and engaged on.  A united Ireland would be a solution to Europe's Brexit problem, as well as being a solution for this island.  That is evident for many of those who have engaged with us.  My colleagues, Lynn Boylan and Liadh N&iacute; Riada, and I have engaged with hundreds of MEPs about the circumstances of the North, on ensuring that the Good Friday Agreement is protected and preserved in all of its parts and in the context of making sure that there will be no hardening of the Border.  It is understood that mitigation is required for the island as regards trade with Britain and Irish unity seems to many people to be the obvious solution.  It is a no-brainer.  We all have to play a part in taking this forward.  I call on the Irish Government to reach out to and engage with the Protestant and unionist-loyalist community who have concerns about their identity being protected in an all-island structure.  We need a Green Paper on Irish unity, or something like that, from the Government to guarantee that their rights and entitlements would be respected and upheld and that what happened to the nationalist-republican community in the North will never be foisted on them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-24a.44" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Matt Carthy" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017052400002#K00300"><p>Deputy Durkan proved my point on media engagement by referring to the analysis of the Taoiseach's and the Government's performance in the Council negotiations.  This analysis was largely written by people who had not been in Brussels for the past 12 months, let alone engaged with the negotiations.  The lead piece  in <i>The Irish Times</i>was written by its London correspondent.  We need an engaged media and people who will hold us all to account as MEPs and Government representatives.<br/><br/>I agree with everything Deputy Martin Kenny said.  Elites can be elected.  An elite is a disengaged political class and comprises people who deliberately or negligently ignore what citizens are asking them to do.  At European level, notwithstanding everything Se&aacute;n Kelly and others have said, there is a big problem in this regard.</p><p>The EU engagement with trade agendas in the recent past has been the best example of that, where it has gone out of its way to ignore, misinform and, in some cases, block any debate in regard to what trade deals will mean for vulnerable sectors such as the agricultural sector or domestic indigenous SMEs and what the real output will be.  As we have from the start, we are asking for an open conversation on the net impacts of trade deals.  For example, the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, has led to an additional 50,000 tonnes of Canadian beef entering the EU market.  No one can tell what impact that will have on the Irish beef market because nobody has bothered to find out.  Nobody has carried out an analysis of what it will mean, yet Ireland has signed up to it.  Regardless of the Deputy's position on the matter, there should be a public debate about it.  There is a very good chance that the provision of an EU investor court system for resolving disputes between investors and states will be put to a referendum.  As I said earlier, I do not want such a referendum to take place in a vacuum where the only option is to accept it or Ireland will leave the EU.  We need to have a conversation about whether Ireland wants to be part of this type of scenario.</p><p> Deputy O'Rourke asked two questions which are crucial in regard to how we move forward.  The first addressed the position of MEPs and other European leaders regarding our concerns about Brexit.  Although I am usually very critical, I admit that there is an openness at European level to addressing the issues that we have raised.  The EU has more understanding than the British Government of the implications of Brexit for the island of Ireland and the Border, in particular.  Our colleagues in the British Parliament do not comprehend our discussion in terms of the dangers of a hard Border.  Perhaps the understanding of the EU on this issue is because it has more awareness of what land borders mean and the challenges and hindrances they can create.  On the evidence of people to whom we have spoken, there is no resistance at European level to a formula that allows the North to remain part of the Single Market and the customs union, to draw down EU funding and continue to have rights in terms of European Parliament elections.  The only places from which resistance to such solutions will come are this country or our neighbours across the water.  We must ensure that, if there is resistance, it does not come from Irish political leaders.  People need to work together.</p><p> Deputy O'Rourke also asked about the prospect of other countries leaving the EU.  In the short term, there is no prospect of any other country leaving the European Union.  That is probably primarily influenced by the apparent mess that the British Government is making of its exit.  In the short term, no electorate would leave the EU, even if they were given an option to do so.  That is mainly due to a threat and fear of what leaving the EU would entail as opposed to a sense of ownership and belonging to the EU.  That is not a good foundation on which to move a political project forward.  As I said earlier, unless the EU moves towards a situation where citizens across Europe want to belong to and feel they have ownership of the EU project, it is a foundation built on quicksand and does not have a future that we would like.  All witnesses and members here today accept the EU is an important concept and has an important role to play in the future of this country and other EU member states.  If we do not engage with European leaders to ensure they begin to engage with citizens and national parliaments in a way they should have been doing and should do, I fear what the future prospects may be.</p></speech>

The article indicates that the price of beef is higher in Canada than in Ireland and there would currently be little interest in pursuing the agreement.  Sometimes, details such as that make a difference.</p></speech>

The issue of the Border has arisen in regard to Brexit.  The Border is approximately 500 km long.  The constituency I represent stretches along it for almost 100 km, from Belturbet to Pettigo.  I am, therefore, acutely aware of the impact that closing roads, putting up checkpoints and so on would have.  It is agreed that is not wanted.  The British Prime Minister, Theresa May, has said that nobody wants to return to the Borders of the past.  It is understood that the EU wants to protect the Single Market and the integrity of that market.  All members of the committee want that also.  However, there is a discrepancy because one can have one or the other but it is very difficult to have both.  One cannot have a free and open border and at the same time protect the integrity of the market.  That issue needs to be understood.  Britain's position so far has been that it wants to leave the customs union and so on.  If it does so, that will cause serious problems for people on the island of Ireland.  There is recognition of that across Europe.  That situation would be resolved by the island of Ireland having special status.</p> <p>  I was glad to hear Ms McGuinness mention the fishing issue.  The issue of Irish territorial waters is important.  Our fishing industry, which is one of the most vocal industries about getting a raw deal from Europe, is extremely concerned that if British territorial waters are taken out of the EU, where will the boats currently fishing there go if not into Irish waters?  We need to negotiate what Ireland's position will be after Brexit.</p> <p>  No one at this meeting is opposed to trade deals.  They are always good.  However, for whom are they good?  People are concerned by the secondary and tertiary effects which trade deals have on other industries and which may not be evident on the surface.  We must be careful that vulnerable industries in peripheral countries such as Ireland will not be negatively affected by trade deals.  No one is saying there should not be trade deals.  There should be.  However, we must ensure there is protection for industries in Ireland and other places on Europe's periphery where trade deals could have negative effects.</p></speech>

It is fascinating when members of Sinn F&eacute;in speak in regard to trade deals because there is the obvious problem of being in favour of trade deals and simultaneously in favour of protectionism.  I found Mr. Carthy's contribution very interesting.  People who have a problem with trade deals only look at the inward, not the outward.  The outward is the benefit.  Ireland is a small island.  Trade deals are of great benefit to it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-24a.50" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1310" speakername="Colm Brophy" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017052400002#L00600"><p>If Mr. Carthy will allow me to respond, he can then reply with the permission of the Chairman.  Trade deals and our involvement in the EU are the real opportunity for an island such as Ireland.  Economic growth on this island in terms of jobs, people and small, vulnerable businesses could not be sustained without comprehensive trade deals which allow us to be have a disproportionately large export sector compared to that we would have without trade deals and certainly compared to that we would have were we outside the EU.  Facts are important.  One can speak of how the EU is built and whether its citizens want to remain as citizens.  The establishment of the European Union was probably the best peace agreement ever signed.  People should remember that before it is put at risk.  Most EU citizens wish to remain in the EU.   When they really think about it, the people of Europe, not just political elites, want to remain members of the EU.  All polls conducted in Ireland on this issue indicate that the majority of people on the island of Ireland are very positive towards the EU.  It is worth bearing in mind that while problems may exist, and I appreciate that certain political parties have historical problems with the EU and its institutions, the real threat which Ireland faces is that people discussing Brexit fail to recognise that Ireland is stronger with its European partners.</p><p>It is not us setting up ideological divides.  It is not us trying to have a go at Europe on the side while talking about endorsing it at the centre.  We need to be integral, with our European partners, in negotiating a solution with the UK.</p><p> Unfortunately, the UK has chosen to leave.  I think it is the worst decision that Britain has ever made, as a country.  I would be much happier if it had chosen to remain, and I campaigned for Britain to remain.  We have all lost by the UK leaving.  We and our EU partners must negotiate a deal, which I believe is possible.  After the UK general election is over I believe a mindset will develop, over the next two years, within British politics that will be better disposed to recognising the fact that even if Britain cannot remain within the EU it can do a deal with the EU that benefits both sides.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-24a.55" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017052400002#M00500"><p>I apologise for having to leave the room for a minute.  I would like to address a couple of points that have arisen.</p><p>Members across the room have given the impression that somehow the Irish Government or Irish politicians are not committed to doing what is necessary in the present climate.  Please be assured that they are.  The Taoiseach has repeatedly laid the groundwork.  The constant chipping away, criticism and undermining of the ability of Irish institutions to carry the day is not a good thing.  All of the political parties in this House, as far as I am aware, sing off the same hymn sheet.</p><p>Let me explain trade deals.  In 1989, the GDP <i>per capita</i>in this country was half that of the countries in the European Free Trade Association, EFTA, which was half that of the United States.  The only country in the European Union that came close to our GDP was Luxembourg.  Since then, Ireland has reached the position of being on par with all of the leaders in the European Union, which did not happen overnight or without the commitment of the European Union and the Irish people.  It is a fact of life now and is a major achievement.</p><p>I have been amazed by some of the things alluded to by Sinn F&eacute;in's MEP, Mr. Matt Carthy.  I heard a reference in the House, not so long ago, to the effect that the policy was akin to Tory policy.  I heard that we would move away from the European Union concept altogether and return to free trade agreement.  That is Tory policy and is what they want.  That is why the Tories are leaving the European Union.  The Tory party is committed to that policy.  Who wins in that situation?  The bigger country always wins.  That is why we have trade deals.  They protect smaller countries.  Trade deals also provide collegiality in terms of the need to address the issues that arise and they deal with them, accordingly.  If one country falls out then all of the countries fall out, which makes a huge difference.  </p><p>I want to mention the possibility of protectionism.  As the Chairman and everyone else seated around this table knows as well as I do, protectionism is not the answer because of who wins.  The bigger country wins.  The bigger economic bloc always wins.</p><p>I compliment Ms Martina Anderson on one thing.  There is an urgent need to have an Assembly in Northern Ireland.  It would be hugely beneficial to what we in this part of the island are trying to do.  It would be hugely beneficial to the outcome of the negotiations that are taking place.</p><p>I have one reservation.  We tend to blame the European Commission for lots of things.  We can sack the European Commission but we cannot sack the European Parliament if it does something wrong.  I mean no disrespect to anybody seated around the table, the European Parliament occasionally goes off on a tangent from time to time and produces reports that are not in our interest, although I shall not go into it in too much detail.  I believe that we should work with what we have.  We have an agenda to chart the agreement that this part of the island needs to ensure the future of the island of Ireland, as we have already repeatedly stated.  We are not watering that down.  We are not taking advice from anyone on how to do so because we know what to do.</p><p>Finally, I am always irked when people say &quot;we will get the best deal that we can&quot;.  That is a sign of defeatism before one starts.  Who enters negotiations with a mindset to get the best deal that one can?  Immediately one's opponent will say: &quot;We will limit the best deal that you will get from here on in.&quot;  I firmly believe that the world is our oyster.  I believe that we can get a better deal than we had before, without a shadow of a doubt.  We hope that a reconstituted Assembly in Northern Ireland is established as quickly as possible with a view to ensuring that we have the assistance that we need in this part of the island to achieve our goals.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-24a.57" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1294" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017052400002#M00700"><p>I watched proceedings on a screen upstairs.  I wish to mention one concern, on behalf of the Green Party.  I disagree with Deputy Durkan's belief because there are differing views.  Ireland is really concerned about Brexit.  The visit by Michel Barnier here two weeks ago deepened my concern.  I firmly believe a clear message has been given that the free movement of people on our island would be accommodated but there will be no flexibility on the European side in the trade of goods and services.  That leaves us all in an incredibly difficult situation.</p> <p>  I do not agree with the Tories on anything.  David Davis, the Tory Brexit negotiator, has said that the European Union is assisting us with the sequence.  I do not believe that is right for us as a country.  We have been told that the Irish Border issues will be examined first.  One cannot resolve that unless one knows the wider trade issue in terms of goods and services.  Perhaps the people issues will be dealt with first but the key critical issues, such as Irish agriculture, will not be dealt with.     </p> <p>  I urge our European Parliamentarians, on our behalf, to tell their European colleagues that Ireland does not have to insist on a two-tier process.  Why should we not start negotiations on some areas where we can get agreement, such as energy policy, climate and environmental standards, that are not part of the complex trade arrangements?  We should start with some points of agreement.  I believe that we are increasingly heading towards a crash-out Brexit process where we get no transitional deal.  Ireland will be the worst affected in that regard.  The Irish Government must go the European Council meeting on 22 June, presumably we will have a new Taoiseach by then, and start saying to our European colleagues that they must break away from this and that we will only negotiate on two strands.  First, we have a very short timeline.  Second, it risks a crash-out process.  Third, it does not address the fundamental Irish issues on how we deal in trades and services.  From what I heard Michel Barnier say, he will not allow any movement on this matter.  The customs border will be the customs board if the UK is not in the customs union.  That is a real concern of mine.  We need to change strategy and policy in the sequencing of the talks.  The UK will have to give up on everything because it does not have a negotiating position.  It is not as I am saying we should yield to the UK.  Why must we stick to the issue of sequencing?  David Davis has said that it will be the row of the summer.  If so, then Ireland should say: "Come on, step back from the cliff edge.  The cliff edge does not suit us." </p></speech>

The Deputy has missed the following piece.  It has been mentioned that if sufficient progress is made on the three issues we will look at the transition plus the trade agreement.  It is not as if one must be finished before negotiations begin on the other.  A more nuanced approach must be adopted.</p> <p>  The European Parliament would like to debate the new trading partnership by October of this year.  We cannot let the UK off the hook.  It opted out of the European Union, which will have a clear impact on us.  We cannot say to the UK that we will sort everything out in its direction.  I have had frank discussions with David Davis on this issue and know that he understands the EU's perspective.  I do not share the entire optimism of Deputy Durkan right now nor Deputy Ryan's pessimism.  I believe that if all of us, as elected representatives, and the UK look to the rights and needs of citizens first we will work through all of the structural issues to formulate a deal that works for people, business and communities.  That is what we are paid to do. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-24a.59" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Matt Carthy" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017052400002#N00100"><p>Obviously people misheard what I said.  I have a very clear position on the CETA, the TTIP and other deals, as well as on the investment state dispute settlement because I believe it to be extremely dangerous.  What I said was that we should have a frank and open debate on what exactly these deals meant and make a judgment call on what they meant for Ireland and let people make up their minds.  My position was reinforced when people jumped up and seized on the very notion that we should even have a debate on these questions as if, somehow, all of a sudden we were opposed to free trade or in favour of protectionism.  I said nothing of the sort and neither has any representative of Sinn F&eacute;in.  The concept that because one supports the European Union one cannot be critical of what it does is exactly the one that led us into the difficulties with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, whereby because we support its work we cannot question or criticise any particular element of that work.  We know the mess we are in in that regard.  Frankly, this is on a much lower scale than some of the fundamental deficiencies with the democratic accountability of the European Union.  If those of us who support it do not stand up and demand that these inefficiencies, as well as its ineffectiveness and, frankly, unaccountability, be addressed, we are doomed to see huge fundamental failures.</p> <p>  Let me state when Sinn F&eacute;in MEPs are most comfortable at European Parliament level.  We are most comfortable when we are able to adopt a single position with the Irish Government, the permanent representatives and our fellow Irish MEPs and we go into the European Parliament to battle with a united voice for Ireland.  However, we do not ignore failures on the part of the Government and-or our colleagues when we believe they are taking positions that could be to the detriment of the people who elected us and will make no apologies for doing so.</p></speech>

Durkan that there will be elections in May 2019 and that he will have an opportunity to rehire or fire us.  A little like the Commission, we can be got rid of, too, and the Deputy will have plenty of opportunities to do so.  </p> <p>  I am a little worried that we have been designated as a special case because the last time the European institutions designated us as a special case we ended up with a debt of tens of billions of euro.  Some would like to say it disappeared into thin air, but it did not.  As a result of our being designated as a special case, in the past two years we borrowed &euro;6 billion.  On what did we spend it?  We spent it on nothing.  We eviscerated it and got rid of it.  We, therefore, need to be wary about being granted special case status.  If a dog on my estate bites a child, it will be lucky to get a second chance.  We have been more than bitten, we have been devoured.  Therefore, we need to be wary.</p> <p>  Deputy Frank O'Rourke asked about the position of other MEPs.  I presume he meant their position on the future of Europe.  A particular MEP, Guy Verhofstadt, the lead negotiator on behalf of the European Parliament, is quite clear.  Option No. 5 would not go far enough for him.  He wants to sit down beside people to tell them what they should eating for dinner.  That is the sort of European Union he wants and that is where it is inclined to go.  At our group meeting Jean-Claude Juncker was clear enough on where he wanted it to go, as is Emmanuel Macron.  They all want to move towards further integration.  People might think this is wonderful, but we have to have a debate on the issue.</p> <p>  I tried to establish when the discussion on the future of Europe would take place by asking Commissioner Phil Hogan, Jean-Claude Juncker, Donald Tusk and the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, but each and every one of them could not tell me much about it.  We were promised that, to encourage debate, the European Commission, together with the European Parliament and interested member states, would host a series of debates on the future of Europe in European cities and regions to engage with national parliaments, local and regional authorities and civil society at large.  Having attempted to establish when and where these debates will take place, I am on the verge of giving up because no one who should know about them seems to knows anything about them.  Whether people are in favour of option one, two, three, four or five, we have to have this discussion.  I have to have it because my children will be living in the European Union and I want it to be the best possible.  If we are not going to discuss the issue, if we are going to be afraid of and run away from it, I can only conclude it will not be good for us.  It terrifies me that even a country such as ours which supposedly is 88% in favour of EU membership is afraid to discuss it.  If we are that much in favour of it, we should not only not be afraid to discuss it, we should also hear what the dates of the meetings are, as opposed to hearing from the Vice President of the European Parliament that nothing really will happen and that people will hold their own private meetings.  The debate needs to be held in public, not in the dark.</p> <p>  Do not mix up correlation and causation.  One would swear that if we had not joined the European Union in 1973, the iPhone would never have been invented and that we would still be driving around in 20 diesel tractors.  No, we would not.  Things would have changed.  It should be remembered that we had peace before what happened in Nice.  Next time someone says there have been no wars on the continent of Europe, tell him or her to have a little respect for the people who lived in the former Yugoslavia.  I think we can call what took place a war.  God knows, there was enough blood spilled.</p></speech>

They were open meetings at which we had great discussions on many things, including the future of Europe.  I suggest the committee write to the Commission office in Dublin to find out exactly, as requested by an MEP colleague, about the consultation process.  The information should not be closed off.  If meetings are being held, we should note the dates.  Speaking for myself, I will continue to do what I normally do, which is to engage in public.</p></speech>

I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and her officials.  On behalf of the select committee, I also welcome Mr. John Costello, chairperson of the parole board, and those of his colleagues who may be in attendance.  </p> <p>  Before dealing with the Bill section by section, would Deputy Jim O'Callaghan like to speak?

I acknowledge the role the T&aacute;naiste has played in dealing with this Private Members' Bill, the broad principle of which she has accepted and on which she is happy to work.  I am conscious of the fact that I have had engagement with the Department of Justice and Equality, which I welcome.  A lot of amendments have been tabled.  Deputies Mick Wallace and Clare Daly have tabled amendments, as have I.  In fairness to the T&aacute;naiste, she has adopted the sensible approach that we will let the amendments go through and that the main Government amendments will come through on Report Stage.  We may also have further amendments to propose on Report Stage, albeit probably not be too many.  This is a worthwhile process.  The most important point is not that it is my Bill or anyone else's but that we get it right.  I am not proprietorial about the Bill and acknowledge the work the Department has done on it.  We all agree that the legislation is long overdue.  Many of the amendments proposed will help the Bill, but I am conscious that we will get a better overview of it when we see the Government's amendments on Report Stage.  While I will not hold the Department to a timetable, we are all anxious that the amendments be brought forward as quickly as possible.  However, I am conscious that there is still work to be done.</p></speech>

The establishment of a parole board on a statutory basis has been an ongoing Government and Opposition policy objective.  There is a need to provide for a more objective and streamlined parole process which, while, of course, being of benefit to the prisoner, has public safety at its core.</p><p>It is of paramount concern, and the Bill encompasses this objective.  It goes a considerable way to making provision for a statutory parole board, the principle of which I fully accept.  I went to the Government with this earlier this year, to proceed with the establishment of the parole board through the Bill.  Since then, a departmental official has been working full-time on it and progress has been made in resolving certain policy issues.  We have engaged with the Deputy O'Callaghan, and been in consultation with him in considering the need for further amendments.  We have more work to do in the Department, as Deputy O'Callaghan has acknowledged.  We are working through a co-operative process.  As Deputy O'Callaghan said, we want to get the very best Bill we can through the process of engagement at the committee and in consultation with Deputy O'Callaghan and the officials working full-time on it.</p></speech>

A reference in the definition of parole candidate is proposed by Deputy Daly.  It would add clarity that it applies to persons eligible for consideration for parole.

Deputy O'Callaghan's amendments seek to do the same thing, perhaps in a slightly different way.  His amendments are more simple, with just a line stating one of the functions of the board is to make recommendations on sentence management.  Mine is a bit more detailed and convoluted.  I am open to seeing which approach is best.  I presume there is an argument that if too much detail is included it might tie the board's hands which is obviously not the intention.  At the same time, I was trying to balance against this that if we do not include the detail there is a danger the board's functions and powers in this regard will not be clear enough, which could leave it hamstrung.  This is the balance we are trying to reach.  I do not know which is best so I will throw it out there.</p><p>The amendment I have tabled, whereby the Bill would empower the board to make sentence management recommendations, has been tabled on foot of the recommendations by the existing parole board, which I believe is significant and adds weight to it.  It has pointed out it has this function already and it constitutes the bulk of its work.  It recommends it for only five or six prisoners a year.  If it is taken away it will be left bereft of a number of responsibilities.  Everybody agreed on Second Stage it should continue to have this role.  The question is how.</p><p>Where my group of amendments differs from Deputy O'Callaghan's is I propose that we give the board powers to make orders regarding sentence management rather than just recommendations.  This is an important difference.  It is important in light of the fact it will be the body reviewing all of the facts about the individual's progress, and I believe this is appropriate.  It is recommended by the existing board.  I have left it open to the governor of an open prison to revoke or suspend such orders, which is how it happens at present.  Obviously it would be very difficult for the board to do this as it is not present in the prison.  The idea of an oversight role for the board whereby a governor who revokes or suspends an order has to justify it or explain the reasons in writing is reasonable.  There was unanimity on this issue on Second Stage.  What we are trying to do is sort out the detail of how it would be done.</p></speech>

I will go through the amendments one by one.  The amendment we are dealing with now is amendment No. 3, in which Deputy Daly is trying to amend the definition of parole order.  At present, the Bill states it shall be construed in accordance with section 22.  Deputy Daly wants to change this to section 22(1) and (2) and she also proposes a new section.  It is easier if we leave it in accordance with section 22, the way it is.  It complicates it by having to specify subsections.</p> <p>  There is agreement on the more general issue.  If we look at amendment No. 6, which I have proposed, it is in effect similar to what is contained in Deputy Daly's amendment No. 5.  What we are seeking to do is provide that one of the functions of the parole board shall be to make recommendations regarding the sentence management of prisoners and transfers to an open prison.  This is a function the board will have.  With regard to parole orders, these are dealt with in section 22.  Obviously, the parole board will have the power in respect of parole orders.  I am slightly hesitant about giving governors powers to revoke parole orders.  We need to have a clear statutory basis that it is the parole board which has this power.  It can set out orders and revoke orders.  Amendment No. 3 is unnecessary and we should go with amendment No. 6, which is the same as Deputy Daly's amendment No. 5.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 72 and 83 are linked to amendment No. 5 and amendments Nos. 3, 45, 50 and 58 are consequential amendments to amendment No. 72.  I support the principle of the amendments, which reflect current practice whereby the parole board can and does make various recommendations.</p><p>These include advising a prisoner on the type of programmes with which he or she should engage, recommending transfer to a lower security prison or recommending a programme of temporary release, leading to longer periods.</p><p> With respect to the element of the amendments regarding transfers to open prisons, this is, as I have said, a recommendation that the current parole board can make.  Such a recommendation could be implied in the general understanding of "sentence management".  However, I am not going to object to specifying the transfer to open prisons.</p><p> My preference is for amendment No. 6.  My concern with Deputy Daly's amendment No. 72 is the proposal permitting the parole board to issue orders relating to sentence management, including orders for transfer to open prison.  By providing for the parole board to make orders rather than recommendations, the amendments would effectively involve the board in the management and operation of prisons, which is outside of the remit of the board.</p><p> I acknowledge that Deputy Daly has also put forward amendment No. 83, which would allow a Governor to revoke it.  Nevertheless, getting into the management of prisons is a somewhat inappropriate role, and I hope the Deputy understands that.</p><p> Amendment No. 6 goes a long way to what the Deputy Daly is seeking.  It allows recommendations with respect to sentence management, including recommendations relating to transfers to open prisons.  I would suggest agreeing amendment No. 6 over amendments Nos. 3, 5, 72, 45, 50, 58, 71, 72 and 83.</p><p> With respect to amendment No. 71 in the name of Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan, this amendment allows for the parole order to be sent to a prison governor, which is right.  I would also like a further provision requiring the parole board to also notify the Minister that the parole orders have been made.  It is necessary that the Minister for Justice and Equality would be aware of any decisions to release prisoners.  A simple notification of the nature of the parole order which is issued to the relevant prison governor would I believe suffice, and I will suggest an amendment to that at a later Stage.</p><p> I would also like to address subsection (5) of the amendment, which provides for the board to specify conditions.  Subsection (2) of the section being amended already sets out the conditions of a parole order.  However, subsection (5) appears to allow the board to specify conditions, which I presume will be some or all of the conditions under subsection (2), or will it be conditions in addition to subsection (2) which will apply to all persons released on parole?</p><p> In any event, I believe there is merit in considering introducing an automatic condition of release, which would apply to all parole orders, such as that the offender must comply with all lawful instructions of his or her probation officer.  While section 22 of the Bill sets out the conditions which may be imposed in respect of individual offenders, I believe we should consider whether it should be a standard and automatic condition of every parole order to abide by the instructions of a probation officer.</p><p> Persons on parole are under the supervision of probation officers.  It is the case that this supervision may vary from offender to offender or as time passes.  Probation officers are responsible for facilitating and assisting an offender in reintegrating into society and, as such, are likely to be best placed to identify the immediate needs of and risks faced by an offender, including as these needs or risks change.  When cases come to me I often see the progress people are making and the varying recommendations of probation officers.  In my view, an automatic condition to abide by the lawful instructions of a probation officer will avoid any unforeseen gaps should needs or risks emerge, and it will aid the rehabilitation of the offender.</p><p> I would be interested in the views of the members with respect to this proposal.  It is a matter we can return to at a later Stage of the Bill.</p></speech>

It is probably the case that amendment No. 6 rather than amendment No. 5 should be accepted.  I will not worry about that.  However, amendments Nos. 72 and 73 are linked and their purpose is to precisely to overcome the issue of the board being involved in the day to day management of the prison.  What I am trying to do on the one hand is give the board more power over sentence management, with a caveat that the prison governor maintains a power to offset that by being able to revoke or suspend the order the parole board would make.  I believe that overcomes the Minister's point about the parole board going beyond its remit and straying into prison management.  That is there to balance that situation and giving the board more power over sentence management in this way, through the issuing of orders, was, as far as I can recall, based on a submission from the current parole board.  I believe it is reasonable because on the one hand it is giving it more power but, on the other, it is qualifying that so that the management of the prison would be able to carry on.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy O'Callaghan's point about whether that is giving a prison governor too much power to overturn that, the fact that the Governor would have to give a written explanation on that gives it an oversight role.  I do not know if that better explains it.  I like those two amendments and I am prepared to push them rather than the other ones.  If I did not move amendment No. 5 and amendment No. 6 was moved, the possibility of the board issuing orders remains in other Parts of the Act, which I believe is what Deputy O'Callaghan said.  That would be fine.  Does he understand the point I am making?</p></speech>

Getting involved in the management and operation of the prisons, which is the tendency, is where this is going.  That is the reason I would prefer the broader approach in amendment No. 6.  It is more appropriate to the role of the parole board, and it is clearer.</p></speech>

Some other new definitions may also be required on foot of amendments proposed today, including a definition of "medical practitioner".  We may have to revisit those but they are technical definitional issues.  I will have to come back to them in section 2.</p></speech>

Under existing arrangements, parole is effectively the exercise by the Minister of the power of temporary release under the Criminal Justice Act 1960, reflecting the fact that the existing parole board operates in an advisory capacity only.  Given that the parole board will now be established on a statutory basis, with a clear decision-making function with regard to the release of certain prisoners, it may be necessary to explicitly set out what parole is as distinct from ministerial powers of temporary release, which will continue to operate under the Criminal Justice Act 1960.</p> <p>  Under the provisions of this Bill, parole is conditional release.  Unlike temporary release which may be renewed but also may not, parole can only be revoked where there is a risk to the public or there has been a breach of a condition attached to the parole.  That risk or breach is subsequently determined through a hearing under section 25 of the Bill.  It would be helpful, and it will distinguish parole from temporary release, if we set out - possibly in section 5 of the Bill - that parole is a form of conditional release.  It is already clear from section 5(3) that the provisions of the Bill are not intended to interfere with the right of temporary release, so I may therefore bring forward amendments to clarify the type of release that is being provided for under the Bill.  It would be helpful if we did this and I want to alert the committee that I intend to do that under section 5.</p></speech>

However, it should be extended, and I have extended it to &quot;a practicing academic, barrister or solicitor of at least 10 years standing&quot;.  That is not because I am trying to limit it to lawyers.  It is an important legal function and that the person who is chairman of the board should have a legal qualification.

I had originally indicated that it should be a current or retired member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but Deputy Wallace suggests we take out the term "or retired".  I think it might be better to have a retired garda as opposed to a current garda on the board.  I would think a current garda should be out guarding the streets as opposed to sitting on the parole board.  I will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say on it.  I think we would be better off to make it more expansive rather than more restrictive.  If it is a current or retired member of the Garda, it is more expansive.</p> <p>  In amendment No. 9, Deputy Wallace proposes "a lay community representative".  It is important to have community representatives but people are going to be selected by a competitive selection process under section 8(3)(b).  On the wording, Deputy Clare Daly has amendment No. 10, which I would prefer to amendment No. 9.  It refers to "two persons appointed through a competitive selection process coordinated by the Public Appointments Service to have" certain qualifications.  It is important everyone is not appointed by a Public Appointments Service competition.  People will just not apply for it.  There is some basis for certain members of the board to be appointed that way.</p> <p>  The manner in which I have identified that people should be appointed is that, for example, the Irish Prison Service, the Probation Service, the Garda Commissioner and the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland will nominate a person each.  That is a better way to do it rather than to have a competition, which may look transparent and which people might think sounds great, but which will in many respects not get people to apply.  There is a mix within it in that some have to apply through the competition process and some are appointed by others and it is a good mix.  I would prefer amendment No. 10 over amendment No. 9, but will hear what the Minister has to say about it.</p></speech>

On amendment No. 8, my point was that the emphasis should be on the assessment of the current risk of the person before the board.  There should be an emphasis on current knowledge of the public safety environment, on assessing risk to the community or risk of reoffending at the present time, using up-to-date information from currently serving members of the force.  It is important to focus on the prisoner now and at how much he or she has been rehabilitated, and not have a retrospective look at the period of his or her offence or his or her sentencing.  A retired garda might have known the prisoner better in the past than a serving garda, but we hope that the prisoner is not the same individual he or she was when he or she got into trouble and that maybe he or she has moved on.  While we accept that the principle of prison does not work, the thinking is that it is supposed to rehabilitate prisoners.  If the system was better than it is, there might be more rehabilitation than there is.  To give a person a fair chance, it is fair to look at his or her present more than his or her past.</p><p> Deputy O'Callaghan made a point about retired garda&iacute;.  I know retired garda&iacute; as well and they are a lot smarter than serving garda&iacute; in many cases.  It does not change the fact that current members of the Garda will be more up to date, which is natural.</p><p> My amendment No. 9 refers to a lay community representative.  Given that this stuff is going to be put on a statute basis then it is just a case of ring-fencing this matter.  There might be several community representatives on the board or they might be sidelined.  We could have a situation where there are no community representatives on the board.  My amendment seeks to guard against such a situation by insisting that the board has at least one community representative at all times, on a statutory basis.  </p></speech>

My amendments are linked and share a theme but some highlight different points.</p><p>My amendment No. 10 refers to the appointment system and calls for the two members with experience of the supervision or aftercare of discharged prisoners to be appointed subject to section 8(2)(i).  At the moment it is the Minister who appoints under this heading.  I tabled my amendment because I believe that two persons appointed through a competitive selection process co-ordinated by the Public Appointments Service is better than the Minister appointing such persons.  We have the same debate on every piece of legislation whether it is appointment to a judicial council or everything else.  There is a danger when the Minister nominates that the appointment would appear to be less transparent.  That is the only reason I tabled my amendment. </p><p>Amendment No. 13 seeks to add two new members to the board.  Like Deputy Wallace's amendment No. 9, my amendment seeks to add people from the community to the board.  Amendment No. 13 reads:</p><blockquote>two persons appointed through a competitive selection process coordinated by the Public Appointments Service with knowledge and experience of working or volunteering in a support role with criminal offenders and discharged prisoners.</blockquote> <p>My amendment has a similar intent to that of Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment No. 12, which allows for the possibility of two community representatives.  My amendment seeks to appoint people who have worked in the community or in pastoral roles with offenders to the board.  They would be a welcome addition.  My amendment is more definite than amendment No. 12.  My amendment wants it made obligatory to appoint two community persons rather than leave it as an option.  The aim of my amendment is supported by the present parole board.  </p><p>I made the point on Second Stage that the board is heavily weighted towards legal and high powered people who, with the best will in the world, probably have more professional contact rather than a direct experience of dealing with some of people who are up for parole.  In that sense, community experience and that type of background would add a good and necessary balance to the board.  My amendment is important to me because it seeks to make the provision obligatory rather than optional.</p><p>I tabled amendments Nos. 14 and 15.  Section 8(1) provides for the parole board to be made up of &quot;not more than 15&quot; members.  My amendment seeks to improve gender representation and bring it closer to 50:50.</p></speech>

Yes, amendments Nos. 14 and 15.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 16, 17 and 19 are on the same theme.  They make the opposite point in a load of different ways from what Deputy O'Callaghan has made in his amendments.  My amendments seek an open competition for appointment to the board and the rationale is the same as previously.  I do not have a difficulty with the professions being represented.  It is good for the board to be comprised of legal people, Garda and psychologists.  I have a problem with their nominating bodies nominating people rather than using merit.  The Irish Penal Reform Trust has also raised its concern that the people who are favoured by the organisation might be nominated and that they will agree between themselves to take turns to be appointed for a year.  People are not being nominated on merit.  It is too important to leave the final say to the representative bodies even though I do not have a problem with the criteria.  It is really important to have psychologists.  I would prefer people to be nominated on merit and for a competition to be held.  I do not think a competition would put people off.  I applied for the job myself in the recent round of competition-----</p></speech>

The board should not just be comprised of legal bigwigs and all of the rest or their organisations.  A balanced board is better.   I appreciate that there is a different way of considering this matter than what Deputy O'Callaghan has proposed.  The gig is not exactly a popular one and people are not queuing up to join.  I could not get on the board even against that background.</p> <p>  Finally, amendment No. 21 seeks to add to the list of criteria that must be satisfied before somebody can be considered for appointment to the parole board.  It is important that members of the board have training or experience in interview techniques given that the contact with the person is based on report but a lot of it is based on a person's performance during an interview.  People need to be qualified in how to assess the situation.  They must be able to recognise when a person does a bad interview or does not represent himself or herself properly.  It is a disempowering process for the applicant.  Therefore, it is important that board members are skilled in how to draw people out in an interview process, particularly in the criminal justice system.  Board members need common sense.  A knee-jerk impression can cloud a person's judgment so board members need training.  It is a complex issue.  We need people who can see past their feelings.  I agree with the parole board in its call for inservice training in interview techniques to be provided.  </p></speech>

I have had the benefit of reading their decisions, and having to make a decision myself on the recommendation they are making to me.</p> <p>  I will make a general point first about how critical the membership is.  I think everybody here accepts that it is critical to have the right people on the board because one must make life and death decisions almost.  One must assess the most serious offenders or people who have committed the most serious of crimes who are before the parole board in terms of an application for their future management.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Wallace that risk assessment is absolutely central.  I have given an awful lot of thought to this matter.  I constantly ask myself the following when I read these cases.  What is the risk?   What is the risk assessment?  How has it been done by the parole board?  How well has it been done by the various reports that the board has access to?  If I have any questions about it I refer them back and get further information.  I say that just to highlight how absolutely critical decision-making is and the implications it has for society as a whole in terms of safety and of course for the individual in terms of his or her future life and his or her opportunity for rehabilitation.  That always has to be balanced with an absolutely accurate assessment, in so far as we can.  These things are not a precise science but they are terribly important.  The membership of the board must be seen in that light.  The criteria that we use are critically important.</p><p>I have put much thought into this.  We must ensure we get the right mix and the right balances, and that we do not do anything just for the sake of a representation that might appear to be the right thing to do.  We must have a process in place that ensures we get the best people on the parole board.  That is the goal of everybody in the committee.</p><p> In that context, I will not oppose amendment No. 7.  It expands the category of persons qualified to be the chairperson of the parole board.  It broadens it to include a solicitor or barrister of ten years standing.  Deputy O'Callaghan also includes the phrase "a practising academic".  There might be further qualification of that because it is a broad phrase and we might need to narrow it down in the context of the job to be done on the parole board.  However, I am happy to revert to the Deputy on that.  The Bill will establish the parole board on a statutory basis with decision making powers to release prisoners prior to completion of sentence.  I have a preference for a legally qualified chairperson, but I can give it further consideration.  I also wish to examine the phrase "practising academic" to define it a little further.</p><p> With regard to the amendment proposed by Deputy Wallace, it is existing practice to have a retired member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the parole board.  On the point the Deputy makes about risk assessment, whether the member is retired is not an influencing factor.  The Deputy appears to be talking about cases where there might be what might be seen as a conflict of interest or where there might have been an involvement of the garda in the case.  I do not know how often that happens, but I would not have thought it was very often.  The key point is the critical ability of the garda, retired or otherwise, to make the risk assessment.  Restricting it to current members narrows the depth of expertise available to the board, so I ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment.</p><p> Amendment No. 9 proposes to include in the membership of the parole board "a lay community representative, appointed following a transparent and objective recruitment process and selected by an independent body".  Amendment No. 12 proposed by Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan contains a similar proposal involving the appointment of such a representative by the Minister.  Obviously, "community representative" is a very broad concept and there are varying ideas of who such a representative might be.  The basic point, as I have already said, is that persons with the greatest expertise in crime, justice, offender management and, in particular, rehabilitation and re-integration of offenders should be represented.  I am not convinced that the amendment is necessary or sufficiently clearly drafted, but I will not oppose it.  However, members should again consider the point that the board we are appointing comprises people who must be as tight as possible in terms of the expertise we would like them to bring to the board.  It is such a serious decision to make and we want people who understand the context and have the broad qualifications.  I have no wish to restrict it unduly, because people bring much life experience to this type of situation as well.  However, management of offenders and understanding of criminal behaviour, recidivism and rehabilitation are very important.  A particular difficulty with amendment No. 9 relates to the process of recruitment.  There is no guidance on who or what would comprise the independent body with responsibility for selection of the person in question.  Including the words "transparent" and "objective" appears to be superfluous because this is a requirement of all recruitment processes.  I will proceed with amendment No. 12.</p><p> Amendments Nos. 10, 13, 16, 17, 19 and 21 proposed by Deputy Clare Daly also relate to the membership of the board and in particular the appointment of persons to the board.  The Bill currently provides for the membership of the board to include persons appearing to the Minister to have knowledge and experience of the supervision of discharged prisoners or who have made a study of the causes of delinquency.  Currently, when the Minister has to make an appointment to the board, there are clear criteria for who should be appointed.  They must be expert.  Amendments Nos. 10 and 19 remove the Minister from any role in the appointment of persons to the parole board and assign the role to the Public Appointments Service.  The membership of the board as currently proposed in section 8 properly identifies the appropriate persons to be members of the board as well as the means of appointment.  It is appropriate, given the Minister for Justice and Equality's oversight of the criminal justice system, that the Minster should have input into the membership of the board.  The Minister has responsibility for oversight and has awareness of the broad issues in crime.  To exclude the Minister having any input into the board is unnecessary.</p><p> It is a positive thing for the Minister to have an input into the membership because one often finds when one looks at the membership of a board that some skills might be absent, so when the Minister is due to make the appointment that could be taken into consideration.  One may find, for whatever reason, that particular expertise has been selected by everybody else who has an input into the membership and there might well be a gap which could be filled by the appointment by the Minister of the two members.  This relates not just to the parole board, but to appointments in general.  Certainly one of the criteria I consider when making board appointments is what skills are necessary in the particular situation and what is missing.  That is a unique role and unique knowledge the Minister can have, as opposed to other people.</p><p> Amendment No. 13 proposes the appointment of a further two persons through the Public Appointments Service with experience of working with offenders.  It is evident that the board as set out under section 8 already contains such persons, be it the representative of the Probation Service or the representative of the Irish Penal Reform Trust, a body with a great deal of experience in this area and which focuses on these issues and is very appropriate.  Equally subparagraph (i) of the section refers to the appointment of persons with knowledge and experience of the supervision or aftercare of discharged persons and there is potentially considerable overlap with that provision and the amendment proposed by the Deputy.</p><p> Amendments Nos. 16 and 17 propose that persons appointed to the parole board should be selected through competitions run by the Public Appointments Service.  This would be extremely unwieldy if it was applied to everybody.  The appointment of existing employees of certain services such as the IPS or the Probation Service should be a matter for those organisations and those appointed will continue to be employees of those services.  I do not believe that any difficulty has been raised by the existing parole board which these amendments would address.  There would have to be further consultation with a number of the organisations and with the Public Appointments Service on the impact of these amendments before they could sensibly be agreed.  Members will understand my point.  Take the example of a probation officer who is nominated to be a member.  It is quite appropriate that this comes from within the Probation Service, as opposed to all probation officers going to the Public Appointments Service and having to go through that process and then returning as members.  It is unwieldy.</p><p> Amendment No. 21 is to section 8(4), which sets out certain requirements of persons appointed to the parole board.  The amendment adds to those requirements by requiring the person to have training or experience in interviewing techniques and proven analytical skills.  Again, that is very broad.  These skills are clearly necessary.  Whether it is necessary to build in them in as a specific requirement in this way, that everybody has skill in interviewing and in analytical techniques, gives rise to the question of assessing that and building it in as a criterion.  People will bring a different range of skills to the board and I am not sure it is necessary to go into that level of detail.</p><p> Amendments Nos. 14 and 15 relate to the gender balance of the parole board and I agree with them.</p><p> Amendment No. 18 corrects an oversight in providing for the appointment of a probation officer to the board by including such appointment in paragraph (3)(e) of section 8.  However, I propose to bring forward an amendment to provide for the appointment of a probation officer by the director of the Probation Service. </p><p> The key goal is to get the right mix of people with the right level of training, experience and understanding of the area to do this important job.  That has guided my approach and response to the amendments.</p></speech>

In fairness to me, I thought it was quite well drafted.  I accept the T&aacute;naiste's point about the nomination from the Probation Service.  As a result, I will withdraw amendment No. 18.  It is inappropriate, as I have suggested, to try to get around that by getting the Irish Prison Service to nominate the person.</p><p>Amendment No. 12 accommodates Deputy Wallace's concern about a lay community representative, as it includes such a representative.  I agree, however, it is a board that requires expertise.  I know Deputy Daly's concern in respect of trying to get everyone nominated in a transparent and open way.  My assessment of trying to get people to serve on public boards, and I do not have the experience of other people here, is that it is hard to get decent people to serve.  If we have a process whereby people have to apply for a competition and, as the Minister said, every probation officer has to apply for a competition and has to be separately interviewed, after which an individual will be selected, it would make it very complicated, in my opinion.  Maybe in a different society it would be appropriate, but it would make it extremely complicated to get membership of the board in this way.  The method we have in section 8 at present is that four people will be nominated by the Public Appointments Service and other individuals will be nominated by representative bodies, such as the Irish Penal Reform Trust, a probation officer, the Prison Service, a garda, a psychologist and the psychiatrists will nominate a person.  There will be a good mix there, and the Minister will also have a role in it.  If we hand over everything to the Public Appointments Service we could have it electing the Taoiseach at the end of the day.  We have to have some political involvement in it.</p></speech>

Is it some sectional group of the community?  Is it the community who are victims of crime?  We need to be very careful.  I have been listening to the exchange going back and forth.  Some of the amendments have an underlying trend of complete mistrust of how people are appointed.  It leaves out the logic of why sometimes appointments need to be made and the process that needs to be gone through to make them.  I see phrases such as a community representative.  What is a community representative?  I would argue people elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann are the greatest example of community representatives.  How, out of every type of community there is in our country, is somebody a community representative?</p></speech>

The involvement of the Public Appointments Services is part of a broader political debate flowing out of public disquiet over the way in which appointments to boards were previously handled.  It is something we have discussed.  In this context, I am prepared to see this is a board that will not be a highly sought-after gig with loads of initials after people's names and wads of cash attached to it.  Presumably the people who would opt to go to the parole board would do so out of a motivation of public service or an association in a former life or some interest in the area.  In this sense, I accepted the point that perhaps mandating the Public Appointments Service to deal with a board of this character, which does not meet weekly, is perhaps a little top-heavy.  However, it is there to overcome the difficulty with previous political appointments.  I am prepared to stand back from this group of amendments.</p> <p>  With regard to the idea of the nominating bodies being subject to some scrutiny, perhaps this does not apply to this type of board because the people coming forward will be those who will want to come forward, and they will not be stampeded in the queue for the positions.  That is probably true.  Others, such as judicial boards, would be prestige gigs and we would need to include more caveats.  When we say nominating bodies this does not necessarily give a level of transparency.  Perhaps the overall balance is met by the various categories.</p> <p>  I am quite adamant about the inclusion of a community representative, whether it is done in Deputy Wallace's way or my way.  Deputy O'Callaghan's amendments also speak about community.  Deputy Brophy's points are a bit facetious, because the person will define himself or herself and the appointment process will nominate who comes forward.  Yes, a Member of the Oireachtas is a community representative as far as I am concerned, but in actual fact what is far more likely in this category, and what is supported by the present parole board, is the idea of somebody who has experience of working with ex-offenders.  In this sense, they would be very well placed.  They may not have initials after their name but they have street knowledge of risk and how a person's sentence was managed, and they could be a really valuable addition to the professional people on the board.  The only point is to have a balance with the high-powered professional-type input because, with the best in the world, people who are professional may not have a broader understanding.  They have their own expertise, but it could be blended with somebody who has more of the background.  Many of the people up for parole perpetrated their crimes in their own communities on neighbours and friends.  If they are going back into those communities it is precisely those people who would be the victims of further crime if they got it wrong.  A community representative would be a valuable addition, whether through Deputy Wallace's amendment or mine.  I take what Deputy O'Callaghan is saying, that his amendment allows for community also, but it is only an option and not an obligation.  I believe somebody such as this would be invaluable to the board.  I would like such a person to be there.  I accept the Minister's point on amendment No. 21 regarding interviews.</p><p>My amendment is probably too detailed.  Hopefully, the board deals with that issue.  We probably do not need to specify it in legislation.  I will withdraw it.</p></speech>

There is good balance in terms of those appointed by the Public Appointments Service and the nominating bodies.  I would agree with the inclusion of a community representative.  How we define that can obviously be looked at, but I agree with the inclusion of someone with such experience.</p> <p>  One could argue that an ex-offender would have the relevant experience.  I wonder is there any legal barrier to an ex-offender serving on the parole board.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-24a.184" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1310" speakername="Colm Brophy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017052400002#H00300"><p>I listened to what Deputy Clare Daly had to say there.  I never make any argument facetiously.  I will go back to the point of my intervention, which is quite interesting.  What it has teased out in subsequent contributions from Deputy Clare Daly is what was being talked about, not merely a generic community representative but a specific type of community representative.  Others might have a view that the community is victims of crime which have a particular view on what has happened to their life or their families lives, or someone like that, would be as entitled to a community representative of a similar nature on the parole board.  We are trying to strike a balance in terms of the membership of the board.  There is a good balance outlined, by the Bill and by some of the proposed amendments, but we need to be careful that we do not seem to be, by a careful process of how we select the board, almost creating a prejudged outcome for what the parole board will do.  I renew my reservation about the broadness of the term "community representative" without qualifying it in some way.</p></speech>

My only concern is that by inserting the provision and limiting it to "when appointing panel convenors to a review or hearing", it might suggest the chairperson would not have to comply with the principles of impartiality in dealing with other issues.  It is implicit throughout the Bill that anyone in the role of chairperson of the parole board must be impartial in his or her treatment of issues.  Deputy Mick Wallace raises a valid point that a judge who adjudicated in a case and passed sentence on an individual could not adjudicate in that individual's parole hearing, but this all comes within the principles of natural justice that operate in administrative bodies.  It would be safer to leave the proposed provision out than to include it.</p></speech>

As Deputy Jim O'Callaghan said, the amendment relates specifically to the panel convenors to a review or hearing.  Deputy Mick Wallace seeks to require the chairperson of the board to adhere to the principles of impartiality when making such appointments.  The Bill will establish the parole board on a statutory footing.  The board and its members will be subject to all of the duties and obligations of any statutory decision-making body and the requirements of fair procedures, as Deputy Jim O'Callaghan said.  There is a body of law which oversees and covers procedures.  In that regard, the amendment is unnecessary and would actually cloud the situation a little.  It is better that the assumption is that people will commit to adhering to natural justice and fair procedures, which is what one would expect of any body.  I do not think it is necessary to single out the panel convenors in the chairperson's decision-making.</p></speech>

It is a matter of accountability and not wasting time.  Supporting the timely communication of parole board decisions to candidates for parole and other relevant parties is vital.  According to the Irish Penal Reform Trust, there can be delays of up to nine months before a candidate for parole has a decision communicated to him or her, which is more than frustrating for the prisoners who want to act on the parole board's recommendations.  For example, sometimes it might recommend particular training or treatment.  If the communication of a decision is delayed by months, it is a little mad and not very fair.  </p> <p>  On the issue of accountability and the keeping of records and so on, the committee does not need me to tell it that we do not have enough of it in Ireland.  We are considering bringing forward a Bill to make it compulsory to keep minutes, for example.  A simple example would be the decision made by NAMA to shred the minutes of the meeting of 13 December which was crucial in the final stages of the setting up of Project Eagle.  Greater accountability is required across the board in how we do things, but the point about a prisoner receiving information in good time, surely, is quite practical.</p></speech>

Perhaps we might delete "3 or" and leave it at "5".  I understand what Deputy Mick Wallace is seeking to achieve in his amendment, but, in legislative terms, what is reasonable to me may not be reasonable to someone else.  Therefore, I do not know how one could legally define "a reasonable timeframe".  Perhaps we need to consider the terminology because, as I said, the word "reasonable" means different things to different people.</p></speech>

The decision should be signed and dated as it is a formal decision.</p> <p>  Regarding amendment No. 29 also tabled by Deputy Mick Wallace, I note the point made by Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, but it would be worthwhile having something in the Bill to put the onus on the parole board to provide a decision within a reasonable timeframe or as soon as is reasonably practicable.  Putting a specific date on it - for example, a requirement that it be done within four weeks - would make it very difficult for the board.  However, on balance, I have no problem with amendments Nos. 28 and 29.  I do not think amendments Nos. 26 and 27 are over the top, as suggested by Deputy Clare Daly, but I am concerned that they would limit the discretion of the parole board and the chairperson.  The objective in having panels of three, four or five individuals is that a number of panels could be in operation at any one time.  It should be remembered that there are only 15 people on the board; therefore, there could be between three and five panels operating at any one time.  We are better off leaving discretion as to how panels are operated with the chairperson.  If panels are to consist of five members every time, less consideration may be given and they could find themselves overworked.  Every single one of the five members would only be able to deal with three applications at a time.  Therefore, on balance, I would leave the provision as it is and let the chairperson have discretion.</p></speech>

That is valid.  I do not think it is appropriate that someone would be waiting months in limbo.  That is an unfair and almost cruel way to treat someone by leaving them waiting like that.</p> <p>  On Deputy Daly's primary amendment, I would link it with what Deputy O'Callaghan has said that if one is too prescriptive on this in terms of its overall constitution and not allowing the chair that flexibility one will end up fairly quickly with a situation where inordinate delays will come out of parole board reports, caused by five people having to sit on every one.  If we establish something and put a chair in place, a certain amount of flexibility has to be put in there for what is effectively a day-to-day management decision by the parole board.</p></speech>

As currently set out in the Bill, that could be three or five members of the board.  It would mean, as Deputy Brophy was saying, that there were always five persons on the panel.  The amendment does remove the flexibility which will lead to the better working of the parole board.  Five out of a board of 15 is quite a lot.  It is a busy board and there are a lot of cases to be seen.  The flexibility that is there at the moment for the chair is good.  One does not want to increase the membership of the board.  By keeping the flexibility and have the chairperson decide, I have no doubt that on some occasions the chairperson may decide that there is five in particular cases.  I would prefer to stick with flexibility.  It also means that more reviews can be carried out.  Ultimately, the people on this board have applied and are volunteers.  Giving the chair the flexibility is the best use and what will get the best outcome, depending on their skills.  It is better to keep the position where there is three or five and to allow the board to manage its work and get on with it.</p> <p>  Deputy Wallace wants to insert the words "signed and dated".  I take his point but I would say the words are unnecessary and could call into question similar provisions in legislation.  Obviously, all decisions should be signed and dated and statutory provision is not necessary.  I would be concerned that accepting the amendment may have unintended implications for similar statutory provisions but I am happy to look at it.  It is a common sense approach, and why not make it statutory, but it may be that there would be subsequential issues for other statutory provisions.  I would like to have a look at it again with the Parliamentary Counsel and perhaps come back on Report Stage.  </p> <p>  Deputy Wallace's other amendment refers to "the decision must be provided directly to the prisoner within reasonable time frame".  I agree with that, of course it should.  I suggest that section 15(2) and 16(2) of the Bill already make the necessary provision for decisions to be forwarded to the parole candidate directly and that we do not need further provision.  However, we do not have a big problem with this issue of reasonable time frame.  Sectons 15(2) and 16(2) give the necessary provision.</p></speech>

I am still not sure.  I appreciate that there is flexibility in the three to five members provision, we are not saying it should be three in all cases, there is a provision.

These amendments seek to provide for reports to be obtained from a psychiatrist or other medical practitioner.  In the original draft, I had linked psychologist and psychiatrist together but it is safer to link psychiatrist with other medical practitioner.  That is provided for in amendment No. 31.  </p><p>Amendment No. 33 gives the power to the parole board to procure from the courts service at transcript of the sentencing comments of a judge.</p><p>One could understand why the parole board would want to hear what a sentencing judge had to say at the time of sentence.  Unless the board has the statutory power to obtain that transcript, it will not be able to do so.</p><p> Amendment No. 35 provides a protection to a psychologist, psychiatrist or other medical practitioner who has been asked by the parole board to conduct a report on the applicant.  In this instance, it will be able to secure the medical notes on the parole candidate without the medical practitioner of the parole candidate saying that he or she has no authority to release them.  Obviously, if the parole candidate does not want to provide the medical notes, they will not be provided.  However, it would be necessary to provide the medical notes in order for the parole application to be considered.  That is the basis of those amendments, which make sense.  This was brought to my attention by a psychiatrist who works in the area of treatment of persons who have committed criminal offences and who are under psychiatric care.  </p><p> Amendment No. 38 provides further protection for a medical practitioner in regard to giving evidence and producing the treatment notes concerning the parole candidate.  If this was not provided on a statutory basis, a doctor may say that he or she cannot give that information because of the confidentiality he or she owes to the patient.  However, this is dependent on the parole candidate giving his or her permission.</p></speech>

There is a list of criteria, such as risk of reoffending, conduct to date, etc., and this adds extra criteria to take account of the effect the decision would have on the prisoner's family and the likelihood of facilitating his or her reintegration.  A theme of our discussions on penal reform was that the role of the family and social supports are the key determinant in whether somebody will reoffend or not.  One could say that this is basically covered by looking at the risk of reoffending but we need to elevate that issue.  That is why I have included it.  International evidence shows that family integration is the key to whether somebody is going to end up back in prison or not.  The purpose of the amendment is to try to get that provision included in the Bill.  Amendment No. 63 is also about family supports.</p></speech>

The reason I tabled the amendment is that if one is charged with murder, there is no incentive to pleading guilty, because whether one pleads guilty or not guilty, one will be sentenced to life imprisonment.  I thought there might be some benefit in providing an incentive for a person accused of murder that if he or she pleads guilty, it could be taken into account at the parole process.</p> <p>  Having spoken to officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, I recognise there are issues in respect of it.  For instance, why should whether a person pleaded guilty or not guilty at the time of the prosecution be taken into account when assessing whether he or she should be rehabilitated and allowed out into the community?  The real issue I am trying to deal is to provide an incentive to plead guilty to a murder charge when there is none at present.  Perhaps the parole process is not the way to do that.  On that basis, further consideration needs to be given to it.  I will withdraw amendment No. 62.</p> <p>  In amendment No. 32, Deputy Daly proposes additional factors that need to be taken into account, including the effect the granting of parole may have on the prisoner's family.  My concern is this will lead to a corresponding requirement by the family of a murder victim to have its submission taken into account and what impact the release will have on it.  Under the Bill a victim can make representations to the parole board.  I am concerned Deputy Daly's amendment will extend it further to take into account factors that are not relevant to the central issue, which is the rehabilitation or not of the parole candidate.</p></speech>

It is clear from section 19 of the Bill that a parole board may grant parole if, in its opinion, the person being considered for parole will not present a risk to society and releasing the person will facilitate the reintegration of that person into society.</p> <p>  From the cases I have seen, there is a significant level of information available to the parole board when considering cases.  The parole board has all the information that is relevant, including how the prisoner has behaved, how he or she has dealt with disciplinary issues and if there has been contact with family.  A wide amount of information is available to the parole board.  In her amendment, Deputy Daly proposed to insert "the effect that the granting of parole may have on the prisoner's family".  There are broader issues in regard to family.  I understand the point the Deputy is making but the effect on the prisoner&rsquo;s family of the actual decision is not really relevant to these considerations.</p><p>With regard to facilitating reintegration of the offender into his or her family, the parole board always considers the overarching matter of reintegration into society, which encompasses the aspect of integration into family.  Having the effect on family in statute is problematic.<br/><br/>Amendment No. 63 to section 19 of the Bill makes a similar provision regarding facilitating reintegration with family.  Under subsection(1)(<i>b</i>) of section 19, the parole board may grant parole to a person if, in its opinion, the release of the person in question would facilitate the reintegration of the person into society.  That is the general point.  The intention behind the Deputy's amendment is adequately covered in the provision as is.  I note the comments of Deputy O'Callaghan with regard to amendment No. 62.<br/><br/>Both amendments seek to achieve the same aim and I will outline a concern as to possible consequences if this amendment is agreed.  The effect of the amendment suggests that defendants who plead guilty to an offence would receive a positive benefit with respect to their being considered for parole.  I agree that a defendant&rsquo;s remorse or admission of guilt should be acknowledged.  However, I do not believe that a defendant who fails to plead guilty should be negatively impacted in respect of release.  Where a defendant pleads guilty this can be, and generally is, taken into account as a mitigating factor for the purpose of sentencing and that is correct.  I do not agree that it is a relevant factor - Deputy O'Callaghan made this point - with respect to the release of the prisoner and I consider the criteria currently set out in the Bill to be sufficiently broad for the purpose of determining release.  I repeat that I would not like to see offenders who have pleaded not guilty, as is their right, and were convicted following a trial having that choice and right possibly negatively impacting on a decision relating to their release.<br/><br/>Section 19 of the Bill provides that the parole board may grant release if the person being considered for parole will not present an undue risk to society and the release of the prisoner will facilitate the reintegration of the person into society.  I do not see how the nature of the offender&rsquo;s plea would inform either of those considerations.  We are going back to the basic purpose of the parole board, which is assessing risk.  That is really the key consideration at that point.</p></speech>

The first part of the amendment is worded really poorly with respect to the granting of parole and impact on a prisoner's family.  It is not appropriate in that context.  I was open to the idea that this may have been covered anyway and I was probably trying to seek some way to include a provision for the family.  I will withdraw the amendment but if I resubmit it, the amendment will not be in its current format as the points are well made and accepted.</p> <p>  I did not agree with Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment No. 62 at all.  We are aware of people who pleaded not guilty who believe they were wrongfully convicted and will not engage with parole services because they feel they would have to admit some involvement in something they say they were never guilty of in the first place.  We must take that into account.</p></speech>

This is against the backdrop of where the Bill currently provides for the parole panel to refuse somebody and not be considered again for two years.  I am trying to replace this with a provision for one year as I do not accept the two-year rule.  I am not sure if it is a resourcing issue but it is too long.  The European Court of Human Rights has accepted periods of less than a year between reviews and rejected periods of more than a year as incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights Article 5.4.  In Murray <i>v.</i>Parole Board, the English Court of Appeal stated the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights regarding parole review periods for life sentence prisoners was that for an interval of more than a year, the onus is on the state to establish a period is not in breach of Article 5.4.</p><p>This is really important and there is no logical reason a year could not be considered.  Sentence length can be a kind of peculiar concoction in some ways, as it is not necessarily linked to rehabilitation.  It is a mixture of punishment depending on the seriousness of the offence, tradition and how long prisoners are likely to move towards rehabilitation.  All of those factors are put in.  The parole system is really the only comprehensive way of keeping track in this regard to see if rehabilitation is working.  Two years is just too long.</p><p>Earlier this year I was contacted by the partner of a prisoner serving a life sentence and this man has basically ticked all the boxes necessary to become eligible for parole.  He has not been granted it to date because of delays in accessing therapeutic services that have been mandated to him but not provided.  That is not his fault but it is holding up the entire process when he is carrying out his side of the bargain.  It is preventing him from being paroled.</p><p>Instances like this cannot be addressed in the Bill, but by shortening the time period between parole applications pressure could be brought to bear in circumstances where, for example, the Irish Prison Service is not delivering services that would help the person to get parole, when he or she is doing all that is required and ticking all of the boxes.  If the parole board was meeting the individual within a year rather than two years, for example, then the person could say that he or she did not get access to counselling and the board could then apply some pressure.  I am trying here to overcome such problems and believe this amendment will make the Bill more human rights compliant, which is why I will be pressing it.</p></speech>

It is good that the Bill is making provision for the candidate's legal representative to attend the hearing and in that context, it is common sense that the legal representative would be sent a copy of the decision.</p><p>Subsection (3) currently reads, &quot;Where a person whose parole is being considered is dissatisfied with the decision of a review, that person shall be entitled to a hearing, if requested in writing within 14 days of the communication of the decision of a review.&quot;  Amendment No. 43 seeks to provide that the individual would be entitled to a hearing within 4 weeks of a request.  I know that the Government is reluctant to accept specific time limits but this goes back to the issue we discussed earlier regarding what is a &quot;reasonable&quot; timeframe and how long is a piece of string.  I understand that there is a danger that a failure on the part of the authorities to meet a timeline may give rise to a judicial review or a potential cost to the State and I can see why the Government might want to avoid it.  At the same time, I think the request here is not unreasonable.</p></speech>

That seems very reasonable.  Amendment No. 42 would require a decision of a parole review to be given to the parole candidate&rsquo;s legal representative.  There is no provision in the Bill for legal representation for the purposes of the review.  The reference in the Bill to legal representation is in relation to the hearings.  I would certainly have no difficulty with legal representatives being included in section 16 of the Bill for the purpose of receiving a copy of the decision following a hearing, as proposed by Deputy Wallace in amendment No. 47.  The review stage under the Bill is an initial consideration of parole on the basis of such information and reports as the parole panel considers relevant.  These are reviewed by the panel which can then decide if parole should be granted.  If not, the parole candidate can request a full hearing under section 16 of the Bill.  I would also like to inform to the select committee that it is my intention to bring forward amendments to provide for legal aid where necessary with respect to representation at hearings.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 43 which was tabled by Deputy Wallace would require a hearing following a refusal of parole to be conducted within four weeks.  I believe that is too short a period of time in which to prepare for such a hearing.  Aside from operational difficulties this may cause the parole board with respect to gathering evidence or seeking witnesses, it might also cause difficulties for a parole candidate and his or her legal representative with respect to considering the decision following the initial review and preparing for the hearing.  I would suggest further consideration be given to this provision.</p> <p>  I have no difficulty with amendment No. 44.  Amendment No. 67 tabled by Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan relates to section 21 and will address the subject of amendment 44.  If amendment No. 44 is agreed, then amendment 67 provides that parole candidates will be eligible to make subsequent applications for parole after two years from the date of the most recent decision declining parole.  The parole board may also direct a shorter period than two years.  Amendments Nos. 46 and 51 from Deputy Daly are to section 16 and would require a parole candidate who is refused parole to be further considered for parole one year following that refusal.  The Bill currently provides for subsequent considerations two years following review.  However, as I have said, amendment No. 67 will allow the parole board to direct a shorter period than two years and I have a preference for proceeding with that approach.  I believe we should make statutory provision for it being done in less than two years.  I would prefer to take that route.  I would go back to the earlier point about the quality of the decision making in the first instance.  If we are satisfied with the membership of the panels and the people doing the work, including the chair and with the fact that they are giving serious consideration to each and every case and are carrying out proper risk assessments, then referring decisions back within a year might not be appropriate.  I would prefer to leave it to the discretion of the panel.  There may be outstanding issues or some reason for the panel deciding that it would like to conduct a hearing again within a shorter period and it can do that.  I believe that is a better way to proceed.  </p> <p>  Amendment No. 89 provides for the legal representative of the parole candidate to be notified of a hearing.  It may be the case that a legal representative has not been engaged by or appointed to the candidate.  Perhaps the amendment could be reconsidered to provide for notification to a legal representative where the candidate is represented for the purpose of a parole hearing.  That is just a technical and practical point.  </p></speech>

If the review does not go well for the prisoner, he or she can request a hearing and that is where the legal representation comes in.  In that context, it is beneficial to have Deputy Wallace's proposal inserted in respect of the hearings but not in respect of the reviews.</p> <p>  In terms of the two year versus one year provision, the parole board is going to work in a collaborative way.  Amendment No 67, which proposes to amend section 21 provides that "an eligible person shall be entitled to bring a subsequent application after two years from the date of the most recent decision declining parole or within such shorter period as the Board may direct.".</p><p>If the board thinks a person is close to parole, it will bring forward the date and suggest the person can come back to it in one year.  It is not too prescriptive.  If it were to be every year, it would just put people through a process which might build false hope in a prisoner.  Other than that, I agree with what the T&aacute;naiste said.</p></speech>

As it stands, I will press amendment No. 51.  I appreciate that there is discretion to reduce the period below two years, but to be human rights compliant, it would be better if it was one.  If a person is not engaging or there have been no improvements in his or her circumstances, the matter will be dealt with quickly by the parole board.  Some people do not and do not want to engage at all.  As such, it is really up to a person to make an application and he or she may not want to make it after one year.  Having been through the process, he or she might say, "To hell with it."  If someone is engaging with services, it is a better monitoring mechanism to have the period as one year.  There may be a redrawing around it, but at things stand, I will certainly press amendment No. 51.</p></speech>

I understand absolutely that the safety of the community and the victim are of critical importance in making decisions on a person's release, but the emphasis in the paragraph is too much on the actual offence when it should be on rehabilitation, which is the whole purpose.  Of course, we have to have an assessment of the risk to victims and the community if a prisoner is released, but the section already provides that the position of the victim and any victim impact statement or submission made on behalf of the victim must be one of the board's guiding principles.  It would be despicable if someone said a prisoner who had committed an horrific crime was a great fellow in prison and should be released early, while the victim was left to think he or she had no come back.  At the same time, the whole point of prison and parole is supposed to be rehabilitation and allowing someone back into society without the risk of reoffending.  The IPRT put it well.  It stated decision-making should concentrate exclusively on the risk of a prisoner committing a serious offence if released and not engage in re-sentencing by considering the seriousness of the offence and the aggravating circumstances.  I am seeking to delete the line to avoid re-sentencing, while being very cognisant of the impact on victims and the community.  The victim impact statement is taken into account.  It strikes a better balance.  It would be putting amendment No. 53 with amendment No. 59.</p></speech>

The emphasis should primarily be on the assessment of the current risk associated with the person before the parole board.  When the Carlisle committee reported in 1988 on the parole system in England and Wales, one of its key recommendations was that a parole board should concentrate exclusively on the risk of a prisoner committing a serious offence, if released.  The report stated a board should not engage in re-sentencing by considering the seriousness of the offence and aggravating circumstances.</p></speech>

It is important to set it out.</p> <p>  Deputies Daly and Wallace are correct when they say prison is about rehabilitation but it is also about punishment.  There are many cases where people are just convicted of murder.  There are different degrees of murder.  We do not differentiate between murders under our legal system.  The factors associated with the case of somebody who is convicted of killing a group of children, as supposed to somebody who is convicted of murder committed on the spur of the moment one night with drink taken, can be taken into account.  It could be argued that the issue is to assess whether the former candidate still poses a threat but it is unrealistic to believe the parole board should not take into account the offence for which a person has been convicted.  Sometimes that may be unfair but it is relevant to the function it has to fulfil to ascertain the gravity of the offence committed.  Some offences stand out but not because of media notoriety.  The murder of five children is different from another type of criminal offence.  I am aware that this is a tricky issue.  Not to include what is proposed, however, would mean the board would not take into account the gravity of the original offence.  The reality is that, when any parole board comes to consider a case, it will ask what the individual is convicted of.  The amendment raises an interesting point but, on balance, I will oppose it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-24a.379" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017052400002#P00300"><p>I oppose this amendment absolutely.  It is critical in decision-making that one knows the nature and gravity of the offence.  When I consider the cases that have come to me, I cannot think of one in which, when making a decision on release into society, I would not want to know the details on the nature and gravity of the offence or the risk to society.  I am referring to the exclusion of the nature and gravity of the offence from the list of relevant material that the board should endeavour to take into account under section 18.</p> <p>   Amendment 59 would make similar provision with respect to section 20.  The information in question is information that the parole board currently considers and information that parole boards traditionally considered.  To exclude the nature and gravity of the offence would be to exclude fundamental information that is essential.  The nature and gravity of the offence - the particular circumstances in which the murder or rape took place - must be known if one is making a decision on releasing somebody into society.  One also needs to consider a range of other issues.  When one examines the guiding principles in the Bill, one notes this is one of a whole series.  It is stated the board shall endeavour to take into consideration all relevant available information, including the stated reasons and recommendations of the sentencing judge.  This gives a lot of information about the context of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the person whose parole is being considered.  If the offence was committed when the prisoner was 19 and he is now 40, one needs to know what his behaviour has been like in prison, in addition to his attitude, engagement with the alcohol and drugs programmes and his engagement within prison.  One must also consider information from the trial or sentencing process.  Therefore, there is a long list of guiding principles.  The one in question is one of them but it is a very important one that should be left in the legislation.  In view of this I do not believe the amendment is a good one.</p> <p>  On amendment No. 54, I have already outlined my concerns with respect to the board taking into consideration an offender's plea at trial.  Moreover, I believe there should be sufficient information in the stated reasons and recommendations of the sentencing judge which are to be considered by the parole board without making specific provision to consider the offender's plea at trial.  As I said, section 19 provides that the parole board may grant release if the person being considered for parole will not present an undue risk to society and the release of the prisoner will facilitate reintegration.  I do not see how the nature of the offender's plea would inform either of these considerations.  We have discussed this.</p> <p>  I support amendment No. 55 as an alternative to amendments Nos. 56 and 57.  This amendment will require the board to assess the extent to which the person whose parole is being considered has been rehabilitated and is capable of being reintegrated into society.  That addresses the matters contained in the subsequent amendments from Deputies Daly and Wallace.  These are matters that are central to the way in which the board does its work at present.  I refer to all the issues associated with the potential for rehabilitation.</p> <p>  In Ireland, the average life sentence served is approximately 18 years.  It is very clear that, in this country, we assess all those issues.  In America, for example, there are much longer sentences and one does not have an opportunity to rehabilitate.  We all know the consequences of that.  We have a good system but all the various factors need to be taken into account.  One obviously has to focus on rehabilitation but, from what I have seen, I am very confident that it is fully taken into account.</p> <p>  On a more general point, sections 18 and 19 would benefit from further review as there is some overlap in the guiding principles under section 18 and the factors to which the board may have regard in deciding on whether to make a parole order under section 19.  For instance, section 19(1)(a) provides that the parole board may grant parole if, in its opinion, the person being considered for parole will not present an undue risk to society and the release of the person will facilitate the reintegration of that person into society.  To take up Deputy Daly's point, reintegration is one of the factors to which the board may have regard, as set out under subsection (2) of section 18.</p> <p>  With respect to the drafting of section 18, consideration will also need to be given to the numbering.  There may be some stand-alone subsections.  This, however, can be accounted for in any amendments to sections 18 and 19 to bring them further into line with each other.</p></speech>

I do not agree that we should crucify him again at the end.  We should have an open mind at the end as to where the person is in his head and life.</p> <p>  The Irish Penal Reform Trust believes there may be merit in the introduction of tariffs to life sentences where the judge stipulates the minimum custodial period that must be served on a life sentence before parole can be considered.  The trust is opposed to the introduction of any mandatory minimum custodial periods.  The Law Reform Commission and the Strategic Review of Penal Policy have both recommended that no new mandatory sentencing regimes be introduced.  The Law Reform Commission report on mandatory sentencing of 2013 recommends that where an offender is convicted of murder and is, therefore, sentenced to life in prison, legislation should provide that the judge may recommend a minimum term to be served by the offender.  This would deal with the issue.</p> <p>  Tariffs may provide clarity and reassurance to victims and to life-sentence prisoners in terms of the length of periods of imprisonment.  If tariffs are introduced where the original sentencing judge stipulates a minimum custodial period based on the gravity and circumstances of the offence, considering the nature and gravity of the offence, as in sections 18 and 19, after this period has been served may amount to re-sentencing.</p> <p>  Mr. Tom O'Malley of NUI has said there must be some mechanism for identifying the absolute minimum period a sentenced prisoner is required to serve before being eligible for release.  Otherwise, a parole board risks subjecting the prisoner to double jeopardy, that is, trying the prisoner twice for the same crime.  No one is saying otherwise but some people are definitely deemed unfit to be let loose in society because of the nature of their crimes, and they should be dealt with accordingly.</p><p>If a judge stipulates the minimum amount of time that a person must serve then the parole board must have an open mind and the notion that the person is in a different place must be entertained. </p></speech>

All of the guiding principles, such as the stated reasons and recommendations made by the sentencing judge, the information from the trial and the sentencing process, go to the very nature and gravity of the offence.  The nature and gravity of the original offence will form part of the decision-making process because of all of the other guiding principles.  Therefore, it is not necessary to specify the nature and gravity of the offence as a guiding principle.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-24a.383" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017052400002#Q00300"><p>Having listened to the debate I believe the amendment is even more important as a guiding principle.  The judge factors in the nature and gravity of an offence when sentencing.  Nobody is saying that the parole board will not know what the person has been imprisoned for.  Of course the board will know the type of crime.  It must recognise the impact the original crime has had on the victim but it must also recognise the impact on the victim of its decision to release the person up for parole.  That provision is still in place.  It is important that the submissions made by the victim are taken into account.  We are trying to avoid a situation where a person has ticked all of the boxes.  Presumably, if the nature and gravity of the crime is particularly appalling then the person will have been imprisoned for quite a while.  The person will have completed their treatment and therapy, admitted they are wrong, acknowledged their crime, tried to make amends and all of the rest and yet the decision could be held back by having to specifically take into account the nature and gravity of the crime.</p> <p>  The parole board will take account of the nature and gravity as it is in the background.  To spell it out does not bring balance and I believe it is better to remove the clause.  A parole board is supposed to assess whether a person is ready to be reintegrated in society.  To reach that stage the person will have had to cross many barriers.  In addition, many of the issues will have been dealt with at the sentencing stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-24a.384" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017052400002#Q00400"><p>I will go over this matter again.  Essentially, a parole board analyses the whole situation.  It conducts a risk assessment, on behalf of society, on the possibility for rehabilitation.  It seems to me that one cannot assess the current risk unless one understands the nature of the offence that was committed in the first place and the risks factors that led to same.  The nature and gravity of the offence must, absolutely in my view, be factored into the current risk assessment.</p> <p>  It was mentioned that one should not go back in time because the person has served his or her sentence.  Of course one must consider the circumstances, the nature and type of the offence.  That is the reason the person is in prison in the first place - the nature and the offence.  We are talking about very serious offences.  Understanding the particular circumstances that led to the offences in the first place in my view, and from my experience, is critical in terms of deciding what the next step would be.  It is critical for the parole board when it makes an assessment.  It considers the journey that the person has undertaken and it is a journey away from the offence that he or she committed in the first place.  The nature and type of offence must be centrally involved in the decision-making.  It is one of the factors.</p> <p>  Many of these crimes, where crimes have been committed by people who go before the parole board - any murder, any description of any murder, any rape and any of these serious reasons why people are in prison - are going to be horrendous situations.  That is the reason the person is in prison in the first place.  It is why the person started out being in prison.  Understanding the nature and type of the offence, the circumstances, and Deputy O'Callaghan gave examples of the type circumstances one could have in terms of being associated with alcohol and drugs, then understanding the journey the person has been on in prison in regard to drugs and alcohol would be a critical part of the decision-making.</p> <p>  My view is that this provision should absolutely be left in the legislation.  The provision is central to the current risk assessment that one makes about the future of the person.  It is one of many factors.  The other factors have been well spelled out in the Bill.  They include rehabilitation.  They include the other areas that I have already read out such as the details about the trial and what happened at the trial.  The provision is central.  To take it out would miss an essential part of a risk assessment.  In terms of having a safe society, it would be a great disservice to remove the nature and gravity of the offence that was committed in the first place.  </p> <p>  As far as mandatory sentencing is concerned, Deputy Wallace, it is a totally different issue.  I happen to agree and I think most of the bodies that have examined the matter, such as the Law Reform Commission and penal reform groups, have moved away from that stance.  One often gets calls in society for mandatory sentencing.  I support the view of the Law Reform Commission and penal reform groups in terms of this matter.  It is not a matter for the parole board.  That is a different issue and it dealt with in other legislation.</p></speech>

What has been objected to here is the specifically pulling out, into a stand-alone category, of the nature and gravity of the offence.  If one is going to give that an added weight by according it a particular section then other things should be given equal weight.  For example, the circumstances of the offender at the time.  Were they strung out on drugs?  Had they a psychotic breakdown or whatever?  Why would we not single out those matters as well?</p> <p>  Of course the nature of the offence is going to be considered.  The section refers to all of "the information from the trial" so it is not that the parole board is not going to know any of that.  It will know.  We are objecting to that aspect being signalled out as a factor for the board to consider without other factors being given equal weight.  That is all </p></speech>

Section 18 is on guiding principles.  Section 18(2) states:</p><blockquote>The Board shall also be guided by the following principles in the discharge of its functions:(a) the Board shall endeavour to take into consideration all relevant available information, including:<blockquote>(i) the stated reasons and recommendations of the sentencing judge; <br /><br />(ii) the nature and gravity of the offence;<br /><br />(iii) the degree of responsibility of the person whose parole is being considered;<br /><br />(iv) information from the trial.  </blockquote></blockquote> <p>Part of the problem is that this country has a one-size-fits-all punishment for murder and it is only a life sentence.  I am concerned that if one takes out the provision one will be left with a situation where judges will try to put themselves in a situation where they are going to have to try to distinguish between different types of murders.  One could have recommendations, which would not be permitted once this law came in.  In America one can be sentenced without parole.  Ireland has a statutory mechanism.  Obviously the parole board should take into account the nature and gravity of the offence.  </p><p>One could argue that Ian Brady and Myra Hindley should have got parole but I will not go into that discussion.  There is a process whereby people can judicially review a decision.  If the parole board refuses to grant parole to an individual for a period of 20 or 30 years solely due to the nature of the offence then that can be judicially reviewed by the individual concerned. </p><p>We must take into account that there will be people on the parole board who will try to do their best.  They have a difficult job to do.  They will try to balance the safety of the community, on the one hand, with the requirement of rehabilitation, on the other hand.  To remove this provision would be artificial.</p><p>Therefore, I will be opposing the amendment.</p></speech>

I think it accommodates many of the concerns that have been set out this morning.  I am proposing that someone who has been refused parole should be allowed to apply again after two years, or at an earlier date after a "shorter period as the Board may direct".  This amendment also takes on board many of Deputy Wallace's concerns about having applications dealt with "as soon as reasonably practicable" and gives the parole board a certain degree of leeway by allowing it to make "rules for the purpose of enabling this section to have full effect".  I ask Deputies to support the amendment.</p></speech>

As Deputy Wallace has said, it is probable that amendment No. 67 will be agreed.  The two amendments are almost identical.  Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment includes an extra provision.  The other four clauses are identical.  It is great that this clause is being inserted.  The only difference between the amendments relates to the two-year issue we discussed earlier.  We have said we will revisit that.  Therefore, we can go with Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment now.  We will revisit the two-year issue at some future stage.

Section 20(5) provides that when imposing a sentence on a person, a sentencing judge may impose a specified period during which that person shall not be eligible for parole.  This connects with my earlier comments regarding mandatory life sentences for persons convicted of murder.  Section 20(5) is a very significant provision and would require considerable consideration and further consultation.  As I said to Deputy Wallace, whether this is a matter that should be considered in a parole Bill requires further consideration.</p></speech>

I tabled the amendment in the context that the Irish Penal Reform Trust said that a violation of conditions in the absence of a criminal offence being committed should not automatically mean the person is returned to prison.  I know Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill provides for a parole licence to be suspended if somebody is deemed to be an undue risk or if he or she has breached his or her release conditions, and that is fair enough.  A suspension of a licence is fine but to have it entirely revoked with a person being sent back to prison to serve his or her full sentence is an incredibly serious decision and it should be one that is only taken for the most serious of reasons.  It should not be automatic for the breaching a condition.  The transgression has to be serious enough for it to amount to a criminal offence for it to be considered.</p><p>Amendment No. 82 deals the two-years versus one-year debate regarding a person whose parole licence has been revoked.  It provides for a person whose parole licence has been revoked not having to wait two years to have a review in that he or she could have one after a period of one year.  It is worth saying that the provision my amendment seeks to amend is deemed to be not appropriate by the current parole board.  That is why we decided to examine that and it is interesting to take on board the parole board's views on that issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-24a.478" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1355" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017052400002#S04400"><p>My comments are on the same theme.  My two amendments are similar to Deputy Daly's amendment but are worded differently.  The conditions attached should be reasonable and proportionate.  A breach in a parole order should not automatically mean a return to prison.  All relevant circumstances should be taken into consideration, including prior behaviour on licence.  A recall to prison can disrupt positive factors, which have been known to protect against reoffending, such as stable accommodation, employment, family relationships, contact with community health care and so on.  Therefore, a decision to recall a person to prison should be proportionate to the seriousness of conditions breached.</p> <p>  The intention must be to try to keep the individual out of prison if at all possible and that he or she would be only thrown back into it if there was no choice.  Proportionality is paramount.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-24a.479" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017052400002#S04500"><p>The section provides for the revocation of a parole order or the suspension of a parole order.  Deputies Daly and Wallace are correct in stating that serious sanctions can be imposed by the parole board.  They only arise in circumstances where conditions have been breached and the other grounds are set out in the section.  The section states that a person who is the subject of a parole order can have it revoked if he or she poses an undue risk to the safety of the community and he or she has breached his or her release conditions and the board is satisfied that the gravity of the matters outlined justify the revocation of a parole order.</p><p>Then there are lesser grounds for a suspension.  Either way, under section 25(4), they have an entitlement to a hearing and it is not as though one can have some arbitrary decision by the parole board stating it will revoke that person's parole order.  The person will get a hearing.  It is not feasible for it simply to be the case that they could only revoke it if the person has committed a criminal offence.  One is out on licence, to a certain extent, when one is out on parole and it is a privilege that one is being given.  It is not only if one commits a criminal offence.  One must comply with the conditions.  For instance, one of the conditions could be to stay away from a particular person.  If one starts approaching that person again, one shall have it revoked or suspended.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-24a.481" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017052400002#T00200"><p>Amendment No. 77 to section 25 would have the effect that a parole order may only be revoked if the person commits a criminal offence, as Deputy Clare Daly outlined.  Currently, the section provides that an order may be revoked if the person poses an undue risk to the safety of the community or any person - that stalking example is a good one - or persons or has breached a condition of his or her parole.  I would have very grave concerns about agreeing this amendment.  Parole is in effect conditional release.  A person knows precisely what the conditions are.</p> <p>  If a person was to pose an undue risk or breach a condition of his or her release, then the option of revoking the parole order must be available.  That is what it is about.  One is released on certain conditions.  It is not merely about whether one commits a further crime.  It is about all the varying conditions.  I return to the quality of the parole hearing.  If one has the proper risk assessment, one will have the proper conditions laid out in the order.</p> <p>  It is also the case that a person who has an order revoked is entitled, under the Bill, to a hearing following the revocation or suspension of an order.  The grounds for revocation, as set out in the Bill, are common grounds in parole practice and we should retain them.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 78 and 79 to section 20 would require any breach of conditions to be a serious breach.  The seriousness or otherwise of a breach of a condition is a matter which can be considered at the subsequent hearing.  A breach of a condition as a trigger for revocation or suspension of an order is a straightforward matter to determine.  Determining what amounts to a serious breach and who would make such a determination would introduce a subjectivity which could cause delay in what may be a high risk situation - one must keep that in mind.  Persons granted parole will be fully aware of the conditions of their release and their need to abide by those conditions.  All of that is part of the parole hearing.  It is laid out clearly.  The person will know precisely the conditions by which they must abide.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 81 is unnecessary, in my view.  There is no reason to consider that the hearing into the revocation of a parole order could amount to a renewed parole process.  It is clear from subsection (4) of section 25 that the person who is subject to the revocation of the parole order may make submissions &ndash; for the purpose of a hearing &ndash; in respect of the proposed grounds upon which it is proposed to revoke or suspend the order.</p> <p>  Amendment 82 was discussed in a fair bit of detail by us already.  It proposes the reduction, from two years to one year, in the subsequent period before which a person can seek to be further considered for parole.  I have already made clear my view on that.</p> <p>  I will comment on section 25 at a later stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-24a.482" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1355" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017052400002#T00300"><p>I disagree.  We do not expect to agree on everything.</p> <p>  We agreed that if someone seriously breaches his or her parole conditions, that is a very serious matter and should be dealt with accordingly.  However, life is not black and white.  We all break rules on a regular basis and we are not always necessarily penalised draconianly for it.  I certainly do anyway.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Callaghan states it is a pleasure to be out on parole.  There is an element of that, but if one is in prison for a long time, he or she would not be used to being out.  On the idea that one might breach some of the rules because one is out, like a calf in the shed after the winter being let out into a green field of grass who behaves in a funny fashion for a while until he or she gets used to it, the prisoner, when he is released after being inside for a long time, is in a strange place.  We should be somewhat flexible in how he deals with his new-found freedom and we should not be so black and white and inflexible about it.  That is all.</p></speech>

While a breach of the conditions is obviously serious, there can be extenuating circumstances and there are obviously different conditions.  Maybe we have not distinguished enough between decisions to revoke parole or suspend the licence.  Suspension of a licence is fair enough - I can see that - but what we are trying to say is it should be a serious criminal matter that has a person sent back to prison with his or her sentence reinstated.  I would imagine stalking and harassment are criminal matters and they would be covered under those conditions.  Obviously, that would be reprehensible and should be included.  It is in that context that we put it forward.  To be honest, it covers that.</p></speech>

If a person is stalking and harassing a person, Deputy Clare Daly's amendment requires that person to have committed a criminal offence.  That requires an adjudication by a court.  One cannot merely have the parole board stating that the person committed a criminal offence by doing that.</p> <p>  I agree that it is not black and white.  I would not like it to be operated in a black and white fashion.  I am sure the parole board would not operate it as such.  If somebody gets out of prison and gets into a bit of trouble in the first while, that is not an issue on which the parole board will state that his or her parole is revoked or suspended.  It requires discretion on the part of the parole board and that is the way it will operate.  It is a serious sanction.  It would only happen, I would have thought, in exceptional circumstances.  However, it is too prolonged a process to state that it would only happen where somebody has committed a criminal offence.</p></speech>

There will have been a rehabilitation plan that may have involved temporary periods visiting family.  For example, there may have been a move to an open prison.  That is taken into account when the parole board is examining the case.  That is merely to put in context what the Deputy stated.</p></speech>

Subsection (1) also allows for this to happen in circumstances where the chairperson does not believe that the circumstances are urgent and that the action needs to be urgent.  If someone is arrested under subsection (1), the Bill currently provides that the board can exercise the powers without holding a review or hearing.  My amendment tries to change that such that if the situation is not urgent and the board is considering having someone arrested and returned to prison, it needs to first conduct a review or hearing.  In section 26, there is a provision for the board to hold a review or hearing 21 days after the parolee has been locked up again.  My preference would be that in circumstances where that is not urgent, the review would take place before the reincarceration.</p></speech>

I do not think there is any controversy about them, they are changing a wording and removing a comma.</p> <p>  On Deputy Daly's amendment, section 26 deals with warrants.  The board has a substantial power here, however I would be concerned that it could not issue a warrant prior to having a review or hearing.  I see the Deputy's point about urgency but section 26(4)  provides for a hearing within 21 days after the person is so returned.  It has to be within 21 days.  It could be quicker.  I would have thought the parole board would be very anxious that any such hearings would take place very promptly.  I suspect that perhaps the Minister will wish to look at the whole issue of warrants on Report Stage, as it is a complicated area of the law and I will listen to what she has to say. </p></speech>

This is a section of the Bill to which I intend to bring further amendments.  I have been advised that the issuing of warrants by the parole board authorising a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to apprehend a person is not appropriate.  I will bring forward substantial amendments to this section to provide for a system of returning to custody a person released on parole where that would arise under the provisions of the Bill.</p> <p>  I would ask Deputies to consider not pressing these amendments, given that I am looking at revising this section in its entirety.

I was not concerned with diluting the powers of the board there, I was only putting it forward in the circumstances where the board said that it was not urgent and to provide for the review to be held beforehand rather than afterwards.

This is the first time this select committee has passed Committee Stage of a Private Members' Bill.  It is an important development and one I hope will be the forerunner of many in the time ahead.  I am delivering the message.  Members here have obviously expressed concern at the build-up of Private Members' Bills and are very anxious that as this Bill is facilitated with a money message, the same would issue for other Bills that are to be brought before us.  I say well done to Deputies Jim O&rsquo;Callaghan, Wallace and Clare Daly for their significant input.  I thank Deputies Farrell and Jonathan O'Brien for their attendance.  To the T&aacute;naiste and her officials, go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh go l&eacute;ir.</p></speech>

I remind members, witnesses and persons present to make sure their mobile phones are turned off.  The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the collapse of the Pilot Training College of Ireland.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-24a.600" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Kealy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017052400002#F00300"><p>We thank the committee for inviting us to present on behalf of the trainee pilots whose careers were devastated when the Pilot Training College of Ireland, PTC, collapsed five years ago.  Our presentation will address the background of the collapse and the level of investment in education the trainee pilots made, the collapse of PTC in the summer of 2012 and how much was lost by the trainee pilots, developments since the collapse, concerns we have about regulatory oversight of PTC and the human consequences, which Ms Kealy will cover.</p> <p>  PTC operated a pilot training business in Waterford as well as a Florida facility associated with the Florida Institute of Technology, both approved by the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA. The IAA oversaw the safety standards and training of the company as well as ensuring that there were sufficient resources to carry out training to the required standard.  Generally students did the early part of their training in Florida, where clear skies were usually available, before completing training in Waterford.  Training was provided to retail or self-funded students and airline-sponsored students.  Training was supposed to take approximately 14 months and cost between &euro;80,000 and &euro;90,000.  No State support or subsidy was available.  Fees were collected over the first seven months of the course even if the training schedule was falling behind.  The company was quite aggressive in ensuring collection.  Fees were not bonded.  Although that issue was considered after the collapse, the Minister at the time decided not to require bonding as a result of concerns that training firms would leave Ireland.  Prospective students and their sponsors would have taken comfort from the IAA approval and also an investment in the company by Enterprise Ireland.</p> <p>  PTC ceased training students in late June 2012 and the IAA suspended its approval as a flight training organisation on 3 July 2012.  The company initially went into examinership in July.  The examinership was not successful and liquidation was initiated in late September 2012.  While liquidation has not yet finally concluded, there will be nothing for the students.  A total of &euro;7.7 million net fees, in respect of which no training was delivered, had been prepaid at the date of the collapse.  A figure of &euro;8.4 million gross was due as the company claimed that &euro;700,000 was owed to it by some individuals.  At the same date, the company had an estimated deficit of &euro;7.2 million.  Essentially, the students paid for the failure.   The 60 or so students we represent were among those most impacted upon and were owed &euro;2.6 million.  In total, 300 students were affected, including some whose training was airline-sponsored.</p> <p>  The &euro;7.7 million net owed as at June 2012 compared to &euro;3.6 million owed in December 2010.  In the intervening 18 months, the company lost &euro;5 million.  That situation was not helped by advertising costs of &euro;1.2 million incurred in 2011 alone, as the company aggressively tried to expand.  That effort failed with the company having essentially used prepaid student fees for training it could never afford to deliver.  It would appear that the company had no cash and was instead relying on prepaid fees to pay its way.</p><p>Hardly any cash has been realised since the liquidation which commenced in September 2012, not even enough to pay the liquidator.   The parent company of PTC, Shemburn, owed PTC &euro;1.6 million and was subsequently liquidated.  However, little value was realised from the company and nothing is expected to go to PTC.  The liquidator of PTC sought to restrict directors of the company through High Court proceedings in February 2016 before Judge Haughton.  The proceedings resulted in the managing director and main shareholder being restricted from acting as a company director for five years.  Judge Haughton was very sympathetic in his approach but was not in a position to do anything for the students because the company had no money.</p><p> A range of complaints were made by students and their sponsors to the Garda bureau of fraud investigation but no action has been taken to date.  In October 2012, Following a meeting with the Irish Aviation Authority in October 2012, this committee indicated it would undertake a forensic investigation of the collapse.  However, that decision was subsequently reversed when the committee met in private session.</p><p> PTC and its sister operation in Florida were approved by the IAA, which undertook a review in September 2011 as part of its renewal and review process, during which additional financial information was sought.  PTC's approval was renewed in spite of its precarious financial position.  The additional information was requested pursuant to a section of the regulations which deals with concerns about the lack or apparent lack of financial resources.</p><p> Freedom of information disclosures show that the IAA reviewed the company accounts of Shemburn, the parent company of PTC, although these were not the group accounts because they did not consolidate its subsidiaries.  It was solely the company accounts.  Shemburn had a &euro;1 million reported net worth at December 2010. The IAA noted that Shemburn did not have qualified accounts.  However, Shemburn was not the entity it was approving for flight training.  A review of PTC&rsquo;s accounts would have shown a &euro;2 million deficit at December 2010, &euro;3.6 million owed to students and a serious qualification of the accounts which stated that the conditions in being at the time indicated the existence of a material uncertainty which may have cast significant doubt over the company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern.  PTC could only survive by collecting fees upfront to fund training which had already been paid for by other students.  The IAA director of safety regulation stated at a committee meeting in October 2012 that many flight training companies are like Ponzi schemes.  A review of the PTC accounts would have shown this to be the case.  PTC was borrowing from Peter to pay Paul.  In view of the fact that PTC had little or no cash, how could the IAA have concluded that it had the resources to carry out pilot training to the required standards?  The IAA showed excessive forbearance in allowing it to continue to operate.  One of the objectives of the IAA was to promote aviation education and training in Ireland and it formed College Ireland in 2010 to further that aim.  In addition, Enterprise Ireland injected stabilisation funds of almost &euro;400,000 into PTC in 2010 by way of preference shares.  Unfortunately, that investment was lost.  The desire to promote companies such as PTC almost certainly resulted in forbearance when hard decisions were required.  The problem with that is that it was the students&rsquo; moneys that were at risk and ultimately completely lost.</p><p> The Minister noted in 2012 that students would have lost money no matter when intervention, including the withdrawal of approval, occurred, implying that earlier intervention was contemplated.  Such earlier intervention would have resulted in reduced overall losses as sums owed for training due increased dramatically from &euro;3.6 million to &euro;7.7 million in the final 18 months of the company's operation.</p></speech>

For many students, this was their only chance for a career or education in flying.  When PTC collapsed with no reimbursements for students, their dreams collapsed.  Some trainees were ashamed to talk about it.  We set up and continue to run a Facebook group for these students in order to keep us all together and communicate any progress or developments in our quest for justice over the past five years.  We knew it would keep at least some hope alive.  Approximately 120 students have continually followed the group since the collapse of PTC in July 2012.  I have an interest in mental health and hope that having communication with others on the issue through the Facebook group kept some people from thinking it was all over.</p> <p>  Some students managed to fund the completion of their training although this generally caused significant financial strain for their families.  Many others did not complete the training and suffered severe financial consequences without a career to show for them.  At least one family had to downsize their house to afford the additional fees for a son of the family to continue his training.  Another almost had their home repossessed and had a major row with their bank.  One student had a stress-induced seizure and will never be allowed to fly again, which is very sad.  Some students took the exams at a later stage but the exams had changed in format or content and students did not receive a discount on the exam fees.  There was no way of getting any money back.  A woman told me at the weekend that her family was under such financial pressure after her son's dreams were dashed in 2012 that her marriage broke up.</p></speech>

The operation of PTC was totally dependent on IAA approval.  By showing the forbearance it did, the IAA allowed the students of PTC to suffer great damage to their financial positions and ambitions.  The more recently-recruited students were generally owed the most and might not have suffered at all had the company been closed earlier, whereas those who finished during the forbearance period benefited from the expenditure of that cash.  Unfortunately, Ms Kealy and I are in the former category.</p> <p>  In its administration and governance, including due diligence in reviewing the accounts of Shemburn rather than those of PTC, the IAA did not act with appropriate care in carrying out its responsibilities, particularly given the acknowledged incidence of Ponzi scheme conditions in flight training schools.  Subsequent to the PTC collapse, analogous situations involving the safety responsibilities of public bodies, such as the case of Priory Hall, resulted in very large usages of public moneys.  There was considerable co-ordinated action across Departments and the private sector in regard to problems involving English language schools.  While the cost of flights home for trainee pilots stranded in the US was covered by the IAA, no other financial assistance was forthcoming other than the preservation of flight records.  As Ms Kealy noted, students who ended up re-doing exams when time limits ran out received no discount on the fees charged by the IAA.</p> <p>  Five years after the company's collapse, this is still a sore issue for all affected.  We appeal to the committee members to give our case and the futures of all these young people a full and deserved hearing.</p></speech>

This issue has been going on for five years and has been very difficult for the witnesses, pilots and their families.  Of the 60 students that the witnesses represented, how many have gone on to become pilots or pursued other careers?</p></speech>

I estimate approximately 50% or a little more have managed to become pilots because they have obtained the fees for their training by hook or by crook.  There is a perception that many of these students come from very well-off families.  The vast majority of families with whom we have interacted in this regard took out extra mortgages or used redundancy moneys and in some cases the students themselves had saved up for years to be able to afford the training.</p><p>There were probably a couple who had sufficient funds and did not have to remortgage or mortgage themselves to the hilt.  Unfortunately, a range of students, whom we have become aware of from the Facebook group, have been unable to carry on.  One chap got a job since working in the airport in order that he could be near planes.  He cannot afford to be a pilot.</p></speech>

We collected money from all the student families in order that we could have representation during the examinership and so on but when it is was looking much more difficult, if we had tried to take legal action against the IAA, it would probably have been a High Court hearing and we would have to put up the money up-front.

Are other similar companies in operation in Ireland?  If so, how are they governed?  Are there bonding systems in place?  My understanding is no bonding system was in place at the time and that continues to be the case.  According to the documentation, not alone are there no bonding systems in Ireland, there are no bonding systems in the UK.  Could Mr. Kealy flesh that point out?</p></speech>

We paid FIT, which was covered by the IAA to continue the training.  Our son completed some of this training there and he went to Atlantic Flight Training Academy in Cork.  To be fair to the academy, it took a good few of the students, particularly the company-sponsored students.  In our dealings with them, they have only ever asked for the money on a pay-as-you-go basis.  They never looked for stage payments on a strict timetable basis.  We said if we got involved with another company, it would have to be on the basis that we just paid as we went and Atlantic Flight Training Academy, fortunately, was in that position.  I believe that is also the approach of the National Flight Centre in Weston.  Those are the two primary trainers in the country.  A few others provide modest training.</p></speech>

In the prior year, the last set of accounts for the company would have shown a deficit.  At the same time, it had made a profit.  At the time we made a decision, the prior year's accounts were not available because they did not become available until autumn 2011.  It was quite slow about producing accounts.  The company had been operating for about ten years.  It seemed to have a good reputation in general from what people who had been trained at it said.  The issue that it really ran into was that it started trying to change its strategy and tried to become something much bigger.  In the process, it effectively wasted much money.</p></speech>

The biggest one was Air Astana, the Kazakh airline, which was owed about &euro;1 million.  Those airlines essentially just shifted their students elsewhere, because they lost money but could absorb it and live with it.  They wanted to get their pilots trained, so they just moved.  Air Astana moved to Atlantic Flight.  I am not sure what the other airlines did.  Unfortunately, that was not the case for the privately funded students.</p></speech>

What happened was that the training, depending on who one listened to, was running well behind.  There was a row going on on the ground in Florida between PTC and Florida Institute of Technology, FIT, which is the company in Florida.  It had not been paid by PTC in quite some time and it only subsequently came out that there had been a number of cases over the previous nine months when training was stopped because payment had not been made by PTC.

That was a point that was used along the way.  The point has also been made that the IAA is not a consumer protection organisation.  It is its role to be a safety regulator.  However, in its role as safety regulator, it needs to make sure that a company that is providing training has sufficient resources to carry out the training safely.  This company unfortunately did not have that money.</p><p>As I outlined in my opening statement, there were clearly some concerns on the IAA's part because its request for information in September 2011 referenced an article in the international regulations which pertains where the authority - in this case the IAA - has concerns over the financial position and resources of the company.  Our concern is that it based its opinion on the financial status of the company on the wrong set of accounts.  It seems that they looked at my brother to see whether he had money even though they were relying on me.  That was the wrong thing to do.  Our view is that the IAA, in failing to do its job correctly, effectively exposed us to losses.  If it had done its job correctly, the company would have ceased approval at a much earlier date and we would not have lost money.</p></speech>

That company had net assets of &euro;1 million.  When we look behind it, part of the assets were made up of an investment in the pilot training college.  Those accounts were not qualified.  If, however, the IAA had looked at the accounts of the company that it was actually giving the approval to, that company's accounts were heavily qualified.</p></speech>

The average amount that our group was owed was about &euro;40,000, whereas across the 300 private students the average was much smaller.

We discreetly asked various students that we were dealing with if they knew those people and in some cases they did not.  The student who was owed the most had literally started in Florida about two months beforehand, and because of delays had actually paid the vast bulk of the money by that stage.  The students did not manage to make contact with those people.  Other people just wanted to move on because they were so ashamed about it.  It was a nightmare for them.</p></speech>

On the issue of the wrong accounts being audited, the fact that the pilot training college's accounts were not audited and the fact that the IAA was responsible to ensure that the company had sufficient funds to provide the courses, did the witnesses ever get a satisfactory explanation from the IAA?  Did it take responsibility?  It does not seem that it was prepared to take it further.  It did not accept that it did not carry out the job that it was tasked with.</p></speech>

It did not deal with the substantial issue that it was tasked with, which was to ensure that the company was in a sufficient financial state to continue with the education courses that it was advertising.  That would have come under the remit of the IAA at that time.</p></speech>

In writing back to us, it would say that it is not a commercial regulator and that its role was solely safety oversight.  One of the executives in the IAA would write back to Ms Kealy.  That was the line it took.  Its role is very much driven by the international regulations, and those regulations make it quite clear that there is a financial monitoring role in making sure that a company has sufficient resources.  It is not a guarantee of the moneys.  At the same time, however, if the flight training organisation is dependent on people prepaying moneys in ever-increasing amounts in order to be able to fly a plane, there is something wrong.</p></speech>

However, we received legal advice that we had no privity of contract in terms of our ability to take any action against the auditors because we did not have a relationship with them.  It appears that the IAA relied on promises the company made.  However, Ireland is not a big place and the industry is not big; therefore, everybody must have known pretty much everything that was happening.  One of the notes I gave the committee notes that a person who was a director of the IAA was employed by PTC for a while.  I say this not because I know that they did something wrong, but because it shows how small the industry is when there is this interconnectedness.  I would be amazed if the IAA was not aware.  For example, during 2011 PTC was in the process of being approved to act as a training company for Aer Lingus.  For some reason, in the autumn of 2011, Aer Lingus ended that relationship.  I would be shocked if the IAA was not aware that this had happened.  It should have questioned about what was going on at that point.  PTC stated it was trying to change its strategy, which was to move over to airlines and stop taking on retail funded students.  It was trying to link with a number of big airlines, but it failed to get a number of big contracts and in the process spent a great deal of money.  The most local contract was with Aer Lingus.  How did the IAA or anybody connected with the industry not know that there clearly was some reason Aer Lingus decided not to proceed?</p></speech>

In 2012 the country was in a far more challenging financial position, but I do not know whether that was a contributory factor.  Subsequently, there have been a number of cases in which public bodies paid a large amount of taxpayers' money, for example, that of Priory Hall.  I accept that it is in a different sphere, but it still involves a large amount of taxpayers' money to deal with a safety related issue where there was a failing by public sector officials.  On that basis, we sought some contribution towards the future training costs of the students. We understood it might have to be on an <i>ex gratia</i>basis, because we believed that had it not been for the way matters had played out, PTC would have been closed down much earlier and that we would have lost far less money.  As it was a commercial organisation, we accept that we will not get everything back, but we thought there might be some compensation.  A big deal was made about the fact that the flights back to Ireland were paid for, but there was not a lot of money involved across all of the students.</p></speech>

There was no arrangement.  When we went to the Atlantic Flight Training Academy in Cork, the academy agreed to conduct things on a pay-as-you-go basis.  That was its decision.  There was no payment or compensation paid other than the cost of the flights and, as the IAA stated, protecting the flight records which it is important to protect.  I return to the point that we do not believe PTC, in normal circumstances, should have been allowed to continue to operate as it did.  Essentially, it was using our money to fund its losses, activities and expansion.</p></speech>

I will describe the way it was worked.  PTC had very few assets.  Its main assets when it went into liquidation were moneys owed to it by Shemburn, which is called the parent company, but it is more complicated than that in terms of who the shareholders were.  There was &euro;1.6 million owed by the parent company which had used the cash received from PTC to buy aircraft and a simulator.  It was over-lending to Shemburn by PTC and particularly that loan which caused Mr. Justice Haughton to decide to restrict the director of PTC because it had previously written off a loan between the two companies and then proceeded to give another, even though it had already lost &euro;1.6 million.</p><p>Essentially, Shemburn owned the planes.

It owned the planes but basically got the funds from PTC to do it.  When Shemburn was also put into liquidation -  the liquidator of Shemburn was Kieran Wallace of KPMG &ndash; essentially it tried to get the planes sold but issues arose over registration rights and ownership.  The planes were left out in the weather and as members are aware, the weather in Ireland is not a good thing and therefore they sold for a lot less.  The main director of PTC and Shemburn effectively claimed that he had a charge over the assets and took the most valuable assets on the basis that he had a right to them, even though nothing in that regard was mentioned in the accounts.  Basically, there is no money.</p></speech>

It went through the audited accounts signed by Cooney Carey.  This is where it looked at the Shemburn accounts, as opposed to the accounts of PTC.  It noted the accounts were not qualified and it stated it reviewed the financial projections provided by the company for 2011 to 2013, which includes the profit and loss balance sheets and cashflows.  The company projected profits for each year.  The company showed positive net cashflow over the period.  The IAA also stated as recently as early June 2012 &ndash; this was written in July 2012 &ndash; that it met the CEO of PTC and he assured the IAA that sufficient funding was in place until at least year-end 2012, which it clearly was not.  As I previously noted, a specific request was made by the IAA in September 2011 and we received a copy of that letter from the liquidator, which indicated that it was invoking a request for additional information under one of the rules in terms of the ongoing financial monitoring which indicated to me that the IAA had specific concerns over the financial resources of the company.</p></speech>

These accounts were not signed until 29 August 2011.  It appears they were lodged with the CRO on 27 October 2011.  Basically, there was a section which said, emphasis on matter &ndash; continued financial support.  It was stated that in forming their opinion, which was not qualified, the auditors had considered the adequacy of the disclosures made in the notes to the accounts.  It was stated that the company was owed money by a company and the directors believed that the loan would be fully recovered within two years.  The directors stated the company was on track to achieve significant budget profits for the year.  It was said that the conditions indicated the existence of material uncertainty which might cast significant doubt over the company's ability to continue as a going concern.  The financial statements did not include any adjustments that would result if the company was unable to continue as a going concern.  It subsequently came out from the independent auditor's report at the time of the examinership that even though the company's accounts were already &euro;2 million in the red, there was an overstatement of &euro;700,000 in the position of the company so it was really &euro;2.7 million in the red.</p></speech>

There was a significant number of local authority properties in Priory Hall and that is separate.

I think that is where Mr. Kealy is coming in respect of how the  IAA, when examining the accounts, looked at the wrong company - the parent company as opposed to the subsidiary, which was directly taking the student fees.  In respect of the IAA and the discounts Mr. Kealy mentioned, does the authority run those schools or courses?</p></speech>

The IAA carries out both written and practical, that is to say flying, examinations.  It charges accordingly for those.  One of the points from our perspective is that we appreciate the responsibility, but in our view the IAA should have intervened earlier.  As an external observer, in light of the fact that it was trying to promote aviation training and education in Ireland and had actually set up a body the previous year, it would have looked pretty bad if it had ended up closing one of the largest pilot training colleges in Ireland within six or nine months.  In many ways, the IAA was very heavily invested in promotion.  As we have seen, it is very difficult for a body which has a job promoting things to come down harshly on those carrying out the activities it promotes.  A comment that I have heard is that a regulator is needed.  Regulators can be slow about taking action.  Things can get pretty bad, and only when the problems finally blow up does the person with the job of cleaning up ask why it was not stopped sooner.</p></speech>

It went out of business in 1992.  I was not aware of issues going back that far but it was attached to the response to a freedom of information request we put in requesting documents from the IAA.</p><p>Another company, Cabair International, UK, went out of business approximately one year before the Pilot Training College of Ireland went out of business.  As I mentioned earlier, one of the trainers in the IAA told me that when he was undergoing training in Scotland, the pilot training college he was attending went bust and he lost money.  Unfortunately, it is pretty common.</p></speech>

The director of safety regulation from the IAA made the point during a meeting of this committee in 2012 that there were a lot of similarities to ponzi schemes in terms of flight training organisations.  I assume, based on that comment, that a lot of those organisations have sought fees up front and at the end of the day some of them have gone bust on the back of that.</p></speech>

Mr. Kealy noted that the college in question made a profit of approximately &euro;500,000 in 2010 and that in the 18 months ending June 2012 a loss of &euro;5 million was incurred by the company.  Has any satisfactory explanation been offered for the high loss in the period prior to the collapse of the company?  Was the company operating differently during that time?  It is clear to me that those losses included prepaid student fees, which is wrong.</p></speech>

According to company statements - this is repeated in a number of other documents we have seen - the company decided to go after big airlines in terms of student recruitment, in respect of which it spent a great deal on advertising, but, unfortunately, a lot of the business it chased did not come to pass.  It spent &euro;1.2 million on advertising in 2011.  We do not have a breakdown of what the advertising included because there were very few lines of information in what we received.  It appears to us that a lot of that money was spent on advertising to recruit more retail students, which was not consistent with the company's new strategy.  It went after Aer Lingus, Turkish Airlines, Qatar Airlines and a few others.  Having spent money, which was students' money, it did not land the contracts either because people withdrew or at least did not proceed.</p></speech>

We need to ask the question what if, as appears, the wrong accounts were reviewed and whether if the right accounts had been reviewed students would not have lost such vast sums of money.  I would like to assure the witnesses that I will be urging this committee to look into this matter further to ensure we get satisfactory answers to the questions raised today.</p></speech>

I was unable to be here for the earlier part of the meeting as I was involved in other meetings.  Many constituents of mine from Roscommon-Galway were caught up in what happened and are very sore and bitter about it.  As the witnesses may already have answered similar questions to mine from other members, I am happy to accept brief responses.  Is it true that the total cost of the collapse was &euro;5 million?</p></speech>

In many cases, people are owed &euro;50,000, &euro;60,000 and &euro;70,000, which are large amounts.  This was due in part to the fact that training was delayed.  Money was collected in the first seven months.  While one would expect a lot of expenses around flight training to have been incurred during that time unfortunately the students were spending more time on the ground than on flying.  PTC says this was the partially the responsibility of FIT, the US company.  However, it was also due to the fact that PTC was not paying the US company.  In our view, it was recruiting more students to get more cash upfront so that it could feed its habit.</p></speech>

Essentially, they have nowhere to go.  We would not be able to gather the money together to take action against the IAA.  Even though the IAA has significant responsibility in this area, the legal advice we received, which was provided free, is that pinning it on it, legally, would be difficult.  We have pursued the company itself but it has no money.  We have no way of getting at the directors of the company.  We do not have the cash to do that.  We gathered together approximately &euro;15,000 in the early days to employ solicitors, who actually did approximately &euro;30,000 worth of work on our behalf but accepted only &euro;15,000, but we did not have the money to take the matter to the High Court.  We were told that to take an action against the IAA we would be required to put cash upfront.</p></speech>

At the time we received good publicity from newspapers, but we never received an "official" hearing.  We are appealing to the broad body politic and the Government to see if anything can be done to in some way compensate the people concerned for what we believe we have highlighted as failings in the way certain public bodies carried out their roles, although they did not have specific responsibility for us.  Nonetheless, by letting a company continue to operate when, in retrospect, they should not have, it has cost us money and we deserve to get something.  Unfortunately, we do not have a legal route and although we have been told that we could try to sue, there is a good chance we would not win.  The Irish Aviation Authority has indicated that it has been told by its directors to defend any case.  If we wanted to take an action, we would have to put money upfront.</p></speech>

There is also the wider question of how to prevent this from happening again and what regulatory changes are required to ensure it can never happen to anybody again, whether in the field of aviation, education or anywhere else.  These considerations must be decided by the committee and the appearance of the delegates has brought it back onto the agenda and we will pursue it.
