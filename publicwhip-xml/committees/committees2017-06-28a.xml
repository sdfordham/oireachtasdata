Before we commence our consideration of the Mediation Bill 2017, I wish to notify members that we have one item to discuss in private session at the end of this meeting when the Minister leaves.  I ask members to stay for that brief consideration.</p> <p>  Today's meeting of the Select Committee on Justice and Equality has been convened to consider Committee State of the Mediation Bill 2017.  I welcome the new Minister for Justice, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and offer congratulations to him on his new portfolio appointment and responsibility.  I also welcome his officials.  I understand the Minister must leave early and will be replaced in the course of our deliberations by the Minister of State, Deputy John Paul Phelan.  That was flagged to me earlier, but I am unsure if that is still the case.</p> <p>  We will proceed to the consideration of the Bill.  Does the Minister wish to say a few words?</p></speech>

I am in his hands on all occasions at which I attend here as Minister.  I wish to acknowledge the importance of this committee.  In my previous ministerial iteration or guise, I always acknowledged the importance of the appropriate committees and those committees would have acknowledged that we worked in a mutual manner.  I hope the Chairman's committee and I will have a similarly positive and constructive relationship.  I am happy to be here and I am happy at all times to engage with the committee.</p> <p>  I am keen to proceed with this Bill which I know is one of urgency for the committee.  I have a busy schedule and I note what the Chairman said about the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan.  I understand the Chairman is allowing me some respite to attend the plenary session of the D&aacute;il for the Judicial Appointments Bill and I am due back this afternoon on another important issue.  I hope we can proceed with as many of these amendments as possible in the timeframe envisaged.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017062800002#A00800"><p>I move amendment No. 1:</p><blockquote>In page 5, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following:<br /><br />&ldquo; &ldquo;civil dispute&rdquo; means any civil dispute to which this Act applies by virtue of <i>section 3</i>;&rdquo;.</blockquote> <p>I have three amendments in this section, amendments Nos. 1, 4 and 7.  The whole purpose of the grouping is to seek to clarify that the Bill applies to a wider group of disputes rather than only those in which civil proceedings have been issued.  We feel that the use of the word &quot;proceedings&quot; is likely to cause confusion for the public and for the mediators themselves and could give rise to a belief that in order for the protections of the Bill to apply, proceedings will have had to have been issued.  It is to try to clarify some of those points.  I know the Minister has tabled amendment No. 3 to change the definition of proceedings to civil proceedings that may be initiated before a court.  What I am asking the Minister to clarify here is that this amendment means that the Bill applies to any dispute in which there is a potential to litigate, that the proceedings do not have had to have been issued.  Could he clarify that in the context of this amendment and what kinds of disputes he thinks would be excluded from the provision?  Notwithstanding the Minister's amendment, the argument remains that for the avoidance of doubt in the public's mind, a &quot;dispute&quot; is better than &quot;proceedings&quot;.  It heads off any potential confusion.  This is a critically important Bill as far as we are concerned.  We want to encourage people to use mediation as an alternative to court.</p><p>We do not want people thinking it has to go through the courts process.  There are situations in which this could cause irrevocable damage, for example, a dispute between neighbours.  If somebody starts litigation it is very hard to come back from that and go into a mediation process.  We want people to know they can get to mediation before the issue goes to court and that they can have an early intervention to de-escalate things.  In that sense, I think "dispute" is a better word.  I know Deputy Wallace has "dispute" rather than my wording, which is "civil dispute".  I am open to that argument.</p></speech>

I invite the Minister to respond.  He has amendments in this grouping also.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017062800002#B00300"><p>This group of eight amendments, namely, amendment No. 1 and amendments Nos. 3 to 9, inclusive, all relate to the scope of the Bill.  I acknowledge the contribution of my predecessor, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Fitzgerald, on this legislation.  I hope we can advance matters today and set a date for future progress also.</p> <p>  Following publication of the Bill and Second Stage discussions, my Department received a number of submissions on scope-related issues.  It was felt by some that section 3 was so structured as to create an impression that the Bill would apply only to civil proceedings and not to disputes which had not reached the stage of proceedings.  That, of course, is not the intention.  My Department has held discussions with the Office of the Attorney General, the Courts Service and mediation groups, including the Mediators' Institute of Ireland, in an effort to find a wording that would ensure the Bill&rsquo;s provisions would apply to disputes in the civil law arena.  I believe we can reach accommodation on the issues raised by Deputy Daly in her amendment.</p> <p>  In amendment No. 3, I propose to replace the definition of proceedings in section 2 in order to remove the reference to section 3 and to make it clear that "proceedings" means "civil proceedings which can be instituted before a court".  Using that phrasing will resolve the issue raised by Deputy Daly.  In amendment No. 5, I propose to delete section 3(1), which specified that the Bill applied to any civil proceedings.  The title of the section will be changed to "Scope" instead of "Application".  In amendment No. 8, I propose to delete the words "any of the following".</p> <p>  The net effect of these amendments is to make it clearer that the Bill will apply to disputes as well as civil proceedings.  I am aware that amendments Nos. 1, 4, 6 and 7, tabled by Deputies Daly and Wallace, are designed to bring about the same effect.  I hope, subject to the agreement of the committee and of the two Deputies, that the amendments I have tabled will address adequately the issues they have raised.</p> <p>  As regards amendment No. 9, the position is that following further discussions with the Office of the Attorney General, it was accepted that the exclusion of proceedings before a tribunal under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts 1921 to 2011, a commission under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, or a committee under the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013, as provided for in section 3(2)(f), does not arise and, in the circumstances, might be removed.</p></speech>

I should have invited him to speak as the proposer of amendment No. 6.</p></speech>

I think we are all on the same wavelength.  We do not have an issue with it.</p></speech>

Does the Minister have any idea of what kind of disputes we envisage the amendment would exclude?  Are there any?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1355" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017062800002#B01200"><p>I move amendment No. 2:</p><blockquote>In page 6, line 21, after &ldquo;means a&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;confidential&rdquo;.</blockquote> <p>Confidentiality is a very important aspect of mediation and one of the main reasons for the success of the process.  We note the Mediators' Institute of Ireland was concerned that if the confidential nature of mediation was to be in any way undermined, parties to a dispute would be less likely to use mediation as a process to resolve their dispute.  It is probably necessary to include references to confidentiality in the definition of mediation and also to extend confidentiality to third party participants and oral communications.  It has been recommended by the Mediators' Institute of Ireland, the Law Reform Commission and the Law Society that a reference to confidentiality be included in the statutory definition of mediation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017062800002#B01300"><p>This is a must-have amendment for us.  The bedrock of mediation is trust.  That is going to be undermined if confidentiality cannot be guaranteed.  Parties may not be willing to speak openly if there is a risk that some of the material could be used later in potential litigation.  The whole purpose of mediation is to resolve disputes through an open forum.</p> <p>  The Mediators' Institute of Ireland points out that communications between parties made with the intent of settling judicial proceedings have traditionally been protected by the courts and by common law in terms of the "without prejudice" privilege.  Statements contained in a document marked "without prejudice" or made verbally on that basis in a genuine attempt to settle a dispute cannot be used to undermine a person later on.  This process is about trying to avoid litigation.  If the parties are genuinely trying to resolve a dispute, they need that protection.  It is there anyway in court proceedings.  It is important to say that "without prejudice" privilege also has limitations.  The party relying on it must show that the dispute existed at the time of the communication and that legal proceedings had commenced or the communication was in contemplation of litigation.  It is not enough that the communication concerns a matter in dispute for the privilege to be upheld.  There must an indication of settling the dispute in that sense.</p> <p>  There is a well-accepted value to confidentiality in the resolution of disputes and it has to be spelled out in these provisions if we are to woo people away from the courts into an alternative channel.  The Law Society of Ireland, Law Reform Commission and the Mediators' Institute of Ireland all say this is fundamental and I think it has to go into the body of the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017062800002#B01400"><p>I support this amendment.  It is very important that mediations remain confidential, not just between the mediator and parties involved but also to any individual who is brought into the mediation process as an expert or whatever.  The whole process must be recognised as being confidential.  We were going to table an amendment to this effect on Report Stage but since Deputies Daly and Wallace have proposed it now, we will be supporting their amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017062800002#B01500"><p>I cannot resist acknowledging the rather unusual context of Deputies Wallace and Daly seeking to provide for privacy and confidentiality.  My experience with both Deputies is otherwise.</p><p>I am happy to hear the submissions.  Discussions on amendment No. 10 should have regard to later amendments, Nos. 28 and 31.  I would draw the attention of Deputies to section 10, which sets out in some detail the confidential nature of the process of mediation.  I do not believe it is strictly necessary to amend the definition in the manner suggested by Deputies Wallace and Daly, but in the spirit of compromise and with due deference to the submissions from Deputies Wallace and Daly, I am willing to accept the amendment.  We will have to adjust the punctuation for the purposes of the readability of the definition, but I am happy to accept the amendment from Deputies Daly and Wallace.</p></speech>

I appreciate the point raised by Deputy Wallace, and indeed the intention behind the amendment, but I really do not see a pressing need for it.  Having regard to section 10 already dealing in detail with the issue of confidentiality, the committee will also note that I have tabled amendment No. 29 for later on, which will further strengthen that section.  It will also serve to clarify that all statements, including oral statements, in any form of mediation, must fully respect the concept of confidentiality.  This will also cover any general explanation of the reasons of the mediator for withdrawing from a mediation.  I accept what Deputy Wallace is saying.  I do not take issue with him, but I believe it is unnecessary for the actual construct of the Bill.  I ask him to accept that and not to press the amendment.  In the context of his reflection, if we complete matters today, I am open to having this issue revisited on Report Stage.  I do not see the necessity.</p></speech>

It would argue that the Bill, as it is, fails to deal with the regulation of mediators.  Without regulation, anyone can claim to be a mediator, and the mediators to whom the courts refer people should be regulated.  The change will help give people a qualified mediator who subscribes to a specific, not just any, code of practice.  As the Bill stands, the mediator could subscribe to any code of practice he or she devises.  Without such an amendment, there would be no standardisation and the code of practice would be non-binding on mediators.  The Mediators Institute of Ireland and the Law Society have expressed concerns about this.</p></speech>

At present, section 8 holds that &quot;the mediator shall, prior to the commencement of the mediation ... furnish to the parties a copy of any code of practice to which he or she subscribes&quot;.  Therefore, it is proposed that mediators be able basically to write something on the back of a napkin as long as they say it is their code of practice.  My first amendment seeks to place an obligation on the mediators to subscribe to a single code of practice, changing &quot;any&quot; to &quot;the&quot;.</p><p>My second amendment is linked with this in that it provides that all mediators' codes of practice &quot;shall incorporate in full ... the code of practice prepared and published [by the Minister] under <i>section 9</i>&quot;.  During Second Stage debate on the Bill, even Government backbenchers made the point that there is no point in the Minister publishing a code of practice for the conduct of mediators only for mediators not to be obliged to follow it.  It does not make any sense.  In this sense, section 9 is undermined by section 8 in that mediators do not have to sign up to the code of practice and, therefore, all of the good aspirations in section 9(2) about ethical standards being observed and continuing professional development can basically be junked by a mediator who is empowered to design his or her own code if he or she so wishes.  Given that we were discussing in the House last week the regulation of other professional bodies, we need regulation here, and the mediators themselves want it.</p><p>I note that the Law Society said it was very disappointed that proportionate and appropriate regulation of mediators has not been given a statutory basis in this Bill.  Any amendments to do so would probably be outside the scope of the Bill at this stage.  It is particularly against this backdrop that I urge the Minister to accepts these amendments.  My amendment No. 23 is an effort to plug the gap in this regard pending full statutory regulation.  These amendments, if accepted, would at least require mediators to sign up to a code of practice with certain crucial provisions set by the Minister and would require that the code of practice also incorporate training requirements for mediators, a provision that is absent from the Bill at present.  Without this, I believe we are heading into very dangerous territory.  It leaves people seriously exposed to ending up potentially in the hands of rogue operators to be exploited, which we absolutely do not want.  This is important and, as I said, even Government backbenchers made this point during the Second Stage debate.  Amendment No. 15 is linked into this in that it places an obligation on the Minister to prepare and publish or cause to be prepared or published a code of practice for mediators.  At present, it is only an option for the Minister, which is not good enough.  It should be a requirement.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 20, 22, 23 and 25 are another little grouping within this grouping and, again, they seek to tighten things up regarding the code of practice.  At present, the code of practice the Minister may draw up may include provisions concerning continuing professional development, ethical standards to be observed, the determination of costs and fees and so on.  What we seek to do with this amendment is to place an obligation on the Minister to include all of these provisions, but not just these provisions.  It can go broader than them.  The amendment does not limit the Minister to these provisions but it does oblige him to deal with them.</p><p>Amendment No. 23 obliges the Minister to include education and training requirements for mediators in this regard as well.  This grouping, obliging the Minister to put certain things into the code of practice, is very reasonable and I believe it is supported by the profession itself.  Against the backdrop of our trying to professionalise many of these standards, the grouping is more than welcome.  In deference to amendment No. 23, my amendment No. 25 then seeks to remove the item in the list of things to be included in the code of practice regarding procedures to be followed by mediators in the conduct of mediation.  I am seeking to remove this on the assumption that amendment No. 23 will be accepted.  We would be tying the hands of mediators too much if we were to keep that line in the context of the other provisions I mentioned.  We do not want to micromanage what mediators do in primary legislation, and that is not the intention of these amendments, but the option is always there for the Minister to include recommended procedures to be followed.  However, requiring mediators to sign up to procedures that must be followed in primary legislation is too much.  That can be dealt with by statutory regulation.  The aim is to try to overcome some of the shortcomings in the mediators' code of practice.</p></speech>

As regards section 8, I am unable to accept amendment No. 12 in the name of Deputy Wallace and amendments Nos. 13 and 14 in the name of Deputy Daly.  Amendment No. 12 proposes to amend section 8(1)(c) in a manner which would require a mediator to furnish the client with a code of practice which would not only incorporate a code of practice published under section 9 but could also incorporate additional unspecified terms.  While the amendment provides that any such additional terms should not conflict with the content of the code of practice under section 9 it is difficult to see how this could operate in an effective manner in practice.  It would present practical difficulties and so I am unable to support it.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 also seek to amend section 8(1)(c) by substitution of the word &quot;any&quot; with &quot;the&quot;, but that implies that there can be only one code of practice for mediators.  That might present a difficulty.  There may be more than one code of practice for mediators depending, perhaps, on the subject matter of a dispute which might be going to mediation.  For example, amendments 16 to 19, inclusive, to section 9 while mainly technical in nature contains a proposal for the development of a code of practice dealing with the involvement of children in mediation.  I see a potential conflict in what is proposed by Deputy Daly, although I do not believe it is intended.  To amend section 8(1)(c) in the manner proposed would not have the effect sought by Deputy Daly and it could, in fact, be unduly problematic.  </p><p>Amendment No. 14 also seeks to require a mediator to furnish to a client a code of practice which would incorporate a code of practice published under section.  I am unable to accept this amendment for the reasons already outlined in regard to Deputy Wallace's amendment.  </p><p>Amendments Nos. 16 to 19, inclusive, are technical in nature.  They relate to the possibility of there being more than one code of practice for mediators.  This must be acknowledged.  </p><p>Amendment No. 26 proposes the insertion of a new provision allowing a code of practice to contain details of procedures to be followed by mediators in the conduct of a mediation involving consultation by a mediator with a child.  This amendment follows on from a recommendation from the Law Reform Commission in its report on mediation and conciliation regarding the voice of the child.  The commission recommended that where a mediator considers it appropriate to involve a child directly in a mediation, the mediator must obtain the consent of the child and must provide adequate facilities for that specific and special purpose.  My Department has discussed the manner in which this recommendation could be progressed with the Legal Aid Board and the Mediators&rsquo; Institute of Ireland and the consensus reached was that the best way to achieve the objective is to ensure that the voice of the child is included in a code of practice made under the Act.  </p><p>The intention behind amendment No. 15 in the name of Deputy Daly is, I believe, to make it mandatory for the Minister to prepare and publish a code of practice for mediators.  I cannot accept this amendment as it ignores the possibility, specifically provided for in section 9(1)(b), that the Minister may approve a code of practice prepared by a person other than the Minister which purports to set standards for the conduct of mediators.  I believe that possibility must be preserved.</p><p>In regard to amendments Nos. 20 to 22, inclusive, the intention appears to be to ensure that a code of practice must include all the matters outlined at paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>f</i>) in subsection (2).  However, as I have already indicated, there is likely to be more than one code of practice and it would not be appropriate to impose such a restriction.  It is quite likely there will be more than one code of practice and these amendments do not allow for that possibility.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 23 and 24 seek to insert into a code of practice provisions regarding education and training for mediators.  I do not believe that a code of practice for mediators is the correct place to deal with training and education standards and I note that codes of practice for mediators in other jurisdictions do not include provisions for education and training.  I am not saying that education and training provisions are in any way at variance with the role and function of mediators but I do not believe that putting that in a code of practice is appropriate.</p><p>I cannot accept Amendment 25 from Deputy Daly which would have the effect of removing procedures to be followed by mediators in the conduct of mediation from the scope of a code of practice.  I acknowledge what the Deputy had to say about this  being dependent on other amendments.  Amendment No. 25 as it stands, to my mind, would run completely counter to what a code of practice should do and, therefore, I cannot accept it.</p><p>I would ask Deputies to consider what I have said and to reflect on the Bill in its entirety with the Committee Stage amendments following which we can look at what might be done on Report Stage.  In regard to all of the amendments tabled by Deputies Wallace and Daly I see potential difficulties, many of which are perhaps unintended but would nevertheless cause difficulties in practice.  I do not believe anyone is keen to have a Bill that might be regarded as anything less than certainty.</p></speech>

I will therefore withdraw amendment No. 12.  Amendments Nos. 21, 22, 24 and 27 are also in my name and they also pretty much overlap with what is provided for in Deputy Daly's amendments.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 21 seeks the substitution of the word "may" with "shall" in an effort to make the Bill more specific.  The points listed for inclusion in the code of practice are good but there is too much scope to avoid what should be fundamental requirements for a code of practice.  The change from "may" to "shall" is a change from optional to a mandatory provisions for the code of practice.  I am of the view that these provisions should be mandatory.</p> <p>  On amendment No. 24, there should be a minimum requirement in terms of education and training for a person to be a mediator otherwise a situation is created whereby mediators who have completed a short course can be placed on the same level as already professionally qualified mediators with hundreds of hours of training.  That might not be such a good idea.  The Bill as it stands will allow those who undertake significant ongoing education to be equated with those who do not refresh and update their mediation skills and education.  This should be avoided.  There are people who go the extra mile to be better at their job.</p><p>There should be clarity and recognition that they are putting in the effort and trying to advance their ability in order to deal with complex situations.  Therefore, I believe it is important.</p></speech>

What we are trying to do with this Bill is facilitate a major transfer away from the court process of dispute resolution.  It could potentially be a really important thing for citizens, but it has to be done right.  Done right it would be brilliant, but done wrong it could cause a huge amount of damage.  The Bill is full of aspirations about a code of practice but there is no meat behind it.  There is nothing to require that to be drawn up and there is nothing to require the mediator to sign up to it.  As the Bill is currently constructed, somebody could go and do an online diploma course, put "association of professional mediators" or whatever beside his or her name, hand over the code of practice and then be on exactly the same level playing field as somebody who has been highly trained, who has upskilled and who has done it all.  That is just too dangerous.  We have seen too many rogue operators at there.  I appreciate that my staff are obviously more clinical than the staff in Deputy Wallace's office in terms of drafting the amendment.  Our amendments Nos. 13 and 14-----</p></speech>

With regard to our amendments Nos. 13 and 14, we are talking about certain minimum standards.  The Minister said that there would be different codes of practice and all that.  That may absolutely be the case.  However, what we are saying is that for somebody to have the label of mediator, they must require certain minimum standards.  What is the point in talking about a code of practice if people do not have to adhere to it?  Not only that, but the Minister may do some of these things.  We might have confidence that this Minister will do them, but there is no requirement on a Minister to bring about some of these things.  Again, I say that in the context of the likes of the Law Society stating that the regulation of what will be a new, important and growing profession of mediators should be dealt with on a statutory basis.  It cannot be done fully by the legislation as it stands.  Our amendments are just trying to plug the gap pending the statutory regulation of it.  It is not about micromanaging and it is not about dotting every "i" and all that sort of stuff.  It is about certain minimum standards that mediators must adhere to in order to give themselves that title.  I believe it is vital.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.92" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017062800002#F00500"><p>One of the main issues is whether there should be a code of practice or a variety of codes of practice.  My preference would be for the former.  If we start going down the road of mediators having a series of codes of practice, we would end up like boxing associations with different organisations having different codes of practice and people being able to say that they are regulated by the Malahide mediators business or the Rathmines mediators association.</p> <p>  The preference should be to have one code of practice.  The Minister said that there is an advantage to having more than one code because, for instance, he may want to develop a code of practice for mediations that involve children.  I do not see why we cannot have just one code of practice and, within that, we would have a section that would deal with mediations that involve children.  Section 9 refers to there being a code of practice.  As Deputies, we have a code of conduct.  We do not have a different code of conduct for different parties or anything like that.  I believe we should be seeking to harmonise this in one code of practice for mediators.</p> <p>  With regard to the other amendments about education and training, as I said, we intend to table an amendment to section 9 on Report Stage in respect of the requirement that mediators should have to have a minimum standard of education or training.  I believe that should be put in the Bill.  Otherwise, it will just be open season.  It is not like any other profession in which one has to achieve certain qualifications in order to become qualified to practise.  As Deputy Daly said, under the Bill as it stands anyone can just call themselves a mediator and off they go.  We need to be able to protect them.</p> <p>  In terms of the code of practice, in court there are the rules of court.  If we want to make mediation a success, which we all want to do, we should have just one code of practice for mediators.  It should be there and everyone should know what is in it so that there is no ambiguity.</p></speech>

I listened to the point raised by Deputy O'Callaghan, but the fact of the matter is that there are different practices and codes that are required for different areas of practice.  I mentioned just one, which was the matter of children in mediation.  I believe that unduly restricting the Minister in section 9(1) excludes that possibility, which is more than a possibility - it is a likelihood.</p><p>I want to make the point again regarding the education and training, which has been mentioned, as well as the qualifications.  I draw the attention of members again to the role of the mediator under section 8(1), with specific reference to 8(1)(b) and 8(1)(c), by which the mediator would be required prior to the commencement of the mediation to</p><blockquote>(b) furnish to the parties the following details of the mediator that are relevant to mediation in general or that particular mediation:(i) qualifications;<br /><br />(ii) training and experience;<br /><br />(iii) continuing professional development training,and<br /><br />(c) furnish to the parties a copy of any code of practice to which he or she subscribes in so far as mediation is concerned.</blockquote> <p>That deals with the matter of qualifications and training and with the issue of experience and expertise and, therefore, I believe it caters for the points being raised by the Deputies in a number of the amendments.</p><p>With regard to education and training, I accept the point raised by Deputy Wallace.  However, it is probably premature in this Bill and therefore inappropriate to deal with it at this stage.  The minimum requirements of the Mediation Council of Ireland, about which there is some reference in the Bill, would deal with that.  This would be an issue for the council.  I refer to the Schedule of the Bill, which will impose a duty and obligation on the council to maintain and develop standards in the provision of mediation, including a system of training, education, professional development and the acquisition of expertise.  I am not against the point Deputy Wallace is making, but I do not think it is appropriate in this part of the Bill and I do not think it is appropriate for this Bill.  Rather, it is a matter for the Mediation Council.  As the Deputy knows, the council will be of consequence in terms of the evolving nature of mediation and the law.  I ask the Deputy to accept our bona fides in this regard.</p></speech>

The point is that, in the absence of a standardised code of practice, how do I know whether somebody with a diploma from the advanced royal mediation institute is highly trained or bought the diploma online?  If we do not define a code of practice ourselves, it will put too much of the onus on the citizen to have to do the digging and find out the standards.  That is why I believe it is important to go ahead as recommended in the amendments.</p></speech>

I ask the Deputy to let me deal with that specific issue on Report Stage and not to press that particular amendment now.  I will consider what she has said to see whether we can address the point she has made without incorporating the amendment before us, which, for reasons I have already given, conflicts with the current section 9 on the matter of there being more than one code of practice.</p><p>We must accept that reality.</p></speech>

His amendment is probably better than mine.  It relates to the issue of confidentiality provisions.  We are trying to make sure it is clear that this covers all communications, oral or written, and not just written communications.  The Minister has provided for this in his amendment.

The section imposes a general confidentiality obligation on the mediator and parties to a mediation.  Following a review of the section, it has become clear that it does not go far enough in ensuring the confidentiality of the mediation process.  For this reason, amendment No. 29 proposes deletion of the words "by the mediator with the parties" and the insertion of the words "oral statements".   Deputies will accept the fact that this will broaden the confidentiality obligation to all communications made in the context of the mediation, including any oral statement that might be made by a participant.</p> <p>  Deputy Daly&rsquo;s amendment seeks to achieve the same end but, given the fact my amendment is similar, I hope she will feel she is in a position not to press her amendment.</p></speech>

The first corrects a drafting error in section 10(3) by substituting the word "admissible" for "inadmissible".  This makes it clear that evidence introduced in mediation that is otherwise admissible or subject to discovery in proceedings shall not become inadmissible solely because it was introduced or used in mediation.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 31 deletes the word "civil" in section 10(3).  It is no longer needed here following the amendment of the definition of "proceedings" in section 2.</p><p>That is fine.

For this purpose, they must provide clients with information on mediation services, including details of mediators, information about the advantages and benefits of mediation, information on the confidentiality obligations, as discussed earlier, and the enforceability of mediation settlements.  Where mediation is declined or fails and court proceedings are instituted on behalf of a client, the application must be accompanied by a statutory declaration made by the solicitor confirming that these obligations have been discharged in relation to the client and the proceedings to which the declaration relates.</p><p>In submissions to my Department, the Law Society has raised the possibility of confusion and duplication of effort in cases arising under the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, the Judicial Separation and Family Law Act 1989 and the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996.  The society points out that the requirements of this Bill in relation to the making of a statutory declaration would appear to be in addition to the existing requirements with respect to the signing of a certificate under those Acts.  I accept that there is a possibility of duplication of requirements in these cases and I am tabling amendment No. 32 which disapplies section 14 to certain matters arising under the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, the Judicial Separation and Family Law Act 1989 and the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996.</p><p>We need consistency and coherence between the provisions of this Bill and the requirements on solicitors under the Acts of 1964, 1989 and 1996.  For this reason, amendments Nos. 39 to 41, inclusive, will, respectively, amend sections 20 and 21 of the 1964 Act, sections 5 and 6 of the 1989 Act and sections 6 and 7 of the 1996 Act in order to require a solicitor to make a statutory declaration rather than merely sign a certificate to the effect that the requirements under these Acts have been discharged.</p><p>In addition, I consider that the information regarding mediation provided by a solicitor to an applicant under these Acts should mirror the obligations placed on a solicitor under this legislation.  For this reason, the proposed amendments require a solicitor to provide to an applicant under those Acts the names and addresses of persons qualified to provide an appropriate mediation service and to inform his or her client of the matters referred to in sections 10 and 11 of this Bill.</p><p>Two further amendments concern section 29 of the 1964 Act and section 43 of the 1996 Act.  Both relate to the costs of mediation or counselling services.  Since the Bill we are now discussing contains specific provision for costs of mediation, these sections should be amended to delete reference to mediation services.  I ask Deputies to accept the amendments as tabled.</p></speech>

The requirement in the Bill to produce a report which outlines any issues raised, or for the mediator to give an opinion on the engagement of the parties, would breach this confidentiality.  This section is of great concern to the Mediators' Institute of Ireland and the Law Society, and was highlighted in the 2010 report of the Law Reform Commission.  In that report, the Law Reform Commission concluded that mediators' reports, if any, should be narrowly restricted and might have some role in assisting a court in determining a successful litigant's cost application after litigation, subsequent to an inconclusive mediation but not otherwise.  In paragraph 4.125 of the report, the commission concluded that:</p><blockquote>[T]he Commission considers that the content of mediators' or conciliators' reports to the Court should be narrowly restricted.  Confidentiality during a mediation session is essential to protect the integrity of the process.  For the mediation or conciliation to be effective, a mediator or conciliator must have the trust of all participants, both in joint sessions and in private caucuses.  Requiring mediators or conciliators to report on the conduct of the parties to the Court imperils the confidentiality of the process.</blockquote></speech>

As Deputy Wallace said, the Law Reform Commission, the Law Society and the Mediators' Institute of Ireland are all keen that there would be some changes here, in particular with regard to the obligation in this section that mediators provide in their report to the court a statement of their opinion as to whether or not the parties fully engaged.  This is way too subjective.  Only a brief report needs to be presented as to whether or not meditation took place and whether a settlement was reached and, if so, what the terms of that settlement were.</p> <p>  It is important we include in the Bill the requirement that the report be a written one.  That comes under amendment No. 33.  Otherwise, we run the risk of much of the mediator's time being spent on court appearances and so on.  A written report to the court, however, should be sufficient.  It should be a neutral summary of the facts.  It is important to include something because in awarding costs the courts can take into account any unreasonable refusal or failure of a party to consider or engage properly in mediation.  I agree with Deputy Wallace's point that the mediator's report should one of advice and for the court decide whether it was unreasonable or not.</p><p>A normal statement should be a written statement to the court to be rubber stamped.  That is an important point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.177" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017062800002#J00200"><p>It should be a written report and the wording of section 17 implies it would be a written report, so I do not see any harm in stating it will be a written report.  Otherwise, one will not get the detail that is set out in the rest of section 17(1).</p> <p>  A further point concerns section 17(1)(b)(iv), which states: "if no mediation settlement has been reached, a statement as to whether, in the mediator&rsquo;s opinion, the parties engaged fully in the mediation" will be made.  I believe that will change the character of the mediation and it also changes the character of the mediator.  If that is put in place, the mediator will become an individual who can punish one or other of the parties to a mediation, which I believe undermines the voluntary nature of mediation.  One will find situations where mediators in a report to the courts say one side did not fully engage, and as a result there could be costs consequences against that side in court.  There may also be consequences for the mediator in that the parties may say this was unfair and that they did fully engage, and there may be a dispute in which a mediator is sued.  This makes it difficult and makes it potentially adversarial, which is what we do not want in mediation.  This needs to be looked at again by the Minister.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.178" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017062800002#J00300"><p>This group of amendments relates to the mediator&rsquo;s report to the court under section 17.  It provides that where the parties decide to engage in mediation following an invitation by the court, and they subsequently apply to the court to re-enter the proceedings, the mediator will prepare and submit a report to the court outlining the outcome of the mediation.  I take the point with regard to having the report in writing.</p> <p>  Following publication of the Bill, a number of submissions to my Department queried whether the mediator&rsquo;s report should refer to unresolved matters as currently required by section 17(1)(b)(iii).  I have accepted that it should not be necessary to refer to such &ldquo;unresolved&rdquo; issues and that is the purpose of amendments Nos. 36 and 38.</p> <p>  As regards amendments Nos. 33 and 34 tabled by Deputy Daly, I am not disposed to accept them as of now but I take the point she makes.  Subsection (1) requires the mediator to prepare and submit a report to the court and this already implies that the report must be written.  Moreover, inserting the words &ldquo;short and neutral&rdquo; in regard to such a report, as proposed in amendment No. 34, is unnecessary since paragraphs (a) and (b) already indicate the content of such a report.</p> <p>  As regards amendments Nos. 35 and 37, tabled by Deputies Wallace and Daly respectively, I am willing to give this issue further consideration because I do not believe there is much between us.  The key issue here is the requirement in subsection (1)(b)(iv) that if no mediation settlement has been reached, the mediator&rsquo;s report should contain a statement as to whether the parties engaged fully in the mediation or not.  I recognise that this provision raises sensitive issues for mediators.  Deputies will be aware that a broadly similar provision is already to be found in section 28 of the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011, which requires the chairperson of a mediation conference to include in his or her report to the court a statement as to whether the failure of mediation is substantially due to the conduct of one or more of the parties, and in that case specifying the identity of such party or parties.</p> <p>  I would ask Members to acknowledge the sensitivities here.  I am willing to give the matter further consideration.  I acknowledge the importance of the points raised in terms of facilitating further discussion and in assisting me to come back on Report Stage with a form of wording that should meet the concerns of Deputies as indicated in amendments Nos. 35 and 37.  I would hope to come back with something if Members are minded to leave matters over until Report Stage.</p></speech>

If we are saying it is implied that a report should be written, we should spell it out.  I do not think there is any harm in that.  It is not wordy or cumbersome and will not undermine the Bill.  I would like to press those amendments.  I accept the point on amendment No. 34 and am happy to withdraw that.</p> <p>  In terms of the bigger picture, it is a key area for mediators and we have to come up with something better on this.  Deputy O'Callaghan summarised the points very well in that it could undermine the whole process if we do not get the wording right.  Whether we press it now or deal with it on Report Stage, I do not mind.</p></speech>

Moreover, the various mediation bodies have their own training frameworks, education courses, continual professional development, as well as disciplinary codes.  I should point out that provision is made in section 9 for codes of practice, as we have already discussed, to include complaint and redress mechanisms and I am not convinced that the council should be given additional oversight in the Bill.</p><p> I would ask the Deputy to accept what I say having regard to the requirements of the council.</p></speech>

There is a number of bodies of work that we said the Minister is going to direct.  Is there a facility for us to amend those amendments if they do not tick the boxes?  We cannot anticipate the Minister.  Does the Chairman know what I mean?  How do we deal with that?  We can put in amendments now to the Bill, as amended by the committee, but the Department has agreed to undertake a body of work around two substantive issues.  Can we subsequently amend those amendments if we are not happy with them or how does that work?</p></speech>

We will make contact with the Deputies.</p> <p>  I could be wrong here but my assumption is that the Deputies will perhaps resubmit amendments in largely similar form to those on Committee Stage.  I take the Chairman's point regarding short notice but short notice cannot be at the expense of due notice.  We will need a bit of time.  I would hope that we could deal with Report Stage before the summer recess.  Maybe, if my officials make contact with the clerk to the committee, we can work something out.</p></speech>
