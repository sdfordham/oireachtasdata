Apologies have been received from Deputy Lisa Chambers.  I welcome all those present to this meeting of the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs.  During session A, members will hear from me.  I ask them to go easy on me.  We will also hear from Mr. Peter Hughes, general secretary of the Psychiatric Nurses Association, and Mr. Gareth Noble, children's law specialist, on the Seanad Public Consultation Committee's work on children's mental health services.  During session B, the committee will hear from Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, special rapporteur on child protection, regarding issues arising from the audit of the exercise by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of section 12 of the Child Care Act.  My contribution will only serve to inform members because the work by the Seanad Public Consultation Committee will start tomorrow.  Members can ask questions if they wish but I will only really be informing them about what will happen tomorrow.  I propose that the committee goes into private session to deal with housekeeping matters.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

C&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte - they are very welcome.  They are here to present to us the Seanad Public Consultation Committee's work on children's mental health.  I thank them for appearing before the committee.</p><p>I must deal with some housekeeping.  Before we commence, in accordance with procedure, I am required to draw the witnesses' attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode.  Mobile phones interfere with the sound system, make it difficult for parliamentary reporters to report the meeting and adversely affect television coverage and web streaming.  I also advise the witnesses that any submissions or opening statements they make to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.</p><p>I understand the witnesses will make short presentations and I now invite them to do so.  We commence with Senator Freeman.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1428" speakername="Joan Freeman" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017062800002#C00300"><p>I reiterate that this presentation aims to inform the committee of what will happen tomorrow on Ireland's very first public consultation day on mental health.  I thank Mr. Gareth Noble and Mr. Peter Hughes for coming to help me with today's meeting.</p> <p>  The public consultation day on children's mental health in Ireland is a unique opportunity for our nation to address the provision of mental health services for children and adolescents in Ireland.  I hope the publication of the report will bring to the attention of the Government the challenges that face this country in providing even a somewhat adequate mental health service for our children, whose disposition to mental health issues is increasing.  The mental and emotional struggles of our young people have expanded dramatically in the past decade alone.  New phenomena exist such as cyberbullying and self-image pressure from social media which put increased pressure on an already vulnerable category of youth identity.  Children between the ages of 15 and 17 have the fifth highest rate of suicide in Europe, and in recent months there has been a dramatic increase in suicide among young teenage girls.  In a country which purports to put the interests of such children first, we need to identify whether we are delivering on this commitment.</p> <p>  The purpose of the Seanad Public Consultation Committee is to hear the testimony of service users and service providers who work in the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  On this point - I know this is not in my written submission - this is not about the hard-working men and women on the front line of our CAMHS and other services; it is about us looking at the system that surrounds our mental health services for children.  Under no circumstances do I want to give the impression that we are criticising the people who work on the front line.  Over the past month or more, the Seanad Public Consultation Committee members and I have received in excess of 100 submissions from service users, including mothers, fathers and adolescents, and service providers - consultants, nurses, social workers and lobby groups - across the country.</p> <p>  Eleven years have passed since the policy document governing the delivery of these services, A Vision for Change, was published in 2006.  As with many of these documents, there is a lot of vision but very little change.  I wish to direct members' minds momentarily to the static nature in which our services have remained since the publication of A Vision for Change.  The reality is that successive Governments have fallen significantly short in implementing the recommendations captured by the report in terms of provision of services, inpatient beds, consultant child psychiatrists and support staff, out-of-hours services and accountability on spending.</p> <p>  The declining amount of budget funding as a proportion of the overall health budget has further prompted a reduction in staff and inpatient facilities.  We have been told that the mental health budget has increased and that it is approximately &euro;850 million, but the mental health budget for children is only 6% of that overall budget.  This is never highlighted.  The reality is that 6% of the overall mental health budget is allocated to 23% of the people who make up our population, that is, the young people who need this funding and these services, yet demand increases.  Referrals to CAMHS have doubled from 8,663 in 2011 to 13,062 in 2013.  Increased levels of staffing do not meet this demand.  Recruitment and retention of staff and availability of services are in stark contrast to the demands of a child population which has increased by an estimated 17.8% since 2006.  There are 55 child psychiatric consultants to a population of 1.2 million children.  Even trying to figure this out is challenging.</p> <p>  As the committee may be aware, I have introduced legislation in the Seanad seeking to ban the admission of children to adult psychiatric units.</p><p>This has prompted a very important discussion on how these children end up in such units for short stays.  By their nature, these admissions are a last resort and the reasons for the admissions generally arise of administrative expediency in a dysfunctional health system.  </p><p> The submissions to the Public Consultation Committee make clear that the admissions are a consequence of structural shortcomings or cracks in the system, shortcomings that need to be exposed, such as the lack of services for 16 to 18 year olds, poor retention of personnel and a lack of collaboration between catchment areas.  Often a child might be admitted to an adult unit as a result of an absence of beds or because of the non-availability of a child psychiatrist to perform the admission.  In some cases, it might be because there is no closely located in-patient unit.  These are not adequate justifications for a practice that is deemed to contravene the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. </p><p> I have invited Gareth Noble who is a specialist child lawyer and who has more experience of the reality of these services.  He, like many of the specialists in child law and those engaged in the provision of child and mental health services, is able to give a truer picture of the shortcoming of those services.  Since being nominated, I have found the testimony of front-line workers to reflect the most valuable contribution to my learning in this area. </p><p> I am therefore inviting the members of this committee to support the public consultation day, to highlight the issues involved, to attend and  to ask questions of those contributing if the member is a Senator, to be part of the implementation process when the recommendations are published and to create a space for the discussion of the findings as part of this joint committee in the next term.  I thank the members for their time today.</p></speech>

To be honest, it should not really be necessary at this point, but if anybody has a burning question I am happy to answer it.  My statement was really just to tell the committee about what will be happening tomorrow.  Perhaps when we come back in the autumn we could have the opportunity for people to make comments if they so wish.  The findings will come out tomorrow and we will have a report by the autumn which I would like to present to the committee.</p></speech>

At the outset, I would also pay tribute to the committee in supporting the consultation day tomorrow to highlight these issues with a view to taking forward substantive proposals to Government, the HSE and others to ensure that our mental health services are fit for purpose.</p> <p>  Ireland has a poor record in protecting and vindicating the welfare needs of children and a number of significant reports have highlighted, and indeed continue to highlight, these issues across a range of areas.  This is an important opportunity to remedy the continuing breaches of the rights of children, which have in recent times taken on even greater focus as a result  of the referendum in 2012 to afford children greater constitutional protections and status in their own right.</p> <p>  I address you this morning as someone who acts for children and young people and their families in a range of welfare cases.  Through my work I have witnessed at first hand the challenges families face in accessing mental health services at times of trauma and crisis.  I have spoken to and advocated for many children directly who struggle with their mental health and well being.  I have collaborated closely with front-line staff employed by the HSE, Tusla and other public bodies who recognise and share many of the frustrations families and young people express and who feel powerless to effect meaningful change.  Such change, they feel, can only come about when there is clearer direction and meaningful policy change from management and from Government.</p> <p>  The seminal document in reforming Ireland&rsquo;s mental health strategy was published in 2006, the year I qualified as a solicitor.  It was entitled A Vision for Change.  That strategy aimed to modernise our system and ensure better co-ordination and better practices.  A vision that would deliver a nationwide service to ensure that community-based responses through CAMHS teams targeted resources in an effective way thereby intervening early to ensure a young person had a clear and speedy pathway to recovery.  I regret to say that this vision has not been progressed and in many respects children are in a much worse position than they were prior to Vision for Change.  The recent removal of 11 beds from Linn Dara in West Dublin for inpatient care for children; the fact that some 2,419 children and their families, in the most recent figures, are waiting in excess of twelve months for an appointment from CAMHS, 218 of whom have been waiting more than a year, 762 for more than six months; the fact that 15 counties in Ireland remain without an out of hours and weekend crisis service; and the fact that up to 67 children were admitted to inappropriate adult wards in 2016, all represent an unacceptable series of ongoing breaches of children&rsquo;s rights and constitute a serious dereliction in our duty of care towards them.  </p> <p>   I wish to offer the Committee some observations on a number of these issues.  The first of these is the issue of children being admitted to adult psychiatric wards. I strongly welcome and support the publication of a Bill by the Vice Chairman of this committee in December 2016 to ensure that no child under the age of 18 is placed in an adult psychiatric unit.  As far back as November 2006, the Mental Health Commission issued a code of practice relating to such admissions pending the ending of such a practice by 2011.  This has never been done.  It is my view that such a continuing practice is a potential breach of many legal rights instruments including Article 24 of the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child and indeed our own Constitution in respect of the personal rights guaranteed by Article 40.3, Article 43 and most recently by Article 42 A.  At a European level the practice could well constitute a breach of Article 3 of the European Convention of Human Rights which, inter alia, prohibits degrading treatment.  Article 8 of the same Convention promotes and provides a right to respect of one&rsquo;s private and family life.  There are serious legal issues arising from this continuing practice.</p> <p>  Adult psychiatric facilities are not the American celebrity clinics we see on television with a gym and samba lessons.  They are challenging and difficult environments populated by very vulnerable individuals who often present with a range of mental health concerns.  Some exhibit huge levels of distress and can on occasion be physically threatening.  Such situations are difficult to manage and deal with for all concerned and yet we are asking the most vulnerable of teenagers who are exposed to such situations to cope with them on top of their own challenges.  My experience is that they cannot and nor should they have to.  I have seen examples of young people returning home having been exposed to such environments and being lost forever as a result of such traumas.  </p> <p>  Effective recovery can only happen within the confines of a dedicated, safe and appropriate facility.  I have spoken and acted for many young people and families who talk about the sense of loneliness, rejection, fear and isolation in adult psychiatric facilities, often far from home.  In contrast I have visited adolescent facilities where I have seen at first hand how young people supporting one another do so within a context where their care is managed by appropriate specialists in adolescent care and where that sense of fear and isolation can be massively mitigated.   We have a moral, political and legal duty to children and this Bill is a crucial first step in achieving better outcomes for children in situations of crisis and for their families.</p> <p>  With reference to the CAMHS teams, I have seen a number of instances where admissions to adult units are sanctioned most reluctantly by treating professionals who accept the undesirability and problems inherent in such admissions.  It is also clear that professionals are most anxious that children do not remain in hospital any more than is required.  It is important, however, that such discharges are in the context of an appropriate step-down plan into the community and which involve services such as those provided within the multidisciplinary framework of CAMHS.   I have spoken to many parents who leave hospital facilities with their children without an appropriate onward community-based plan to ensure that continuum of care.  Some leave without having been re-engaged in community services or who have to go on waiting lists once again to access such services.</p> <p>  Reintegration plans with an appropriate suite of supports are essential if children and young  people are to move on with their lives.  We have all seen reports from the coroners' courts of the particularly fragile position of many young people discharged from in-patient care without the necessary supports and the truly awful consequences that such a lack of care may ultimately lead to.  Similarly, long awaited protocols must be fast tracked to ensure that every young person nearing the end of their childhood and who may require ongoing care beyond the age of 18, has a transition plan in place and be consulted about it.  It is to be noted in this regard that some conditions such as ADHD, diagnosed in childhood, is not a condition that adult mental health services provide for.</p> <p>  I referred earlier to the scandalously long waiting times for appointments with CAMHS.  This is not the only observation, gravely serious though that issue is.  It is of some concern and note that CAMHS have not issued an operating report since 2014, notwithstanding the fact that annual reports were envisaged by A Vision for Change.</p><p>If children and their parents were to report to members of this committee and to the wider public, what would they say?  Would they point to the fact that staffing levels required in regard to an increase in demand for such services have never been provided?  Would they point out that many child and adolescence mental health services, CAMHS, teams are excluding many young people from their services because they do not fit within the increasingly strict confines of their criteria and the lack of flexibility regarding same?  Children with a dual diagnosis who experience mental health concerns but who are also on the autism spectrum and children with mental health challenges who have also substance misuse issues are often falling between the cracks in accessing services.  &quot;It is someone else's responsibility&quot;, &quot;A different service is required&quot;, &quot;Join the end of that queue&quot; and the game of pass the parcel getting into full swing is an all too familiar experience for so many.  The lack of meaningful engagement and support by service providers is leading to infinitely more pressure on children and families and a sharp deterioration in the quality of life for such people, with all the added costs which ensue as a result of such an approach.<br/><br/>Children between the ages of 16 and 18 are often referred to as the Cinderella age in accessing mental health services.  They are too old to avail of adolescent care and too young to access many other services.  While children at the age of 16 can often provide consent for general health services and procedures, it remains a grey area in respect of psychiatric care and interventions.  This has been acknowledged by the Mental Health Commission and further clarity in law is urgently required.  Paediatric emergency departments are often accessible to children under 16 and therefore the emergency presentation of children between 16 and 18 occurs at adult hospitals, most if not all of which have woefully inadequate child psychiatry cover.  We have seen instances in the past where young people aged 16 or over present at an accident and emergency department and require urgent assessment.  Disputes have arisen between adult and child services as to which team should assess the young person.<br/><br/>Officially, CAMHS refers to services being provided for young people up until they reach adulthood.  On the ground, however, there is massive inconsistency in this approach with a lack of referrals being accepted for children beyond their 16th birthday.  Given that in 2010, 16 and 17 year olds constituted 68% of inpatient hospital admissions, the provision of care for this age group remains woefully inadequate.  A full review of CAMHS and services and supports for this particularly vulnerable age group is required as a matter of priority.  This is all the more important given the lack of clarity over the level of provision envisaged within the new National Children&rsquo;s Hospital for this age group and also noting the fact that new capacity legislation does not apply to minors.<br/><br/>In regard to children in the criminal justice system, it is reported by the Irish Penal Reform Trust and others that many prisoners in our system have undiagnosed and often untreated mental health conditions.  Within the adult penal system, however, prisoners who meet the criteria for various mental health conditions can be treated at designated centres such as the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum.<br/><br/>In the juvenile detention centre at Oberstown, young people with complex needs including mental health concerns are assisted by teams referred to as assessment and consultancy therapeutic service, ACTS.  However, in contrast to the position for adults, such treatment can only be done within the confines of the Oberstown facility.  There does not exist a designated centre within the child detention system as exists in the adult prisons through the Central Mental Hospital.  For children with such acute difficulties, the ability and availability of professionals to treat such cases is avoidably compromised.<br/><br/>In regard to listening to the voices of young people and their families, this consultation day provided by members of this committee and the invitation of submissions is an important first step in identifying the strengths and challenges within our adolescent mental health services.  Young people and their parents often fear the consequences of raising complaints and concerns, however valid.  It is a reality that many parents who struggle to access vital services and who express concerns about their ability to cope with the challenges of a mental health crisis are often characterised in a manner which seeks to shift blame onto their ability and capacity to parent.  I have acted for a number of parents who, in articulating their concerns about their ability to safeguard their children without appropriate supports, find themselves on the receiving end of a referral to Tusla.  This has a chilling effect on parents and their ability to speak out.  It is also a massive abuse of power to utilise Tusla in such a manner and a distraction from providing a pathway for much needed stabilisation and therapeutic recovery for the young person.<br/><br/>When a child is detained by the District Court on an involuntary basis upon application by the Health Service Executive, HSE, under the Mental Health Act 2001, certain provisions of the Child Care Act 1991 may also apply, including the giving of court directions concerning the welfare of the child and the appointment of a legal representative or a guardian <i>ad litem</i>to act as a voice for the child in those proceedings.  We have seen in recent times through the child law reporting project further examples of just how important it is to ensure that the views and wishes of such children are fully represented.  It is vital, therefore, that any reforms of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>system must ensure that the ability of the child to participate through their guardian is meaningful.  This must continue to be provided for on an equal basis to other participants in court proceedings and must not, as appears to be proposed, dilute the voice of the child to witness status.  That is against the interests of children and is in any case constitutionally dubious.<br/><br/>This committee has demonstrated, in its support for the public consultation day tomorrow, a proactive approach to leading a conversation on the specific requirements of a modern mental health service from the perspective of a child.  Statutory obligations in regard to children refer to the rights and needs of the child being of paramount consideration.  Using this as our guiding principle, we need to develop policies and services that truly do put children first.  Senator Freeman&rsquo;s Bill is certainly consistent with that approach and I and many others at the front line urge the speedy progression and implementation of that Bill.  I thank the Acting Chairman and the committee members for giving these issues their attention.  I look forward to further engagement on these important issues.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Hughes" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017062800002#E00300"><p>I thank the members for the invitation to address the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs.  As general secretary of the Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA, I want to highlight my concerns in regard to the CAMHS.  The inadequacies and under-investment in the current provision of CAMHS is something my union has consistently drawn attention to and I hope that the committee's interest in this area will help in addressing the many gaps in CAMHS that exist throughout the country.</p> <p>  In 2006, the Government policy on mental health, A Vision for Change, was published outlining a ten year plan for the provision of mental health services.  Chapter 10 of that widely welcomed strategy outlined the recommendations for child and adolescent mental health services.  Some of the key recommendations included two multi-disciplinary teams per 100,000 population; one liaison multi-disciplinary team per 300,000 population; one day hospital per 300,000 population; and that urgent attention should be given to the completion of the planned four 20-bed units in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Dublin and multi-disciplinary teams should be provided for those teams.  That will result in 100 beds for CAMHS nationally.</p> <p>  Most important, A Vision for Change included in it a provision for an evaluation after five years to assess the progress in the delivery of CAMHS and whether it is meeting the needs of the population.  Eleven years on, we must question the commitment to the recommendations in A Vision for Change.</p> <p>  The PNA, in partnership with the Royal College of Surgeons Ireland, RCSI, published research last year on the implementation of A Vision for Change in adult mental health services ten years on.  The results were stark and disappointing.  Among the findings were that 60% of beds were closed yet only 30% of the recommended community services were put in place; there were no 24-hour crisis intervention services as recommended; we are currently conducting research, phase 2, in partnership with the RCSI, into the specialist elements of A Vision for Change, inclusive of CAMHS.  Early indications suggest that 37% of the recommended multi-disciplinary teams as outlined in A Vision for Change are operational; 53% of the liaison services are in operation; and 52 beds are operational out of the 100 recommended beds.  That figure has reduced in recent weeks to 48.  This research will be concluded by quarter 4 of this year.</p> <p>  The population of children nationally is expected to increase by 8,530 between 2016 and 2017, which is consistent with the percentage growth annually in the past decade.  That projection, coupled with the expansion of the free GP scheme, will create an additional demand on child and adolescent mental health services.</p> <p>  I also wish to make reference to the appalling situation of young homeless children currently living in hotels, guest houses and short-term accommodation.  Not only does that increase the level of mental distress on those involved, that transient situation complicates the follow up of the children as they are transferred from one CAMHS to another as their accommodation moves.</p><p> According to the mental health division operational plan for 2017 there are 74 multidisciplinary teams.  A Vision for Change recommended two teams per 100,000 population, which equates to 94 teams, so we have a shortfall of 20 teams.  According to recent research we conducted, only 50% of the recommended teams are in operation in the greater Dublin area and most of them are not fully functional as they are missing many disciplines.  There are four day hospitals nationally.  A Vision for Change recommended one for every 300,000 population, which equates to 15 hospitals.  This means we have a shortfall of 11 day hospitals.  There are 74 CAMHS beds nationally.  A Vision for Change recommended 100.  However, only 48 of these are operational nationally due to staff shortages and, in particular, nursing shortages.  There are 20 beds in Cork, but until recently the unit only had the capacity for a maximum admission of 15 children.  This has now been reduced to 11 due to nursing staff shortages.  St. Joseph&rsquo;s unit in Fairview has 12 beds, but only six are operational due to nursing and medical staff shortages.  The Limerick unit never materialised and the 20-bed unit in Galway is fully operational.  Linn Dara in Dublin, a new purpose built 22-bed unit, which only opened 18 months ago, has in the past three weeks closed 11 beds due to nursing shortages.  The unit has only 50% of the nursing resource required.  These 11 beds have been closed despite a list of 20 children awaiting admission.</p><p> We know all too well that the net result of these bed closures and underprovision in CAMHS is to further increase the unacceptable admission of children to adult mental health units.  We witnessed a stark example of this just last month, with the admission of a 16 year old to the adult mental health unit in Waterford.  To add to the trauma experienced by this child, we know that child had to spend the night sitting on a chair.  To say, 11 years after the publication of the A Vision for Change strategy, that this is totally unacceptable is, if anything, an understatement.  Child and adolescent mental health services are in crisis and, as outlined, the provision of services is deteriorating rather than improving.  The children and parents of our country are being let down by the non-implementation of policy and the lack of commitment or urgency in addressing the crisis.  And yet we know, and have known for ten years, what needs to be done to address the crisis.</p><p> As a matter of urgency, the 100 beds as recommended need to be provided and staffed in order to provide quality therapeutic care and prevent further admissions of children to adult mental health units.  The number of community mental teams needs to be increased, as recommended.  They need to be fully staffed and expanded to provide out-of-hours home-based services.  The criteria for clinical nurse specialists are too stringent and need to be adapted in the short term to facilitate an increase in applicants.  There are approximately 20 unfilled clinical nurse specialist posts nationally, mostly due to insufficient applicants as the criteria are too strict.</p><p> The 15 day hospitals as recommended need to be provided.  Of course, the full implementation of these measures will only come if there is a substantial increase in the budget for mental health services, which currently stands at 6.4% of the health budget.  Bizarrely, and probably only in Ireland, we have witnessed a situation where despite the growth in demand for mental health services across the board there has been a steady reduction in the mental health budget as a percentage of the overall health budget.  In 1984 the budget was 13% of the health budget, in 1994 it was 10% of the health budget and in 2004 it was 7.1% of the health budget.  As can be seen, the commitment to mental health services is diminishing each decade, yet the demand has never been greater.  It is little wonder the previous Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, admitted in the Dail on 23 May that mental health services have been neglected for over 30 years, and were, as he put it "the Cinderella of many Health Service Executive Votes and Department of Health Votes".</p><p> Sadly, when we look at the mental health budget it is hard not to conclude that A Vision for Change was used as a cost-saving measure on the backs of those with mental health issues.  Too often we have seen the closure of beds with paltry investment in community services.  We are struggling to provide vital services while trying to manage a severe shortage of psychiatric nurses, largely due to the fact that our highly skilled and committed nurses are being forced to leave the Irish health system for better pay and terms and conditions in the private sector, the UK, Australia and Canada, to name but a few of the market competitors.  Who can blame them, when there is a consistent failure to address realistically the issues of pay and conditions for nurses?  At the end of the day, this is the only realistic solution that will stop the haemorrhaging of our nurses abroad and encourage those abroad to return.</p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to briefly outline the extent of the ongoing crisis in child and adolescent mental health services, which we know is impacting severely on the children and parents of this country.  I assure the committee that the Psychiatric Nurses Association is determined to see the issues in CAMHS addressed before they deteriorate even further, and we would welcome the committee's support in achieving the provision of properly resourced and staffed CAMHS that meets the needs of children, families and communities throughout the country.</p></speech>

I have a very quick question about preventative measures.  We are very bad at preventative measures in the general area of mental health and particularly in the area of child mental health.  Do the witnesses have an opinion on the introduction of play therapy as part of primary school or access to a play therapist?  Many schools who are in the school completion programme have it but most other schools do not.  Many people do not even know what play therapy is.  I am big advocate of it and I wonder what is the opinion of the witnesses, given that it will not always work but in some cases it might be a preventative measure.</p></speech>

A situation arose in Cork recently whereby if a child had presented to either accident or emergency department in the city at, CUH or Mercy University Hospital, there would have been no CAMHS available to them, which is an issue of significant concern in Cork.  I am sure it is an issue that probably arises generally.  Are there significant shortfalls?</p> <p>  Recently, I had an interesting conversation with somebody working in the Bessborough Centre.  He felt the area of infant mental health was quite underdeveloped.</p><p>It is not something I am particularly familiar with.  Is it dealt with in A Vision for Change?  Is it an area that requires further development?</p></speech>

Senator Freeman said we will come back to this in the autumn and I support that.  We will set time aside.  The Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs cannot implement much of what we have heard.  It is the responsibility of the health committee or the Department of Health.</p> <p>  Deputy Funchion raised the issue of play therapy and the well-being course is coming into the school system.  We should look at a cross-departmental response to all of this because, as the children's committee, we do not have the power to deal with much of this.  We need to engage with the education and health committees to identify what specifically can and must be done to address the issues that have been raised.  I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  </p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  Most importantly, I thank Mr. Gareth Noble for his presentation.  It is the one that should be liked and shared across multimedia because it echoed what I have experienced in my constituency clinic, as have many others.  My personal assistants and everyone else are hearing about it on a daily basis.  The Cinderella age in this regard is 16 and 17.  Their parents are feeling it.  They do not know where to go and they fall between the stools completely.  I asked an awful lot of questions previously about where we are with regard to A Vision for Change and 82 positions remain unfilled.  The building of the multidisciplinary teams and the number of beds required are also issues.  It is only the start of a conversation but it is a conversation that has been going on for 11 years.  People are highly frustrated.  I am newly elected.  I compliment the witnesses on what they have done this morning.  Their contribution was absolutely fantastic.  I thank Senator Freeman for the opportunity to discuss the issue.</p></speech>

On the play therapy issue, in child care proceedings where children are taken into the care of the State, we are seeing much more emphasis on child therapy and all the feedback is highly positive in terms of allowing children the space to deal with traumatic situations.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire referred to the role of CAMHS and presentations at accident and emergency wards.  One of the biggest difficulties that parents and children face is the fact there are no CAMHS out-of-hours services or weekend cover and, quite often, some of the really traumatic experiences that children and young people face manifest out of hours and at weekends.  The issue of infant mental health is a new development and is something with which everyone is trying to grapple.  It is also related to attachment issues.  We are seeing the need for a lot more specialisation in terms of infant mental health and attachment issues.  </p> <p>  I thank Deputy O'Sullivan for referring to the need for cross-party and cross-departmental collaboration.  One of the greatest frustrations I have as a child lawyer, with which I could paper the office, is that when I highlight an issue to a particular Department or a particular public authority, nine out of ten times I get a letter back saying I should be referring to somebody else.  In one example, I referred something to a particular Department that referred me to a different Department.  When I wrote to the second Department, it referred me back to the original Department and all the while, children are getting lost in that system.  We need to develop mechanisms whereby these things are dealt with properly.  One difficulty with taking Tusla out of the HSE and developing it as a stand-alone agency is that many of the child protection issues, which include mental health, continue to remain the responsibility of the HSE.  That has been a big difficulty in terms of fully realising the ability of Tusla to do its job in protecting children.  </p></speech>

I thank Dr. Shannon for appearing today.  Before we commence, in accordance with procedure I am required to draw the witness's attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence relating to a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p> I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode.  Mobile phones interfere with the sound system and make it difficult for the parliamentary reporters to report the meeting.  Also, television coverage and web streaming will be adversely affected.</p><p> I advise witnesses that any submission or opening statement that have been made to the committee will be published on the committee website after the meeting.</p><p> The witness will make a short presentation that will be followed by questions from the members of the committee.

It is hugely important and significant legislation.  Many of the themes that emerged from my audit touch on many of the themes addressed in the last session.  After listening to the evidence given by the previous speakers, I felt compelled to associate my name with the significant development that has taken place.  I look forward to participating in the consultation process.  </p> <p>  One can measure any democracy by the manner in which the needs of the most vulnerable are considered and met.  Nowhere is this more evident than with the most vulnerable of children who are subject to emergency intervention by the State over weekends and after 5 p.m. in the evening.  I welcome this morning the publication by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, of an implementation plan for the audit.  It is my view that reports such as the one I have undertaken are meaningless unless there is implementation.  I urge the committee, if I might be so bold to suggest, to invite me back before it a year from today's date to give an account as to what has happened during the intervening period.  As somebody experienced in writing and producing reports, I sometimes become frustrated at the fact that the pace of implementation is far slower than I would like.  It is my view that childhood does not stand still.  Sometimes the approach adopted does not reflect the limited nature of childhood.  </p> <p>  The audit was commissioned by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It was a response to the Ombudsman for Children's investigation in respect of two discrete cases.  It is unique in its comprehensiveness as a systemic review, in that it paints the national picture.  I would like to state publicly that I had commendable levels of co-operation from members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in conducting the audit.  In terms of the scale of the audit, I understand that this is the largest worldwide audit of the exercise by a police force of its emergency child protection powers.  The audit provides us with insight.  </p> <p>  In terms of ensuring the integrity of the information that I produced, I sought international validation of my recommendations.  For the record, it is important to mention that I sought the assistance of Oxford University.  Professor Laura Hoyano in Oxford has said that my report will break new ground in terms of empirical techniques in the field.  I had asked her to review my document in its entirety.  In her analysis of the report she stated in terms of the overall audit, it seemed to her to employ sound empirical methodology, which was then carried out with admirable thoroughness and was very well written.  She considered that the findings were all borne out by the data he reported.  It is important to state that in the context of the integrity of the data and the findings I made as a result of the data.  A further review stated the report was an outstanding piece of work that was extremely well-written and careful.  This was the international assessment of the work that I have undertaken.  The committee should be in no doubt that this is a large-scale audit.  I have spent two years and perhaps thousands of hours of work and have spent virtually every weekend over that period travelling to Garda stations.  This was an active piece of work and it is the one of which I am proudest as both a researcher and a professional.  I hope that after the outrage there will be action.</p> <p>  I shall outline the extent of the work undertaken as part of the audit.  I travelled right around the world.  I had very impressive co-operation from the police authorities in the UK.  I met the Metropolitan Police.  I looked at the child protection services and the interaction between child protection services and police forces, not only in the UK but in New York in respect of the New York Police Department, NYPD.  I had very impressive co-operation from the NYPD and viewed state-of-the-art facilities in the Bronx.  As a result of those visits, I have compiled a series of recommendations.  My recommendations are not just based on a paper-based exercise.  They are based on my experience of travelling the length and breadth of this country to review how children experience the section 12 process.  In addition, I talked to individual garda&iacute; and travelled around the work to look at other models in order that we can come up with a model that meets the cultural needs of Irish children.</p> <p>  I hope the legacy of my report and what I think of today are the children who are subject to section 12.  Many people, in the aftermath of the audit, talked about the fact that they found the accounts in the audit profoundly disturbing, distressing and upsetting because many of the case narratives documented children's shattered lives.  I appreciate that child protection is complex and challenging.  The impact of early trauma can have significant consequences.  The cumulative adverse experience of early years can have considerable consequences even where intervention by social services follows.  I am of the view that when a child is taken into the care of the State, the State is saying it can do a better job.  If the State fails a child a second time, this can have devastating consequences for the child.  My audit provides us with a unique insight as to what happens when parents fail children, when the State fails children and children are allowed to drift rudderless within the system.  No child should suffer to protect an institution.  We have heard many accounts of children being subjected to institutional abuse.  I would also say that no child should suffer at the hands of parents and no child should be made to live a life of unspeakable abuse to protect his or her abusive parent or parents.  Many of the case narratives in the audit shine a light on some uncomfortable truths.  Child protection is often invisible to families and their communities.  My report shines a light on an unpalatable truth for Irish society about how life is lived for some of its citizens.  This audit also indicates that the prevalence of domestic abuse, and that does not necessarily mean physical violence, has sadly not abated.</p> <p>  One of the biggest challenges facing Irish society is the adverse consequences for many children posed by parental alcohol abuse.  Drug and alcohol abuse by parents can be very damaging on their ability to consistently parent their child.  The failure on the part of society and Government to properly address the alcohol problem as a fundamental threat to the proper functioning of individuals and communities leaves the child protection system dealing with insurmountable consequences.  I am conscious of the fact that a Public Health (Alcohol) Bill is currently being discussed.  We do not have time to address this issue but is a national crisis.  If there is anything to emerge from my report, it is our ambivalence towards alcohol and those who promote alcohol and yet the consequences are devastating. </p> <p>  Another key theme to emerge from the audit is in the area of inter-agency co-operation.  It is essential that those who operate under the umbrella of child protection services can share information on vulnerable individuals and their families.</p><p>Throughout the audit, over a lengthy period of time, agencies kept saying to me that there were confidentiality problems and data protection issues.  My view is that confidentiality is sometimes a bogus issue.  What I found was poor inter-agency communication and co-operation.  I am conscious of the fact that, since the audit, there has been an attempt to say that there are very good lines of communication within the upper echelons of organisations, but I found this bore no reality to the perception gleaned from talking to individual members of, for example, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  What I found is that inter-agency co-operation was overwhelmingly inadequate.</p><p> I would like to address the currency of this audit, its breadth and whether it is relevant to the present.  This audit looked at more than 500,000 fields of PULSE data.  It was a thorough and comprehensive review of PULSE.  I understand that I am one of the first people to have had access to these data, over the period of 2014 to 2015 in particular, but also from 2008 until the end of 2015.  I also conducted questionnaires on all garda&iacute; who exercised their powers for the 2014 to 2015 period.  There were 560 cases, with a full response rate by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is commendable and of enormous assistance for drawing conclusions.  I conducted a random audit in September 2015.  I attended the national headquarters of the child protection unit in Harcourt Street and randomly selected cases to obtain a temporary picture as to how the system was operating.  I then interviewed those garda&iacute; subject to the random audit to get an understanding of how they felt.  Those interviews were lengthy.  I heard reference to the fact that Tusla introduced a national out-of-hours service in 2015.  I want to make it very clear for the record that I conducted focus groups in late December 2015 in the aftermath of the introduction of the national out-of-hours service.  Those focus groups were conducted with both senior and rank-and-file members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in order that I could get an understanding of the position.  I continued to liaise with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, up until the earlier part of this year.  Perhaps I was a source of incredible frustration for those within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, because I continually updated the report, and tried to present as accurate a picture as I possibly could.  I think it is important to emphasise that point.</p><p> To return to the issue of inter-agency co-operation, it is essential that children do not slip through the net, and we heard that in the previous presentations.  It is a question of pulling children back from the brink.  We need greater links between agencies.  There is reluctance in this country to look at much broader structural reform.  This is a real problem and this committee has a central role in solving this problem.  Looking at the international models, the solution to this problem is co-location.  Every professional that has a role in child protection needs to feel equal.  No-one has an exclusive reserve on child protection.  A very good example is the state-of-the-art facility opened in the Bronx, where the equivalent of Tusla, the New York Police Department, NYPD, a forensic paediatrician and the prosecution service sit around a table making decisions about children.  That is relevant to the out-of-hours service.  If a garda and social worker are co-located, then the out-of-hours service does not become such a big problem.  Be in no doubt that I do not believe that the national out-of-hours service is currently fit for purpose.  Look at the evidence given before this committee last week, which I have read with great care, the fact that there are service providers for four locations, and the suggestion that we look at demand for services in other jurisdictions.  I would point to my own report, which comprehensively documents demand.  On page 50 of the report, I provide an analysis, county by county, of the number of section 12 incidents between 2008 and 2015.  What more information do we need to determine what is necessary for an out-of-hours service?  My view is to ask why a child in a county that is less populated should receive an inferior service because the child lives in that jurisdiction rather than a heavily-populated area?  We need equality across the entire country.  That is something that we deserve.  We passed a children's rights referendum.  It has to mean something for all children, not just some children.  We did not pass a referendum just qualifying that.  It is important to emphasise that point.</p><p> To get things right, we need to take a rights-based approach.  There are a number of core rights, including non-discrimination, the best interests of the child, the right of the child to life survival and development, and also the voice of the child.  All children should have the right to survive, grow and develop in the context of social, physical and emotional well-being.  Every child should have the opportunity to reach his or her full potential.  Coming back to the mental health issues, in my opinion the system fails children with psychological or mental health difficulties.  The failure to recognise mental health issues at an early stage can have profound implications for the family.  Warning signs need to be treated with sufficient seriousness.  Referrals need to be timely and appropriate.</p><p> I will go through five of the key findings of the audit.  The first was the overwhelmingly positive findings that exist in respect of certain actions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The garda&iacute; commit great effort to treating children sensitively and compassionately when a child has been removed under section 12.  What I found as part of the audit is that some members worked well beyond the rostered hours to ensure that children removed under section 12 obtained the appropriate care.  One of the principal objectives of the audit was to examine the appropriateness, proportionality and legality of section 12 removals.  The audit team and I found that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na exercise their powers following a period of careful consideration of the circumstances and available evidence.  All cases examined involved an appropriately restrained use of section 12 powers.  The audit also found that there was no evidence of racial profiling when exercising section 12 powers.</p><p> That said, that finding must be tempered by the fact that certain ethno-cultural demographic information was not routinely documented on PULSE.  The audit found difficulties with the PULSE system.  It found that the PULSE system was not perfect.  It also found that there was no routine gathering of ethnic data.  That needs to change.  If there is a legislative block, that needs to be removed.  From a child protection perspective, the audit found evidence of the removal of children under section 12 from the same family circumstances - in other words, repeated removals.  The audit also found little evidence of discrete child protection training in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  On-the-job training seemed to be preferred over formal core training.</p><p> The critical thing to emerge again and again was that notification is not communication.  If one fills in a form and pushes that on to another office, that is not communication.  Communication is shared decision-making.  I think that critical theme of notification not being communication emerged at every stage of the audit.  The presence or absence of out-of-hours services was subject to considerable criticism.  Children had to be criminalised or pathologised in order to gain access to the necessary welfare and support services.</p><p> The audit found very positive evidence of the operation of specialist child protection units in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is why I am such a strong advocate of co-location.  Nothing predicts like the past.  Those who are not aware of history are bound to repeat it.  There appears to have been a failure to learn from past mistakes.  We need to learn from the shattered lives of those children whose personal stories are reflected in the audit.  When a child is the victim of abuse or neglect, it is the responsibility of statutory services or agencies to provide a timely and proportionate response.  It is my view that, to protect children, we need to promote co-location.</p><p>Co-location has several advantages.  In my opinion, there is less system inflicted trauma, better decisions, more appropriate interventions and, in fact, more efficient use of resources rather than this silo mentality where we all are doing something separate.  It is no different to passing the correspondence from one Department to the next Department.</p><p> Working upstream also has huge benefits.  The importance of schools at an early point tackling problems should not be understated because education is the gateway out of disadvantage.  Certain behaviours are clear and strong indicators that the child may be at risk.  Among these are substance, alcohol and solvent abuse.  Escalating patterns of at risk behaviour and poor impulse control should raise flags for all professionals involved and should designate the child as being in need of urgent attention.  It is my view that the system is unable to cope with children with emotional behavioural problems.  I was deeply distressed by a number of examples where children who had emotional behavioural problems did not receive an out of hours service because the providers would not accept them.  Those children inevitably ended up in hospitals or Garda stations.  That is a matter of profound concern.  Intervention, when it comes, must not be too late to vindicate the right of the child to have his or her welfare protected.</p><p> Many challenges remain to be resolved before we can say that we are a country where our children's rights are fully vindicated.  It is always a work in progress.  It demands new perspectives, renewed efforts and real energy.  A system designed to protect children must protect children.  The system must be accountable.  It must be consistent.  It must always seek to minimise the risk to the welfare of the child.  It is salutary that one quarter of our population are children.  When we talk about the political response to this, we should not lose sight of that fact.  They are our greatest national resource.  The right service at the right time is crucial, and we must get it right for every family and every child.  We need to imagine a Republic where all children are treated equally.  Any such republic must necessarily include a robust, 24 hour, 365 day a year service - I am passionately of that view - alongside a properly co-located service.  The manner in which society treats its vulnerable citizens reflects not only its qualities but also its sense of justice, its commitment to the future and its ambition to enhance the human condition for the next generation.</p></speech>

It gives a clear picture of what life is like.  He said that he hopes after the outrage comes the action.  Me too.  He also described how life is lived for some of our vulnerable children.  Those were poignant, strong and profound statements.  We will now take questions from the committee.  I will call Deputy Jan O'Sullivan first, as she has to leave.  If he does not mind, Dr. Shannon might take two or three questions at a time in case of repetition.  When everyone is finished, he might allow me to ask a couple of questions as well.  I call Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.52" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1325" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017062800002#K00300"><p>I reiterate what the Vice Chairman has just said.  The extraordinary passion that Dr. Shannon brings to the welfare of children is hugely significant.  I thank him for his report.  I immediately propose what he suggested at the start about inviting him back.  I do not know if he has a monitoring role in terms of implementation.  If he does not, he should.  Implementation is absolutely crucial, as he and the Vice Chairman have stated.</p> <p>  The main issue for me concerns co-location and inter-agency communication.  Representatives of Tusla have attended the committee and we have already had some discussion around Dr. Shannon's report.  As Dr. Shannon said, notification is not communication and we need a working relationship that puts the children at its centre.  In his written submission to the committee, Dr. Shannon said that the audit sought to evaluate the nature of inter-agency communication between Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that it sought to examine the processes and cultures, if any, in which Tusla social workers provide feedback on cases to Garda members following their removal of children under section 12.  Section 12 is relied on where there is a serious and urgent child protection risk.  It is an extraordinary responsibility for the Garda and, from what Dr. Shannon said in the report, it is highly sensitive to it.  The real concern, however, is the fact that there does not seem to be the interaction and real mutual respect for professionals that Dr. Shannon spoke about as well.</p> <p>  The Minister has stated that she will publish an implementation plan and speaks about having an assigned social worker to the recently established Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na national child protection unit.  What I want to tease out  is what is required at the local level for each individual child in terms of communication between the Garda and Tusla and the requirement on Tusla to have that real proper communication, feedback and engagement with other services and not just the Garda.  This may be with teachers or whoever else might identify issues for children.  That is the main area I wanted to ask Dr. Shannon about.</p> <p>  I fully support Dr. Shannon in terms of the need for a full 24 hour, out of hours service for all children in the country.  The ISPCC, which operates a listening service, has pointed out to us as well that it is absolutely essential.  Does Dr. Shannon know if there is some kind of resistance from Tusla to that?  I do not know if there is but I would be interested to know if there is.  As a committee, we have to say that it is essential.</p> <p>  There is a new system called Signs of Safety being introduced by Tusla.  I was pursuing this last week.  It sounds good in so far as it is concerns involving and training people such as garda&iacute;, teachers and community people.  I do not know enough about it.  It will be implemented.  Tusla staff are already being trained in it.  My specific question relates to risk assessment in that situation and ensuring that, when spreading responsibility for child safety, we are not in a way leaving nobody responsible where there is a significant risk level.  I apologise for all the questions.</p></speech>

I will start off with the Signs of Safety framework.  I welcome the development but it needs to be monitored.  It is the primary responsibility of the State to ensure that children are properly protected.  That cannot be delegated to any third party.  We need a conversation around the benefits of Signs of Safety, and there are undoubted benefits, but also the downsides of this approach.  It is a core part of the Tusla vision and therefore needs to be comprehensively examined.  It is beyond this discussion but the issue is a particularly important one because it will have a profound impact on how children are protected within this jurisdiction.  It needs a much broader discussion.</p> <p>  In respect of inter-agency co-operation, I support the ISPCC approach.  Sometimes I think that there is a misunderstanding on the issue of inter-agency co-operation.  I have read the transcript from last week's meeting.  If I may, I will reference a number of the issues raised.  They include a national call centre where social workers consult with and provide advice to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I do not see that as a robust, national, out of hours service.  It is a stop gap and I acknowledge the fact that in November 2015 it was a significant step forward and that there were the beginnings of an out of hours service.  However, and I must say this publicly, if we are referencing Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow and Cork city as areas where there is a "full social work service", I come back to the point I raised earlier about those children who happen to have a need.  I refer the committee again for further consideration to page 50 of my report.  If we look at the areas outside of those discrete towns and cities, we will see that there is a need.</p><p>I would argue that even if only a small number of children require a service, why should those children not receive a service?  I would also argue that the children most in need of a service are the children who seek to access State services after 5 o'clock in the evening or over a weekend.  Sometimes those are the children with challenging emotional behavioural problems and, arguably, they need an enhanced social work service because of the difficulties presented.</p><p> To come back to the audit, it unambiguously found poor inter-agency co-operation.  Even if that was the perception among rank and file members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it is problematic.  If one agency believes there is a mystification and a lack of understanding of the way Tusla operates, it is a real challenge for the child protection system in terms of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na exercising their powers but not understanding what is happening next.</p><p> If I could share with the committee what I wanted to do, I had provided Tusla with a robust proposal to delve deeper into the Tusla involvement.  What is needed, and I see a reference to it in the Minister's statement this morning, is to look at what happens next.  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire referenced some public comments around this broader audit of the system.  We need to get a 360 degree picture as to how the system operates.</p><p> I share Deputy O'Sullivan's views on all the issues she raised.  I am conscious of her long track record in this area, but the key issue for me is around implementation in a meaningful manner, not a document.  It is how those actions are implemented and that there will be a timeline in respect of the implementation of those actions.  That is what I will be suggesting.  I hope that answers Deputy O'Sullivan's questions.</p></speech>

I said it at the time and I will say it again.  The audit was a remarkable piece of public service.  The report underlines that there were examples but some of the examples given in the approximately 91 cases were shocking.  Anyone would find them harrowing.  They show the adverse and difficult circumstances in which many young people in Ireland grow up.  It was well worth shining a light on that and the way it is being dealt with.</p> <p>  One aspect that was clear in the audit was that there were difficulties between the two agencies specifically involved, namely, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla.  It is worth stating that the audit clearly shows that there is a high level of commitment on the part of the individuals involved, and I acknowledge that the work is very difficult.  There are great difficulties facing social workers and garda&iacute; and they show a great deal of commitment but in regard to Tusla in particular, and we discussed it last week, there seems to be both structural and cultural issues which raise very serious concerns.  We discussed individual cases, but the concern was not simply about the individual cases.  It was the structural and cultural weaknesses that existed.  As far as I recall, the culture referred to by a number of garda&iacute; was one of people leaving it until the last minute on a Friday to get in contact with the garda&iacute;.  I ask Mr. Shannon to comment on that and on his experience of cultural issues because that seems to be a significant concern.</p> <p>  The issue of inter-agency co-operation has been largely dealt with, but I might return to it later.  On the area of out-sourcing which we discussed in considerable detail last week also, I expressed my concern about that.  The level of reliance on agencies, particularly the Five Rivers agency, in the past 15 to 20 years has become very significant.  A huge proportion of the out of hours cases are referred to it.  In particular, I expressed my concern that that agency has the ability, and exercises it, to refuse to accept children who it perceives as displaying problematic behaviours and who could then end up in Garda stations or other unsuitable places.  That is a very unsatisfactory, dangerous and problematic situation.  I would like to hear Dr. Shannon's response to that and what he believes should be done about that reliance.</p> <p>  I was interested to hear Dr. Shannon's comment on the issue of an audit because as he noted, it was an issue I raised last week and on a number of other occasions.  The question of whether our child protection services are fit for purpose needs to be asked.  If they are not, how do we get to the bottom of that?  Does it require a full audit of our child protection services and, if so, what would that involve?  Are we looking specifically at section 13 or is a much broader audit of child protection services required?  Dr. Shannon might give us a roadmap on how to get to a child protection service that is adequate and fit for purpose in an Ireland that passed the children's referendum.</p> <p>  We had a brief discussion on Tusla's response to the audit on the day and subsequently.  A press release was issued.  It was withdrawn.  Last week's statement from Tusla stated that no member of staff was involved as part of the methodology for conduction the review or writing the report.  I would be interested in Dr. Shannon's response in terms of the nature of his communication with Tusla, his subsequent communication with Tusla and, harking back to the previous question, his engagement with Tusla on a further audit.</p></speech>

If I can start with the last question, I made extensive efforts to consult with Tusla prior to the audit commencing.  That dates back to when Gordon Jeyes was the national director.  I sent what was then the proposal to Gordon Jeyes.  Once Fred McBride was appointed chief executive officer I sent a copy of the framework to him at that stage.  As this was an audit of the exercise by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of their child protection powers, it was looking at it with that lens.<br/><br/>In response to Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's question, I had suggested that we needed that complete picture.  There has been much discussion around the 91 cases and whether there should be a further review.  If I can I will use take this opportunity to say that I have written to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have asked for my view on this and what I say is that it is nowhere suggested in the report that those cases are either all examples of problematic cases, since they are not, or that they are exclusive examples.  I say that the cross-section of these instances was used to reflect the themes arising in the course of the audit and, for example, to illustrate the grounds pursuant to which section 12 was invoked.  I say also that a further examination of these particular examples set out in the audit would not be helpful or appropriate in the context of all other cases which arose, and that there are data protection issues as well.  The data provided from the PULSE review is only one of several bases of research set out in the audit to include interviews with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, reviews of questionnaires and other documentation on focus groups.  I say that I believe there is little or no purpose to further examining these historical cases, which have already had the benefit of a thorough examination, and that I would respectfully submit that the interests of children the subject of section 12 orders would be best served by enabling the previously proposed contemporary review of section 13 cases to proceed as speedily as possible.<br/><br/>What I wanted to do was look at the system as it operates currently.  It is all very well to say that these were historic concerns.  We need to look at whether there were contemporary concerns.  I had prepared a detailed proposal, which I had sent to Tusla.  Issues emerged regarding the <i>in camera</i>rule and to sample.  There were a number of females with Tusla in August of last year, but suffice it to say that conducting this further stage of the audit was a lengthy process.</p><p>What I wanted in regard to section 13, if it were possible, is that it would mirror the same size and the scale of the Garda audit in order that we could have a broad systemic review of the system as it operated but difficulties were identified.  I am not going to get into the nature of the correspondence but suffice it to say a number of emails were exchanged and some time was spent developing a proposal.  I made every effort to consult with Tusla on this project in so far as it was relevant because we were looking at what happens when a child is removed under section 12.  The sad reality is that in some of these cases Tusla has a very minor involvement because the children, in some cases, were brought by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to a private provider, the Five Rivers organisation.  I want to state publicly that I found no fault with the Five Rivers organisation.  I will address later the point Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire mentioned, and I share his view on the State outsourcing its child protection responsibilities to anything other than a State agency.  I have said publicly, not only in this but in other forums, that I have a big difficulty with this.  We know what happened in the past when the State outsourced its services.  If there is anything we have learned from the past it is that the State must take responsibility.  It is very similar to the question Deputy Jan O'Sullivan raised regarding the fact that the State has to assume responsibility in this regard.  </p><p> I received a letter from Mr. Gordon Jeyes's successor, Mr. Fred McBride, and I will read extracts from it.  It stated that Tusla has welcomed the strong collaborative approach I took to our shared agendas.  It also noted that as stated previously and publicly, the report has provided very important insights into the child protection system in Ireland and provided Tusla with a greater impetus to address the challenges.  It further states the media statements made by Tusla were simply an attempt to clarify that the audit was solely focused on a review of section 12, as undertaken by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that my findings were based on information obtained through what it calls my detailed and comprehensive review of information obtained from the Garda.  It references stage 5, which is what I had hoped to do in regard to section 13, which would have been a further stage of the audit.  It states that other than the basic information provided to me on the emergency out-of-hours service, the audit did not review any file material.  The audit could not review it because the intent of the review was to look at section 12.  I wanted to look at section 13, and I am not going to go into the detail of the correspondence, but I wanted to do it at the same scale and with integrity.  The reality is that there were difficulties on who would fund that process. </p><p> I am an independent person in that if I prepare a report, I would regard it as not being subject to review by any third party.  I produced the report as it appears.  That would be a key feature in my becoming involved in any such process.  Mr. McBride's letter stated that this was in no way an attempt to undermine what he called the rigorous research I undertook.  It is important to note he also stated he was equally aware that I had met the interim director of policy and strategy and the head of legal services in November last year, when I read sections of the draft report to them and outlined some of the key legal issues from the audit, including the need to review the contract with Five Rivers.  I had identified at that stage that there was no reference in the contract with Five Rivers to the foster care regulations, a key part of best practice in the area, and my understanding is that Tusla may have changed the contract in the intervening period.  We also discussed the need to expand the emergency out-of-hours provision and the need to address the challenges of suitable placement for children with complex emotional behavioural difficulties.  The members can see from that the engagement I have had was appropriate and I made every effort, in so far as it was appropriate, to consult with Tusla on this project.  I acknowledge the programme of reform being undertaken by Tusla.  Everybody wants Tusla to succeed but what we need to do is to have an honest conversation.  This report shines a light on an area that, to date, has not received much attention.  </p><p> As for children with emotional behavioural problems, I was deeply troubled by the finding that children who presented to the private provider did not receive a service because there was a suspicion that the young person had consumed alcohol or drugs.  In those circumstances, arguably, I would submit that it is more important that they would receive a proper service.  I read the Minister's statement this morning that there would be a review of the legislation as to whether there are legislative issues to be dealt with in the context of this issue.  It is deeply concerning that children would end up in Garda stations or in hospital beds because there is not a proper service available to them, not least because this has an impact on the criminal justice system and the health system because a young person would be taking up a hospital bed or depleting Garda resources sometimes in areas where those resources are challenged.</p><p> My view on outsourcing is very clear.  We should have a seamless social work service and we need a comprehensive social work service.  We should be in no doubt that co-location involves investment.  It involves a Government commitment and such a commitment needs to be given.  If we want to have a comprehensive child protection system, it will involve a cost.  If our greatest national resource is our children, surely it is worth spending that money because it will reap rewards in terms of better outcomes for children upstream rather than having to deal with problems downstream.  I hope I have answered Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.63" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Geoffrey Shannon" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017062800002#M00300"><p>I suggest the focus on section 13 would then provide the basis and the question on the broader audit might well emerge from that.  What I have - hopefully successfully - undertaken is a highlighting of how the section 12 process operates.  I am confident the conclusions I have arrived at demonstrated two high-level points, in that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na exercised its powers proportionately.  There is no evidence of racial profiling.  What it demonstrates is poor inter-agency co-operation between the agencies.  We now need to examine what happens next in the aftermath of the section 13 review and having looked at the court files.  I had seen this in three phases, first, looking at the section 12 phase, next looking at section 13, in other words, what happened when the case ended up in Tusla's office and then what happened ultimately when the case was disposed of by the court.  That would give us a comprehensive picture as to how a large part of our child protection system operates.  If that produces issues that need further explanation, I would suggest at that stage that we would consider a broader audit.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question and is of assistance.</p></speech>

I am delighted he is on the side of children.  He has swept away the politics and engaged in straight talking in claiming the independence of his office.  He has been very strong on that and about not being influenced.</p> <p>  We have been comprehensively dealing with a Public Health (Alcohol) Bill in the Seanad.  I regret that the former Minister of State is no longer in her former position.  She was very purposeful in brushing aside any vested interest that lobbied and was seen to try to dilute that Bill and its potency for children and their parents.  Alcohol is a leading cause of dysfunction and mental ill-heath in our country and that affects our children from pre-birth and infancy and upwards.</p> <p>  We discussed mental health earlier and Senator Freeman made a presentation on it.  Our lack of mental health services is a child protection issue.  We are woeful in what we are doing in that area.  We are trying to kick-start the process and get something done immediately to protect our children because it is a child protection issue.</p> <p>  Representatives of Tusla appeared before the committee last week.  The culture in that agency is one of defensiveness but we need to get beyond that.  There are reasons for it being defensive but that agency is the foundation of in terms of where our children are at in this State and looking after them, making sure we can embrace that and can nurture them.  Tusla is not doing that.  I put it to one of its representatives that the agency is not fit for purpose.  We need to promote it, encourage it, and bring it up to the level where our children are adequately embraced and looked after.</p><p>Childhood is limited and we need to recognise that every slow step of politics and legislation condemns more children to an adulthood or young adulthood of broken promises that we have not kept.  We need to be more immediate and be seen to be more immediate.</p><p> Dr. Shannon alluded to the reference to equality in the Proclamation of 101 years ago.  I always allude to the pursuit of happiness of every child.  Some of the children Dr. Shannon has dealt with and some who I have dealt with professionally have never known the concept of happiness.  That is an emotional feeling.  What is happiness?  Children should own happiness every day.  Yet, every day some of the children we deal with do not know that concept or what it means.</p><p> Will Dr. Shannon talk about co-location in a practical sense?  How does he envisage it in the Garda station or wherever the co-location happens?  Where does Dr. Shannon envisage it?  Who does he envisage being involved?  Is it going to be overly bureaucratic?  Are we going to try to simplify it in the interests of expediency, ticking the boxes and ensuring that we do the right thing?  We will always take risks in making decisions.  We are adults but we do not know every answer to every question.  A duty of care to the mental and physical well-being of children will guide us in everything we do.  I thank Dr. Shannon and I am delighted that he is on the side of our children.</p></speech>

If you wish, please go ahead and answer Senator Devine's questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.67" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Geoffrey Shannon" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017062800002#N00300"><p>I will start with the last question.  It seems to be a trend.  The question of how this can be realised is particularly important.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na confirmed to me on Friday last week that it will be implementing without delay all of the recommendations in the report, and a key part of these is co-location.  The way that will operate at a practical level involves specialist child protection units being established.  There will be a social worker with a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We will have joint decision making.</p> <p>  That is why I was trying to make that link and reduce the reliance on the national out-of-hours service.  We will be building up expertise where it is needed, that is to say, in the local Garda station.  The vision is that 28 social workers would be assigned to the various units.</p> <p>  Senator Devine asked what I would like to see in terms of practical recommendations.  I would like to see from members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla a joint plan, perhaps presented to this committee, on how it is envisaged that this proposal will be rolled out along with the timeline.  What I have seen in respect of the four specialist child protection units has been impressive in terms of far greater cohesion between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla.  We build up a relationship of trust when we work with people on a daily basis - no one needs a high-level degree to understand that.  Sometimes the simple solutions are the most effective solutions.</p> <p>  The one key recommendation in this report is the recommendation around the need for co-location and the need for it to happen as soon as possible.  Senator Devine is absolutely right: we need to make it real.  We need a roadmap for how and when this is going to happen.  Otherwise, we could be back here next year.  That is why I hope it was not inappropriate for me to suggest that we review this a year from now.  I have considerable experience of reports and I have been central to the drafting of many reports where many of the recommendations remain un-implemented.  I hope this report will be one of the first reports in respect of which there will be a speedy implementation plan.  My key recommendation at the end of the report was that, one year from the date of publication, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would publically demonstrate the efforts undertaken to implement the recommendations.</p> <p>  I share the view of Senator Devine on mental health issues.  In my view the State has a mandatory obligation to protect children and ensure children who are in need of services receive those services.  A key part of that is the mental health issue.  There is a natural alignment between the presentation this morning and my presentation, because many of the issues to emerge in the audit revolve around children with mental health issues and how, if those issues go undiagnosed, they can have far-reaching consequences.</p> <p>  The final issue raised related to alcohol.  That is a key issue.  In fact, it is the stand-out issue from this report.  Everywhere we turn in this report alcohol features.  This is a national crisis.  Committee members should be in no doubt that it needs urgent Government response.  However, it is not only a question of an urgent Government response; there are far broader societal issues.</p> <p>  There are several key recommendations.  I met officials from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and I warmly welcome the commitment of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone.  Undoubtedly, she is a committed Minister.  There is an implementation plan in this report and the fact that she has come out so quickly with an implementation plan is impressive.  I notice that as part of the implementation plan the report is to be sent to the Minister for Health.  This is a key part of it.  I am conscious of the fine work done by Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy in the area and I wish to acknowledge it.  However, we cannot afford any further delay.</p> <p>  I have asked for an additional feature when Tusla undertakes a risk assessment.  If a parent is persistently abusing alcohol, that should be a risk indicator.  Some of the examples in chapter 3 will horrify committee members.  I still have memories of tracking these cases on the PULSE system.  It beggars belief how some of these children are treated.  This demands not only a Government response but a societal response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.68" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1231" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017062800002#N00400"><p>I thank Dr. Shannon for an outstanding report.  This is the third time we have had conversations since the report was launched.  Hindsight and 20/20 vision are great things.  If we had known some of the answers this morning we might have approached Tusla somewhat differently last week.</p> <p>  In her statement this morning the Minister said that there is a new inter-agency protocol reflecting the children first legislation and that it is awaiting sign-off by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I would welcome some commentary around that and what exactly needs to be done there.</p> <p>  In response to Senator Devine, Dr. Shannon mentioned 23 social care workers.  Does this correspond to 23 divisions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where we are looking at doing the co-location?  How will that come with the data protection and some of the problems that Dr. Shannon has encountered along the way?  Do we have the systems in place and the communication between both organisations such that they can interact and use the same computer database?  Even though we might not have an out-of-hours service, we have built up trust and knowledge.  How do we access the information around the families?  I believe that is a major part of it.</p> <p>  I was concerned to hear about the repeated removal of children from families.  Once was acceptable but twice is unforgivable.  What was the link with Tusla at that stage?  When it becomes repeated, then all of a sudden a pattern is developing.  Were people removed more than once?  Were there instances where this was repeated?  That is an interesting part of it because to me it shows that the system failed completely.</p> <p>  I thank Dr. Shannon for his openness and honesty in respect of the fact that he engaged with Tusla.  While I know the report was commissioned by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na I was of the opinion that Tusla did not have a role to play because this was a report of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the force requested the audit to be carried out.  Dr. Shannon has told us how, after the audit, he engaged with Tusla in November and December 2016.  Tusla was aware of this before it came out.  Has Tusla asked Dr. Shannon or invited Dr. Shannon to continue with the next section of it?  Has that door been opened?</p> <p>  The report is outstanding.  It is live and in-the-moment and we have 91 cases.  Have we looked at any preventative measures other than those identified by Dr. Shannon?  Has Tusla asked Dr. Shannon about aspects that it would like guidance with, for example, the structure of frameworks to be put in place?</p><p>There are aspects here on which we would like guidance, with structures and frameworks put in place.  Can he continue with this work?  It would be hugely important for me to understand that there is continuation, that this is the start of a scope of work where we have done the audit.  However, it will be no good unless we have implementation and an action plan for that implementation.</p><p> While I welcome what the Minister highlighted this morning, I am worried about timeframes.  In terms of what the Minister outlined this morning, Tusla is to have actioned something.  What is Dr. Shannon's comment on manageable timeline expectations?</p><p> There is a national crisis around alcohol and drugs.  Alcohol abuse was a key issue running through Dr. Shannon's report.  What can this committee do about this?  Does Dr. Shannon recommend we invite in the Minister for Health to discuss that central element?  Are there other issues he feels we should highlight with the Minister?  I thank Dr. Shannon again for his report.  It was mind-blowing.</p></speech>

On the question about the follow-through of section 13, I can say publicly that I have framed a proposal on this.  I am not sure what the Minister's intentions are on this and this committee will have to ask about that.  I have about as much information as the members do.  The press release states that &quot;the Minister has asked Tusla to commission independent research immediately into Tusla's current practice where children come into care following an emergency intervention by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&quot;.  I presume that is a reference to section 13.  I am not asking that I be asked to undertake this piece of work but there is real value in me continuing, having spent some time on it until now.  I do not know if this is an attempt to say that somebody other than myself will be asked to undertake this research.  All I can say publicly is that I have given a lot of thought to how this could be undertaken.  I am not suggesting that it should be me but I am saying that from a State perspective there are benefits to having spent two years and thousands of hours on framing the first part of this proposal.  The committee may know that I have made some professional sacrifices to continue this work.  I am passionately committed to it.  I share Deputy Rabbitte's view that this needs to be done as soon as possible.  I am anxious to be honest with this committee.<br/><br/>When it came to the repeated removals, I was able to track them on the PULSE system and track whether or not the same child was subject to a section 12 within a relatively short period of time.  Question marks will, of course, arise.  It comes back to the Deputy's question, however, which was quite an important observation.  When attempting to look at this one is faced with a difficulty around the <i>in camera </i>rule.  If the child has been subject to care proceedings, one could run into this kind of difficulty in the next stage of the audit.  Ministerial direction would give the Minister much greater power.  Even if this required a legislative amendment, I think that this is a hugely important piece of work and one worth pursuing.  We need to have the full picture.<br/><br/>Hand on heart, I cannot give the committee an honest answer to the question of repeated removals.  What I can say, however, is that there was more than one episode of repeated removals under section 12 from the same family circumstances.  I cannot give an answer as to whether or not that was appropriate.  That answer lies in the comprehensive examination of a large number of cases to see how many were subject to repeated removals and whether or not they were justified.  That is important.<br/><br/>The Deputy is also right about the data protection issues.  This day next week I will appear before the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality to discuss the general data protection regulation.  I am happy to share my presentation for that meeting with this committee if it is of assistance.  There are important data protection issues.  I have long argued that both the <i>in camera </i>rule and data protection are there to protect citizens, not the system.  If they are used as a defence mechanism, then the Legislature needs to address this.  Data protection emerged as a central problem again and again through the course of the audit.  I have indicated in meetings with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs that if there is a legislative difficulty and a perception of a legislative difficulty from the perspective of either the Department of Children and Youth Affairs or the Department of Justice and Equality in the context of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, then there is an obligation on the Legislature to legislate.  In no other jurisdiction that I have reviewed were data protection issues perceived as a barrier to child protection.  It would be a real tragedy if we were to use data protection as a barrier to protecting our children.  That would be lamentable.<br/><br/>I warmly welcome Deputy Rabbitte's comments about alcohol.  What she suggests would be very helpful.  The issue raised this morning about cross-departmental response and a whole-of-government approach is hugely important.  Alcohol is such a fundamental issue and I think the Deputy's suggestion is a very good one.  </p></speech>

There is a lot of information there for me to get my head around.  I recently had a communication from the office of the Minister for Justice and Equality about this report.  It stated that the then T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, agreed that a protocol would be signed between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla on the operation of section 12 and that personnel from Tusla would be co-located at the national child protection unit at the Garda National Protective Services Bureau.</p> <p>  I also received an update from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on both of these issues, the first being the signing of a protocol between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla on the operation of section 12.  It stated that following the development of a proposed agreed protocol between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla on the operation of section 12, the Garda National Protective Services Bureau, GNPSB, had forwarded the document to policy development, implementation and monitoring, PDIM, for the section's consideration and that a response was expected from the PDIM in the near future after which such arrangements would be made for it to be signed.</p> <p>  On the second issue of the proposed co-location of Tusla personnel at the national child protection unit at the GNPSB, it stated that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na welcomed the intention of Tusla to co-locate Tusla personnel at the national child protection Unit at the GNPSB and awaited the receipt of a communication from Tusla in that regard and that upon receipt of confirmation from Tusla of its intention to co-locate Tusla personnel at the national child protection unit, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will immediately commence discussion with the agency with a view to making of necessary arrangements regarding such issues as role profiles, duties, roster periods, line management, etc.  It stated also that the NCPU had only recently been established and was currently working to advance the readiness of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for commencement for the Children First Act 2015 and that it was envisaged that the proposed secondment of Tusla personnel would take place post-commencement of the Act but that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would discuss earlier secondment of relevant personnel if proposed by Tusla.</p> <p>  That is just an update I received for the purposes of this committee.</p> <p>  Dr. Shannon has done work on the drug and alcohol area and I found his findings extremely interesting.  What we have to do here is to educate people about the issue of alcohol and its knock-on effects.  Many people are unaware of these, and I have also spoken to Senator Black about this.  Many people are unaware of the knock-on effects that even moderate or chronic moderate alcohol intake can have.  In anything we do on alcohol, we need to prioritise where it is that we need to specifically target.  Sometimes we get blanket approaches that are so spread out that they lose their effectiveness.  Behaviour towards and consumption of alcohol has changed over the last ten to 15 years.  Binge drinking was not the phenomenon 20 or 25 years ago that it is today.  We also have drugs and alcohol, uppers and downers, being used together, in particular by young people and unfortunately also by children of 14, 15 or 16 years of age.  We have a huge binge drinking culture.</p><p>My view is that what we need to do is prioritise and target a specific area.  The binge drinking culture is affecting the situation, notwithstanding the findings of Dr. Shannon across the board.  Perhaps it is not a question Dr. Shannon can answer, but from my own research the consummation of alcohol in Ireland has dropped by 25% in the past 15 years but the question is whether the abuse of alcohol has increased.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.73" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Geoffrey Shannon" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017062800002#P00200"><p>I think I can answer that question with a little insight because I co-chaired with the current chair of the Child and Family Agency the review of the just under 200 children who died in State care over a period of ten years.  Alcohol was a central feature of that report.  If we roll on to 2015 I returned to look at the issue and found it is as prominent as it was in 2010.  While the pattern of drinking may change, I would argue that the abuse of alcohol has not changed.  I am being very honest with this committee.  The issue is our ambivalence towards alcohol and whether we perceive alcohol as a risk indicator.</p> <p>  All I can do is respond in so far as it impacts on child protection.  In terms of the implementation plan prepared by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, which I welcome on this issue in particular, Tusla needs to confirm that persistent alcohol abuse is seen as a risk indicator and that is something we need to tackle.  I have had the benefit of looking at the approach of other jurisdictions and relative to other jurisdictions Ireland is particularly ambivalent because there seems to be a culture within this jurisdiction of a certain level of alcohol abuse being acceptable, yet the evidence points to the fact that it has a profound impact on child protection and welfare.  It impacts also in a very significant way at a financial level because it places an insufferable burden on the child protection system.  I think that this needs a whole-of-society approach as well as a Government-led approach.  I acknowledge the fact that there has been an implementation plan and that the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs met on the Thursday following the publication of the report.  The point I am making this morning is that not only do we need an implementation plan but we need a timeline.  An implementation plan is only a piece of paper unless the recommendations are actioned, and there needs to be a regular review as to what is happening.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.75" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Geoffrey Shannon" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017062800002#P00400"><p>Yes, I can respond to that by referring to the cases I was reviewing.  I have had the benefit of looking at a large amount of PULSE data which gives one an insight into the changing face of substance abuse.  It is not just alcohol, there certainly is an increasing tendency towards drug abuse and I think there is a message therein for legislators in terms of much tougher legislation being introduced on drug use in terms of its impact on children and vulnerable people.  The landscape has changed.  My view is that there is an increasing instance of drug and solvent abuse.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.76" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1266" speakername="Kathleen Funchion" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017062800002#P00500"><p>I also thank Dr. Shannon for his presentation.  It is refreshing to have someone speak so genuinely and passionately about children's rights because as I have said previously we continuously fail children in this State, both in the past and present.</p> <p>  Deputy Rabbitte touched on some of the questions I wanted to ask about section 12.  Where there is repeated removal of a child, what recourse is there for a garda who comes across such situations on a regular basis?  Is there anything he or she can do?  Lack of accountability is an issue.  Social workers can say the Garda is dealing with an issue because it was out of hours and then the Garda can say it thought the case had been handed over to a social worker.  The inter-agency approach outlined by Dr. Shannon would address such situations because there must be accountability.  Where does the buck stop in the case of repeated removals?  Is it with Tusla?  Can we say Tusla is failing children in such situations?  If a child is constantly being removed it is the role of Tusla to oversee that.</p> <p>  Tusla was before the committee last week.  I said that personally I did not have any confidence in it and the role it plays and that it has failed far too many children.  A case was referenced about two foster children in the same home where there were repeated complaints by the birth mother of one of the children.  The response, that one would not necessarily remove a child as it could be detrimental and one would have to review the situation and monitor it and put different systems in place, was very vague.  Does Dr. Shannon have any comments on a case such as the one I outlined where there are two foster children and there are repeated difficulties of a serious nature?  What is best practice in that regard?</p></speech>

The broader issue was raised by Deputy O'Sullivan on the terms of Signs of Safety.  We need an honest discussion on the issue.  In fairness, while I cannot comment on the individual case what we need to do is take a positive approach to child protection.  All I can tell the Deputy is what the State's obligations are.  Article 19 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child provide that children are entitled to be protected from harm and ill treatment.  It is a mandatory obligation to protect children from harm and abuse.  That is the standard.  That is reflected in our domestic legislation.  The Constitution also provides for that.  In implementing Signs of Safety, Tusla must have regard to that.  It is not just a passive approach.  There is a legal obligation on the State to be proactive in protecting children.  That is why I think we need to look at the policy which is Signs of Safety, alongside the legal obligations that exist.  Deputy Funchion has raised a really interesting question which deserves an entire discussion because if the future of child protection is going to revolve around Signs of Safety, surely that demands a national discussion around this issue?  It is a very important issue.</p> <p>  The second issue the Deputy raised concerned repeated removals.  The difference between this research and other pieces of research is that it was a very active piece of research.  I travelled around the country with a small number of colleagues, Cian O'Connor, Hilary Coveney Nash and Dr. Imelda Ryan, who is a child psychiatrist.  We met with individual garda&iacute;.  We are not cub researchers.  We are very experienced professionals looking at this issue and what we were getting from members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is mystification as to what happened next.  I share Deputy Funchion's response.  It is all down to inter-agency communication and co-operation.  That ties in with what Deputy Rabbitte said.  I asked why the information cannot be shared.  The perception of the Garda is that there is a data protection issue.  I cannot see how there would be a data protection issue in having a case conference at the end of the year, going through a number of cases that occurred during the year and examining what happened next.  That is why I passionately believe that the next phase, looking at section 13, is important, so we get the complete picture.  As I outlined this morning, I believe that co-location will provide a very real and meaningful impetus for change.  That is why this needs to happen within a specified timeline.  I am talking about the big picture issue, namely, broad structural change.  We need to reimagine our child protection system where all agencies work together to protect children.  There is a saying that it takes a village to rear a child but it takes all agencies working together to protect a child.</p></speech>

Dr. Shannon repeated a couple of phrases a few times, one of which is "a timeline".</p><p>I am sure Dr. Shannon was not being cynical, but how confident is he that the Garda and Tusla will ensure his recommendations are implemented?  Is he confident that the Garda and Tusla will follow through on the recommendations?  I fully agree with Dr. Shannon that someone should oversee whether the recommendations are implemented.  Dr. Shannon spoke about coming back in a year's time.  What if nothing has happened in a year?  There are 12,000 reports on children.  Where are they?  I am not sure whether I am out of order, and I hope I am not, but is there anything we can do to recommend that Dr. Shannon is the person to oversee implementation of his report?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.80" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Geoffrey Shannon" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017062800002#Q00200"><p>I would of course be delighted to be the person to oversee it.  I guarantee the committee that, as those around the table know, I will give an honest account.  Sometimes the truth is uncomfortable.  Nonetheless, I would not be doing the State any service by sugar coating any of the messages.  I have been around long enough to know that reports gather dust in a large number of situations.  We cannot afford for this to happen on this occasion.  The issues raised in the audit are hugely significant and strike at the heart of our child protection system.  As the Vice Chairman said, we need timely and meaningful implementation of the recommendations.  It cannot just be a box-ticking exercise.  When I looked at interagency co-operation I did so with a very neutral eye.  When I started to unpick it, what I found again and again is it was tokenistic.  It was about filling in a form and passing it on and the box has been ticked.  This is just not good enough for children.  Certainly from my review of section 12, and I have not done a section 13 review, we need agencies to move out of their silos and work together.  The report shines a light on the fact this is not happening.  It is not just Tusla or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is also about mental health services.</p> <p>  The points raised this morning are equally valid.  Children need a cohesive service.  They cannot be pushed from agency to agency.  The advantage of co-location is all of the services that children need would be located in one place.  This commends itself to a good sense.  It requires a complete rethink as to how we deal with child protection.  It would be an exciting project for the committee to undertake.  At present, discrete issues are dealt with as they arise.  I am calling for fundamental reform of our child protection system, which would bring about the cultural change required.  If that does not happen we will be back here in four or five years' time with quite a similar report and we will all be outraged.  As I said, and it was picked up on, after the outrage must come meaningful action.</p></speech>

I am an optimist by nature.  I welcome the Minister's statement this morning.  The Minister has a strong record in the area of human rights and I hope we can deliver on this.  Confidence requires a timeline for implementation.  It would be unfair and disingenuous of me to state that I have confidence until such time as I see the timeline and the staggered implementation of the recommendations.  I can say I am conscious of the fact and reassured that the Minister has moved very quickly to deal with this but I welcome it as first step.  The first step is we have the implementation plan.  I will state I have absolute confidence when the recommendations are implemented or there is significant progress in the implementation.  As I have also said, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have indicated they will implement them as soon as possible, but actions speak louder than words and this is something of which we should not lose sight.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.83" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1231" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017062800002#Q00500"><p>As I was listening to the questions I came up with a little brainwave.  The Garda requested the audit be carried out.  I sit on the joint policing committee in Galway.  It would be very welcome if An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na dedicated a section of its bimonthly report to children.  Various offences are documented in the report.  Could there be one specifically looking at where the Garda had to invoke a section 12 with regard to children, with a breakdown on whether there was domestic alcohol or drugs?  The spotlight would be shone at a local level every two months, which would feed into the national idea.  It would strengthen the hand of awareness and continuous media coverage, and it would keep it on the agenda.  Unfortunately if we do nothing we will not speak for a year and much might have passed.  Timelines are essential for implementation.  This is something to which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has access because it is on the PULSE system.  What does Dr. Shannon think of this idea?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.84" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Geoffrey Shannon" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017062800002#Q00600"><p>Information is power.  The proposal would enrich our understanding.  As part of the PULSE chapter I attempted to provide very detailed data.  We now have data, which is why I was slightly at a loss to understand why there was a recommendation on having to gather data on the demand for a national out of hours service.  I have an entire chapter detailing forensically the circumstances in which section 12 was invoked from 2008 to 2015.  This could be updated to look at 2016.  It is unlikely there will be a significant change over that longer period relative to the shorter period of time.  I support having this type of information in the public domain and that it is regularly available.</p> <p>  Deputy Rabbitte has prompted me to make a further observation.  It would be helpful if the implementation plan from the perspective of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would be shared with this committee.  This is the committee for issues relating to children.  I commend Detective Superintendent Declan Daly and Detective Inspector Michael Lynch, who are the two key lead people.  I found them very receptive to suggestions.  Continuing to feed the information gives us an accurate picture.</p> <p>  To come back to Deputy Funchion's question, it is not mystification.  Something that has remained with me since the audit is that rank and file members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are unsure as to what happened the case.  They are deeply invested.  The nation should be particularly proud of some of the junior rank and file members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I was hugely struck by the sheer commitment of young garda&iacute;.  I remember one case where a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na exercised section 12 powers on a Friday.  She said she thought of nothing else over the weekend only whether she had taken the right decision.  While I have criticised Garda training and the PULSE system, the State is well served by front-line social workers and front-line garda&iacute;.  What we need to do now is create the proper framework for our child protection system to operate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.85" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017062800002#Q00700"><p>To pick up on what Deputy Funchion said, and I know it is illustrative, we have the case of a child placed with another foster child, there were allegations of abuse and the birth mother felt the child should be removed from the situation but this action was not taken.  There was another example of a child being returned to the person who was alleged to have abused that child.  I accept I am a layperson and these cases are illustrative.  Dr. Shannon spoke about mystification in terms of the Garda and I am mystified by a number of these cases.</p><p> Briefly, I wanted to ask about the 24-hour service.  In his audit, Dr. Shannon found that, in the context of the 24-hour service, garda&iacute; did not necessarily have access to the requisite files on the children who were the subject of section 12 orders.  I will ask a very simple question because Dr. Shannon has talked in terms of his confidence in progress and implementation.  Does Dr. Shannon believe Tusla is fit for purpose?  Does he believe our child protection service is fit for purpose?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.87" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Geoffrey Shannon" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017062800002#R00200"><p>It is a difficult and political question and I have always tried to stay out of the political domain.  Where we get confidence in our child protection system is in audits of this nature and people willing to accept where there are gaps.  We all make mistakes and we all can improve and we need to create a culture where we are receptive to change.</p> <p>  I am not avoiding the question.  I support Tusla's programme of reform.  It is hugely important that we have a child protection system that is fit for purpose.  That is unquestionable.  What Tusla now needs to do is build up public confidence in our child protection system.  That involves taking an open approach to all reports and being receptive to different approaches.  It comes back to Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's signs of safety.  Let us have a debate.  These decisions should be discussed at this committee.  This committee has a key role.  The members represent the citizens of this country.  It is important that the members have a say in how our child protection system operates.  Ultimately, these decisions will be taken by Tusla but having that conversation is important.</p> <p>  Coming to the discrete question, as I said, I am reluctant to comment on an individual case.  What I will say is that I accept the point that the public needs to have confidence in how individual cases are dealt with.  If, in fact, the factual matrix the Deputy presented is that the public needs to understand why it is acceptable that a child would remain in a high-risk environment, it is not sufficient to state that it is complex or challenging.  We need to be able to explain in layman's terms why, in situations such as the example the Deputy demonstrated, it may be acceptable from a child protection perspective for the child to remain in the family.  The case is one of many cases.  As I say, I have not seen the file and it would be unfair of me to comment on the individual case.  Nonetheless, there is an issue of public confidence.  Of course, the public, looking in at an example like that, should feel confident that the right decision was taken.  If the public does not, it undermines public confidence.</p></speech>

Given the challenges the Garda has had to go through over the past six to 12 months, it is imperative that we, as a committee, highlight that.  We see from Dr. Shannon's report and his audit that rank-and-file garda&iacute; are doing the job to the best of their ability and with the best of intentions.  We should highlight that rank-and-file garda&iacute; are out there and that the majority are doing the job for the right reasons.  That needs to be highlighted.  I welcome that from the report.  It is one aspect that struck me straight away.</p></speech>

I may have been an irritant at times as I continued to pursue, for example, the PULSE data.  I was forensic in terms of seeking answers to anomalies in the PULSE data.  I am concerned that we have a database where the only element of accountability is inserting details on the PULSE system, particularly if that system is not perfect.  One must remember that section 12 is exercised without a court warrant and the accountability that Deputies &Oacute; Laoghaire and Funchion referred to is in ensuring that there is an accurate recording.  I found that there was a receptiveness within that unit.  I cannot speak for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but I am giving an honest account.  While there are fundamental problems with how PULSE operates, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, by and large, does a good job when it comes to dealing with emergency child protection.</p></speech>

Knowing that makes the terrible issues a tiny bit softer.</p> <p>  I thank Dr. Shannon.  He really has been incredible this morning.  I thank him for the way he answered all the questions.  It was certainly a rapid-fire approach and we are very grateful.  If there is anything we can do, as I said, to promote or encourage that Dr. Shannon is part of the next stage, I am sure that the committee would agree to do something in that vein.</p> <p>  I was somewhat remiss earlier so I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, on his new appointment.  That is why I am here today.  I am only taking his place temporarily.  It is terrific that he has been made Minister of State at the Department of Health with special responsibility for mental health and older people.  We wish the Minister of State the greatest success.</p> <p>  I would like to introduce Ms Emer Crooke, who has replaced Ms Dervila Flynn as clerk to the committee.  I probably was not supposed to do this publicly but I am saying, "Hello and welcome", to her.</p> <p>  Before I adjourn proceedings until our next meeting on Wednesday, 12 July, I wish to point out that the latter is supposed to start at 10 a.m.  However, in order to help Deputy Function with her report, would it be acceptable to meet here at 9 a.m.?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.105" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2017062800002#A00600"><p>I move amendment No. 1:</p><blockquote>In page 3, to delete line 19 and substitute the following:&quot;In this Act&mdash;<br /><br />&quot;Act of 1998&quot; means the Education Act 1998;<br /><br />&quot;Act of 2000&quot; means the Equal Status Act 2000;<br /><br />&quot;The Council&quot; means the National Council of Special Education.&quot;.</blockquote> <p>This amendment provides that under this section, we would make reference to the Equal Status Act 2000 as well as the Education Act 1998, which is in the Bill, as put forward by the Government.  Everybody knows why I have put forward this amendment to make reference to the Equal Status Act.  It is because the Equal Status Act contains the infamous section 7(3)(c), which, incredibly and disgracefully, gives a derogation to religious schools to discriminate.</p><p>The Equal Status Act is supposed to eliminate discrimination and ensure equality, yet that subsection gives a derogation to schools to discriminate against the children of all people, which is shocking.  Amendments related to my amendment have been ruled out of order.  I find it extraordinary that an amendment relating to admission to schools has been ruled out of order simply because it relates to another Act.  That subsection of the Equal Status Act is the key to facilitating the ongoing discrimination against children in the vast majority of schools.  This intolerable provision has to be dealt with.  To discriminate against anybody is bad but to discriminate against children is outrageous.  A total of 72% of parents believe the law should be amended in order that baptism would no longer be a requirement for school admission, while 24% say they would not have baptised their children if they had not needed to do so to gain entry to schools.  It is incredible that people are baptising their children purely to gain admission to schools.  More than 90% of schools are Catholic and children who are not of that faith are segregated, excluded, isolated and made feel different because they do not share the dominant faith, yet they do not have the choice in many cases to attend a multi-denominational or a non-denominational school.  They are, therefore, forced into this invidious position.  Any reasonable person would say this is not acceptable.  Whatever reasons successive Governments had for kowtowing to the Catholic Church primarily and allowing them to dominate schools and pursue this discrimination, times have changed.  Even people who are of the Catholic faith recognise the inequity and injustice.  </p><p> As the Minister will be aware, another reason has emerged in the last while; as if the substantial discrimination against kids was not enough, those who run Catholic schools are now sick and tired of the Catholic Church's domination.  That has emerged in the recent period because of religious denominations selling off facilities and degrading the quality of schools and their facilities to pay off their debts or whatever else.  There is nothing for the Minister to be afraid of anymore because even the people running schools who may have long subscribed to their values and ethos are fed up with the church's domination of schools.  There is nothing to fear politically.  The discrimination is partially due to the political establishment being in hock to a particular religious viewpoint, but, more recently, it probably has just been caused by political fear of standing up to the Catholic Church because of the consequences that might flow from it.  However, there is no need to fear anymore.  On a moral, reasonable level, we should remove the baptism barrier under this legislation.  Even on a purely pragmatic, expedient, political basis, there is simply no reason to fail to do it anymore.  The Government should get on with it and do it.  It should even go beyond it and separate church and State completely in the entire education system and other areas.</p></speech>

I look forward to the passage of the Bill, but a number of major issues have not been dealt with.  Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett mentioned the provisions of the Equal Status Act.  I would be grateful if the Minister outlined his position on it and his intended approach in that regard because no amendments have been tabled.  Clearly, it is the ghost at the banquet and the issue that is central to school admissions, but it is not dealt with at all.  Many are waiting to see what will happen.  In particular, in the past week many school patrons who have a legitimate interest in the legislation have been having an uncertain time because they do not know what the position will be.  A consultation process is ongoing.  This is as good an opportunity as any for the Minister to outline his position</p> <p>  Second, the amendment also relates to the definition of the "National Council for Special Education", NCSE.  Some time ago I stated in the House that Fianna F&aacute;il would not be prepared to facilitate passage of the Bill if a provision, which has widespread support among Opposition parties, was not inserted in that regard, but it has been ruled out of order in our amendments.  It relates to giving the NCSE the power to mandate schools to establish special classes where it designates there is a need for it.  That remains our position and I look forward to a constructive debate with the Minister on the issue.  That has to happen and I understand he has given good consideration to the views that have been expressed on all sides of the political divide.  We would like that provision to be included in the legislation.  The NCSE would never use that power, but it would help a number of recalcitrant schools, particularly at second level, to provide the proper facilities for children for whom special classes may well be the answer.  I do not wish to hold up the debate because otherwise we will be here until all hours.</p></speech>

It is unthinkable we would debate a schools admission Bill and not address section 7(3)(c) of the Equal Status Act.  That is the primary means by which children are discriminated against in the school system and the notion of taking the Bill without addressing that section is just laughable.  I tabled an amendment to provide for the amendment of section 7(3)(c), but it has been ruled out of order.  I would like to challenge that ruling, which I do not accept.  I have been in touch with the secretariat and was told that it had been ruled out order under Standing Order 154, but that does not stand up.  The Standing Order states: "It shall be an instruction to all committees to which Bills may be committed that they have power to make such amendments therein as they shall think fit, provided that such amendments be relevant to the provisions of the Bill and are not in conflict with the principle of the Bill as read a second time".  Amendment No. 181 in my name would meet that requirement.  I do not know the basis on which, with others, it has been ruled out of order, but I am challenging the ruling because my strong view is that my amendment would be in order.</p></speech>

The amendment proposed to amend the Equal Status Act rather than any provision of the Bill.  It must be ruled out of order as it is outside the scope and not relevant to the provisions of the Bill.

Through the Chair, I believe that section 7(3) of the Act is directly related to admissions to the schools.  The provision is fundamentally tied to it.  The baptism barrier is a huge issue in admission policies as it allows discrimination across the board.  It makes me wonder the following.  Why have we discussed the Labour Party's Equal Status (Amendment) Bill for more than a year?  Perhaps our discussions have been a complete waste of time and it should have been discussed by the Oireachtas Select Committee on Justice and Equality.  It is bizarre if we have been misguided in that way and the legislation will be delayed.</p> <p>  A huge issue of discrimination, along with the baptism barrier, is discrimination on the grounds of special educational needs.  That is why I echo what Deputy Byrne has said.  I am massively disappointed that the amendment that gives the National Council for Special Education the power to compel schools to open autistic units has been ruled out order.  </p></speech>

I intend to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage that deals with the issue that Deputy Byrne and other Deputies have raised.  It would provide that the National Council for Special Education could advise the Minister on the requirement to open a special class in schools.  I will bring forward a Report Stage amendment on that specific topic.</p> <p>  I shall bring forward Report Stage amendments on some other topics that I will mention for the sake of speeding up the committee.  While I am providing in primary legislation most of the provisions on prohibitive selective criteria, I will bring forward an amendment to provide that the Minister may still regulate on any criteria additional to those specified in primary legislation.</p> <p>  I will bring forward amendments to clarify that practices such as mandatory interviews, meetings, open days and testing of parents are prohibited in all cases, including where a school is not oversubscribed.  I shall table an amendment that provides for the replacement of a section 29 appeals committee member.  In other words, a member of an appeals committee could be replaced to allow continuity.  It is just an efficiency. </p> <p>  I will consider a concern that has been raised by a number of Deputies.  I refer to the ability of Irish language schools to prioritise children from Irish speaking homes.  I will reflect on how that option can be achieved in a fair way.  To clarify, I will bring forward amendments on Report Stage and there may be some additional tidying up amendments.</p> <p>  On the substance of amendment No. 1, everyone probably recognises that the Bill already provides for a definition of the Equal Status Bill in section 7.  The definition of the NCSE has been provided in the appropriate section, which I think is section 66.</p> <p>  I wish to be helpful on the wider issue.  The issue of religion in school admission is not currently in this Bill.  Previously I have indicated that I intend to act on this matter but on a separate track.  I have had consultations on the matter, as has the committee, and I know that the Labour Party is preparing a Bill.  I have always indicated that I think it is unfair that preference can be given by a denominational school to a child who lives far away over and above a child of no denomination, no religion background or a different one who lives close to the school.  I believe that parents should not feel obliged to have their child baptised.  </p> <p>  If today's Bill is passed then religion will not be used in the admissions for 80% of the schools, namely those that are not oversubscribed and no child may be turned away.  Religion cannot be used as a ground.  It is in respect of the 20% of other schools that the issue needs to be addressed.  Following the consultations and discussions, I would prefer to deal with this matter by removing religion as a criterion for admission to oversubscribed schools except in three limited circumstances - first, where it would otherwise be possible to maintain the ethos of the school; second, where the school is established by a minority religion in order to ensure that students of that religion can find a place in a school of that ethos; and third, where the school is established by a minority religion in order to admit a student of that religion who resides in a community consistently served by that school.  This is a version of one of the fourth options put forward to deal with this issue that we discussed before.  The reason I have put forward this provision is because I believe it is a fair way to provide options for parents of children of no denomination or, indeed, of a different one from their local school in order to get reasonable access to a school without unfairly encroaching on the rights of other parents who want to have their children educated in a particular ethos.  This is a fair and proportionate way of using the religious aspect.  It will mean that religion is only very rarely used as part of a school's admission criteria in the future.</p> <p>  At the same time the Bill recognises elsewhere other strengths of a school community.  For example, the school decides its admissions policy.  It can give priority to students from the local area, the siblings of existing pupils or the children and grandchildren of past pupils.  There can still be a strong ethos around the school, which I support.  </p> <p>  The provision protects minority religions.  Many sides expressed that concern when we debated this matter in the House.  At the same time the provision respects the Catholic community.  Ninety per cent of schools are now Catholic.  The provision ensures that a child can get reasonable access to a school of their denomination under the existing provisions where 90% of the children are accommodated. </p> <p>  I looked seriously at the catchment area.</p><p>Deputies from a number of parties were keen on that approach, but I believed it was not as good as the one I was taking because, although it would be an improvement, it would still leave children from non-denominational families at a considerable disadvantage in their local area.  It would also not be as good for many technical reasons.  There are no catchment areas.  If we were to wait for various denominations to come forward with catchment areas, we could be waiting a very long time.  There would need to be boundary commissions to deal with disputes over schools sharing catchment areas and so on, but that is a debate for another day.</p><p> This is a difficult constitutional issue.  There are provisions in the Constitution on religion, education and equality of treatment and we must steer a proposal such as this or any other advanced by members through them.  I will be consulting the Attorney General to make sure I can draft a robust amendment along the lines proposed to bring back to the committee in due course.  It was not intended to be the subject of today's debate.  We have had a separate track and separate consultations on it.  I hope the committee will accept my good faith in this matter.  Not everyone will agree with my proposal, but I ask people to consider it in order that when we do have a debate on the substantive issue, we can, I hope, reach some agreement on it.</p></speech>

Do not get me wrong: people have a right to their religion and if they wish to instruct their children on a particular religious view in their own time, privately or some other way, they are entitled to do so, but the idea that publicly funded schools could discriminate in any shape or form on the basis of religion, or any other basis, is just not acceptable.  That is what equality and equal status mean.  That is what equal admission to schools means.  Equality means no discrimination.  It is an unambiguous concept which does not need to be qualified.  The reason it is being qualified by the Government in its proposals which represent some improvement is we have outsourced our responsibility in the area of education to religious bodies.  Therefore, we are forced into trying to find compromises with them, but we should not have to and I do not accept it.  Equality is equality and equal status is equal status.  Eliminating discrimination should occur across the board or it is nothing.  Therefore, I will press the amendment.</p> <p>  With regard to the rest of the Bill, the removal of some of the soft barriers is an improvement.  I am not disputing that but to have a Bill about admission to schools that does not deal comprehensively with the issue of ensuring equality of access, on religious grounds, is not acceptable.  I forgot to mention in my introduction that I also have an amendment on the issue of special needs, special needs units and the obligations of schools in that regard, but it, too, has been ruled out of order.  That just does not make sense to me.  What I am describing are barriers to admission.  Barriers that are discriminatory or create a playing field that is not level are not acceptable.  Therefore, I will press the amendment.</p></speech>

I welcome use of the word "compel" because I was slightly concerned about the language used earlier.  When it is written down and the proposal on the Equal Status Act is also written down, we will certainly give them absolute consideration.  I am prepared to take the Minister at face value today, but I will certainly wait until Report Stage to deal with the issues in question.  The equal status issues and the baptism barrier ought to be dealt with in relatively short order because we just cannot keep talking about them.  We need action on them.

I recognise that Deputy Joan Burton who has just left has a Bill that will be passed on Second Stage at the end of this month.  It will be open to the committee to consider it.  I seek its tolerance in order that I can bring forward my amendment in a robust fashion to ensure we can have a proposal to put to the Attorney General that is sufficiently robust legally to deal with the issue.

A very significant number of parents nowadays do not subscribe to the belief system of the patron of the school their children are attending.  We know that these children and their parents have a constitutional right to withdraw from that religious instruction, but I believe we need to go further than this.  We need to provide for the spirit of the constitutional protection.  As it is exercised within schools, it is quite divisive for children.  Certain children are excluded from the activities of the rest of their class.  This highlights difference between children.  I do not believe we should be doing this within the education system.  It also causes many organisational difficulties for schools.</p><p>At particular times of the year or in particular classes where a considerable amount of time is spent on preparation for the sacraments, it is especially unfair to children who do not subscribe to the faith formation activity in the school.</p><p> It is wholly inappropriate that religious instruction classes will be held during the school day.  There is a strong argument for moving them out of the school completely in the context of a publicly funded school.  This plays into the wider issue, which we discussed earlier, in respect of the rights of parents for their children to attend their local State-funded school and that it should be free of any religious influence - certainly free of denominational instruction - during the regular school day.</p><p> My three amendments provide for the timing of classes in religious instruction outside of the normal school day.  At a minimum, they should be moved to the last class slot in the day.  Ideally, they should be held after the normal school day and at school finishing time.  That is the only fair way of ensuring the integrity of the school day remains intact and that children are not made to feel excluded in any way because their parents have chosen for them not to attend faith formation classes.  We need to take this step now.  Ideally, it should be outside the regular school day.  At a minimum, we should be ensuring schools move faith formation to the last class in the day to allow parents the option of collecting their children and taking them home.  It would remove the awkward situation in which children are placed as a result of religious instruction taking place and they having to move out of the classroom with arrangements put in place for alternative supervision during those periods.</p></speech>

The idea there would be instruction in a particular religious denomination or viewpoint during school time inevitably creates a discriminatory atmosphere for, as well as isolation and segregation of those who might not share the school&rsquo;s religious view or have no religious view.  It is wrong.  It is not the job of the State to finance that.  I would fight to the death for somebody's right to freedom of religious expression.  However, it is not our job to allow public moneys or the law to uphold a situation where particular religious views are pushed in school at young people.  We are long past the time when that should continue to be the case.  That is not to say there should not be a general discussion about religious, philosophical or humanist ideas.  There should be but not specific religious education and instruction of a particular viewpoint.</p></speech>

Under the Constitution, children have a right to attend school without attending religious instruction, as well as having the right to opt out.  Every school is obliged to honour this.</p> <p>  The approach we are taking on this issue in the Bill is that we are requiring a denominational school to make absolutely clear what provisions it will make for children who do not want to attend the religious programme of that school.  It should be made clear from the outset in the admissions policy before a child is enrolled how this will be dealt with.  It has always been a matter for the individual school to make these practical arrangements.  The best way forward to deal with this in a sensible and flexible way is for each school community to look at this.  Progress has been made in this area since the forum on patronage and pluralism reported.  There have been efforts to provide good practice in schools generally, and in Catholic schools in particular.</p> <p>  I noted later amendments stated the provision should not, as far as practical, be unduly burdensome for parents.  That is a correct sentiment.  I will have to look to amending the legislation to accommodate this on Report Stage.</p> <p>  The amendments preventing any faith formation taking place during the school day or requiring it only to take place at the end of the school day are likely to raise constitutional issues about the rights of religions.  The way forward in this area is to improve practice and to use the forthcoming approach of having a parents and students charter to develop that.  We should also give parents the right, if they are not satisfied that a reasonable accommodation is being made to pursue that, to go to the Ombudsman for Children with their concerns.  The approach we are taking with this Bill and with the prospective parents and students charter is the right way to go.  It respects the different school communities and their right to organise themselves in the right way.  We recognise there are schools with a particular ethos and parents who want to provide for their children to be educated in those schools.  This is the way of trying to accommodate, as best we can, the different needs of parents where their children are enrolled.</p> <p>  However, I cannot accept the amendments put forward by Deputies Shortall and Catherine Murphy.</p></speech>

The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has raised the issue for the Minister&rsquo;s attention that section 30(2)(e) of the Education Act 1998 provides that the Minister &ldquo;shall not require any student to attend instruction in any subject which is contrary to the conscience of the parent of the student&rdquo;.</p> <p>  My amendments Nos. 56 and 84 deal with the opt-out for students who do not wish to attend religious instruction.  Many schools with a religious ethos do not have alternatives for children.  We have scenarios where children will not attend school when communion and confirmation are being prepared for.  There are students in secondary school who were told to sit at the back of the class, given a study class or are told to go to the library when religious instruction takes place.  There are no guidelines in place, however, for the schools or students.  These two amendments would require the Minister to provide definite clarity and guidelines to schools on how they should put in place alternatives for children who do not wish to attend religious instruction and require a timeline for same.</p></speech>

What we want is to make a progressive improvement.  I do not believe we can make a one-size-fits-all regulation when they all face different situations.  Some schools allow children go to the library or resource rooms under supervision.  Some pupils go to a classroom where they can participate in other lessons.  Some schools are able to stagger religious classes to facilitate pupils moving from a class to class.  Some parents choose to collect the children for the periods of religious instruction and do other activities.  I do not believe we can have a regulation which provides a one-size-fits-all approach to this.</p> <p>  The right approach is the one I outlined to Deputy Shortall in that this is an issue for the school community to develop.  We will have a parents and students charter which will set out what is fair provision in general terms.</p><p>There will be a provision to enable parents who are not happy with the way in which the school is providing for their child to take the issue further.  We also provide in the Bill that the school will be obliged to set out the level of provision from the outset in order that when parents enrol their children they will know what approach the school takes.  The package is fair and reasonable in achieving improved provision in this area.  That is the way to go.  It is not the case that we on Marlborough Street decide for 4,000 schools and that there is a central regulation that sums up how it should be done.  That is not the tenor of the approach of the education system.</p></speech>

Other members have spoken about the need for a general education programme in schools on world religions, belief systems and philosophy.  Such a programme would be very worthwhile.  I also feel very strongly that we need to provide a moral and ethical education for all children in all State-funded schools, an ethical education based on civic morality.  The State is remiss in outsourcing responsibility to provide an education based on civic morality to different religious groupings.  There is an onus on the Government and the Minister for Education and Skills to ensure proper instruction on moral and civic matters and I would like to see it developed, as it is long overdue.  However, the Minister is proposing to continue is a situation where increasing numbers of children are being separated from their peers in the classroom.  That is not good practice.  He is also talking about a situation where in many cases children are being removed from the classroom and sent to another room or the principal's office to fill in time while their peers are receiving religious instruction.  That is not acceptable.  He is talking about a situation where children are being excluded from their peer group on a daily basis.  We should not allow that to happen in State-funded schools.  The provision of religious instruction or faith formation should be discrete.  Ideally, lessons should be held outside school hours or, at the very least, iat the end of the school day in order that parents would have the option of taking their children home.</p> <p>  The Minister did not respond to my proposal in amendment No. 181.  It relates to the rule book covering this issue.  It is Rule 69 in the rule book of 1965 about which I am particularly concerned.  For the benefit of members, it is important to point out what that rule provides for.  It states the religious denomination of each pupil must be entered in the school register and the roll book.  I do not know why that should be the case in a State-funded school.  Why is it the religion of a child or his or her parents anyone's business?  Why should it be kept on the register and in the roll book?  Rule 69 goes on to state "this information should be ascertained from the parent (the father, if possible)".  I do not know why that should be the case.  I am referring to the 1965 rule book, but we are saying it is the father, or the guardian of the pupil, where necessary, who should be asked to state the child's religion.  The reference to "the father, if possible" indicates how archaic the rule is and the need to change it.  It was drafted at a time when the diversity now evident in Ireland was not envisaged.  It is utterly out of date and needs to be removed.  </p> <p>  The section allows for religious instruction to be given during the school day.  I propose that the teaching of religion be taken out of the school day and that we move in agreement to make that change in the amendment.  What the amendment states is that "religious instruction shall take place as a discrete lesson at the end of the school day and shall not take place at any other time during the school day, nor shall it imbue or permeate education at any other time during the school day.  This provision exists to afford equal respect and dignity to all pupils, regardless of religion, ethnicity or family background and to uphold their constitutional rights under Articles 44.2.3 and 44.2.4.  Further, this provision exists to give effect to subsections (2) and (3)".  My belief is that, as parliamentarians, we, the Minister especially, in his role, should be taking steps to ensure we afford equal respect and dignity to all pupils, irrespective of their background.  If the Minister allows the current situation to continue, he is patently not doing so and disrespecting those children who are being removed from their peer group every day.  In the eyes of most people, that is not acceptable practice.  It is both discriminatory and divisive and unacceptable in this day and age.  I appeal strongly to the Minister to at least consider amendment No. 181.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.156" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2017062800002#F00400"><p>Children are sensitive and vulnerable.  Making them feel different by pulling them out of a class is tantamount to abuse.  There is no other way to put it.  If a child is taken out and treated differently from the rest, separated from his or her peers and put wherever else, without guidelines being provided as to how that should be done, it is a form of abuse.  Without guidelines, it is left open to being even worse.  I hope and believe most of the staff and principals in schools are very decent and compassionate to all children.  If we are honest, however, when a particular ethos is at play and prioritised and this behaviour is considered acceptable, it can be the case that the child who does not fit in is looked down on, frowned upon or seen as lesser.  The system is open to that potential possibility which no doubt has manifested itself in children who have opted out being singled out.  Whatever way one cuts it, I cannot see how it is not totally unfair to sensitive, vulnerable young children and how it will not have a significant effect on them.  Anyone who has children knows how sensitive they are.  They ask questions about obvious contradictions and conflicts in the treatment of one person or thing against another.  It hits children really hard in how they look at and feel about the world and their place in it.  It is just wrong.  I again note, to quote from the survey of these matters commissioned by EQUATE, that 71% of parents agree that we should introduce a subject in school on all religions and ethical systems, while 18% neither agree nor disagree and only 12% disagree.  Only 12% believe we should hold on to the idea that a particular ethos should prevail and that, as a consequence, those who do not subscribe to it should be separated.  Most see the sense in it.  We know that a majority in the country have some religious views.</p><p>People with religious views understand that this has to change.  Any fair and reasonable person would say that is the case.  Let us not be behind the curve of where people in Irish society are at now and the intelligence and sensitivity they are displaying, instead of upholding what is the fundamentally and unfair and potentially abusive treatment of children who are the minority and are stigmatised, isolated and separated in this way.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that for most teachers, parents and students, singling one child or a number of children out for removal from a general classroom at particular times of the day is not appropriate.  While that it may not affect many children, there is no doubt that children very often feel that kind of separation very deeply.  It marks them out as being the other.</p> <p>  In Dublin West, as well as in many areas of Dublin Bay North, most of our schools have between 30 and 40 different nationalities.  Some schools have up to 80 different nationalities.  It is almost certainly the case that within that cohort there are wide variations of religious beliefs, ethnic backgrounds and parents who have come from different parts of the world.  The population statistics in the last census are very striking.  I am not sure whether the Minister has taken that into account in the Bill.</p> <p>  Some 30% of the population in Dublin West were not born in Ireland and-or their parents were not born in Ireland.  For different reasons, different groups of people from different countries and backgrounds have settled in small towns around the country.  The statistics show that Ireland has changed utterly over the past 25 years in terms of the diversity of its population.  It is very bad educational practice to pick some children out and tell them to go to the back of a room, the principal's office or elsewhere.  Children are being segregated from the group.</p> <p>  There is a very strong precedence for this in Irish education, as the Minister will know if he has read any of the works by various people on the history of education and its relationship to institutions.  Around Ireland, there was a widespread practice whereby children from institutions, such as a local orphanage, were made to sit in a group in a special place in the classroom so that they were marked off from the other children.  That is part of our legacy from a hidden Ireland.  People were in no doubt that those children were to be regarded as different socially and, in some cases, to be effectively shunned.  I am not suggesting that is the intention of the Minister, but he is following in the tradition of enormous insensitivity to children's experiences.  </p> <p>  There is an emerging consensus.  A distinguished educationalist, Professor Kathleen Lynch, has written extensively about this issue.  For the past 30 or 40 years, she has been an adviser to Educate Together and has set out the curriculum around ethical, humanist and social values and understanding the world of the family, neighbourhood, town, country, region, world and the great religions of the world.</p> <p>  A lot of work has been done in the area.  In fairness to many of the major faiths, their religious curricula also reflect a wider appreciation that we live in a diverse and globalised world and, therefore, different religions are globalised.  The numbers may vary from place to place.  The Minister needs to think this through and not go for a convenient and tidy solution.  He also needs to bear in mind that young teachers coming to work in places like Dublin West are keen to be positive and make every child welcome.  Boards of management are the same.  It may take time, but we need to recognise what has happened and what parents want.</p> <p>  I frequently meet parents, as I am sure the Minister does, who are very distressed if their child is picked out and sent elsewhere.  The Minister might say that if the parents knew a child was going to particular school that was of one or another denomination, what should they expect?  They expect their precious child to be treated as equal to everybody else.  That may surprise the Minister and people in the Department of Education and Skills, but the world has changed. </p> <p>  As I said, there are very distinguished people in the world of education who have written extensively about this issue.  We have a lot of documentation on teachers' experiences and their unhappiness with being forced to segregate children on particular occasions.  School principals go to enormous lengths to try to mitigate the negative impact of these differences.</p> <p>  I strongly suggest to the Minister that he rethink the proposal and offer his support.  The language of the recent Fine Gael leadership contest suggested a strong respect for diversity.  That is not evident in the Bill.  It is very narrow and obscurantist.  It harks back to an older Ireland. </p> <p>  We need to bear in mind that we have a significant population of young children in areas of growth.  There is enormous diversity, which is confirmed by the census figures.  That has been the case since about 2000 when very large numbers of new people came to live in Ireland within a relatively short period of time, and they now comprise a significant proportion of our population.</p></speech>

There should be minimum standards in regard to the nature of the exemption for students.  It is not fair on students who are being excluded, whether they are being put to the back of the classroom or sent to a library.  It is not fair on the students and teachers in the class who want to study religion because teachers are being asked to manage classes and teach religion, along with dealing with seven others who are not doing the subject.  That leads to discipline issues.</p> <p>  Students coming into schools in September will see from the timetable that religion is scheduled for 2.40 p.m. on a Tuesday, but a student who does not do religion will ask what he or she should do, and his or her tutor will not know because the school has no idea what is happening.  If those not studying religion are not included in the timetable provisions, will a teacher be available to supervise those students who are not sitting at the back of a classroom?  Are those students unsupervised, which is wrong?  Are they with an SNA, which is not fair on him or her? </p> <p>  It is a domino effect.  I ask the Minister to set down minimum guidelines to at least ensure that those who are not studying religion are doing something of educational benefit during the time involved.</p><p>We have to consider the children in the class who are willingly doing religion and ensure their learning experience is not impacted.  With everything that is happening in society, particularly in the past year and a half, we should be promoting an inclusive approach.  Instead, we have those who do religion and those who do not in the same classroom.  That is wrong on many levels.  I appeal to the Minister to put in place minimum standards to ensure that every child gets the best value out of their education.</p></speech>

I am not supportive of amendment No. 2.  However, there is no question that arguments can be made for it.  My worry is that the ethos of the school becomes affected.  I do not know how we distinguish between religious instruction, faith formation and the ethos of a school because they are intertwined in some ways.</p> <p>  Deputy Martin's amendment No. 56, which is grouped with this one, is reasonable and it would be very helpful if the Minister were able to reflect on it.  I would be inclined to support it.</p> <p>  I agree we have to protect the rights of those who do not wish to attend religious instruction.  My own children do not attend a Catholic school.  Religious instruction takes place after school hours and seems to work quite well.  It is entirely voluntarily, both on the part of the children and the teachers who do it.  They work extra hours, but they are under no obligation to do so.  They have no agreement with the school to do so, but they do it.  As it happens, there is quite a large take-up, but that is a matter of individual choice.</p> <p>  This is something that works in practice.  I would be reluctant to rush it through in this legislation.  Catholic schools are entitled to be Catholic schools.  That is a statement it is necessary to make.  We either have faith schools or we do not have faith schools and if we want to go down the road of abolishing them, that is not a road I want to go down.  I worry that amendment No. 2, in terms of putting religious instruction in faith schools into law, has the potential to effectively remove the ethos.  From my reading of it, there would be no religious issue at all during the school day, for example, First Communion or whatever, or no talk of it.  It would be kept completely separate.  I am not sure that is reasonable for a faith school and it is a decision we will have to make.</p> <p>  If we are to take this debate to its logical conclusions, we should say that we will fund a State system and not have faith schools.  I am sure that is Deputy Boyd Barrett's objective, and he is entitled to it.  It works very well in the United States where there is no difficulty with it.  Catholic schools work side by side and charitable donations allow poor children to attend those schools, so it seems to work reasonably well.  On the other hand, if we say we will be like the United Kingdom and other countries and allow faith schools, they have to be allowed to be faith schools.</p> <p>  This is a much bigger debate than simply the wording of amendment No. 2.  Deputy Martin's amendment is reasonable in terms of making some kind of regulation.  However, personally I am not aware of all these stories of how children feel, and I have not seen the evidence of that.  I am sure there are many examples, but I have not seen them and it is certainly something I would like to see before we start making decisions about it.</p></speech>

There is a need for guidelines.  Class size is a huge issue for teachers and if children are opting out, some guidelines have to be put in place.  I call on the Minister to try to address that issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.163" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2017062800002#H00400"><p>I absolutely recognise change.  The census is very clear.  The proportion of Catholics is down six points from 84% in 2011 to 78% in 2016.  The proportion of those with no religion is up from 6% to 10%.  Among parents between 20 and 40 who have children going to school, the non-religious proportion is 60% higher than that 10%.  We are talking about one in five or even more across the country who are of no religion or non-Christian religions.  I recognise that we need to change in the face of that and I want to see more diverse schools being opened.  I want to see the transfer of patronage from existing Catholic schools to other patrons, but I believe also that it is good that parents want to send their children to schools of their own faith.  That is something parents are entitled to want and I respect and value schools of different ethos.  The strength of our system is that we have schools of different ethos.  Deputy Boyd Barrett does not believe that there should be a different characteristic spirit and ethos in our schools.</p> <p>  To be fair, my experience is that schools of all denominations strive to be open and inclusive.  As Deputy Burton said, many of them have children from many different religions and countries and they work hard to be inclusive and open for them.  That is my experience generally.</p> <p>  There is a constitutional obligation that these schools must respect the right of parents to withdraw their children.  We are providing that this must be stated openly as to the arrangements they will put in place to provide that for the children who want to opt out.  I support that and want to see that evolve through the parents and children's charter, and that we would see that improve over time.  Good practice guidelines have been developed by both groups of both denominational schools and otherwise.  The question is whether we start imposing regulations and saying it must be this or that.  We then get down to the practical issues.  For example, what provision has been made in one-room schools?  Are we providing that they must have a separate place and so on?  The difficulty I have with regulations is that every school is different.  There are 4,000 different schools and to come up with a one size fits all system that is fair and reasonable to the different situations in which schools find themselves would be an extraordinarily difficult proposal.</p> <p>  I recognise Deputy Byrne's point, and he has an amendment to the effect that these arrangements should not be unduly onerous, which is correct.  There should be a test of reasonableness for schools as to how they provide, but if we come along with regulations and tell schools these are the regulations they must have there is a risk that many schools would say they need the Minister to provide them with extra rooms, for which I do not have the budgets.  Practical issues arise.</p> <p>  Developing a system where we change and evolve, putting pressures on the system and testing its reasonableness in the system such as the right to go to an Ombudsman if one is unhappy with the way this provision is being made is the way we evolve from a system which has enormous strengths.  Every day, I go into schools, many of which are denominational, and they do not fit into what some Deputies are portraying as the way in which children from other denominations are treated within them.  They are treated with dignity and huge respect for their diversity.  That is the dominant approach of schools that are denominational.  I am not saying it is perfect in every instance.  That is why I believe there should be a charter and a right of appeal to have that tested.  However, to go down the road Deputies seem to favour of a legislative framework being imposed on 4,000 schools of a different ethos and many approaches does not fit with the evolutionary change we need to see to respond to the greater diversity of the population coming to our schools.  It risks portraying many denominational schools in a very black light that does not reflect the reality.  Many parents of other denominations choose denominational schools because they value the ethos they believe they will find in those schools, even though they are not of their own denomination.  That is the reality.</p> <p>  I am trying to evolve with what I fully recognise is a changing situation.  I will ask my Department to examine this rule 69 which, to be honest, I knew nothing about.  My notes inform me that rule 68 was removed.</p><p>I am happy to have that identified with a view to removing it, as from what the Deputy  has said it does not sound appropriate.  What I am trying to do is respond across the frontier of our education system to the changing environment but I do not want to impose impractical obligations on schools that makes it more difficult for them to do the outstanding work that is being done in most cases.  The communities around the schools have a commitment to their school.  My approach is to try to strike a balance.  I think our approach is evolutionary; it is not to impose a model that we have decided on.   I do not think that is fair to those who have invested their time and effort into creating outstanding institutions across the country.  However, we must create the pressure for change and articulate obligations, such as what we are introducing in the Bill, so that we continue that progress.</p><p> While I will not accept this group of amendments, I will reflect on the points made by Deputies Thomas Byrne and Catherine Martin.  My instinct is that setting up regulations is difficult when one has to accommodate 4,000 different situations.  I would like to see a test of the reasonableness of the efforts so that schools are continually trying to improve the way they accommodate people.  That is the approach that the famous American Disabilities Act took.  It did not require immediate action but it operated in the expectation that people would evolve over time.  That is the approach that can be embedded in a parents and students charter and can be tested as it evolves over time.</p></speech>

There is nothing onerous or complex about moving religious instruction to the end of the school day.  That facilitates children at many levels.  There has been many arguments put forward today on reasons of fairness and respect for children who may not share the religious beliefs of the patron of the school they are attending and many reasons why it makes practical sense to do what is proposed in the three amendments, which is to move religious instruction to the last class of the day.  That makes sense.  We have given the Minister the reasons but he has not given us any reason as to why he should not do that.  For that reason I am pressing the amendment.</p></speech>

I think one has to bear in mind that some schools have already worked out the particular practices that suit the student and parent body.  It would be a very positive to allow students to take religious instruction in the first half hour and the children who do not wish to join the religious instruction classes could skip that class.  It takes the burden off the teachers and the school principal.  For instance in many multidenominational schools the practice in regard to preparation for Holy Communion, as Deputy Thomas Byrne referenced, is to arrange for the instruction in preparation for the Holy Communion class after the school day has been completed.  By and large that has been working very well.  I can understand that Deputy Byrne states that he is not aware of any of these instances but I am making the case that in parts of Ireland, particularly in the north and west side of Dublin, the level of diversity is unlike the experience in any other part of the country.  I accept the point that Deputy Byrne made.  Of course the parents, who are parishioners in the local parish, value their local school and they also do that in areas that are diverse, but the level of diversity must be dealt with in a fair and reasonable way.</p></speech>

<p>This group of amendments involve the replacement of section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to make the entire appeals process fit for purpose and less cumbersome for parents.  It is based on the experience of the Department, which has dealt with more than 5,000 appeals and these are improvements that will make the system work better for both parents and schools.  There is a number of amendments.  An amendment removes a section that never was activated, it was a class of cases that could be brought by appeal, which has never been used.  It was a general power for the Minister to add new categories to which section 29 should be applied.  We have been advised by the Attorney General that it should be removed and we think it is better to deal with this through a students' charter rather than adding to provisions in section 29.  </p><p>The second set of amendments is to distinguish between two separate types of appeals.  One are appeals where a school is not over-subscribed, and where an appeal against expulsion, suspension or refusal occurs in such a situation, there will be an oral hearing.  The appeals will be dealt with fully <i>de novo</i>, so the appeals committee will come to its own conclusion, having examined and considered the evidence and materials available to it.  We are providing for a fast track for this process as it does not have to go to the board of management of the school first.  We are providing for a preliminary decision and the opportunity to appeal before it is confirmed.</p><p>This is trying to deal with the situation in a different way.  It is different from the second category, so we are distinguishing between under-subscribed and over-subscribed schools.  In an over-subscribed school, where there is a refusal to admit a pupil, the appeals will be on the record.  That means the appeal committee will rely on the same evidence and materials as were available to be relied upon by the board of management when it made its decision to refuse admission.In that case we will require that the board has reviewed the refusal first before it can go to the appeal, unlike the case of a non over-subscribed school.  It is only if the grounds offered in the appeal would materially affect the decision that the appeal will be heard.  There is additional hoops to ensure that the appeal process is not being used unnecessarily.  A third element of the group of amendments is that the new section 29 removes the requirement for parents of students in an Education and Training Board's schools to appeal in the first instance to an ETB committee, before taking a section 29 appeal.  That was in the old legislation, but it is a loop that is unnecessary and is being removed.</p><p>There are some other elements.  The new section 29 includes a number of provisions to improve the day-to-day operation of the process.  These include removing the requirement for an inspector to be on every appeals committee and setting out the number of days of suspension before an appeal can be made.  The number of days of suspension is being set at 20 days.  This has been agreed with parents' groups and is based on practice that has evolved.  We are removing the current mandatory requirement for appeals to be heard within 30 days from date of receipt and instead we are providing that procedures set out the timeframes for making and determining appeals and for providing notification of the outcome of any such appeals and that different periods can be provided for different categories of appeal.  Again, the intention is that none would go beyond 30 days but it would allow for different periods of time and that they would be set by regulation.</p><p> There is a provision that an appeals committee may refuse to determine an appeal in certain circumstances.  One is if it is vexatious, frivolous or an abuse of process while another is where the appeals committee has attempted to have a facilitation, there have been attempts to facilitate parties or subsequent steps have been taken by the parties and, in particular circumstances, the committee feels the appeal should not be considered further, that is, where there has been an effort to try to find a solution, that has been exhausted and there is no point in a further appeal and it cannot be proceeded with.  If an appeal has not been made within the timeframe determined, for example, and if it is late, it can be refused.</p><p> There is a provision whereby the appeals committee can rule that a child must be admitted but it is not within its remit to recommend a change in the admissions policy of the school.  However, it can comment on the lack of clarity of the school's admission policy.  Section 29 is not trying the admissions policy of the school itself.  The admissions policy must comply with this Bill.</p><p> The other significant element here is the introduction of compellability so that where an appeal has been allowed, the school must admit the student, readmit the student or adjust the ranking of the student on the waiting list.  Those are the sort of provisions that are being set out in this amending section.</p></speech>

The amendments in different circumstances allow the Minister to require schools either individually or collectively to apply positive discrimination in the admissions policies for groups that have specific difficulty in finding a school place.

Amendment No. 83 involves our catchment area proposals.  In respect of what I am going to do with regard to catchment areas, I have had no time to examine the Minister's proposal on the so-called baptism barrier in any detail.  I am prepared for the time being to not proceed with my catchment area proposal in this legislation until we study the Minister's proposal fully.  I should very clearly say that the catchment area proposal is Fianna F&aacute;il's preferred approach and we are not entirely convinced of the Minister's reasons for not doing it but I am willing to look at what the Minister is proposing and to examine it.  I think it will require the committee to examine it with stakeholders as well because it is not a proposal that has received examination so far.  The fact that I am not pursuing my catchment area proposals today does not mean that they are not Fianna F&aacute;il policy.  It certainly is Fianna F&aacute;il policy and one we want to pursue.</p></speech>

Basically, what we are providing for here is that every school must have in its admission policy a statement that relates back to the equality legislation so that it has to provide that it will not discriminate on grounds of gender, civil status, family status, sexual orientation and so on.  That includes the Traveller community grounding of a student.  It provides that the school must have a statement that states that it does not discriminate on the grounds of someone being a Traveller.  There is nothing in the Bill that stops a school giving priority to the Traveller community.  Therefore, it is our view that the Deputy's amendment is not necessary.  A school is perfectly entitled to give priority to a Traveller if that is what the school chooses to do.  There is nothing in the Bill that stops that.</p> <p>  In the case of homelessness, it is slightly different in that homelessness is not a category in the equality legislation at the moment, but again there is nothing to stop a school providing in this area.  The equality legislation does not contain any ground relating to the housing status of a person.  However, amendment No. 12 appears to require a school to state that it does not discriminate under equality legislation on that ground.  Having regard to amendment No. 83, I do not think the amendment as worded is necessarily what the Deputy is trying to achieve.  With regard to providing for regulations that set out that schools be required to prioritise children from homeless families, I am not aware of any calls for such an approach but I can confirm that I am willing to look at this matter.  If it is clear that such an approach is needed, I will consider it.</p></speech>

This means that special schools or classes will not be required to admit students who do not have the category or categories of special education need for which the school caters.  Essentially, these are to allow a school that has, for example, a special ASD unit to not admit a child who is not on the ASD spectrum to that class.</p></speech>

It will not be deemed to be in breach of the legislation if a school refuses a child who does not fit into the school's special need category.  If a school has a class for six children with special education needs and there is a child seeking access who does not have a special education need, the school can say that it is not taking on the child in its special education need class because that has been reserved for children who require it.  Otherwise, we would find ourselves in a situation in which, if a school had half-full special education provision, a child with no need would be put into that class because the school could not say that it was not making that place available to the child.  It is to allow the school to refuse in those circumstances.  Of course, were any such refusal unreasonable, it could be appealed under section 29.  If a child had a special need and was being unreasonably refused, the parents could appeal.  This amendment prevents children that could go into an ordinary class from saying that the special education school must give the child that place.  I think it is a reasonable provision.</p></speech>

I wonder if category of need is defined.  It struck us when we read it.  We have had representations asking us to table amendments similar to this.  We took a look at them and thought that we could not propose them.  They looked to us like something one would not want to propose.  On that basis, this amendment does not look something I want to support either.  Yes, in the case of a school for the deaf, that is what it does and we need to allow for that.  However, I would not like to see certain people on certain parts of the autism spectrum being unable to go to a particular school because they are too hard to deal with.  There are many such examples.</p></speech>

What we are trying to do is provide for a situation in which, if a special school or special class has been provided for and is seeking to cater to a particular type of need, the admission statement of the school shall include a statement that the school may refuse to admit a student who does not have the specified category of special education need concerned.</p><p>The purpose of this measure is to allow the Department to make special provision for certain categories.  If we believe that the autism spectrum disorder, ASD, category has a particular need or that a different type of special class should be provided - we make provision for in that not all special classes are ASD units - we can have that differential type of provision in order that we can tailor our intervention to the individual needs of the child.  All we were trying to provide for here is that if we have made such a tailored provision, it is reasonable to reserve those places for the children who have that need.  Otherwise, it would be very difficult for us to plan the spectrum of provision for different types of special need.</p></speech>

I find the Minister's statement quite confusing because at primary level in a large primary school we are talking about two special units of six pupils in each class.  By and large, there is a significant over-subscription by parents of qualifying children for those classes.  I am not sure what the Minister is trying to achieve here.  This is a process which has been ongoing.  I am talking about very large schools  that in total comprise 750,000 pupils at primary level and the number would be a little more at secondary level.  Again, I am referring to the experience in Dublin West which may not be the experience in the rest of the country where schools may be much smaller.  What is the Minister trying to tell us?  We are trying to mainstream children with disabilities into the special units where that is appropriate given whatever level of support they may need, but what the Minister has said does not sound great.  What is it that he is proposing to do?  Is Tusla going to make the decision or is the school-----</p></speech>

Parents deserve clarity as to how the students who will be successful in applying for these quite scarce places will be selected, particularly for children who are on the autism spectrum, which in many schools is the majority of the children who end up in the special class units.</p></speech>

First, did the Minister say it is not only the autism units?  Second, if a special needs class was dealing with three specific needs, would that lead to a school deciding, for example, that a child who has all those needs but also has, for example, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, and an emotion behaviour disorder, would not be suitable in terms of the needs provided for in the class and, therefore, the school will not take in the pupil?</p></speech>

A special class is defined in the legislation.  A special class means a class that has been established by a school, with the approval of the Minister, to provide an education exclusively for students with a specified category or categories of special educational need.  The admissions policy of the school must state that it has special classes and it is specified what they provide for, and there is an admissions process.  If we did not have these provisions, the default position of the Act would be that any mainstream child making an application could insist that they be admitted with respect to these special provisions.</p> <p>  The purpose of this measure is to protect the special provision for children who have special needs.  That is not to say that if we set up a unit, a school can discriminate and say it does not want to take in a child with this special need or that other special need.  It is to protect those special provisions from being occupied at the insistence by a child with just mainstream needs.  It is solely to protect the provision for the purposes for which it was intended and that is made clear by the school in its admissions policy.  This has been requested by the special needs bodies.  They are seeking to protect the integrity of their provision for the children who have such needs.</p></speech>

Some of the soft barriers are erected in schools by the professions who are advising the Minister, but not by all of them.  A huge number of them do outstanding work.  The soft barriers are not imposed by me.  I certainly do not want to impose them by legislation and they are not directly imposed by the Minister either.  If we are allowing categories now to be preferred, surely that legislates for soft barriers.  I am open to be convinced that I am wrong, but I am not convinced of that at the moment.</p></speech>

The Minister defines the special unit.  When a special unit is created it is created for a certain category of need.  It is equipped to meet the needs of those children.  It is staffed with people with the experience to deliver to those particular children.  If it is a deaf unit, it will have different categories of staff and all the rest of it.  All this measure is doing is protecting the integrity of the provision that is being made, namely, that it will be for children who meet those categories.  This is not designed to find a way of denying access.  It is to protect the provision of those places for children for whom it is the appropriate setting.  In view of the concern, I will ask for a note to provide that assurance but I am assured by my officials that is the purpose of this measure.  That is the way it has been drafted.  It has been done specifically at the request of groups who want to see that the special provision is provided to the appropriate children.</p></speech>

When I became Minister for Social Protection in 2011, I found in regard to applications for the domiciliary care allowance where children were on the spectrum but particularly where children had  behavioural disorders, that they had not been provided for in terms of accessing the allowance.  We had to completely overhaul the system, close it down for a period and create a new system.  That resulted automatically each year in an extra couple of thousand children and families accessing it.</p> <p>  My recollection is that the Department of Education and Skills traditionally does not particularly recognise behavioural disorders.  The test on the social protection side is broadly does the child require care and attention that is very different from the norm.  Also, in that case, quite a number of parents, if they are parenting full-time, would go on to qualify for carer's allowance, but in terms of the school provisions, the approach of the Department of Education and Skills, from my experience, is far more restrictive.  Does this measure cater for children who have been accepted in terms of the domiciliary care allowance?  It may well be that they will be accepted into mainstream classes in the school because, for instance, they have a physical disability which can be addressed and catered for within the mainstream.</p><p>What I am specifically interested in is the child with severe behavioural disorders.  In my experience, the Department of Education and Skills will not always recognise the issue.  While it has moved a long way in recognising spectrum disorders such as autism and asperger's syndrome, I am not sure the same applies in the case of behavioural disorders.  I would like the Minister to enlighten us on that point.</p></speech>

Over 60% of children with special needs are accommodated in mainstream classes.  In terms of policy, the NCSE advises on what is the most appropriate setting for them.  As I said, almost two thirds of children with special needs are in mainstream classes which are deemed to be the most appropriate settings.  Where it is established that the needs of a child are such that a special unit is required, that provision is made.  We have doubled the number of places in that regard in the space of five years.  There are now 1,200 special units in schools and the level of provision is growing rapidly on foot of NCSE identifying a need.</p> <p>  As indicated by Deputy Thomas Byrne and others, the Department now has the power to compel a school, after a process, to provide a special unit where it is deemed by the NCSE to be necessary for children in the area.  The NCSE, not the Department, advises on the best accommodation for a child, with or without a domiciliary care allowance.  What we are seeking to do, in the context of the amendment, is to ensure that if special provision is made, it will be used for the purpose for which it is intended.  The Deputies have raised the legitimate concern that a child presenting with additional complications could be refused on this ground.  I will withdraw the amendment and ask my officials to re-examine the provision with a view to reintroducing the amendment on Report Stage when I will have a satisfactory explanation for the Deputies.</p></speech>

It is the case that all legislation is open to all sorts of interpretation.  It is not possible to frame legislation that would address all possible bizarre interpretations, but the Minister must have concrete evidence of the experience of parents in trying to get children with mainstream needs into special units such that he was prompted to introduce the amendment?  I do not see the point of it unless it is a phenomenon.  Is it?</p></speech>

On the refusal of admission to children who do not have special needs, as specified, how is the matter to be determined?  For example, will it be determined on the basis of a diagnosis?  When I questioned the Minister on the resource allocation, his response was that there was a move away from diagnosis.  How does this fit in with the resource allocation model?</p></speech>

Taken literally, this means that a school cannot discriminate based on the disability, or lack of, of a child presenting.  The default position, if the amendment is not made, is that if a school has a special class reserved for children with particular needs, it cannot protect the places for children with these needs.  That would be a very strange provision.  Essentially, a school protecting a special education place for a child with special educational needs would be acting in a discriminatory manner.  I do not think any one of us would want to see that position being provided for in legislation.  I am not saying it is a phenomenon.  We are providing that the admissions statement must set out these principles.  In terms of what it might mean, it is a possible unintended consequence.  Following on from the concerns expressed by schools providing special classes, the decision was taken to correct the position by way of amendment.  We need to ensure there is reasonable protection where special provision is made for the purposes intended.  There is no ulterior motive involved.  People have raised a concern that a child presenting who is on the spectrum provided for and has a lot of other needs might be denied a place on the basis that some of them are not included in the list.  That is not the intention and I will ask my officials to ensure the matter is addressed on Report Stage.  In the meantime I can provide a note for Deputies to provide the necessary assurance.</p></speech>

It would have to establish it was essential to retain the ethos and it is not an option where a school just decides it does not want a child of a particular religion.

How do we define what is maintaining the ethos of a school, or how does a school make the case it is necessary to discriminate to protect the ethos of the school?  It is not clear to me whether it is clear in the legislation.  I do not think it is from reading it.  If a school is undersubscribed it is clearly and explicitly prohibited from discriminating.  A school could say in a particular year that it has only ten Catholics because there are a lot of Muslem people and non-religious people so to maintain the proportion, as it would see it, of Catholic students it would start refusing people even though the school is not oversubscribed.  It seems this would be allowed because the section does not explicitly state that if a school is not fully subscribed section 61(2)(b) does not apply.  The Bill does not say that.</p></speech>

Where a school is undersubscribed this reasoning has no place.  The ethos of a school is already protected elsewhere, in the Education Act.  The Catholic Primary Schools Management Association, CPMSA, made the case first that there are very few cases of oversubscription where the baptism barrier comes in, but there are examples of it in my constituency.  Even it would state there are no cases where a school is undersubscribed that somebody should be refused on the basis of religion.  I do not see how anybody would support that as long, of course, as the ethos is protected, which I understand it is anyway.  I do not think the ethos is protected by keeping the number of students low so they do not pollute it in some way.  That strikes me as completely unnecessary.</p></speech>

We tabled amendment No. 23 which, surprisingly to me and I may get an explanation later from the officials, has been ruled out of order.  We reference catchment in the amendment because it is the essential point.  The point about all of this discussion is if in the catchment area there is very large demand for places and there is a school of religious denomination, of course that school of religious denomination is entitled to serve the ethos of its religionists in so far as it is required to maintain the ethos of the school.  This is set out in the Constitution.  However, this does not mean the school can have such a wide catchment area that the children living across the road from the school can be denied a place while children from very far and wide are accepted for a place.  This is what the baptism barrier is about and it is the point the Minister is seeking to duck.  It is a balance between preserving and ensuring the ethos of a school and allowing children in a locality, who may not be of that ethos, to access the school in reasonable numbers without preventing the school from preserving its ethos.  Both of these are addressed in the Constitution.  This is what the Labour Party legislation, which the Minister decided to deep-freeze for a year, set out to achieve.  I do not understand, given all of the various amendments which have been accepted, why amendment No. 23 has been ruled out of order.  The Minister's section does not mention catchment.  Without catchment it is ridiculous, because catchment is what it is about.  This is absurd.</p></speech>

I saw in it some way of tackling the baptism barrier.  The amendment states: "In page 6, line 13, after &ldquo;school&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;not aided by the Department of Education and Skills&rdquo;.  I am of the opinion that this would mean schools which are State-funded could not then discriminate.  Is the Minister suggesting this would only apply to the private schools?  To clarify, we are talking about schools not aided by the Department of Education and Skills.  If we are that specific, we can then tackle the baptism barrier to some extent.</p></speech>

Until we amend and come back here with amendments to the equal status legislation, and I have indicated it is my intention to provide amendments, that equal status legislation exists and this Bill is just reflecting what it provides, namely, if a school refuses to admit a student who is not of that denomination, the school must prove that its refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school.  If that is tested, it would be heard by the Workplace Relations Commission because it now deals with equality cases.  That is the existing provision that goes back to the 2000 Act.</p> <p>  We have all indicated there is an eagerness in this committee to change that and I have indicated I will be coming back with proposed changes.  However, until that occurs, this legislation obviously has to reflect the equal status provisions, and that is what it is doing here, and it is not doing any more than that.  I fully recognise that we need to revisit the Equal Status Act but I believe we need to do so in a way that is constitutionally robust.  We need to bring forward proposals that have been approved by the Attorney General and that respect the constitutional right of the religious to organise their affairs and so on.  What we are providing for in section 62, which is what Deputy Byrne raised, is simply the existing provision.  That is the provision as it now prevails.</p></speech>

It precisely addresses the issue.  Let us be honest.  If we are all concerned about the baptism barrier, let us talk about how it operates.  It operates in the context of catchments.  What we are trying to do is provide a balance which provides, as the Constitution requires, for the ethos of the school but which does not mean that children who are not of that ethos in the area can have no access to that school because children in a wider area can jump over them in the queue.  That is what the baptism barrier is.</p></speech>

Setting aside amendment No. 15, which I will come to in a moment, the legislation is not clear in its execution of its own intent.  That is the very specific point I am making.  That is what we are dealing with.  The Minister stated that the legislation would not allow for discrimination on religious grounds where there was not oversubscription.  I do not believe there should be any discrimination and I will come onto that point shortly.  However, even if that is the Minister's intent, the legislation does not make it clear.  It leaves the door open for discrimination in cases where there is not oversubscription because it does not spell it out clearly.  I think the drafters need to look at it because it leaves this open.</p> <p>  On amendment No. 15, which I did not realise we had moved on to, this is where I disagree with Deputy Burton.  The Labour Party approach to this is a fudge between allowing some discrimination to continue but minimising it somewhat with the issue of catchment.  However, there is the problem of how to define a catchment.  As Deputy Burton rightly pointed out, one can expand the concept of catchment to anywhere so how is catchment to be defined?  It is problematic to define it in any sort of meaningful or legal way.  Therefore, I think the only way to deal with the issue is to delete the offending discrimination which is contained in section 61(2)(b), which echoes the wording of the infamous section 7(3)(c).</p> <p>  It is worth stating the irrationality of the wording of section 61(2)(b), which reads: "a statement that the school does not discriminate in relation to the admission of students where it admits persons of a particular religious denomination in preference to others or it refuses to admit".  What the legislation is saying is that it is not discrimination to discriminate.  It is just bonkers.  It is so Irish, it is unbelievable.  It is not discrimination to prefer one group over another on a religious basis.  That is the definition of discrimination.  Nowhere else could do this, except some sort of tin-pot dictatorship.  It is Orwellian wording - freedom is slavery; war is peace; discrimination is not discrimination.  That is what we are proposing to put into law.</p><p>That is what we are proposing to put in law.  It is already in the Equal Status Act and now we are going to repeat it in the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016, which purports to be reforming the problems in equal admission to school but is actually restating an Orwellian form of discrimination and trying to claim it is not discrimination or is somehow acceptable.  It is totally wrong.<br/><br/>I restate that it is unnecessary to do this, never mind that it is actually wrong to do this to children of all people.  I have made that point already, but who is the Minister doing this for?  I presume he has read the survey of Equate, which is campaigning on this issue.  The survey, which was done scientifically by a proper surveying organisation, shows that 71% or an overwhelming majority of parents, whether religious, non-religious or of minority religions, state the law should be changed so that baptism can no longer be a requirement for school admission in State-funded schools.  Another 12% state that they do not care.  Only 16% want to retain the <i>status quo</i>that the Minister is retaining.  In this legislation, the Minister is pandering to 16% over the vast majority.  Why is he doing this?  I do not understand it.<br/><br/>The Minister has continued to refer to constitutional issues.  I really want to get to the bottom of this, and I should have asked earlier, but at one point the Taoiseach and the Minister claimed the Government had legal advice about the constitutional difficulties involved in removing this discriminatory element of the law.  I have asked repeatedly if we can see the legal advice the Government received, but we have never seen it.  I do not believe the Minister has legal advice.  That was spoof from the Taoiseach.  In my opinion, it was &quot;the man with two pints&quot; talk.  We have heard it only as a spurious justification for maintaining an utterly discriminatory law directed disgracefully against children.  Could the Minister answer that point?  How can he justify it?  Why does he feel the need to do it when he is pandering to a tiny minority of the population?  Where is the famous legal advice about the constitutional problem that might be involved in removing this discrimination from the legislation?</p></speech>

There is a desire by the committee to consider changes to the Equal Status Act and we indicated that we will revert to that issue.  If we make changes to the Equal Status Act, there will have to be consequential changes to this Bill.  I fully recognise that point.  Some of these provisions, which are taken entirely from that Act, will have to be repealed or changed, in particular, this provision in relation to section 7(3)(c).</p> <p>  Changing this here, however, does not change the Equal Status Act one whit.  That will remain on the Statute Book.  The only way in which we can amend it is by making provisions in respect of that Act and we will have to do that on a fresh occasion in a fresh debate.  All of the issues the Deputies are raising can be considered at that stage.</p> <p>  Deputy Catherine Martin's amendment is trying, by the back door, to change the Equal Status Act by confining this exception to private schools or whatever schools, but the same-----</p></speech>

Whatever changes we make here do not change the Equal Status Act.  Under the Equal Status Act, one has the right, if challenged, to go to the WRC and to prove that a refusal he or she has made is essential to maintain the ethos of the school.  I understand that has not been tested and schools have not been using this ground of refusal as a way of keeping non-co-religionists out.  There has not been a case of this brought to the WRC and it is an unused section.  However, until it is changed, we have to respect it and our provision on education admission policy has to respect the existing provisions of the Equal Status Act.  Obviously, if we come back and change that, there will be consequential changes through this legislation, but that is the debate for another occasion.</p></speech>

An amendment which provides that such schools do not discriminate within the meaning of the Equal Status Act is not appropriate.  There is no provision in that Act and any amendment that proposes to amend the definition of discrimination within that Act would have to be made within the Act itself.  The difficulty with the school making a statement that it is not discrimination would not change the parent Act.  The parent Act does not deal with language as a grounds for discrimination.  Under this Bill, Irish medium schools are not prohibited from prioritising children from Irish-speaking homes.  None of the amendments I am bringing forward today will prohibit schools from doing so.</p> <p>  I am aware, however, that there are concerns that some provisions in the Bill could have a bearing on the manner or mechanism by which a school would ascertain that a student is from an Irish-speaking home.  Some schools, for example, meet or undertake an assessment of the student, in some cases the parents or in some cases both students and parents to ascertain whether Irish is in fact the language spoken at home.  In the context of this Bill, such an approach raises a number of issues.  The overall reach and approach of this Bill is to prohibit priority based on the academic ability, skill or aptitude of the student or parent.  It is consistent with long-standing education policy that the academic capacity, aptitude or skills of a child or his or her parents should never have a bearing on whether a child is admitted to a school.  It is for that reason that entrance tests were explicitly banned back in 1993 by the then Minister for Education, Niamh Bhreathnach.</p> <p>  I assure the committee that the Government and I wish to support and promote the Irish language and Irish medium schools as far as possible.  I am, therefore, open to supporting such schools to prioritise children from Irish-speaking homes, where the schools are oversubscribed.  There are, however, complexities involved with ensuring that any mechanism through which they do so is fair and does not serve to exclude children of lesser academic ability or those with special educational needs.  Such a mechanism must also take due account of the general desirability that public policy and law should ensure that no child is excluded from a school based on his or her family or socioeconomic background.</p> <p>  Furthermore, both policy and legal questions arise in defining what an Irish-speaking home is.  Does it apply where one parent is a fluent speaker but the other parent is not?  Does Irish have to be the exclusive language of the house?  Are bilingual families covered?  How can that be provided for in law?  These are complex issues, both legally and in terms of policy.  Nonetheless, I can assure the committee that I intend to reflect further on how the objective can be achieved in a fair, inclusive and transparent manner so as to ensure that I can bring forward an appropriate amendment which takes full account of these issues and has been legally proofed by the Attorney General.  Subject to such considerations and to legal advice, I intend to do so on Report Stage.  I am not disposed to accepting these amendments at this point.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 25 broadens this to provisions of the Education Act and any regulations made under the same.  The Bill does not currently specify how often a drafted admissions policy should be prepared.  It could be interpreted that this be required every year.  However, that is not the intention.  Amendment No. 26 clarifies that the draft admissions policy should be prepared by the board not later than three months after the commencement of the relevant subsection or where a board proposes making any amendments to its admissions policy.  This means that when a board proposes to make any amendments to its admissions policy it must carry out the consultation process as specified in section 62 (1) of the Bill.</p></speech>

This amendment also includes a reference to the admission policy of a school, providing that it shall admit each student seeking admission to a special class in the school, other than in the case of the circumstances set out in section 62(6)(c).  The amendment also reflects more accurately the language used in section 23(4) of the Education (Welfare) Act which provides that a parent is only required to confirm his or her acceptance of the code of behaviour when requested to do so by the principal of the school.</p><p>Amendment No. 44 provides that the admission policy section of the Bill contains a list of the prohibited oversubscription selection criteria and any exemption from same.  The following are the prohibited oversubscription selection criteria: a student's prior attendance at a preschool, with exemptions for early intervention and early start preschools; the payment of fees or contributions; a student's academic ability, skills or aptitude, except for the admission of students to a special school or special class where it is necessary in order to ascertain whether the student has the category of special educational needs for which the special school or special class has been established to cater; the occupation, financial status, academic ability, skills or aptitude of a student's parents; and a requirement that a student, or his or her parents, attend an interview, open day or other meeting as a condition of admission, other than in the case of admission to the residential element of a boarding school or to a course known as a post-leaving certificate course.  The Bill is silent on a limitation on the power of a school to determine a priority for children of past pupils where it is oversubscribed either by setting a percentage or otherwise.  It was previously considered that this matter could be dealt with in regulations but, following legal advice, it is clear the matter needs to be dealt with in primary legislation.</p><p>The amendment provides that a school may not provide priority based on a student's connection to it by virtue of a member of his or her family attending or h0aving previously attended the school, except where a sibling of the student is attending or has attended the school, or where a parent or grandparent of the student concerned has previously attended the school, provided the maximum number of places filled pursuant to the latter criterion does not exceed 25% of the available places as set out in the school's annual admission notice for the school year concerned.</p><p>The amendment also provides that a school may not provide priority based on the date on which an application for admission was received by the school, subject to the application being received at any time during the period specified for receiving applications set out in the annual admission notice of the school for the school year concerned or, where appropriate, at any time during the period as otherwise determined by the school in accordance with the Bill or regulations made under it.  An exemption from this provision is given where, prior to the coming into operation of the subsection, the school had confirmed in writing to the person who had made an application or expression of interest that the name of the child in respect of whom the application or expression of interest had been made had been placed on a list maintained by the school for the purpose of allocating school places in the year concerned.  This exemption ceases to apply five years after commencement of the subsection.</p><p>The amendment also provides that a school shall compile a waiting list of students whose applications for the intake group were unsuccessful following application of the oversubscription selection criteria and this list shall remain valid for the intake year.  Students will be placed on the list in accordance with the order of priority assigned to their applications after the school has applied its selection criteria and it must offer further school places that become available for and during the school year to those students on the waiting list, in accordance with the order of priority in which they had been placed on the list.</p><p>The amendment also seeks to address somewhat the concerns raised by a number of the education partners about the practice of parents applying to multiple schools.  It provides that, in accepting an offer of admission, an applicant shall indicate if he or she has accepted an offer of admission from another school or schools or if the applicant is awaiting the outcome of the admission process in another school or schools.  If so, he or she shall provide details of the offer or offers or the school or schools concerned.  An offer of admission may not be made or may be withdrawn where the applicant does not comply with this provision.</p><p>The amendment amends the existing wording in the Bill which provides that an admission policy shall provide details of the school's policy on its arrangements for students who do not wish to attend religious instruction.  This provision has been amended to provide that an admission policy shall provide details of the school's arrangements for any student where the parent of that student or, in the case of a student who has reached the age of 18 years, the student himself or herself has requested that he or she attend the school without attending religious instruction.</p><p>Amendment No. 59 is a consequential amendment required to change the reference to the subparagraphs in section 62 which now run from (a) to (q).</p></speech>

Most schools do not give such priority but some do.  The effect of giving such priority, particularly in periods of high demand when it outstrips capacity, is that it can be and is given to children from outside the local area and can be at the expense of local children.  I had direct experience of this in the past in my constituency.  I wish to be clear that the amendment does not suggest there be a prohibition on children of staff members enrolling in a school in which their parents are teaching.  I was a member of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills in the previous D&aacute;il when former Deputy Joanna Tuffy was Chairman.  We prepared a report ahead of the intention of the then Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, to introduce what the Minister is dealing with today.  A recommendation was included in the report that the Minister consider it.  It was Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's proposed Bill at that stage.  I ask the Minister to consider accepting the amendment.</p></speech>

As the Deputy explained, the amendment would prohibit schools from prioritising the children of staff or board members.  I believe it is a reasonable position that an oversubscribed school may give priority to children of staff members, where it so wishes.  For example, from the perspective of facilitating those families, it is sensible that a teacher who works in a school distant from his or her home can have his or her children attend the school rather than having to make arrangements for them to attend elsewhere.  I have not come across this as a widely prevalent practice.  If it has been used, it does not appear to be having a big impact on admissions policy, but, obviously, the Deputy has evidence to the contrary.</p><p>If the Deputy has evidence to the contrary and he gives me the details of that I will consider the issue and come back on Report Stage to see if it would be appropriate to deal with it.  The Deputy is trying to balance the reasonable expectation of teachers or other staff members who are contributing to that school community that they might get some priority over the concern of those living locally.  I will consider it.  The Deputy might give me the details of the experience he had and I will consider whether that is prevalent or something that should be provided for in these circumstances.</p></speech>

If, say, the factory worker in the factory adjacent to the same school is travelling long distances to his or her place of work, it might be advantageous for him or her to say, "I would like to have my child in this local school to my employment".  It is not reasonable that it is a perk for teachers only, but I will respond to what the Minister has asked me.  I do not intend to press the amendment because I would like him to give some consideration to it.  It has been a problem in the past and it has the potential to be a problem in the future.  The idea that children from outside an area could come into an area and get priority over local children is not something that would be acceptable to me.  I have spoken to many principals and they have said they would not have that and that they would never do it but in so far as some schools do it, I ask that it would be something that is not acceptable.</p></speech>

As we discussed earlier, many schools are in very different positions.  There may be something in this space and I would be willing to come back and consider this on Report Stage.  What we ought to be trying to do is not be prescriptive.  We should not set regulations and say, &quot;That is it&quot;.  As Deputy Martin suggested, we should try to encourage a process of change through the parents and teachers charter, the requirement to state their policies and so on.  There may be something in this space that we could do, and I would be happy to revert on that.</p><p>Amendment No. 46 is probably already encompassed by what we are doing.</p><p>There was a question on the reason for the 25% criteria.  It was an attempt to try to strike a reasonable ground.  A view was expressed that priority should not be given to children of past pupils on the grounds that everyone should be equal.  On the other hand, it seems that continuity within the school and having the sort of association that grows up with various community activities that are built around the school and that parents are involved in and were involved in when they were students in the school, is favourable.  There is a reasonable sense of continuity that we ought to promote, namely, that that school community is a reasonable concept.  It was to try to identify a reasonable level at which this could be set that would be fair to both arguments and strike a reasonable balance so that we would set a ceiling.<b></b>Prior to this there was no ceiling.  This measure is introducing a ceiling where there was none previously and trying to set it at a level that would be reasonable.  There is no science involved in it particularly, but is an effort to set something that is a reasonable balance of the two views of the world.</p></speech>

There does not seem to be any objective research on this.  As the Minister said, he is trying to strike a fair bargain between different views rather than coming up with evidence-based policy.  It is not an issue of which I have direct experience from my constituents in certain areas.  Is it as big a problem as is being made out?  Has the Minister done the research that shows that this requires action and that it requires a cap of 25% or any cap?  Can he justify it based on empirical evidence?</p> <p>  I seek clarification on the waiting list and the grandfather clause.  I presume that means that one would go back five years from the passing of the Bill.  Is that right?</p></speech>

I do not know what the justification for that is.  I heard him say that continuity is important and that we ought to protect the continuity.  We can replace the word "continuity" with the word "elitism", and that is essentially what this is about - that elitism ought to be protected.  I am horrified at the Minister proposing that 25% of places would be reserved.  There is no justification whatsoever for that.  This can only perpetuate inequality in education.</p> <p>  Our education system is very much a two-tier system and many of us would be of the view that there is a need to change the way in which the private school system is funded - that it is about maintaining elitism.  The idea of reserving 25% of places for sons, daughters, grandsons and granddaughters of people who have attended a school is nonsense.  There cannot be any justification for that.  It directly discriminates against people who, for example, have recently moved into the area.  It directly discriminates against people who come here from abroad.  It very much discriminates against, for example, people whose parents did not go to secondary school.  I cannot understand how the Minister can possibly stand over a discriminatory arrangement like this that is about protecting elitism within the education system.</p><p>As there is absolutely no justification for it, I really appeal to the Minister to rethink this proposal.</p></speech>

Will it encourage schools which do not have a quota to have one?  Is there a way this could be stopped?  The practice has gone on forever and I see no good reason to stop it, but neither do I see any good reason to start it.  This issue may have been missed.  If a ceiling of 25% is included in the legislation, it might end up becoming mandatory.  It is an issue for certain schools that already follow the practice, but I certainly would not like to see it starting in other schools.</p></speech>

One can understand the very practical case for having two siblings attend the same school to make transport relatively easy and in order that parents do not have to endure the extreme trial of having to bring children to two schools at the same time of the morning which might be physically impossible in some cases, but that is totally different from retaining a 25% quota within a school for pupils whose parents or grandparents happened to go to it.  There is no practical, logistical imperative in that regard.  The measure is about maintaining some intergenerational family clique within a school.  I imagine the practice is restricted almost entirely to fairly elite private schools.</p></speech>

I totally understand the case to be made for having siblings attend the same school in rural or urban areas.  I understand the difficulty even more in rural areas.  Having to bring children to two villages or towns could be a real hassle.  It is not necessary, however, for somebody in a rural or an urban area to go to the same school as his or her father, grandfather or grandmother.  Why is that necessary?  Why would one allow discrimination on that basis?  If somebody can make a case for it, I will be interested in hearing it, but I do not really see how one could possibly justify it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.466" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1242" speakername="Catherine Martin" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2017062800002#Y02000"><p>I referred to subsection (9)(b), which deals with the 25% quota.  Deputy Tom Neville is referring to subsection (9)(a) which refers to siblings.  I have absolutely no problem with it because it makes sense for siblings to be able to attend the same school, if only in managing a household, but I do have an issue with the 25% quota.  I am still not convinced that it is evidence-based and believe it has been plucked from the air.  Why stop at a parent and grandparent?  Why not include a great-grandparent also?  There could be circumstances in which the grandchild of someone who attended a school, who may be travelling 15 miles across the city to attend school, could have a greater right to attend it than a child who is living beside it.  That one in four pupils could have this right just because he or she happens to be the grandson or granddaughter of a past pupil is bizarre, wrong and unfair.  The measure is not about equality and equal access.  Of course, I can see the argument about siblings and do not have an issue with it.  The quota of 25% is way too high.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.467" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2017062800002#Y02100"><p>This is imposing a restriction where there was none before.  It is actually reducing the extent to which schools can engage in the practice.  They did not face a restriction before.  The empirical evidence is that the higher ceilings have applied in schools in which it is the custom and practice.  This measure is restricting some schools in giving priority to the children of past pupils.  It is trying to introduce a ceiling.</p> <p>  On the question of why any child should be allowed, the argument is based on the fact that many schools have a tradition whereby past pupils want to send their children to them.  They may have played for the same GAA club or have associations with the parish which they may want to keep for one reason or another.  Schools have facilitated family continuity in terms of being part of the school community.  They often draw members of boards of management and so on from these very involved families.  The provision is trying to strike a balance.  School communities are complex networks and many schools draw their support from past pupils.  It is very understandable they would try to maintain a connection with past pupils.  This is a way by which that connection has been maintained.  It is reasonable to argue that there should be a limit set on the extent to which what I describe would become a practice.  That is why I believe this is a reasonable solution.  Bearing in mind Deputy Thomas Byrne's concern that schools that never followed the practice might introduce it, I will consider the issue and revert to him on Report Stage.  Some continuity is reasonable and in accordance with existing practice in many schools.  The proposal involves a reasonable restriction on the practice.  As I stated, I will consider before Report Stage whether additional changes should be made to this provision.</p></speech>

Different dates may be set out for the admission of students with special educational needs and to the residential element of boarding schools.</p><p>This amendment will provide greater clarity and transparency for both applicants and schools.

It is all right for us to regulate what schools are allowed to do but it is incumbent on the Government to make sure they are funded properly and are able to do their business without recourse to parents.  It should be front and centre of the legislative process.  If we are going to stop schools doing one thing, we need to make sure the Government steps in, which it has failed to do in the past and has forced schools down other routes.</p></speech>

The approach to the Bill is to provide for the option of regulating where it is necessary and proportionate.  This is in line with the principle of subsidiarity whereby decision-making is with the board and patron as far as possible.  A fundamental feature of our school system is that the governance and management of a school is within the control of the board of management.  As a general approach, this Bill seeks to maintain and support this position and to only interfere with the board&rsquo;s authority to determine and manage the admission of pupils to its school where this is necessary.  While regulations will undoubtedly be put in place for some aspects of admission and over time the aspects that require regulation may change, it is not necessarily the case that the Minister should regulate on all matters set out in this section.  I am also cognisant of the need to ensure that regulations would not make the admission process overly complex or burdensome for either parents or schools.  It is important to note that this section requires the Minister to consult with the various stakeholders specified before regulating.  If the Minister was required to regulate in the manner suggested, then he or she may not be in a position to properly respond to the views expressed through that consultation particularly where there is a clear consensus that a particular aspect of admission does not require any regulatory intervention.  Accordingly, it is preferable that this section gives the Minister flexibility to regulate when and where it is necessary to do so and on those specific matters or issues on which regulation is at any given time required.  This is the more appropriate approach.</p></speech>

It would be very useful where I live in east Meath and also in towns like Ashbourne, where parents could choose from a number of schools, all of which have different lists.  While there is probably more co-operation now than there used to be, schools often do not know where they stand with students if students are on multiple lists.</p><p>There is a case for the Minister to do as the amendment proposes and establish a jointly co-ordinated and operated admissions process in order that, at the very least, schools know how many children are in the area.  We have had problems in east Meath and in Ashbourne and Balbriggan over the years where there were not school places for children, while other areas may be overestimating the number of children.  This should be considered.  I understand the Minister is looking at it and I am glad of that.  I would be interested to hear what he has to say.</p></speech>

I will move an amendment today to this section which will allow schools, for the purposes of facilitating the efficient admission of students, to share information with each other in respect of applications received, offers made and offers accepted.  We earlier dealt with an amendment requiring a parent to provide that information to the school.  I am satisfied that the existing provision in the Bill, which will be strengthened by my amendment enabling information sharing, would allow a Minister to direct schools to co-ordinate their processes in the manner proposed by the Deputy.  I therefore consider that the amendment is unnecessary.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 89 provides that a board may share information about applications for admission with another board or patron.  Boards may share a list of students in respect of whom an application for admission has been received and an offer of admission has been made or accepted.  Such a list may include a student&rsquo;s personal details, including the student&rsquo;s name, address, date of birth and public service number.  The introduction of this provision seeks to address the practice of parents making applications or accepting offers for multiple schools and should make the enrolment process more effective and efficient for both schools and applicants.</p></speech>

Why is the personal public service number required for sharing?  Is that absolutely necessary?  People are fairly protective of their PPS numbers.  Is it really necessary for schools to have that on this type of local admissions process?</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 98 and 110 provide that the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, and the Child and Family Agency shall have regard to the admissions policy of schools in the locality when making a designation.  Amendment No. 94 provides that the NCSE should also have regard to the availability of places in schools in the locality when making a designation.  This is a matter to which the Child and Family Agency already have regard.</p><p>Amendment No. 118 also removes the reference to designation being cancelled where a school has proved that the refusal to admit the child is essential to maintain the ethos of the school as provided for by section 7(3)(<i>c) </i>of the Equal Status Act.  This amendment is necessary as a designation appeals committee would not be suitably qualified to make this determination and this provision is straying into the remit of relevant equality legislation legal process.</p><p>Amendment No. 104 is a minor wording amendment which replaces the reference in the Bill to &quot;where the child has not been admitted to any school&quot; with &quot;where the child has no school place.&quot;</p><p>Amendments Nos. 142 and 144 provide that the Minister, in addition to consulting with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, the NCSE and the Child and Family Agency as provided for in the Bill, shall consult with bodies representative of patrons, national associations of parents, recognised school management organisations and trade unions, and staff associations representing teachers, when setting out procedures to be followed by an appeals committee.  Amendment No. 144 clarifies that such procedures shall be determined as opposed to being set out by way of regulation.</p><p>A small number of minor typographical amendments are required, such as amendments Nos. 92 and 105, removing the reference to a school admitting a child &quot;as a student&quot;.  The wording &quot;as a student&quot; is not required as its use in this context is not compatible with the definition of student in the Bill.</p><p>Amendment No. 149 defines child as including a person in respect of whom an application for admission to a school has not been made.  This takes account of situations where a parent may not have made an application for admission to a school.  Amendments Nos. 91, 95, 97, 99, 109 and 111 are consequential numbering amendments.</p></speech>

It sets down the procedure to be followed by the NCSE or the Child and Family Agency for designating a special needs child to a school.  Included in this is an appeals process where the school may appeal against this decision.</p> <p>  The Bill has only two grounds where a school may successfully appeal such a decision.  These are where the NCSE or the Child and Family Agency fail to follow correct procedures or where the child's religion is not compatible with that of the religious ethos of the school concerned.  The school can prove that it needs to refuse admission on the basis of maintaining that ethos.  The amendment I have put forward would remove the second ground for appeal.</p> <p>  The Minister proposes to amend the Bill to delete this second ground.  Amendment No. 110 would, however, have the same effect as it sets down that the agency, in making a decision to designate, must have regard to the admissions policies of schools in the locality.  This would appear to be a backdoor way of doing the same thing and allowing that discrimination on the grounds of religion.  If that is the case, that makes for poor law.  It is unacceptable because it would favour religious ethos over the rights of that special needs child.  This should have no place in our legislation and it is very hard to defend on any grounds.</p> <p>  In the case of children with special needs, we are all too familiar with the difficulties they have in accessing schools and with schools not being prepared to make provision for them to the extent that they should.  The idea that a child who is already disadvantaged due to special needs could be further disadvantaged by being refused on the grounds of religious ethos is an act of double discrimination.  I am open to correction on this but that is my interpretation of what is proposed in amendment No. 110.  If this is indeed the case, then I find it unacceptable.</p></speech>

It would state that the NCSE should have regard to the ability of the school to make all reasonable efforts to accommodate the child, rather as it currently stands, that is, to have regard to the ability of the school to accommodate the child.</p></speech>

We feel the council must have regard to the school that is in the best interests of the child to attend.  I have no problem with that in principle.</p> <p>  With regard to amendment No. 100, tabled by Deputy Martin, the Bill already provides the council must have regard to the school's ability to accommodate the child.  The amendment proposed would reword this to refer to the school's ability to make all reasonable efforts to accommodate the child.  I consider the current wording, referring simply to the school's ability, is adequate and takes account of the fact this will depend on the school in question.  Inserting the proposed wording might cause confusion about this provision and potentially dilute its meaning.</p> <p>  I wish to point out, with regard to amendments Nos. 113 and 124, that the Bill applies to recognised schools only.  It does not apply to schools that are not funded or recognised by the Minister for Education and Skills.  Such a non-recognised school should not, therefore, be designated under this section.  Accordingly, amendments proposing that these particular provisions of the Bill be confined to schools that are not aided by the Department, in other words, non-recognised schools, do not make sense in the context of a Bill that does not apply to non-recognised schools.  I therefore do not accept the amendment.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 115 and 126 relate to a parental appeal, and it must be pointed out that the designation powers in the section are targeted at very specific situations.  They are aimed at children who have no school place at all, including where their parents have tried and failed across many schools to secure a school place for their child.  These provisions are not about ensuring parents in those circumstances get their preferred school or school of first choice.  The provisions give the council or the agency, as applicable, a power of last resort which can be used after a child has been refused access to many schools.  These provisions are not about creating new places in schools that are already full, nor are they about ensuring that the preferred school of choice is designated.  Where a school is designated for a child, the school is required to admit that child.  There is no corresponding compulsion on the parent to avail of the place in the designated school.  The parent may yet decide to pursue other applications or appeals under section 29.  It is, however, appropriate that there would be an appeal process for the designated school as the school is being compelled to admit the child.  A school could be designated, even where it has already lawfully refused the child and an appeal decision under section 29 has upheld that decision.  Therefore, it is reasonable that a school would have a final opportunity to appeal when such a significant interference in its affairs is in question.  It should be noted that an appeal will only be upheld where the appeals committee is satisfied that the agency or council, as applicable, has not complied with the requirements of this section or where the school has established that the decision of the agency or council is unreasonable.</p> <p>  Under this section, parents can appeal where the agency or council has failed or refused to make a designation.  It must also be noted that the agency or council under the Bill must have regard to the wishes of the parents and the school that, in the view of the agency or council, is in the best interests of the child concerned.  However, I do not consider that there should be an appeal on whether the school that has been designated is the preferred school for the parents.  For these reasons I do not accept the amendment.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 121 to 123, inclusive, all propose to delete the provision allowing a designation to be cancelled where a school has proved that the refusal to admit the child is essential to maintain the ethos of the school as provided for by section 7(3)(c) of the Equal Status Act.  I have provided for this provision to be removed as already outlined.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 147 defines "all reasonable efforts" by a parent and I do not consider that such an amendment is appropriate.  It will be a matter for the agency, council or appeals committee concerned to determine whether a parent has made such efforts.  The agency or council must itself also have regard to the interests of the child and the availability of places locally.</p> <p>  Deputy Shortall raised the question about the amendment which inserted the words, "must have regard to the admissions policy".  This is to look at issues such as the gender of the school and that a requirement would not be imposed on, for example, an all-girls school.  The overriding situation is that the best interests of the child is what will be served but this is a factor the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, would bear in mind.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.655" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1222" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2017062800002#HH00400"><p>If the best interests of the child applied we would not have discrimination on religious grounds.  It is not any consolation this might be the case.  The Minister has already spelled out he has deleted the grounds on which places can be refused relating to section 7(3)(c).  My point is that having deleted this, the Minister's amendment seeking to reference the admissions policy of schools in the locality will restore that provision because the admissions policy of the schools in the locality allows them to discriminate on religious grounds.  It is often very hard for children with special needs to get into mainstream schools, particularly their local mainstream school.  In a situation where the parents were not able to locate or source a school and the council or the Child and Family Agency designates a school as being suitable and states it is the school suitable for the child who has special needs, the idea the school could then appeal this on the grounds of religion, and that a child with special needs not subscribing to the same religious beliefs would undermine the ethos of the school, seems shocking.  Many schools are very good at welcoming children with special needs, but some schools go out of their way to not take children with special needs.  This provides grounds for refusing a place to a special needs child where a school has already been designated as the most suitable school for the child but a child with special needs will then be expected to jump another hurdle.  Acceptance of the amendment, whereby the admissions policy of schools in the locality would apply, means if a school has a policy of refusal on the grounds of religion then a special needs child can be refused on the grounds of religion.  While on the one hand the Minister has removed those grounds, on the other hand he is replacing them with the general provision of the admissions policy of schools in the locality.</p></speech>

It amends a section where, in making a designation under subsection (3), the agency will have regard to a certain number of aspects, including the wishes of the child's parents, where appropriate, in accordance with the age and maturity of the child concerned; the wishes of the child; and the availability of places in the locality and the school that in the agency's view would be in the best interests of the child.  We will add to that the admissions policy.  The purpose of this is not the purpose the Deputy considers, which is to bring in religion as a basis for refusal.  The purpose is to look at issues such as special schools.</p><p>The admissions policy for special schools will set out the schools for which it is appropriate, so that in looking at the placement of a child with special needs, they will look at the admissions policies around special needs categories and gender and issues such as that.  This is something they will take into account.  It is not binding on the agency obviously, as it considers these issues.  This is in no way providing that the agency will say that religion is the overwhelming issue and it will not consider a school for that reason.  It is just one factor in a list that will be considered, and the intended purpose is not to introduce some baptism barrier, as the Deputy suggested.  As we discussed earlier, the Equal Status Act is an issue to which we intend to return and that is not being dealt with in this Bill.  The intention of amendment No. 110 is not that ascribed to it by the Deputy.</p></speech>

It could well be interpreted in that way.  It is providing local schools' admissions policies as a grounds for appeal.  The Minister does not say it only relates to gender or special needs.  The admissions policies of schools in the locality covers the right to refuse on the grounds of religion.</p></speech>

It is in the issues which will be considered by the council or the agency.  I will look at the wording of this amendment again because if it can be more precise, then we should make it more precise to ensure it could not be construed in another way.  This is just one of a list of issues where the agency will consider it.  This is not offering a grounds of refusal to a school.  This is an issue that would be looked at.  The intention is that the agency would look at what the school was offering in terms of the facilities and the admission policies that were involved in the various schools in the locality.  It would look across the spectrum.  Religion would be one of the issues it would look at.  In view of Deputy Shortall's concern, which is that, on the face of it, it could be drawn a bit too widely, perhaps we should spell out what elements of the admissions policy should be assessed and I will look afresh at amendment No. 110.

All communications relating to appeals and non-admission of a child should be done through Irish.  It is a basic requirement to communicate in Irish through these schools.

I have huge respect for the language and I try to speak it as often as I can.  These amendments go too far and it will turn people off the language if we start legislating to ensure all work be carried out through Irish.

Deputy Clare Daly will be with us momentarily; she had to go to the D&aacute;il Chamber.  I ask everybody present to please switch off all mobile phones as they interfere with the sound recording system in committee rooms.  Before we commence, I indicate to members that we will go into private session again to discuss a very brief matter at the conclusion of this particular public session.</p> <p>  The purpose of today's meeting is an engagement with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, to discuss the manner in which the Government recently nominated the former Attorney General, Ms M&aacute;ire Whelan, to fill the vacancy on the Court of Appeal.  I welcome the Minister and his officials to the meeting this afternoon, which is the Minister's second with us today.  I record our thanks to him for acceding to our request.  The format of the meeting is that the Minister will be invited to make an opening statement which will be followed by a questions and answers session.  I am obliged in the normal course, but very especially in the circumstances of the matter under address, to caution members they should be aware that under the salient rulings of the Chair, members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House, or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  </p> <p>  Before we begin, I give members a cautionary reminder that the Judiciary is independent under the Constitution and the Oireachtas has always respected the separation of powers.  I request all members, therefore, to be measured in their contributions and to uphold the principle of mutual respect between the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Judiciary.  While this does not preclude debate or raising the matter of the process and manner of a new judge's nomination and appointment, members should not stray into the areas of a judge's personal qualifications or suitability for any given position.  I ask members to refrain from making remarks that reflect on the professionalism or competence of a member of the Judiciary.  I now invite the Minister to make his opening statement whereupon I will give members the opportunity to ask questions.</p></speech>

This very independence is guaranteed by Article 35.2 of the Constitution which provides that judges are to be "independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and subject only to this Constitution and the law".  The appointment of judges to our courts is of fundamental importance to the administration of justice.  We are most fortunate that we have in Ireland a strong, independent, impartial and well respected Judiciary.  The Irish Judiciary has served this country extremely well and, as I stated in the D&aacute;il last Wednesday, it is now and has always been one of the great successes in our history.  Members of the committee will be aware the matter has been discussed in depth over the past two weeks, having been addressed by the Taoiseach during Leaders' Questions on 20 June and 21 June 2017 and during a two-hour debate held in the D&aacute;il on 21 June 2017.  I have nothing new to add to the information provided last week other than to continue to underline what has been said a number of times by the Taoiseach and others about the appointment of Ms Justice M&aacute;ire Whelan to the Court of Appeal that we have appointed a suitable person who was appropriately qualified using procedures that were at all times correct.  That being said, I emphasise that judicial appointments are made, in accordance with Articles 13.9 and 35.1 of the Constitution, by the President acting on the advice of the Government.  This constitutional function cannot be transferred or delegated.  It is a normal feature of Government in common law jurisdictions.</p> <p>  On 5 January 2017, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board sought by public advertisement applications from practising barristers and solicitors eligible for appointment to the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal, High Court, Circuit Court and District Court.  A vacancy for an ordinary judge of the Court of Appeal arose following the retirement of the honourable Mr. Justice Garrett Sheehan on 23 March 2017.  In response to a request from the then Minister for Justice and Equality, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board reported on 16 May 2017 that it was not in a position to recommend a person for appointment to the vacancy in the Court of Appeal.  I remind the committee that section 20 of the 1995 Act provides that all proceedings of the board and all communications to the board are confidential.  From time to time in the past, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board has reported that it is not in a position to recommend any candidates as suitable for appointment as a judge.  The Government, in nominating a person to the President for appointment to judicial office, is not limited constitutionally to the consideration of the outcome of an appointments board process but is obliged under the 1995 Act to first consider the names of any persons recommended by the appointments board, something which did not arise in this instance since there were no such recommendations.  The Minister for Justice and Equality brings a recommendation to Government in the same way that any other Minister would make a recommendation on appointments to important public roles in the area of Government for which they are responsible.</p><p> At its meeting of 13 June 2017 Government decided to nominate the then Attorney General, Ms M&aacute;ire Whelan, Senior Counsel, for appointment as an ordinary judge of the Court of Appeal in accordance with Article 13.9 of the Constitution to advise the President on appointments to judicial office.  The Government acted entirely within its constitutional powers and responsibilities in making this nomination.  I wish to point out that successive Governments have nominated judges since the foundation of the State.  Furthermore, several Attorneys General have been appointed directly to the Bench, as might be expected given their seniority and expertise as the senior law officers in the State.</p><p> On 19 June 2017 Ms Justice M&aacute;ire Whelan was appointed by the President as a judge of the Court of Appeal.  I wish to remind the committee that Government, in making the decisions necessary to nominate people for judicial appointments, is performing a profound function under the Constitution and one which is at all times fundamental to our separation of powers and to the maintenance of independence and public confidence in our Judiciary.  The effectiveness of the performance of this function by successive Governments has been illustrated by the extraordinary quality of the Judiciary and the public respect in which the relevant people and their independence are held.  Indeed it would not be appropriate to comment any further on specific nominations to judicial office, which are decisions made by the Government and subject to Cabinet confidentiality under Article 28.4.3o of the Constitution.  The Government has sole discretion under the Constitution to nominate persons of its choosing, providing they are qualified and eligible for appointment as a judge.  In this case, a suitable person who was appropriately qualified was appointed to fill a judicial vacancy lawfully using a process that was at all times correct.  I have no doubt that Ms Justice Whelan, having regard to her qualifications expertise and extensive experience, will make a valuable contribution to the work of the Court of Appeal.</p><p> Where existing judges of the High Court or any other court put forward expressions of interest in a vacancy to the Attorney General all such submissions are considered and are treated in a confidential manner for obvious and good reasons.  While of course such expressions of interest are always considered, constitutionally, the Government cannot be bound by any such expressions of interest in exercising its prerogative to advise the President on a judicial appointment.  It is in accordance with the law and the Constitution for the Government to nominate a person to the President to be appointed a judge of any court.  This of course includes the Court of Appeal, providing the person is eligible and qualified.  It is also in accordance with the law and the Constitution for the Government to nominate for appointment an eligible and qualified person who is not already a judge, even if there are existing judges who have expressed interest in the appointment.  As stated on several occasions in recent times, the Government is satisfied that all necessary procedures for judicial appointments were followed in the appointment of Ms Justice M&aacute;ire Whelan to the Court of Appeal.  I am satisfied that Ms Justice Whelan will make a valuable contribution to the work of the court.</p><p> I wish to briefly turn to the Government's commitment to significantly enhance the judicial selection model.  The Bill dealing with judicial appointments is winding its way through Second Stage in the House and will come before the committee shortly.  Among other issues, the Bill deals with the matter of the promotion of serving judges, which is currently outside the remit of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  Members of the committee will be aware of the process.  I look forward to engaging extensively with the committee at the earliest opportunity subject to the scheduling of the Bill by the committee.</p><p> I wish to comment on matters germane to the current debate.  An important feature of the new Bill is ensuring that the process for judicial appointments is open, fair, transparent and accountable and that it promotes diversity.  At the same time the protection of the principle of judicial independence remains central.  The Bill will reduce the number of suitable candidates proposed by the commission for each vacancy to three from the stipulated minimum of seven in the current system.  The Bill provides the commission with 13 members.  I figure all members of the committee were in the Chamber last evening and I imagine Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile is, as always, well-briefed on the issues to hand.  More important, as far as the new commission is concerned, merit is provided for in the new legislation as the criterion for selection and recommendation.  Subject to that, the Bill provides for the objectives that the Judiciary should be equally comprised of men and women and that it should reflect diversity across society and within the population.</p><p> I looking forward to hearing the observations of the committee in the coming period and dealing with any outstanding issues that members may believe have not been addressed.  I will do so in accordance with the long-standing principles for debate and discussion of issues under consideration.</p></speech>

I agree with the Minister that it is important for Members of the Oireachtas to respect the separation of powers.  The three organs of government, the Judiciary, the Legislature and the Executive, must respect each other.  Of course there are responsibilities on each of those organs as well to try to hold other organs to account.  The reason we invited the Minister before the committee was because we, as members of the Legislature, want to hold the Executive to account for a decision that was made on 13 June last by the Executive.  Fortunately, we will not be straying anywhere into the judicial arm of government in our questioning, nor should we.</p> <p>  In the time of the Minister in government, how many times has the Government nominated a lawyer to judicial office without that lawyer being recommended by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board?</p></speech>

It has always been the case that the personal privacy of applicants, for obvious professional reasons as well as, dare I say, commercial reasons, is maintained.  I am not going to depart from that practice now.  This approach is essential to the maintenance of the independence of our Judiciary, which is highly valued, not just by me but all members of this committee, in the context of the separation of powers and our democratic institutions under law.</p></speech>

Given the proposed legislation is expected to go some way towards addressing the issue of political interference in how judges are appointed, does the Minister think it is a little ironic that the Government parties in the manner of this appointment before we debated the depoliticisation of judicial appointments made as politicised a decision as one could invent?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.958" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="16:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017062800002#F02300"><p>No, having regard to the fact that Government acted entirely in accordance with the law in the manner in which this appointment was considered. The consideration by the Houses of the commission Bill was agreed in the programme for Government and the Bill is going through the House as we speak.  I do not wish to pre-empt any debate in the committee or in the House.  As Minister, I had the privilege of introducing the Bill last night and I look forward again to discharging my duty during the debate.  I am not in a position to say when and if the Bill will be enacted but I look forward to the full co-operation of committee members.  As I said by way of public comment last week, it is my hope that every Member who has an interest in the issue will have an opportunity to make a contribution during its passage through the House and I will not pre-empt "whens" or "ifs" as far as the matter is concerned.</p></speech>

Given the Minister is prepared to make comment on her suitability and her qualifications, it is fair to ask the following question: is it of concern that the Fennelly commission saw fit to ask her back four times due to contradictions in her evidence and that Mr. Justice Fennelly concluded in the interim report that he did not believe her version of events?  Is the Minister still prepared to stand over his statement?  Did the Minister read the Fennelly report?</p></speech>

I ask him to exercise the greatest care in the construct of his questions.  We have to recognise, and we have to respect, that the former Attorney General is now a member of the Judiciary serving on the Court of Appeal and that the separation between ourselves and the Judiciary is something that we must respect.</p></speech>

I will not comment on what kind of job she will do as judge.</p><p>I will not stray into that, but the Minister raised the issue of her suitability before she became a judge as to whether she was appropriately qualified.  We read the Fennelly report and her role in that is shocking.  I do not even want to go into the Siteserv or the children's referendum aspects.  I am not talking about her role as a judge now.  The Minister raised her suitability and her appropriate qualifications before she was appointed.  Does the Minister have no concerns about the Fennelly report in particular?</p></speech>

That is not the case.  I am going to comment on the suitability of the candidate.  As far as I am concerned, the Attorney General was an entirely suitable candidate.  I refer the Deputy to section 4 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act of 1961, as amended by the 1995 Act, which deals with the question of qualification, eligibility and suitability.  In terms of the decision of the Government to nominate the current Attorney General to office, it is clear that matters such as the significance of her experience as Attorney General and constitutional and legal adviser to Government were important considerations lending considerable weight to the provisions of the 1995 Act.  Further, I refer to the skills and expertise of the Attorney General in providing advices over a number of years, in very difficult and challenging circumstances, to the Government of 2011 to 2017 in terms of the economic, social and political issues it faced.  She provided advice on a diverse range of matters-----</p></speech>

I am trying to avoid the situation because I do believe that we need her.  That is my personal belief.  As Chairman, I have to ask the Minister to hold at that particular point, as in fairness I have already asked Deputy Wallace.  The address today is primarily in regard to the methodology and I ask members to please assist me with that.  I return to Deputy Wallace.</p></speech>

It is pretty much accepted that public trust and confidence in politics in Ireland has been eroded over a number of years.  Would the Minister agree that the manner in which the Government has handled the appointment of M&aacute;ire Whelan to the Court of Appeal has further eroded public trust and confidence in the way we do politics?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.967" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="16:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017062800002#G00600"><p>I will be brief, and I apologise for missing the Minister's opening remarks; I had a question in the Chamber.  I hope I will not ask questions that other members have asked already.  If I do, I can read the Official Report later.  I have a couple of brief questions.  First, we know the Chief Justice and the President of the Court of Appeal wrote to the former Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice and Equality last October asking for the Court of Appeal vacancies to be filled.  They were told at that time that there would be no new appointments until the new legislation and procedures were put in place.  What changed between October of last year and last week that allowed an appointment to be made under the old system in these circumstances, particularly given that the courts were about to go into recess?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.968" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="16:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017062800002#G00700"><p>It was not the old system.  It was the current system, and the system that still obtains.  My understanding is that there was some public comment on the matter of considerable pressures being brought to bear on the court by way of a number of vacancies not being filled.  Although I was not party to any such discussions, I understand that certainly in the public arena a certain anxiety was raised that perhaps some outstanding appointments would be made, and I understand that some of those were duly made.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.969" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="16:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017062800002#G00800"><p>That is the precise point I am making.  I called it the old system.  We can call it the existing system, but it was precisely that system that the Chief Justice was told last October would not be used to implement any new appointments, yet between October and last week, something happened.  I am wondering if the Minister has any knowledge of what that was because the Government, the Cabinet or whoever took a different tack by using this method.</p></speech>

I am wondering what happened in between.</p></speech>

That was the issue around which the subsequent debate took place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.975" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="16:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017062800002#G01400"><p>I am sorry if this question was asked earlier but how many people have been appointed outside a Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, recommendation, apart from existing High Court judges or judges who are outside that process anyway?  How many were appointed outside of the JAAB process in the lifetime of this Government and the previous Government, or even earlier?  I can only ask the Minister to account for this Government's term of office.  Since 2011, how many people have been appointed outside of a JAAB recommendation, apart from current judges who are obviously excluded from that process?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.978" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1269" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="16:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017062800002#G01700"><p>I would make one point of clarification.  The word "other" had not been used in either of the responses to Deputy O'Callaghan or to Deputy Daly.  The Minister's response on each occasion was that one such appointment took place.  I am only pointing out that the Deputy has to listen carefully.</p></speech>

I again refer to the current constitutional prerogative wherein Government makes these decisions in accordance with the law.</p></speech>

In terms of the letter of 16 May in which the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board states it would not make a recommendation, the Minister's answer to the question asked by Deputy Chambers was not clear.  Was the then Attorney General a signatory to the letter or was she involved in any way in that decision?  What role did the she  have in that process?</p></speech>

Under the 1995 Act, the proceedings at the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board are confidential.  This is provided for in the Act and I am not in a position to provide Deputy Daly with the detail of what transpired or was undertaken or discussed or the manner of the discussion at the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, including who was present, who signed the letter, who spoke and who did not speak.  In accordance with the law, I am precluded from discussing this issue.  In addition, I do not have any knowledge of such proceedings.</p></speech>

I am wondering what happened in the period between the letter from the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board going to Cabinet on 16 May and the statement at the meeting of 13 June in which the Government decided to nominate the then Attorney General to the Court of Appeal.  I would like a little more information about how that came about or what steps took place between 16 May and 13 June.  Did the Attorney General turn up at the Cabinet meeting to be informed that the Cabinet intended to nominate her to fill a vacancy?  Was she asked if she would like the job and did she respond that she would be delighted to take the job and thank the Cabinet?  Who initiated the discussion on such a fundamental career change for the then Attorney General?  Did someone ask her whether she would like the job or did she offer herself for the job?  How did it come about that the nomination was made on 13 June?  What steps occurred in the period between 16 May and 13 June?</p></speech>

The Government is entitled to nominate a person of its choosing provided two conditions are met, namely, that the person is eligible and available in accordance with the law and that the person is qualified.  The matter was given appropriate consideration in accordance with the law.  As I stated in response to Deputies' questions, under the strict rules of Cabinet confidentiality, it is not possible for me to enter into any discussion of any form of the detail other than to assure members that the appointment took place fully in accordance with the law.</p></speech>

I am not asking the Minister to divulge what happened at the Cabinet meeting.  He indicated a memorandum arrived at the Cabinet meeting nominating the then Attorney General for the position.  I am trying to find out what happened before that and how the name came to be submitted.  Did the applicant go to the Minister or did the Minister go to the applicant?  Was it a marriage of convenience because the real game in town was to get a new Attorney General to suit a change of leadership in the Fine Gael Party or was it to do with the position?  If I were sitting at a Cabinet meeting and someone nominated me for a new job, I presume I would have been told beforehand that I would be nominated, as otherwise how would anyone know if I was available for the position?  Who contacted whom between 16 May and 13 June?</p></speech>

As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I do not have any knowledge of any issues that may or may not have been discussed between 16 May, when the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board wrote to the T&aacute;naiste noting that the board had decided not to recommend any applicant for the vacancy, and the subsequent act of 13 June.  I was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on 14 June.  I would never be involved in any deliberations on any of these issues, nor would I have any expectation to be involved in such deliberations.</p></speech>

We are left with this gaping hole in that we do not even know how the nomination came about.  It is clear that I will not get an answer to my question.  I do not want to stray into the issue of qualifications but the Minister referred to the person being eminently qualified.  Would the fact that the person in question does not have any experience as a trial judge not be a point of concern?  Does the Minister accept that among the legal profession and Judiciary there was a view that a precedent had been set, albeit relatively recently given that the Court of Appeal is a relatively new court, in that no non-High Court judge had been appointed to a the Court of Appeal previously?  Does he accept, therefore, that there was a presumption among potential applicants that the role would be filled by a High Court judge and that this was a reasonable expectation considering it had always been the case, even if the court is relatively new?  Would that not be a fair assumption to make?  Would this presumption and the particular nature of the job not have stayed the hand of people who would otherwise have been interested in applying for the position?  They will have assumed the only people who would be appointed to the court would be High Court judges.</p></speech>

However, in fairness to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality  I can point to an answer she gave in the House when she was asked if she had discussed the vacancy in the Court of Appeal with the former Attorney General prior to 23 May.  She stated categorically that she did not discuss the vacancy and I accept that statement.</p> <p>  On the matter of forming assumptions, in the circumstances it would be unwise and unfair to the process if I were to make any assumptions about issues that may or may not have happened other than to say once again that practising barristers who are not already members of the Judiciary have been appointed in the past to the superior courts.</p><p>The Government, and I as a member of Government, were concerned about the matter of availability and eligibility to serve and about the question of qualification.  I was satisfied that, in the discharge of my duties and in the circumstances, both of these conditions were adequately met.</p></speech>

I am not going to keep going around in circles but could I have some clarification on a point I may not have heard right?

I know he says that it would be wrong of us to draw any assumptions but does the Minister believe it is credible that somebody would attend a meeting where a nomination was made via a memo and the recipient of the nomination had no prior knowledge of it?  That is not really credible, is it?</p></speech>

I am going to put you forward for this job."  One would know even by the body language of the person and if they had never heard of the nomination before, they would be floored.  Clearly the matter would have to have been discussed beforehand and it would be helpful to know who approached who, but I appreciate that we will not get the answer to that today.</p></speech>

Again, I come back to the constitutional and legal point that the manner in which these appointments are made - under current law and under the current Constitution - is on the advice of Government to the President as to the appointment of a person who is deemed after due consideration to be both qualified and eligible.  This is the key issue here in terms of the decision-making process.  If the law wishes to be changed in that regard, I too am a Member of the Legislature and there are issues that may have to be addressed in the wider arena of a constitutional referendum, but it is something over which I do not have any immediate control.  It may be an issue that this committee, at a future date, might engage in by way of recommendation to Government or Parliament or otherwise.  I am satisfied that I and my Government colleagues act within the current law and that we have acted in a manner which is entirely consistent with the law as is currently stated.</p></speech>

The whole purpose of the grouping is to seek to clarify that the Bill applies to a wider group of disputes rather than only those in which civil proceedings have been issued.  We feel that the use of the word &quot;proceedings&quot; is likely to cause confusion for the public and for the mediators themselves and could give rise to a belief that in order for the protections of the Bill to apply, proceedings will have had to have been issued.  It is to try to clarify some of those points.  I know the Minister has tabled amendment No. 3 to change the definition of proceedings to civil proceedings that may be initiated before a court.  What I am asking the Minister to clarify here is that this amendment means that the Bill applies to any dispute in which there is a potential to litigate, that the proceedings do not have had to have been issued.  Could he clarify that in the context of this amendment and what kinds of disputes he thinks would be excluded from the provision?  Notwithstanding the Minister's amendment, the argument remains that for the avoidance of doubt in the public's mind, a &quot;dispute&quot; is better than &quot;proceedings&quot;.  It heads off any potential confusion.  This is a critically important Bill as far as we are concerned.  We want to encourage people to use mediation as an alternative to court.</p><p>We do not want people thinking it has to go through the courts process.  There are situations in which this could cause irrevocable damage, for example, a dispute between neighbours.  If somebody starts litigation it is very hard to come back from that and go into a mediation process.  We want people to know they can get to mediation before the issue goes to court and that they can have an early intervention to de-escalate things.  In that sense, I think "dispute" is a better word.  I know Deputy Wallace has "dispute" rather than my wording, which is "civil dispute".  I am open to that argument.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the contribution of my predecessor, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Fitzgerald, on this legislation.  I hope we can advance matters today and set a date for future progress also.</p> <p>  Following publication of the Bill and Second Stage discussions, my Department received a number of submissions on scope-related issues.  It was felt by some that section 3 was so structured as to create an impression that the Bill would apply only to civil proceedings and not to disputes which had not reached the stage of proceedings.  That, of course, is not the intention.  My Department has held discussions with the Office of the Attorney General, the Courts Service and mediation groups, including the Mediators' Institute of Ireland, in an effort to find a wording that would ensure the Bill&rsquo;s provisions would apply to disputes in the civil law arena.  I believe we can reach accommodation on the issues raised by Deputy Daly in her amendment.</p> <p>  In amendment No. 3, I propose to replace the definition of proceedings in section 2 in order to remove the reference to section 3 and to make it clear that "proceedings" means "civil proceedings which can be instituted before a court".  Using that phrasing will resolve the issue raised by Deputy Daly.  In amendment No. 5, I propose to delete section 3(1), which specified that the Bill applied to any civil proceedings.  The title of the section will be changed to "Scope" instead of "Application".  In amendment No. 8, I propose to delete the words "any of the following".</p> <p>  The net effect of these amendments is to make it clearer that the Bill will apply to disputes as well as civil proceedings.  I am aware that amendments Nos. 1, 4, 6 and 7, tabled by Deputies Daly and Wallace, are designed to bring about the same effect.  I hope, subject to the agreement of the committee and of the two Deputies, that the amendments I have tabled will address adequately the issues they have raised.</p> <p>  As regards amendment No. 9, the position is that following further discussions with the Office of the Attorney General, it was accepted that the exclusion of proceedings before a tribunal under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts 1921 to 2011, a commission under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, or a committee under the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013, as provided for in section 3(2)(f), does not arise and, in the circumstances, might be removed.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.1034" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1355" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017062800002#B01200"><p>I move amendment No. 2:</p><blockquote>In page 6, line 21, after &ldquo;means a&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;confidential&rdquo;.</blockquote> <p>Confidentiality is a very important aspect of mediation and one of the main reasons for the success of the process.  We note the Mediators' Institute of Ireland was concerned that if the confidential nature of mediation was to be in any way undermined, parties to a dispute would be less likely to use mediation as a process to resolve their dispute.  It is probably necessary to include references to confidentiality in the definition of mediation and also to extend confidentiality to third party participants and oral communications.  It has been recommended by the Mediators' Institute of Ireland, the Law Reform Commission and the Law Society that a reference to confidentiality be included in the statutory definition of mediation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.1035" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017062800002#B01300"><p>This is a must-have amendment for us.  The bedrock of mediation is trust.  That is going to be undermined if confidentiality cannot be guaranteed.  Parties may not be willing to speak openly if there is a risk that some of the material could be used later in potential litigation.  The whole purpose of mediation is to resolve disputes through an open forum.</p> <p>  The Mediators' Institute of Ireland points out that communications between parties made with the intent of settling judicial proceedings have traditionally been protected by the courts and by common law in terms of the "without prejudice" privilege.  Statements contained in a document marked "without prejudice" or made verbally on that basis in a genuine attempt to settle a dispute cannot be used to undermine a person later on.  This process is about trying to avoid litigation.  If the parties are genuinely trying to resolve a dispute, they need that protection.  It is there anyway in court proceedings.  It is important to say that "without prejudice" privilege also has limitations.  The party relying on it must show that the dispute existed at the time of the communication and that legal proceedings had commenced or the communication was in contemplation of litigation.  It is not enough that the communication concerns a matter in dispute for the privilege to be upheld.  There must an indication of settling the dispute in that sense.</p> <p>  There is a well-accepted value to confidentiality in the resolution of disputes and it has to be spelled out in these provisions if we are to woo people away from the courts into an alternative channel.  The Law Society of Ireland, Law Reform Commission and the Mediators' Institute of Ireland all say this is fundamental and I think it has to go into the body of the Bill.</p></speech>

It is very important that mediations remain confidential, not just between the mediator and parties involved but also to any individual who is brought into the mediation process as an expert or whatever.  The whole process must be recognised as being confidential.  We were going to table an amendment to this effect on Report Stage but since Deputies Daly and Wallace have proposed it now, we will be supporting their amendment.</p></speech>

I would draw the attention of Deputies to section 10, which sets out in some detail the confidential nature of the process of mediation.  I do not believe it is strictly necessary to amend the definition in the manner suggested by Deputies Wallace and Daly, but in the spirit of compromise and with due deference to the submissions from Deputies Wallace and Daly, I am willing to accept the amendment.  We will have to adjust the punctuation for the purposes of the readability of the definition, but I am happy to accept the amendment from Deputies Daly and Wallace.</p></speech>

I appreciate the point raised by Deputy Wallace, and indeed the intention behind the amendment, but I really do not see a pressing need for it.  Having regard to section 10 already dealing in detail with the issue of confidentiality, the committee will also note that I have tabled amendment No. 29 for later on, which will further strengthen that section.  It will also serve to clarify that all statements, including oral statements, in any form of mediation, must fully respect the concept of confidentiality.  This will also cover any general explanation of the reasons of the mediator for withdrawing from a mediation.  I accept what Deputy Wallace is saying.  I do not take issue with him, but I believe it is unnecessary for the actual construct of the Bill.  I ask him to accept that and not to press the amendment.  In the context of his reflection, if we complete matters today, I am open to having this issue revisited on Report Stage.  I do not see the necessity.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the submission of the Law Society, thank it for drawing this matter to my attention and ask the committee to agree to the amendment.</p></speech>

The subscribed Code of Practice shall incorporate, in full, the terms of the Code of Practice published by the Minister under <i>section 9</i>of this Act.  The mediator may incorporate additional terms; however, any such terms shall not conflict with the terms of the Code of Practice as published under <i>section 9</i>&rdquo;.</blockquote> <p>The amendment is recommended by the Mediators Institute of Ireland.  It would argue that the Bill, as it is, fails to deal with the regulation of mediators.  Without regulation, anyone can claim to be a mediator, and the mediators to whom the courts refer people should be regulated.  The change will help give people a qualified mediator who subscribes to a specific, not just any, code of practice.  As the Bill stands, the mediator could subscribe to any code of practice he or she devises.  Without such an amendment, there would be no standardisation and the code of practice would be non-binding on mediators.  The Mediators Institute of Ireland and the Law Society have expressed concerns about this.</p></speech>

At present, section 8 holds that &quot;the mediator shall, prior to the commencement of the mediation ... furnish to the parties a copy of any code of practice to which he or she subscribes&quot;.  Therefore, it is proposed that mediators be able basically to write something on the back of a napkin as long as they say it is their code of practice.  My first amendment seeks to place an obligation on the mediators to subscribe to a single code of practice, changing &quot;any&quot; to &quot;the&quot;.</p><p>My second amendment is linked with this in that it provides that all mediators' codes of practice &quot;shall incorporate in full ... the code of practice prepared and published [by the Minister] under <i>section 9</i>&quot;.  During Second Stage debate on the Bill, even Government backbenchers made the point that there is no point in the Minister publishing a code of practice for the conduct of mediators only for mediators not to be obliged to follow it.  It does not make any sense.  In this sense, section 9 is undermined by section 8 in that mediators do not have to sign up to the code of practice and, therefore, all of the good aspirations in section 9(2) about ethical standards being observed and continuing professional development can basically be junked by a mediator who is empowered to design his or her own code if he or she so wishes.  Given that we were discussing in the House last week the regulation of other professional bodies, we need regulation here, and the mediators themselves want it.</p><p>I note that the Law Society said it was very disappointed that proportionate and appropriate regulation of mediators has not been given a statutory basis in this Bill.  Any amendments to do so would probably be outside the scope of the Bill at this stage.  It is particularly against this backdrop that I urge the Minister to accepts these amendments.  My amendment No. 23 is an effort to plug the gap in this regard pending full statutory regulation.  These amendments, if accepted, would at least require mediators to sign up to a code of practice with certain crucial provisions set by the Minister and would require that the code of practice also incorporate training requirements for mediators, a provision that is absent from the Bill at present.  Without this, I believe we are heading into very dangerous territory.  It leaves people seriously exposed to ending up potentially in the hands of rogue operators to be exploited, which we absolutely do not want.  This is important and, as I said, even Government backbenchers made this point during the Second Stage debate.  Amendment No. 15 is linked into this in that it places an obligation on the Minister to prepare and publish or cause to be prepared or published a code of practice for mediators.  At present, it is only an option for the Minister, which is not good enough.  It should be a requirement.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 20, 22, 23 and 25 are another little grouping within this grouping and, again, they seek to tighten things up regarding the code of practice.  At present, the code of practice the Minister may draw up may include provisions concerning continuing professional development, ethical standards to be observed, the determination of costs and fees and so on.  What we seek to do with this amendment is to place an obligation on the Minister to include all of these provisions, but not just these provisions.  It can go broader than them.  The amendment does not limit the Minister to these provisions but it does oblige him to deal with them.</p><p>Amendment No. 23 obliges the Minister to include education and training requirements for mediators in this regard as well.  This grouping, obliging the Minister to put certain things into the code of practice, is very reasonable and I believe it is supported by the profession itself.  Against the backdrop of our trying to professionalise many of these standards, the grouping is more than welcome.  In deference to amendment No. 23, my amendment No. 25 then seeks to remove the item in the list of things to be included in the code of practice regarding procedures to be followed by mediators in the conduct of mediation.  I am seeking to remove this on the assumption that amendment No. 23 will be accepted.  We would be tying the hands of mediators too much if we were to keep that line in the context of the other provisions I mentioned.  We do not want to micromanage what mediators do in primary legislation, and that is not the intention of these amendments, but the option is always there for the Minister to include recommended procedures to be followed.  However, requiring mediators to sign up to procedures that must be followed in primary legislation is too much.  That can be dealt with by statutory regulation.  The aim is to try to overcome some of the shortcomings in the mediators' code of practice.</p></speech>

As regards section 8, I am unable to accept amendment No. 12 in the name of Deputy Wallace and amendments Nos. 13 and 14 in the name of Deputy Daly.  Amendment No. 12 proposes to amend section 8(1)(c) in a manner which would require a mediator to furnish the client with a code of practice which would not only incorporate a code of practice published under section 9 but could also incorporate additional unspecified terms.  While the amendment provides that any such additional terms should not conflict with the content of the code of practice under section 9 it is difficult to see how this could operate in an effective manner in practice.  It would present practical difficulties and so I am unable to support it.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 also seek to amend section 8(1)(c) by substitution of the word &quot;any&quot; with &quot;the&quot;, but that implies that there can be only one code of practice for mediators.  That might present a difficulty.  There may be more than one code of practice for mediators depending, perhaps, on the subject matter of a dispute which might be going to mediation.  For example, amendments 16 to 19, inclusive, to section 9 while mainly technical in nature contains a proposal for the development of a code of practice dealing with the involvement of children in mediation.  I see a potential conflict in what is proposed by Deputy Daly, although I do not believe it is intended.  To amend section 8(1)(c) in the manner proposed would not have the effect sought by Deputy Daly and it could, in fact, be unduly problematic.  </p><p>Amendment No. 14 also seeks to require a mediator to furnish to a client a code of practice which would incorporate a code of practice published under section.  I am unable to accept this amendment for the reasons already outlined in regard to Deputy Wallace's amendment.  </p><p>Amendments Nos. 16 to 19, inclusive, are technical in nature.  They relate to the possibility of there being more than one code of practice for mediators.  This must be acknowledged.  </p><p>Amendment No. 26 proposes the insertion of a new provision allowing a code of practice to contain details of procedures to be followed by mediators in the conduct of a mediation involving consultation by a mediator with a child.  This amendment follows on from a recommendation from the Law Reform Commission in its report on mediation and conciliation regarding the voice of the child.  The commission recommended that where a mediator considers it appropriate to involve a child directly in a mediation, the mediator must obtain the consent of the child and must provide adequate facilities for that specific and special purpose.  My Department has discussed the manner in which this recommendation could be progressed with the Legal Aid Board and the Mediators&rsquo; Institute of Ireland and the consensus reached was that the best way to achieve the objective is to ensure that the voice of the child is included in a code of practice made under the Act.  </p><p>The intention behind amendment No. 15 in the name of Deputy Daly is, I believe, to make it mandatory for the Minister to prepare and publish a code of practice for mediators.  I cannot accept this amendment as it ignores the possibility, specifically provided for in section 9(1)(b), that the Minister may approve a code of practice prepared by a person other than the Minister which purports to set standards for the conduct of mediators.  I believe that possibility must be preserved.</p><p>In regard to amendments Nos. 20 to 22, inclusive, the intention appears to be to ensure that a code of practice must include all the matters outlined at paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>f</i>) in subsection (2).  However, as I have already indicated, there is likely to be more than one code of practice and it would not be appropriate to impose such a restriction.  It is quite likely there will be more than one code of practice and these amendments do not allow for that possibility.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 23 and 24 seek to insert into a code of practice provisions regarding education and training for mediators.  I do not believe that a code of practice for mediators is the correct place to deal with training and education standards and I note that codes of practice for mediators in other jurisdictions do not include provisions for education and training.  I am not saying that education and training provisions are in any way at variance with the role and function of mediators but I do not believe that putting that in a code of practice is appropriate.</p><p>I cannot accept Amendment 25 from Deputy Daly which would have the effect of removing procedures to be followed by mediators in the conduct of mediation from the scope of a code of practice.  I acknowledge what the Deputy had to say about this  being dependent on other amendments.  Amendment No. 25 as it stands, to my mind, would run completely counter to what a code of practice should do and, therefore, I cannot accept it.</p><p>I would ask Deputies to consider what I have said and to reflect on the Bill in its entirety with the Committee Stage amendments following which we can look at what might be done on Report Stage.  In regard to all of the amendments tabled by Deputies Wallace and Daly I see potential difficulties, many of which are perhaps unintended but would nevertheless cause difficulties in practice.  I do not believe anyone is keen to have a Bill that might be regarded as anything less than certainty.</p></speech>

I will therefore withdraw amendment No. 12.  Amendments Nos. 21, 22, 24 and 27 are also in my name and they also pretty much overlap with what is provided for in Deputy Daly's amendments.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 21 seeks the substitution of the word "may" with "shall" in an effort to make the Bill more specific.  The points listed for inclusion in the code of practice are good but there is too much scope to avoid what should be fundamental requirements for a code of practice.  The change from "may" to "shall" is a change from optional to a mandatory provisions for the code of practice.  I am of the view that these provisions should be mandatory.</p> <p>  On amendment No. 24, there should be a minimum requirement in terms of education and training for a person to be a mediator otherwise a situation is created whereby mediators who have completed a short course can be placed on the same level as already professionally qualified mediators with hundreds of hours of training.  That might not be such a good idea.  The Bill as it stands will allow those who undertake significant ongoing education to be equated with those who do not refresh and update their mediation skills and education.  This should be avoided.  There are people who go the extra mile to be better at their job.</p><p>There should be clarity and recognition that they are putting in the effort and trying to advance their ability in order to deal with complex situations.  Therefore, I believe it is important.</p></speech>

What we are trying to do with this Bill is facilitate a major transfer away from the court process of dispute resolution.  It could potentially be a really important thing for citizens, but it has to be done right.  Done right it would be brilliant, but done wrong it could cause a huge amount of damage.  The Bill is full of aspirations about a code of practice but there is no meat behind it.  There is nothing to require that to be drawn up and there is nothing to require the mediator to sign up to it.  As the Bill is currently constructed, somebody could go and do an online diploma course, put "association of professional mediators" or whatever beside his or her name, hand over the code of practice and then be on exactly the same level playing field as somebody who has been highly trained, who has upskilled and who has done it all.  That is just too dangerous.  We have seen too many rogue operators at there.  I appreciate that my staff are obviously more clinical than the staff in Deputy Wallace's office in terms of drafting the amendment.  Our amendments Nos. 13 and 14-----</p></speech>

With regard to our amendments Nos. 13 and 14, we are talking about certain minimum standards.  The Minister said that there would be different codes of practice and all that.  That may absolutely be the case.  However, what we are saying is that for somebody to have the label of mediator, they must require certain minimum standards.  What is the point in talking about a code of practice if people do not have to adhere to it?  Not only that, but the Minister may do some of these things.  We might have confidence that this Minister will do them, but there is no requirement on a Minister to bring about some of these things.  Again, I say that in the context of the likes of the Law Society stating that the regulation of what will be a new, important and growing profession of mediators should be dealt with on a statutory basis.  It cannot be done fully by the legislation as it stands.  Our amendments are just trying to plug the gap pending the statutory regulation of it.  It is not about micromanaging and it is not about dotting every "i" and all that sort of stuff.  It is about certain minimum standards that mediators must adhere to in order to give themselves that title.  I believe it is vital.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.1103" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017062800002#F00500"><p>One of the main issues is whether there should be a code of practice or a variety of codes of practice.  My preference would be for the former.  If we start going down the road of mediators having a series of codes of practice, we would end up like boxing associations with different organisations having different codes of practice and people being able to say that they are regulated by the Malahide mediators business or the Rathmines mediators association.</p> <p>  The preference should be to have one code of practice.  The Minister said that there is an advantage to having more than one code because, for instance, he may want to develop a code of practice for mediations that involve children.  I do not see why we cannot have just one code of practice and, within that, we would have a section that would deal with mediations that involve children.  Section 9 refers to there being a code of practice.  As Deputies, we have a code of conduct.  We do not have a different code of conduct for different parties or anything like that.  I believe we should be seeking to harmonise this in one code of practice for mediators.</p> <p>  With regard to the other amendments about education and training, as I said, we intend to table an amendment to section 9 on Report Stage in respect of the requirement that mediators should have to have a minimum standard of education or training.  I believe that should be put in the Bill.  Otherwise, it will just be open season.  It is not like any other profession in which one has to achieve certain qualifications in order to become qualified to practise.  As Deputy Daly said, under the Bill as it stands anyone can just call themselves a mediator and off they go.  We need to be able to protect them.</p> <p>  In terms of the code of practice, in court there are the rules of court.  If we want to make mediation a success, which we all want to do, we should have just one code of practice for mediators.  It should be there and everyone should know what is in it so that there is no ambiguity.</p></speech>

I listened to the point raised by Deputy O'Callaghan, but the fact of the matter is that there are different practices and codes that are required for different areas of practice.  I mentioned just one, which was the matter of children in mediation.  I believe that unduly restricting the Minister in section 9(1) excludes that possibility, which is more than a possibility - it is a likelihood.</p><p>I want to make the point again regarding the education and training, which has been mentioned, as well as the qualifications.  I draw the attention of members again to the role of the mediator under section 8(1), with specific reference to 8(1)(b) and 8(1)(c), by which the mediator would be required prior to the commencement of the mediation to</p><blockquote>(b) furnish to the parties the following details of the mediator that are relevant to mediation in general or that particular mediation:(i) qualifications;<br /><br />(ii) training and experience;<br /><br />(iii) continuing professional development training,and<br /><br />(c) furnish to the parties a copy of any code of practice to which he or she subscribes in so far as mediation is concerned.</blockquote> <p>That deals with the matter of qualifications and training and with the issue of experience and expertise and, therefore, I believe it caters for the points being raised by the Deputies in a number of the amendments.</p><p>With regard to education and training, I accept the point raised by Deputy Wallace.  However, it is probably premature in this Bill and therefore inappropriate to deal with it at this stage.  The minimum requirements of the Mediation Council of Ireland, about which there is some reference in the Bill, would deal with that.  This would be an issue for the council.  I refer to the Schedule of the Bill, which will impose a duty and obligation on the council to maintain and develop standards in the provision of mediation, including a system of training, education, professional development and the acquisition of expertise.  I am not against the point Deputy Wallace is making, but I do not think it is appropriate in this part of the Bill and I do not think it is appropriate for this Bill.  Rather, it is a matter for the Mediation Council.  As the Deputy knows, the council will be of consequence in terms of the evolving nature of mediation and the law.  I ask the Deputy to accept our bona fides in this regard.</p></speech>

The point is that, in the absence of a standardised code of practice, how do I know whether somebody with a diploma from the advanced royal mediation institute is highly trained or bought the diploma online?  If we do not define a code of practice ourselves, it will put too much of the onus on the citizen to have to do the digging and find out the standards.  That is why I believe it is important to go ahead as recommended in the amendments.</p></speech>

I will consider what she has said to see whether we can address the point she has made without incorporating the amendment before us, which, for reasons I have already given, conflicts with the current section 9 on the matter of there being more than one code of practice.</p><p>We must accept that reality.</p></speech>

Can we get agreement on what we are trying to do?  I feel strongly about the points we are making.  Perhaps to be magnanimous, we will return to this.  I feel strongly about the notion of one code of practice, which is key, but if the Minister will examine this, we will deal with it on Report Stage.</p></speech>

The section imposes a general confidentiality obligation on the mediator and parties to a mediation.  Following a review of the section, it has become clear that it does not go far enough in ensuring the confidentiality of the mediation process.  For this reason, amendment No. 29 proposes deletion of the words "by the mediator with the parties" and the insertion of the words "oral statements".   Deputies will accept the fact that this will broaden the confidentiality obligation to all communications made in the context of the mediation, including any oral statement that might be made by a participant.</p> <p>  Deputy Daly&rsquo;s amendment seeks to achieve the same end but, given the fact my amendment is similar, I hope she will feel she is in a position not to press her amendment.</p></speech>

The first corrects a drafting error in section 10(3) by substituting the word "admissible" for "inadmissible".  This makes it clear that evidence introduced in mediation that is otherwise admissible or subject to discovery in proceedings shall not become inadmissible solely because it was introduced or used in mediation.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 31 deletes the word "civil" in section 10(3).

For this purpose, they must provide clients with information on mediation services, including details of mediators, information about the advantages and benefits of mediation, information on the confidentiality obligations, as discussed earlier, and the enforceability of mediation settlements.  Where mediation is declined or fails and court proceedings are instituted on behalf of a client, the application must be accompanied by a statutory declaration made by the solicitor confirming that these obligations have been discharged in relation to the client and the proceedings to which the declaration relates.</p><p>In submissions to my Department, the Law Society has raised the possibility of confusion and duplication of effort in cases arising under the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, the Judicial Separation and Family Law Act 1989 and the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996.  The society points out that the requirements of this Bill in relation to the making of a statutory declaration would appear to be in addition to the existing requirements with respect to the signing of a certificate under those Acts.  I accept that there is a possibility of duplication of requirements in these cases and I am tabling amendment No. 32 which disapplies section 14 to certain matters arising under the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, the Judicial Separation and Family Law Act 1989 and the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996.</p><p>We need consistency and coherence between the provisions of this Bill and the requirements on solicitors under the Acts of 1964, 1989 and 1996.  For this reason, amendments Nos. 39 to 41, inclusive, will, respectively, amend sections 20 and 21 of the 1964 Act, sections 5 and 6 of the 1989 Act and sections 6 and 7 of the 1996 Act in order to require a solicitor to make a statutory declaration rather than merely sign a certificate to the effect that the requirements under these Acts have been discharged.</p><p>In addition, I consider that the information regarding mediation provided by a solicitor to an applicant under these Acts should mirror the obligations placed on a solicitor under this legislation.  For this reason, the proposed amendments require a solicitor to provide to an applicant under those Acts the names and addresses of persons qualified to provide an appropriate mediation service and to inform his or her client of the matters referred to in sections 10 and 11 of this Bill.</p><p>Two further amendments concern section 29 of the 1964 Act and section 43 of the 1996 Act.  Both relate to the costs of mediation or counselling services.  Since the Bill we are now discussing contains specific provision for costs of mediation, these sections should be amended to delete reference to mediation services.  I ask Deputies to accept the amendments as tabled.</p></speech>

The requirement in the Bill to produce a report which outlines any issues raised, or for the mediator to give an opinion on the engagement of the parties, would breach this confidentiality.  This section is of great concern to the Mediators' Institute of Ireland and the Law Society, and was highlighted in the 2010 report of the Law Reform Commission.  In that report, the Law Reform Commission concluded that mediators' reports, if any, should be narrowly restricted and might have some role in assisting a court in determining a successful litigant's cost application after litigation, subsequent to an inconclusive mediation but not otherwise.  In paragraph 4.125 of the report, the commission concluded that:</p><blockquote>[T]he Commission considers that the content of mediators' or conciliators' reports to the Court should be narrowly restricted.  Confidentiality during a mediation session is essential to protect the integrity of the process.  For the mediation or conciliation to be effective, a mediator or conciliator must have the trust of all participants, both in joint sessions and in private caucuses.  Requiring mediators or conciliators to report on the conduct of the parties to the Court imperils the confidentiality of the process.</blockquote></speech>

As Deputy Wallace said, the Law Reform Commission, the Law Society and the Mediators' Institute of Ireland are all keen that there would be some changes here, in particular with regard to the obligation in this section that mediators provide in their report to the court a statement of their opinion as to whether or not the parties fully engaged.  This is way too subjective.  Only a brief report needs to be presented as to whether or not meditation took place and whether a settlement was reached and, if so, what the terms of that settlement were.</p> <p>  It is important we include in the Bill the requirement that the report be a written one.  That comes under amendment No. 33.  Otherwise, we run the risk of much of the mediator's time being spent on court appearances and so on.  A written report to the court, however, should be sufficient.  It should be a neutral summary of the facts.  It is important to include something because in awarding costs the courts can take into account any unreasonable refusal or failure of a party to consider or engage properly in mediation.  I agree with Deputy Wallace's point that the mediator's report should one of advice and for the court decide whether it was unreasonable or not.</p><p>A normal statement should be a written statement to the court to be rubber stamped.  That is an important point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.1188" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017062800002#J00200"><p>It should be a written report and the wording of section 17 implies it would be a written report, so I do not see any harm in stating it will be a written report.  Otherwise, one will not get the detail that is set out in the rest of section 17(1).</p> <p>  A further point concerns section 17(1)(b)(iv), which states: "if no mediation settlement has been reached, a statement as to whether, in the mediator&rsquo;s opinion, the parties engaged fully in the mediation" will be made.  I believe that will change the character of the mediation and it also changes the character of the mediator.  If that is put in place, the mediator will become an individual who can punish one or other of the parties to a mediation, which I believe undermines the voluntary nature of mediation.  One will find situations where mediators in a report to the courts say one side did not fully engage, and as a result there could be costs consequences against that side in court.  There may also be consequences for the mediator in that the parties may say this was unfair and that they did fully engage, and there may be a dispute in which a mediator is sued.  This makes it difficult and makes it potentially adversarial, which is what we do not want in mediation.  This needs to be looked at again by the Minister.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.1189" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017062800002#J00300"><p>This group of amendments relates to the mediator&rsquo;s report to the court under section 17.  It provides that where the parties decide to engage in mediation following an invitation by the court, and they subsequently apply to the court to re-enter the proceedings, the mediator will prepare and submit a report to the court outlining the outcome of the mediation.  I take the point with regard to having the report in writing.</p> <p>  Following publication of the Bill, a number of submissions to my Department queried whether the mediator&rsquo;s report should refer to unresolved matters as currently required by section 17(1)(b)(iii).  I have accepted that it should not be necessary to refer to such &ldquo;unresolved&rdquo; issues and that is the purpose of amendments Nos. 36 and 38.</p> <p>  As regards amendments Nos. 33 and 34 tabled by Deputy Daly, I am not disposed to accept them as of now but I take the point she makes.  Subsection (1) requires the mediator to prepare and submit a report to the court and this already implies that the report must be written.  Moreover, inserting the words &ldquo;short and neutral&rdquo; in regard to such a report, as proposed in amendment No. 34, is unnecessary since paragraphs (a) and (b) already indicate the content of such a report.</p> <p>  As regards amendments Nos. 35 and 37, tabled by Deputies Wallace and Daly respectively, I am willing to give this issue further consideration because I do not believe there is much between us.  The key issue here is the requirement in subsection (1)(b)(iv) that if no mediation settlement has been reached, the mediator&rsquo;s report should contain a statement as to whether the parties engaged fully in the mediation or not.  I recognise that this provision raises sensitive issues for mediators.  Deputies will be aware that a broadly similar provision is already to be found in section 28 of the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011, which requires the chairperson of a mediation conference to include in his or her report to the court a statement as to whether the failure of mediation is substantially due to the conduct of one or more of the parties, and in that case specifying the identity of such party or parties.</p> <p>  I would ask Members to acknowledge the sensitivities here.  I am willing to give the matter further consideration.  I acknowledge the importance of the points raised in terms of facilitating further discussion and in assisting me to come back on Report Stage with a form of wording that should meet the concerns of Deputies as indicated in amendments Nos. 35 and 37.  I would hope to come back with something if Members are minded to leave matters over until Report Stage.</p></speech>

If we are saying it is implied that a report should be written, we should spell it out.  I do not think there is any harm in that.  It is not wordy or cumbersome and will not undermine the Bill.  I would like to press those amendments.  I accept the point on amendment No. 34 and am happy to withdraw that.</p> <p>  In terms of the bigger picture, it is a key area for mediators and we have to come up with something better on this.  Deputy O'Callaghan summarised the points very well in that it could undermine the whole process if we do not get the wording right.  Whether we press it now or deal with it on Report Stage, I do not mind.</p></speech>

The amendment would impose a significant additional function on the proposed mediation council in respect of complaints and disciplinary matters.</p><p>Following publication of the report of the then Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality on the draft Bill in 2012, my Department engaged in consultations with various bodies in the mediation sector to discuss the issue of regulation of the sector.</p><p> The outcome of the discussions was an oversight body, termed the Mediation Council in the Bill, and it should have the following functions: promote public awareness of, and provide information to the public about, the availability and operation of mediation services in the State; maintain and develop standards in the provision of mediation services; prepare codes of practice for mediators for approval by the Minister and oversee application of any approved code; establish and maintain a register of mediators who have subscribed to an approved code of practice; and advise on the establishment and operation of mediation information sessions in family law cases.</p><p> Mediation bodies pointed out that many mediators are members of regulated professions and are already subject to oversight and regulation by the regulatory bodies concerned.  Moreover, the various mediation bodies have their own training frameworks, education courses, continual professional development, as well as disciplinary codes.  I should point out that provision is made in section 9 for codes of practice, as we have already discussed, to include complaint and redress mechanisms and I am not convinced that the council should be given additional oversight in the Bill.</p><p> I would ask the Deputy to accept what I say having regard to the requirements of the council.</p></speech>

I did not have an opportunity of replying to questions raised by Deputy Daly last night because of the orders of the House.  It would not have been appropriate.  I would not have been allowed.</p> <p>  I would like to take this opportunity, by way of intervention in the Chairman's presence, to say to the committee that I am keen to advance matters on the coroners (amendment) Bill, that I have had a meeting with the Attorney General on this issue, that matters are proceeding, and I would be happy to keep the committee informed and would be happy to keep Deputy Daly informed having regard to her expressed interest in this issue.</p><p>While it is a priority, it is one of a number of priorities, as the Chairman is aware, that are matters of importance to the committee and in the justice area.  I have taken careful note of submissions made by Deputy Daly and I have met the Attorney General.  I hope to be in a position to report progress on this matter very shortly.</p></speech>

The committee is aware that on 1 December last year, which is seven months ago, a judicial appointments Bill that passed Second Stage came here for Committee Stage but we never got the money message.  Seven months later we still have not received the money message.  Another judicial appointments Bill is going through the D&aacute;il, as we see on the screens in front of us.  Will the Minister let the committee know when will the money message for the Bill be delivered?</p></speech>
