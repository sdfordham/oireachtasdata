    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan Farrell" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2017062800002#D00200"><p>The State Examinations Commission, SEC, and our colleagues in the Department of Education and Skills very much welcome the opportunity to attend today&rsquo;s committee meeting to assist the committee in fully considering the petition to make the new English junior certificate exam fairer by adding 30 extra minutes.  I note that the committee would particularly like to discuss how the mock examination papers provided by commercial suppliers might be scrutinised in advance of their sale to schools.  Before dealing with the issue at hand I might briefly set out to the committee the role and functions of the SEC within the State examinations system.</p> <p>  The SEC is a statutory body established in 2003 under section 54 of the Education Act 1998.  Our role is to provide a high-quality State examinations and assessment system incorporating the highest standards of openness, fairness and accountability in operating the Irish State examinations, principally the junior and leaving certificate and the leaving certificate applied examinations.  Examinations and assessment policy is set by the Minister for Education and Skills and the SEC is then responsible for the operation and delivery of the State examinations system.  </p> <p>  The commission is headed by a board of commissioners, appointed by Government on the nomination of the Minister for Education and Skills.  The role of the commissioners is to act as the custodians of the State examinations in terms of affirming and upholding the principles and integrity underpinning the system and the need to maintain public confidence in the examinations themselves.  The functions of the SEC are precisely defined in the State Examinations Commission (Establishment) Order 2003.  These encompass the preparation of State examination materials to their marking, resulting and ultimately appeal processes, along with arrangements for the conduct of the examinations.  The SEC prepares over 500 test items each year, which are taken by almost 120,000 candidates, leading to the marking of 1.9 million items of candidate work and the award of 1 million grades.  </p> <p>  The purpose of the State examinations is to measure the extent to which candidates demonstrate achievement in terms of meeting the aims and objectives of each particular subject specification, or syllabus as they are often known.  </p> <p>  Examination papers do not exist in a vacuum.  Central to the SEC&rsquo;s role in maintaining public confidence in the State examinations is the setting and maintenance of examination standards from year to year.  We do this through the relationship between the preparation of examination papers and their marking schemes, how we standardise these in order to maintain standards year on year and then how we quality assure these through our marking and appeal processes.  The examination paper preparation process itself involves the key personnel of chief examiners, drafters, setters, translators, and in the case of the leaving certificate, university observers and scrutineers.  The process takes over 15 months to conclude and contains a number of overlapping steps to provide examination papers of the highest possible standard to test, and to give candidates the opportunity to answer on, the appropriate aspects of the subject specification, or syllabus.  </p> <p>  The SEC provides a range of supports and services to teachers and candidates in preparing for the examinations.  These are an important element of the work of the SEC as candidates are understandably apprehensive in the lead-up to the State examinations, particularly when a new programme is being introduced, as happened this year with the introduction of a new style of examination in junior cycle English.  To provide appropriate support for future candidates and their teachers, the SEC provides full, open, and free access to its entire electronic archive of past examination materials.  This includes past examination papers, past marking schemes and chief examiners&rsquo; reports on previous examinations.  Such access to past papers and marking schemes allows all stakeholders to have equal and fair access to information about what to expect as regards the structure, format, and style of the examinations, so as to be appropriately prepared.  Chief examiners&rsquo; reports are issued periodically in each subject and provide additional information and insights into how candidates have performed with respect to the various assessment objectives of the syllabus, as well as offering advice to future candidates. </p> <p>  When a new subject specification or syllabus is introduced, such as the new junior cycle English examination which candidates sat for the first time earlier this month, past examination papers in that subject are of more limited use for the purposes described above.</p><p>For this reason, sample examination papers are produced by the SEC, in consultation with the Department of Education and Skills and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, in advance of the first State examinations for any new subject or revised subject specification.  These sample papers are produced as a guide to students, teachers and the public as to the structure and format of the new examination and, like real examinations, are produced with a high level of oversight and quality assurance to ensure their fitness for purpose.</p><p> Mock examinations take place in many schools in spring each year.  These examinations, as the name suggests, are intended to mimic the forthcoming State examinations in June.  Despite the fact they have no official status and their use is not approved or endorsed by the Department of Education and Skills or any other State body, they have been used by schools for some time as a means to help prepare students for State examinations.  The teachers and schools that choose to use them believe their value rests in providing students with an opportunity to sit a full-length examination that attempts to replicate the demands of the State examinations when they come around and thereby enhance candidate preparedness.  While in the past many teachers prepared their own papers for this purpose, commercially available alternatives have existed for a long time and have become increasingly prevalent.  Decisions to hold mock examinations are taken by schools themselves.  The SEC and Department play no role in this activity.</p><p> Mock examinations are not the business of the SEC.  We have no role or involvement in the preparation or delivery of examinations provided by mock examination providers that are private commercial entities.  The companies involved go to lengths to make their products look similar to the State examinations.  They mimic the layout and fonts of the State examinations, including in some instances logos and subject codes akin to those used by the SEC.  These companies usually provide solutions and marking schemes.  In some instances they also provide, on a commercial basis, a marking service and return marked scripts and results to schools that engage them to provide this additional service.</p><p> Due to the efforts made by such providers to mimic the look and feel of the SEC's examination papers, many students and parents may incorrectly believe that these mock examinations have some official status or are subject to some form of State endorsement or oversight, but this is not the case.  The SEC does not engage with the mock examination providers or the public in respect of mock examinations.  As with any other commercially produced educational service or product, such as school textbooks, both the SEC and Department consider that it is inappropriate for a State agency to comment on the quality of either the papers or marking service provided.  Indeed, to do so would certainly constitute inappropriate interference by a State agency in a private commercial market.</p><p> The proposal that the SEC would provide commentary or advice on mock papers to the providers of those papers or any degree of oversight on the papers or the process of their preparation is a cause for concern.  The reality is that mock examinations are produced by private companies within a competitive commercial market.  In our view, it would have a number of inevitable inappropriate implications.  It would imply an endorsement by the State of the very process of conducting mock examinations in schools, enhancing their perceived value despite the fact the Department does not endorse their use or consider them to be an appropriate and effective use of school time.  It would effectively provide endorsement or criticism of the products and services of private commercial companies.  The legislative and administrative architecture that would be required to ensure such oversight and-or involvement with a commercial market by a State body was in full compliance with Irish and EU competition law would be onerous in the extreme.  The resources required to provide an adequate level of oversight to allow any credible endorsement by a State body of the quality of these commercial products and services, including the large numbers of additional staff required, would not be tenable, particularly in pursuit of a goal that is at variance with stated educational policy.  The SEC, in giving its observations or guidance, would as a result inevitably provide insights into examination paper development in such a way as to increase the predictability of examinations and-or provide inappropriate guidance as to future live examination paper content.  The SEC's endorsement would result in inappropriate expectations as to the relationship between material that appears on mock papers and material that might appear on the real State examinations provided by the SEC.  It would expose the SEC to legitimate avenues of criticism if, by sheer coincidence, the content of a mock paper from one company turned out to be a closer match than the content of a paper from another company as to the content that later appeared on the real examination, both mock papers having received the endorsement of the SEC.</p><p> In short, unless mock examinations could be subjected to the same level of preparative rigour as the real State examinations, with suitable oversight mechanisms placed on a sound legislative footing, it would not be credible for the SEC to provide an endorsement of these products.  Even if the substantial resources required to implement this oversight role were made available, the negative consequences of carrying out this role would substantially outweigh conceivable positive effects.  Consequently, the SEC considers that it would be inappropriate for us to have any involvement in the setting or oversight of mock examination papers.</p><p> Today's meeting came about as a result of an online petition organised by junior cycle candidates arising from their concerns based on the adverse experience of some candidates who sat mock examinations last spring in advance of the new 2017 junior cycle English examinations.  The petition sought the addition of an extra 30 minutes for the completion of these examinations as many candidates had experienced real-time pressures in the mock examination.  Candidates, who face the first examination in this new programme this year, were understandably concerned for their prospects in the real English examination in June based on this experience in their mock examination.  Following receipt of the online petition last March, the SEC moved to reassure candidates that the examination papers in preparation for the June 2017 sitting of junior cycle English would be suitable for completion in a two-hour examination and that they would be fair to candidates.</p><p> The English examination sat by candidates earlier this month was fully in accordance with the structure, format and likely time demands of the sample papers at higher and ordinary level set by the SEC and issued in November 2015 for the assistance of teachers, candidates and, indeed, for the guidance of the producers of the mock examinations.  I am pleased to report to the committee that the reports from teachers and candidates on the 2017 junior cycle English examinations set by the SEC show that they were executed without any issues arising and no difficulties were experienced by candidates in respect of completion time.</p><p> The SEC and the Department do not believe it is appropriate for the State to make any intervention aimed at improving the quality of commercial products and services in a market, especially since those products and services do not advance the Government's educational policy.  The reality is that commercial producers have identified an opportunity in a market, which is their right.  The SEC and the Department cannot get involved in endorsing any such commercial opportunities or activities.</p><p> My colleagues and I would welcome observations and will answer any questions that members wish to raise.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gary &Oacute; Donnchadha" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2017062800002#E00300"><p>I have a few remarks and I will provide the secretariat with a copy of my remarks after the meeting.  A key innovation in the junior cycle reform process was the provision for junior cycle examinations to be marked by State Examinations Commission and for new classroom-based assessments to be conducted by classroom teachers.  We consider that this dual approach will deliver the very best context to ensure a learner experience appropriate to the needs of the 21st century.  Teachers will support student learning through conducting and grading classroom-based assessments.  This is a major element in the assessment arrangements for the junior cycle.  This kind of classroom assessment complements the end of cycle examination.  It is very real and immediate for the learner because the teacher scaffolds and gives constructive feedback through the journey that is the three years of junior cycle.  Importantly, the focus on the final examination is significantly reduced, which was a key objective of the reforms.  The dual assessment approach is being developed to align better with the learning goals of a modern curriculum programme.  The new junior cycle profile of achievement is the record that the learner will receive at the end of the junior cycle.  The record will give students, parents and guardians a much broader picture of the young person's learning experiences and achievements throughout the junior cycle.  Parents and students asked for a rich picture of engagement, involvement and celebration of the learning.</p><p>We recognise that embedding formative classroom assessment represents a significant culture change for teachers, for students and for parents.  Thus, the junior cycle for teacher support teams will be engaging with schools during the next five years of implementation.</p><p> The rebalancing of assessment modes to introduce classroom-based assessments and complement final summative examinations changes the conversation fundamentally.  The call to directly supervise external commercial providers is misplaced in a context where our junior cycle strategy and focus are moving away from reliance on a single external examination and promoting a wider range of learning opportunities for all.  What we can do is to positively draw the attention of teachers to a wide range of materials on the NCCA, SEC and junior cycle for teachers support service websites that will assist in developing appropriate, valid and reliable assessment instruments and approaches.  We can commit to providing this additional advice, and links to materials, on our websites in response to the very matters raised through this committee.</p><p> Part of this issue relates to the strong commitment of Government and the Department to reduce the reliance on the junior cycle summative examination.  This is reflected in the framework, which reduced the time to two hours but balanced it with the time allocated to ongoing classroom-based assessment modes throughout the three years of the junior cycle.  Adding time to an examination would be, in our view, the wrong thing to do, bearing in mind the many new ways teachers and schools have of capturing and celebrating the learning in junior cycle.  It may be that the provider of the mock examination can already see that the test design was, on balance, demanding too much of students on this occasion.  The solution may be for providers to ensure that the right kind of concepts and skills are assessed and rewarded while checking, through standard quality control procedures, that the assessment can be completed within a reasonable time.  I have already said what we propose to do, which is to provide a mix of materials on our websites.  Our commitment to package the currently available resources in one place should be a significant help to all, especially the learners.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1218" speakername="Shane Cassells" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2017062800002#F00200"><p>I welcome Mr. Farrell and officials from the Department.  It is 24 years since I sat a mock English junior certificate paper but I have an appreciation of that period in my life and the importance these examinations play.  This is especially the case in the junior certificate cycle because it is one's first big examination in secondary school.  English is the big opener in the process and it is a huge step for the young people who take it.  Today's meeting has arisen from the real-time pressure of a mock paper, as opposed to the State papers.  I pay tribute to the petitioner, Ms Tara O'Sullivan, for showing the experience and foresight for this at such a young age.  She has come to the Houses of the Oireachtas to seek positive change in the State examinations and there has been a reaction from several thousands of people, not to mention considerable media coverage.  We talk about positive engagement and this is a clear demonstration of that.</p> <p>  The responses seem to be that the mock papers are not what we are concerned with.  They seem to say that we are only here to deal with the State side but that is a disengagement from the reality, which is that the mocks play a vital role in the preparation for the State exams.  We cannot dissociate ourselves from that reality as they are part of our educational system.  I accept the points made by Mr. Farrell and Mr. &Oacute; Donnchadha that there needs to be oversight.  In the absence of engagement, however, we leave ourselves open to the scenario we see today.  Mr. &Oacute; Donnchadha spoke about positively drawing attention to guidelines but that is to say it is up to individual schools to decide if they want to positively engage.  I feel we need a cohesive approach among all secondary schools.  How does the Department believe we can achieve that if we just ask people to draw attention to guidelines?</p> <p>  The fact that Ms O'Sullivan drew attention to this allowed the State Examinations Commission to look at the addition of time but how did the commission reassure candidates that the examination papers would be suitable for completion in a two-hour period?  Reference was made to everybody being happy.  How did the witnesses from the Department draw those conclusions?  When one walks out of an examination hall one is happy that it is over, whether one has completed all the questions or not.  What sample did the witnesses get of people across the country being happy?  English is a different paper from all others.  In economics, accountancy or maths there is a set time to complete questions but in English, for which I had a huge gr&aacute;, one tries to elicit creativity from students.  The witnesses said adding time was going in the wrong direction but, of all papers, English is the one in respect of which we should allow creativity to flourish and restricting time is not the way to go.  I acknowledge that continuous assessment is positive in this regard.</p> <p>  Can Mr. Farrell answer my question about reassurance?  How was the assessment done which found that people were happy?</p></speech>

Can Mr. &Oacute; Donnchadha leave us with a copy of his statement?</p></speech>

I agree wholeheartedly on points made about the confidence and experience of the young person who has come forward to engage with the democratic process, which is music to the ears of the Department in the context of the new politics and society programme it is running.</p> <p>  This is not a disengagement from the mocks.  We are trying to find an appropriate balance among the free right of providers to exist and to provide all manner of supports to schools in the way of resources and materials, the solemn responsibilities of the State Examinations Commission and the care the Department needs to show in responding to needs.</p><p> The issue of the change in junior cycle is fundamental here.  We have brought the assessment and feedback conversation right back into the three years of the junior cycle.  In the future it will not be a case of waiting for the big bang at the end of the three year cycle.  I accept that it is an important experience and that going into an exam hall is a daunting experience, but there will be a huge amount of conversation.  Unlike when the Deputy and I did our junior certificate examinations, there will be ongoing conversation and dialogue with the teacher as well as these structured tasks, assessments and pieces of work and positive and supportive, scaffolding feedback from the teacher pointing out how the work can be improved and developed.  There is a much better ongoing conversation with learners during the course of the junior cycle at relevant key points and the arrival of the examinations is not a falling over the cliff situation or a date with destiny.  It is a more natural continuation of the assessment conversation they have had.</p><p> On the issue of adding additional time, the State Examinations Commission did provide reassurance.  I will hand over to Mr. Aidan Farrell on that issue.</p></speech>

In terms of the framing of examination papers, the State Examinations Commission has a detailed protocol and procedures in place.  We provide our drafters and setters with detailed manuals in terms of how to go about setting examination papers that would be free from bias or any form of discrimination and that will accord with the syllabus specification for the particular subject.  These expert people, who are either serving or retired teachers, work under the direction of the chief examiner.  Within the team, we will have a drafter, a setter, assistant setters, on occasion, and translators in the case of subjects that need to be translated, all of whom are expert in the subject area and in the devising of test instruments.  Part of our responsibility is to ensure that the examination paper can be completed within the time set down in the specification.  We also need to ensure that the examination itself in terms of its content and questions is fully testing and sampling the full breadth of the particular syllabus.</p> <p>  In terms of junior cycle English this year, having received the online petition and recognising that there was a very real issue of concern among a large group of candidates, we took a number of steps.  The chief examiner for junior cycle English would have liaised closely with his counterpart, the chief examiner for leaving certificate English, in terms of subject expertise and as another expert pair of eyes.  We also asked a scrutineer to review the test paper.  This is a subject expert who has had no involvement in the setting of the paper, that is, who has no ownership of the paper and would have no understandings or misunderstandings around the paper.  This person sits down and sits the paper.  Scrutineers have a number of important roles.  One is to determine whether the paper can be conducted within the time allowed.  Second, do the questions themselves make sense?  Is it a sensible paper?  Third, is the paper in accordance with the subject specification as set out in policy by the Department?  That was the final reassurance that we brought to the process this year.  We had someone independent of the process sit down and actually sit the paper to reassure and guarantee us that the paper could be completed in time.  That allowed us to offer reassurance to candidates throughout the country.  </p> <p>  The Deputy also raised the issue of how the State Examinations Commission knows that candidates are happy with the outcome of the examinations.  There are a number of ways in which we get that feedback immediately after examinations.  Generally, in the national media each day, each of the teachers unions will appoint a subject specialist who will draw feedback from among the membership in terms of how the paper has been received by candidates and the teacher's own expert view on how the paper read, how it sampled the curriculum, whether it was fair to candidates and whether it was sufficiently challenging but also sufficiently accessible for candidates.  That whole range of issues will be addressed by the subject expert.  That feedback comes to us.</p></speech>

I have to say that all of the spokespersons at the time, on behalf of the various unions, would have commented on the time issue as well as the content of the paper.  The second avenue through which we gain feedback on the papers is through the subject associations.  These are professional associations be they of English teachers or Geography teachers.  Shortly after the examination, they will canvass their teaching members on how the paper was received, how it was for their candidates and so on.  That is a valuable part of the quality assurance for us in terms of whether it was a particularly challenging paper - perhaps too challenging - compared to previous years and whether there were any issues around the paper that need to feed into our framing of our marking scheme so that we will have a fair and balanced approach to the marking of the papers.</p></speech>

I understand that the Department went to the bodies, but 55,000 people sat it.  Mr. Farrell spoke about unions, teachers and others but I would also be interested in, as in the case of this petition, the people who actually sat it themselves.  I call Deputy Brendan Ryan.</p></speech>

Mr. &Oacute; Donnchadha, or perhaps it was Mr. Farrell, seemed to suggest that the Department would not consider mocks an effective use of school time.  If that is the case, has the Department made recommendations to schools to desist from them?  To the Department's knowledge, are there any schools not doing mocks on a regular basis?  It would seem to me to be a feature of school life.  To suggest that it ought not happen is perhaps something that we should not be suggesting.  I would suggest that it is something that will continue and that the school community likes doing them.  Parents like them as well because they test their children.</p> <p>  It was touched on somewhat but in terms of capturing feedback about time in the exams in a systematic way, do the delegates believe that is being dealt with adequately on an ongoing basis?  Presumably it is factored into decisions in the following year and so on.  How is the time to be allowed decided in the first instance?  Is it the case that a decision is made that it will be a two hour exam and that, therefore, the questions are to fit into a two hour scheme?  Should time be a factor in exams?  I know that we have to manage exams and the timetable but it would seem to me that, if he or she has a certain amount of knowledge, a person should never come out of an exam feeling that he or she had more to say and to do and that time was a factor.  I would be interested in the witnesses' comments in that regard.</p> <p>  In terms of perhaps not endorsing commercial entities and all of that kind of stuff, is there a case for regulation of these commercial entities given that they are likely to be an ongoing feature of school life?</p><p>I note the two actions suggested, including sending a message to providers.  The question is who would do that.  Would it be the Department or this committee?  The Department committed to drawing attention to website materials and so on.</p></speech>

How is time decided and is time that important?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.28" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gary &Oacute; Donnchadha" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2017062800002#H00300"><p>The context in which the mocks are currently serving a purpose is about to change over the lifetime of the introduction of the junior cycle.  That is certain.  There are arguments that mock examinations play a role in the current dispensation, but as the junior cycle moves on through the implementation of more and more subjects, the assessment conversations teachers have with students will begin to populate the calendar right through the three years of junior cycle.  From a Department point of view, we have to point out the opportunity cost in the loss of teaching time, especially if we can demonstrate and promote the kind of structured, gainful student learning experiences which can be facilitated while also serving an assessment purpose so that teachers capture the learning much earlier in the process.  They are certainly capturing the learning formally at key points during the second and third years.  Those learnings factor into the junior cycle profile of achievement and actually will be a very attractive report on the many dimensions of learning, not only the State examinations piece but the recording of their performance and achievements on classroom-based assessments and what we call "other areas of learning".  These are areas where the teachers will for the first time have an opportunity to input directly on the student profile the valuable learning encounters in which the student participated, whether it is debating, tackling a challenging sporting encounter or participating in a musical event.  These are all important aspects of the learning which will be pulled together.  We are not talking about banning mock examinations or anything like that at this point, but I have no doubt that as the junior cycle adds in more subjects over the years - we are running right up to 2022 in phasing in this - the context will change for mock examination providers.  Perhaps their business will evolve into more strategically supporting the other kinds of learning schools are trying to promote for which materials and assessment tasks are needed throughout the period of the junior cycle rather than just focusing on the terminal examination, the significance of which has been reduced.  That would be a logical place for those providers to be considering.  That could indeed provide a valuable service if they provided the right kinds of supports and materials to serving teachers.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.30" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tim Desmond" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2017062800002#H00500"><p>Observations on that are twofold.  The first thing is to stay with English.  In the context of junior cycle reform, we are satisfied that within a two-hour allocation, there is adequate time for us to set tasks which give candidates the opportunity to display the skills they have achieved and the things they know.  Within that period, we can elicit adequate information to make a judgment on a candidate's level of achievement at the end of it.  As far as exam duration is concerned generally, our position is that there is adequate time.  Exams are not a race against the clock albeit there must be some time constraints on them in so far as there are problems with leaving candidates there indefinitely.  Without time constraints, one will get the approach which is to write everything one knows.  That is not educationally or assessment sound because what one needs people to do is to answer the question that was asked.  The response to that is judged against the time available.  To do that, the higher order skills of being able to analyse a question, draw conclusions and synthesise an answer are important.</p> <p>  In our view, the most important people to look at the clock in the first place are us and our setters to determine what questions we can ask which can be meaningfully answered within the allocated time and whether the array of those is such that we can elicit the information we need to say a candidate has achieved to a certain level.  We work within that.  Within junior cycle reform, the spirit of it and the change of philosophy there, we are certainly comfortable that a two-hour examination gives candidates adequate time to show what they have achieved in the three years without it being a race.  If one makes examinations very long, they become marathons for other reasons.  There are other issues at that stage and they become endurance tests and marathons.  Within the context of it, two hours is fine.</p></speech>

The fact that more than 12,000 students signed the petition shows us how worried they are about this exam.  We should bear in mind that it is a difficult time for students and their families.</p> <p>  Was there much feedback on the sample paper produced by State Examinations Commission?  Was anything flagged when it was sent to schools?  What is the average cost of producing State exam papers?  Have we ever looked at the commission producing the mock papers for schools?  On the feedback issue, the commission went to the membership and teachers.  I know students run out the door when the exam is over and it is a few days later that they digest what has happened, but is there any way for their feedback to be taken in?  Can the commission provide us with the number of complaints it received, if any, around this particular English exam paper?</p></speech>

It is either the expert subject commentators as reported through the media or through the actual subject associations, namely the teachers dotted across the country feeding back through their representative structures and as subject experts feeding into our marking processes through an engagement with the chief examiner to set and frame the marking scheme for that examination.  A third element of feedback we get is from parents and candidates after the examinations.</p><p>Having worked for 15 years in the SEC, my experience is that if the candidates or their parents have concerns about the content of a paper, either that it was too challenging or that the candidates had a particular difficulty with a question that really fazed and threw them for the purpose of completing the examination, they contact us immediately after the examination.  On occasion we have had 2,000 to 3,000 calls or emails from candidates or their parents around a particular question if candidates were somewhat thrown in the course of the examination.  I believe we are an open and accessible organisation in terms of getting that feedback.  The teachers are engaging with the candidates at school level, because quite often the teacher will go into school on the day of the examination to reassure and show support to the candidates and to see how things went for them.  There are well-honed paths of feedback from that point of view.</p></speech>

Nowadays there is more of a buildup of anxiety, and there seems to be more media coverage and articles on the dos and don'ts of examinations.  What is Mr. Farrell's opinion of that?  I have a view that examinations are hyped up too much for the students, the teachers and parents as well.</p></speech>

The nature of the examination systems means the leaving certificate examination is a pivotal access point, be it into the world of work or to the world of further studies.  We recognise the significance of that examination.  We are very conscious as an organisation of the need to keep things as stable as possible for the candidates and their parents in the lead-up to the examinations and to deliver a credible examination system without in any way setting out to catch candidates out in any way.  That is not the purpose of the examination.</p> <p>  I think Deputy Murphy is correct that for a period there was a particular hype around the State examinations, especially leading up to the written examinations in June.  Undoubtedly that would increase the focus, the stress levels and the tension levels for candidates and their families.  I have noticed a lessening of that in the past two to three years.  Undoubtedly, there is, and rightly so, commentary on the examinations.  They are significant in Irish family life and in the education environment.  There is a focus on them, but the focus has been balanced with information and feedback on how students have perceived the examinations.  They then move on to the next examination.</p> <p>  A number of years ago, there might have been a greater focus on tips for tomorrow, which only feeds into people's stress level, because if the tip is on the poet one has not revised, it will stress people to hear this expert extolling a particular approach on radio or television on the night before the examination.  That has lessened significantly in recent years.  As the body responsible for both maintaining public confidence in the examinations as well as maintaining a stable environment for candidates taking their exams, that is certainly something we would welcome.</p></speech>

Let me explain the reason.  There is probably a mixed practice in schools in that quite a number of schools provide mock examinations, but not all the mock examination papers would come from commercial suppliers.  In many cases, teachers will set their own mock questions in a mock examination paper.  I suspect one of the reasons is that mock examinations are taken in spring each year.  The leaving certificate, or for that matter the junior certificate cycle, are a two or three-year programme, respectively.  Teachers have not finished teaching those programmes.  A mock paper could be put in front of candidates covering a range of areas which the students would not have yet covered in the classroom.  Any value the mock examinations would have is very much diminished at that point because the students have not covered the material.  They are learning very little from that experience.  Another area where we would have to be very careful is the significance of the examinations in an Irish context.  Naturally students want to prepare as well as they can for the examination.  It is only human nature for people to try to predict what they think will come up.  If a question on the poet Sylvia Plath came up last year, it will not come up this year, or whatever the case might be.  That is human nature and that is fully understandable.  If it were the case that the SEC were either to produce mock papers or to provide oversight or endorsement of the mock examination papers provided by one or a number of the commercial suppliers, we would then be entering into the area of commenting or people believing they know what may come up in the live examination.  Clearly, if we were to design a mock paper and ask a question framed in a particular way, are we going to ask that question again in the June examination?  Even in terms of proper preparation from an education or assessment point of view, there would be real negative implications for teaching and learning if we were to engage in that sort of activity.</p></speech>

It is in the Education Act.  Schools are encouraged to tap into and access the student voice, and they can do this through the school self-evaluation process and the external inspections of schools through the whole-school evaluation, WSE.  Every whole-school evaluation that is conducted involves a student questionnaire to survey students directly on the issues of concern to them.  Those responses are processed.  As I reflect on it, it might be a wholesome thing to check the issues that are coming up in terms of the assessment experience and the examination experience of students during the course of the junior cycle.  These might be a very appropriate set of questions to ask.  The students are on a learning journey during the three years and, at various points, really valuable information surfaces.  The outcomes of the WSE questionnaires are published for the school system.  Indeed, they form a relevant part of each school's own reflection on its services and the quality of its provision, and the data from the evaluations is published along with the school report.  That is a very important point.</p> <p>  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs is actively involved in supporting the student voice as well.</p><p>D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g frequently highlights issues of concern.  Our Department goes to the D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g events where we are often called to account and called on to respond.  Where concerns are summarised in themes, we happily take them on board and feed them in wherever the change is needed.  It gives the young people agency in their own lives.  We also encourage that at school level where they can comment on their learning experience.</p></speech>

We also have the voice of the student in this petition and we will get back to that.</p> <p>  Would the State Examinations Commission, SEC, be prepared to consider its feedback processes in light of this petition?  I am concerned because 55,000 people sat the junior cycle examination.  There were no complaints, the line was not hopping but the SEC heard from the media, the teaching bodies and the professional associations.  Could it review its feedback process on the students' experience and build that into its processes? </p> <p>  The Department and the SEC are ambivalent about the use of mocks, particularly in respect of the new junior cycle.  Given that and the difficulties of quality control, of the SEC getting more directly involved and regulation, is there an opportunity for the Department to review their use by schools and to consider issuing guidelines?  The Department says it has not endorsed their use or considered them to be an appropriate and effective use of school time, which is a strong statement, yet they happen all over the country and caused concern to this individual.  Given the ambivalence, would the SEC consider abandoning the practice?</p></speech>

We are finalising our strategic statement and policy direction for the next few years.  One area we will consider is the engagement with stakeholders and their feedback on the service, as well as input into its design and operation.  We can consider how we might trap the candidate voice in a way that has not been considered before.  The examination system operates through the schools.  We are dealing with students who are 15 years of age at junior cycle or 17 or 18 years at leaving certificate level.  Schools enter their candidates for examination and act as advocates on their behalf, rightly so.  In that way we get a feedback from schools on the impact of the delivery and operation of the examinations system.</p></speech>

These are very young learners, aged 13 or 14, and we already have decided that setting them high-stakes examination tests is the wrong way to support their learning.  That is why the reforms are driven by the Government to shift the emphasis back into the classrooms and close to the teaching-learning loop where the really valuable good work happens.  We do expect the goalposts to be seen to have changed over time.  We expect that the rebalanced dispensation that will exist in a short few years will make it very clear that there is no point in trying to service a high-stakes terminal examination at the end of junior cycle.  We are more interested in seeing how resources and materials can be developed and facilitated for the formative classroom-based assessment processes.  I will take away the suggestion that we consider some guidance for schools in the context of what they do around the new junior cycle and how the legacy practice of mock examinations fits into that, if at all.  I will be happy to take that back to the Department and give it some thought.</p></speech>

C&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte - they are very welcome.  They are here to present to us the Seanad Public Consultation Committee's work on children's mental health.  I thank them for appearing before the committee.</p><p>I must deal with some housekeeping.  Before we commence, in accordance with procedure, I am required to draw the witnesses' attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode.  Mobile phones interfere with the sound system, make it difficult for parliamentary reporters to report the meeting and adversely affect television coverage and web streaming.  I also advise the witnesses that any submissions or opening statements they make to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.</p><p>I understand the witnesses will make short presentations and I now invite them to do so.  We commence with Senator Freeman.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Gareth Noble and Mr. Peter Hughes for coming to help me with today's meeting.</p> <p>  The public consultation day on children's mental health in Ireland is a unique opportunity for our nation to address the provision of mental health services for children and adolescents in Ireland.  I hope the publication of the report will bring to the attention of the Government the challenges that face this country in providing even a somewhat adequate mental health service for our children, whose disposition to mental health issues is increasing.  The mental and emotional struggles of our young people have expanded dramatically in the past decade alone.  New phenomena exist such as cyberbullying and self-image pressure from social media which put increased pressure on an already vulnerable category of youth identity.  Children between the ages of 15 and 17 have the fifth highest rate of suicide in Europe, and in recent months there has been a dramatic increase in suicide among young teenage girls.  In a country which purports to put the interests of such children first, we need to identify whether we are delivering on this commitment.</p> <p>  The purpose of the Seanad Public Consultation Committee is to hear the testimony of service users and service providers who work in the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  On this point - I know this is not in my written submission - this is not about the hard-working men and women on the front line of our CAMHS and other services; it is about us looking at the system that surrounds our mental health services for children.  Under no circumstances do I want to give the impression that we are criticising the people who work on the front line.  Over the past month or more, the Seanad Public Consultation Committee members and I have received in excess of 100 submissions from service users, including mothers, fathers and adolescents, and service providers - consultants, nurses, social workers and lobby groups - across the country.</p> <p>  Eleven years have passed since the policy document governing the delivery of these services, A Vision for Change, was published in 2006.  As with many of these documents, there is a lot of vision but very little change.  I wish to direct members' minds momentarily to the static nature in which our services have remained since the publication of A Vision for Change.  The reality is that successive Governments have fallen significantly short in implementing the recommendations captured by the report in terms of provision of services, inpatient beds, consultant child psychiatrists and support staff, out-of-hours services and accountability on spending.</p> <p>  The declining amount of budget funding as a proportion of the overall health budget has further prompted a reduction in staff and inpatient facilities.  We have been told that the mental health budget has increased and that it is approximately &euro;850 million, but the mental health budget for children is only 6% of that overall budget.  This is never highlighted.  The reality is that 6% of the overall mental health budget is allocated to 23% of the people who make up our population, that is, the young people who need this funding and these services, yet demand increases.  Referrals to CAMHS have doubled from 8,663 in 2011 to 13,062 in 2013.  Increased levels of staffing do not meet this demand.  Recruitment and retention of staff and availability of services are in stark contrast to the demands of a child population which has increased by an estimated 17.8% since 2006.  There are 55 child psychiatric consultants to a population of 1.2 million children.  Even trying to figure this out is challenging.</p> <p>  As the committee may be aware, I have introduced legislation in the Seanad seeking to ban the admission of children to adult psychiatric units.</p><p>This has prompted a very important discussion on how these children end up in such units for short stays.  By their nature, these admissions are a last resort and the reasons for the admissions generally arise of administrative expediency in a dysfunctional health system.  </p><p> The submissions to the Public Consultation Committee make clear that the admissions are a consequence of structural shortcomings or cracks in the system, shortcomings that need to be exposed, such as the lack of services for 16 to 18 year olds, poor retention of personnel and a lack of collaboration between catchment areas.  Often a child might be admitted to an adult unit as a result of an absence of beds or because of the non-availability of a child psychiatrist to perform the admission.  In some cases, it might be because there is no closely located in-patient unit.  These are not adequate justifications for a practice that is deemed to contravene the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. </p><p> I have invited Gareth Noble who is a specialist child lawyer and who has more experience of the reality of these services.  He, like many of the specialists in child law and those engaged in the provision of child and mental health services, is able to give a truer picture of the shortcoming of those services.  Since being nominated, I have found the testimony of front-line workers to reflect the most valuable contribution to my learning in this area. </p><p> I am therefore inviting the members of this committee to support the public consultation day, to highlight the issues involved, to attend and  to ask questions of those contributing if the member is a Senator, to be part of the implementation process when the recommendations are published and to create a space for the discussion of the findings as part of this joint committee in the next term.  I thank the members for their time today.</p></speech>

At the outset, I would also pay tribute to the committee in supporting the consultation day tomorrow to highlight these issues with a view to taking forward substantive proposals to Government, the HSE and others to ensure that our mental health services are fit for purpose.</p> <p>  Ireland has a poor record in protecting and vindicating the welfare needs of children and a number of significant reports have highlighted, and indeed continue to highlight, these issues across a range of areas.  This is an important opportunity to remedy the continuing breaches of the rights of children, which have in recent times taken on even greater focus as a result  of the referendum in 2012 to afford children greater constitutional protections and status in their own right.</p> <p>  I address you this morning as someone who acts for children and young people and their families in a range of welfare cases.  Through my work I have witnessed at first hand the challenges families face in accessing mental health services at times of trauma and crisis.  I have spoken to and advocated for many children directly who struggle with their mental health and well being.  I have collaborated closely with front-line staff employed by the HSE, Tusla and other public bodies who recognise and share many of the frustrations families and young people express and who feel powerless to effect meaningful change.  Such change, they feel, can only come about when there is clearer direction and meaningful policy change from management and from Government.</p> <p>  The seminal document in reforming Ireland&rsquo;s mental health strategy was published in 2006, the year I qualified as a solicitor.  It was entitled A Vision for Change.  That strategy aimed to modernise our system and ensure better co-ordination and better practices.  A vision that would deliver a nationwide service to ensure that community-based responses through CAMHS teams targeted resources in an effective way thereby intervening early to ensure a young person had a clear and speedy pathway to recovery.  I regret to say that this vision has not been progressed and in many respects children are in a much worse position than they were prior to Vision for Change.  The recent removal of 11 beds from Linn Dara in West Dublin for inpatient care for children; the fact that some 2,419 children and their families, in the most recent figures, are waiting in excess of twelve months for an appointment from CAMHS, 218 of whom have been waiting more than a year, 762 for more than six months; the fact that 15 counties in Ireland remain without an out of hours and weekend crisis service; and the fact that up to 67 children were admitted to inappropriate adult wards in 2016, all represent an unacceptable series of ongoing breaches of children&rsquo;s rights and constitute a serious dereliction in our duty of care towards them.  </p> <p>   I wish to offer the Committee some observations on a number of these issues.  The first of these is the issue of children being admitted to adult psychiatric wards. I strongly welcome and support the publication of a Bill by the Vice Chairman of this committee in December 2016 to ensure that no child under the age of 18 is placed in an adult psychiatric unit.  As far back as November 2006, the Mental Health Commission issued a code of practice relating to such admissions pending the ending of such a practice by 2011.  This has never been done.  It is my view that such a continuing practice is a potential breach of many legal rights instruments including Article 24 of the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child and indeed our own Constitution in respect of the personal rights guaranteed by Article 40.3, Article 43 and most recently by Article 42 A.  At a European level the practice could well constitute a breach of Article 3 of the European Convention of Human Rights which, inter alia, prohibits degrading treatment.  Article 8 of the same Convention promotes and provides a right to respect of one&rsquo;s private and family life.  There are serious legal issues arising from this continuing practice.</p> <p>  Adult psychiatric facilities are not the American celebrity clinics we see on television with a gym and samba lessons.  They are challenging and difficult environments populated by very vulnerable individuals who often present with a range of mental health concerns.  Some exhibit huge levels of distress and can on occasion be physically threatening.  Such situations are difficult to manage and deal with for all concerned and yet we are asking the most vulnerable of teenagers who are exposed to such situations to cope with them on top of their own challenges.  My experience is that they cannot and nor should they have to.  I have seen examples of young people returning home having been exposed to such environments and being lost forever as a result of such traumas.  </p> <p>  Effective recovery can only happen within the confines of a dedicated, safe and appropriate facility.  I have spoken and acted for many young people and families who talk about the sense of loneliness, rejection, fear and isolation in adult psychiatric facilities, often far from home.  In contrast I have visited adolescent facilities where I have seen at first hand how young people supporting one another do so within a context where their care is managed by appropriate specialists in adolescent care and where that sense of fear and isolation can be massively mitigated.   We have a moral, political and legal duty to children and this Bill is a crucial first step in achieving better outcomes for children in situations of crisis and for their families.</p> <p>  With reference to the CAMHS teams, I have seen a number of instances where admissions to adult units are sanctioned most reluctantly by treating professionals who accept the undesirability and problems inherent in such admissions.  It is also clear that professionals are most anxious that children do not remain in hospital any more than is required.  It is important, however, that such discharges are in the context of an appropriate step-down plan into the community and which involve services such as those provided within the multidisciplinary framework of CAMHS.   I have spoken to many parents who leave hospital facilities with their children without an appropriate onward community-based plan to ensure that continuum of care.  Some leave without having been re-engaged in community services or who have to go on waiting lists once again to access such services.</p> <p>  Reintegration plans with an appropriate suite of supports are essential if children and young  people are to move on with their lives.  We have all seen reports from the coroners' courts of the particularly fragile position of many young people discharged from in-patient care without the necessary supports and the truly awful consequences that such a lack of care may ultimately lead to.  Similarly, long awaited protocols must be fast tracked to ensure that every young person nearing the end of their childhood and who may require ongoing care beyond the age of 18, has a transition plan in place and be consulted about it.  It is to be noted in this regard that some conditions such as ADHD, diagnosed in childhood, is not a condition that adult mental health services provide for.</p> <p>  I referred earlier to the scandalously long waiting times for appointments with CAMHS.  This is not the only observation, gravely serious though that issue is.  It is of some concern and note that CAMHS have not issued an operating report since 2014, notwithstanding the fact that annual reports were envisaged by A Vision for Change.</p><p>If children and their parents were to report to members of this committee and to the wider public, what would they say?  Would they point to the fact that staffing levels required in regard to an increase in demand for such services have never been provided?  Would they point out that many child and adolescence mental health services, CAMHS, teams are excluding many young people from their services because they do not fit within the increasingly strict confines of their criteria and the lack of flexibility regarding same?  Children with a dual diagnosis who experience mental health concerns but who are also on the autism spectrum and children with mental health challenges who have also substance misuse issues are often falling between the cracks in accessing services.  &quot;It is someone else's responsibility&quot;, &quot;A different service is required&quot;, &quot;Join the end of that queue&quot; and the game of pass the parcel getting into full swing is an all too familiar experience for so many.  The lack of meaningful engagement and support by service providers is leading to infinitely more pressure on children and families and a sharp deterioration in the quality of life for such people, with all the added costs which ensue as a result of such an approach.<br/><br/>Children between the ages of 16 and 18 are often referred to as the Cinderella age in accessing mental health services.  They are too old to avail of adolescent care and too young to access many other services.  While children at the age of 16 can often provide consent for general health services and procedures, it remains a grey area in respect of psychiatric care and interventions.  This has been acknowledged by the Mental Health Commission and further clarity in law is urgently required.  Paediatric emergency departments are often accessible to children under 16 and therefore the emergency presentation of children between 16 and 18 occurs at adult hospitals, most if not all of which have woefully inadequate child psychiatry cover.  We have seen instances in the past where young people aged 16 or over present at an accident and emergency department and require urgent assessment.  Disputes have arisen between adult and child services as to which team should assess the young person.<br/><br/>Officially, CAMHS refers to services being provided for young people up until they reach adulthood.  On the ground, however, there is massive inconsistency in this approach with a lack of referrals being accepted for children beyond their 16th birthday.  Given that in 2010, 16 and 17 year olds constituted 68% of inpatient hospital admissions, the provision of care for this age group remains woefully inadequate.  A full review of CAMHS and services and supports for this particularly vulnerable age group is required as a matter of priority.  This is all the more important given the lack of clarity over the level of provision envisaged within the new National Children&rsquo;s Hospital for this age group and also noting the fact that new capacity legislation does not apply to minors.<br/><br/>In regard to children in the criminal justice system, it is reported by the Irish Penal Reform Trust and others that many prisoners in our system have undiagnosed and often untreated mental health conditions.  Within the adult penal system, however, prisoners who meet the criteria for various mental health conditions can be treated at designated centres such as the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum.<br/><br/>In the juvenile detention centre at Oberstown, young people with complex needs including mental health concerns are assisted by teams referred to as assessment and consultancy therapeutic service, ACTS.  However, in contrast to the position for adults, such treatment can only be done within the confines of the Oberstown facility.  There does not exist a designated centre within the child detention system as exists in the adult prisons through the Central Mental Hospital.  For children with such acute difficulties, the ability and availability of professionals to treat such cases is avoidably compromised.<br/><br/>In regard to listening to the voices of young people and their families, this consultation day provided by members of this committee and the invitation of submissions is an important first step in identifying the strengths and challenges within our adolescent mental health services.  Young people and their parents often fear the consequences of raising complaints and concerns, however valid.  It is a reality that many parents who struggle to access vital services and who express concerns about their ability to cope with the challenges of a mental health crisis are often characterised in a manner which seeks to shift blame onto their ability and capacity to parent.  I have acted for a number of parents who, in articulating their concerns about their ability to safeguard their children without appropriate supports, find themselves on the receiving end of a referral to Tusla.  This has a chilling effect on parents and their ability to speak out.  It is also a massive abuse of power to utilise Tusla in such a manner and a distraction from providing a pathway for much needed stabilisation and therapeutic recovery for the young person.<br/><br/>When a child is detained by the District Court on an involuntary basis upon application by the Health Service Executive, HSE, under the Mental Health Act 2001, certain provisions of the Child Care Act 1991 may also apply, including the giving of court directions concerning the welfare of the child and the appointment of a legal representative or a guardian <i>ad litem</i>to act as a voice for the child in those proceedings.  We have seen in recent times through the child law reporting project further examples of just how important it is to ensure that the views and wishes of such children are fully represented.  It is vital, therefore, that any reforms of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>system must ensure that the ability of the child to participate through their guardian is meaningful.  This must continue to be provided for on an equal basis to other participants in court proceedings and must not, as appears to be proposed, dilute the voice of the child to witness status.  That is against the interests of children and is in any case constitutionally dubious.<br/><br/>This committee has demonstrated, in its support for the public consultation day tomorrow, a proactive approach to leading a conversation on the specific requirements of a modern mental health service from the perspective of a child.  Statutory obligations in regard to children refer to the rights and needs of the child being of paramount consideration.  Using this as our guiding principle, we need to develop policies and services that truly do put children first.  Senator Freeman&rsquo;s Bill is certainly consistent with that approach and I and many others at the front line urge the speedy progression and implementation of that Bill.  I thank the Acting Chairman and the committee members for giving these issues their attention.  I look forward to further engagement on these important issues.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.82" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Hughes" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017062800002#E00300"><p>I thank the members for the invitation to address the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs.  As general secretary of the Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA, I want to highlight my concerns in regard to the CAMHS.  The inadequacies and under-investment in the current provision of CAMHS is something my union has consistently drawn attention to and I hope that the committee's interest in this area will help in addressing the many gaps in CAMHS that exist throughout the country.</p> <p>  In 2006, the Government policy on mental health, A Vision for Change, was published outlining a ten year plan for the provision of mental health services.  Chapter 10 of that widely welcomed strategy outlined the recommendations for child and adolescent mental health services.  Some of the key recommendations included two multi-disciplinary teams per 100,000 population; one liaison multi-disciplinary team per 300,000 population; one day hospital per 300,000 population; and that urgent attention should be given to the completion of the planned four 20-bed units in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Dublin and multi-disciplinary teams should be provided for those teams.  That will result in 100 beds for CAMHS nationally.</p> <p>  Most important, A Vision for Change included in it a provision for an evaluation after five years to assess the progress in the delivery of CAMHS and whether it is meeting the needs of the population.  Eleven years on, we must question the commitment to the recommendations in A Vision for Change.</p> <p>  The PNA, in partnership with the Royal College of Surgeons Ireland, RCSI, published research last year on the implementation of A Vision for Change in adult mental health services ten years on.  The results were stark and disappointing.  Among the findings were that 60% of beds were closed yet only 30% of the recommended community services were put in place; there were no 24-hour crisis intervention services as recommended; we are currently conducting research, phase 2, in partnership with the RCSI, into the specialist elements of A Vision for Change, inclusive of CAMHS.  Early indications suggest that 37% of the recommended multi-disciplinary teams as outlined in A Vision for Change are operational; 53% of the liaison services are in operation; and 52 beds are operational out of the 100 recommended beds.  That figure has reduced in recent weeks to 48.  This research will be concluded by quarter 4 of this year.</p> <p>  The population of children nationally is expected to increase by 8,530 between 2016 and 2017, which is consistent with the percentage growth annually in the past decade.  That projection, coupled with the expansion of the free GP scheme, will create an additional demand on child and adolescent mental health services.</p> <p>  I also wish to make reference to the appalling situation of young homeless children currently living in hotels, guest houses and short-term accommodation.  Not only does that increase the level of mental distress on those involved, that transient situation complicates the follow up of the children as they are transferred from one CAMHS to another as their accommodation moves.</p><p> According to the mental health division operational plan for 2017 there are 74 multidisciplinary teams.  A Vision for Change recommended two teams per 100,000 population, which equates to 94 teams, so we have a shortfall of 20 teams.  According to recent research we conducted, only 50% of the recommended teams are in operation in the greater Dublin area and most of them are not fully functional as they are missing many disciplines.  There are four day hospitals nationally.  A Vision for Change recommended one for every 300,000 population, which equates to 15 hospitals.  This means we have a shortfall of 11 day hospitals.  There are 74 CAMHS beds nationally.  A Vision for Change recommended 100.  However, only 48 of these are operational nationally due to staff shortages and, in particular, nursing shortages.  There are 20 beds in Cork, but until recently the unit only had the capacity for a maximum admission of 15 children.  This has now been reduced to 11 due to nursing staff shortages.  St. Joseph&rsquo;s unit in Fairview has 12 beds, but only six are operational due to nursing and medical staff shortages.  The Limerick unit never materialised and the 20-bed unit in Galway is fully operational.  Linn Dara in Dublin, a new purpose built 22-bed unit, which only opened 18 months ago, has in the past three weeks closed 11 beds due to nursing shortages.  The unit has only 50% of the nursing resource required.  These 11 beds have been closed despite a list of 20 children awaiting admission.</p><p> We know all too well that the net result of these bed closures and underprovision in CAMHS is to further increase the unacceptable admission of children to adult mental health units.  We witnessed a stark example of this just last month, with the admission of a 16 year old to the adult mental health unit in Waterford.  To add to the trauma experienced by this child, we know that child had to spend the night sitting on a chair.  To say, 11 years after the publication of the A Vision for Change strategy, that this is totally unacceptable is, if anything, an understatement.  Child and adolescent mental health services are in crisis and, as outlined, the provision of services is deteriorating rather than improving.  The children and parents of our country are being let down by the non-implementation of policy and the lack of commitment or urgency in addressing the crisis.  And yet we know, and have known for ten years, what needs to be done to address the crisis.</p><p> As a matter of urgency, the 100 beds as recommended need to be provided and staffed in order to provide quality therapeutic care and prevent further admissions of children to adult mental health units.  The number of community mental teams needs to be increased, as recommended.  They need to be fully staffed and expanded to provide out-of-hours home-based services.  The criteria for clinical nurse specialists are too stringent and need to be adapted in the short term to facilitate an increase in applicants.  There are approximately 20 unfilled clinical nurse specialist posts nationally, mostly due to insufficient applicants as the criteria are too strict.</p><p> The 15 day hospitals as recommended need to be provided.  Of course, the full implementation of these measures will only come if there is a substantial increase in the budget for mental health services, which currently stands at 6.4% of the health budget.  Bizarrely, and probably only in Ireland, we have witnessed a situation where despite the growth in demand for mental health services across the board there has been a steady reduction in the mental health budget as a percentage of the overall health budget.  In 1984 the budget was 13% of the health budget, in 1994 it was 10% of the health budget and in 2004 it was 7.1% of the health budget.  As can be seen, the commitment to mental health services is diminishing each decade, yet the demand has never been greater.  It is little wonder the previous Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, admitted in the Dail on 23 May that mental health services have been neglected for over 30 years, and were, as he put it "the Cinderella of many Health Service Executive Votes and Department of Health Votes".</p><p> Sadly, when we look at the mental health budget it is hard not to conclude that A Vision for Change was used as a cost-saving measure on the backs of those with mental health issues.  Too often we have seen the closure of beds with paltry investment in community services.  We are struggling to provide vital services while trying to manage a severe shortage of psychiatric nurses, largely due to the fact that our highly skilled and committed nurses are being forced to leave the Irish health system for better pay and terms and conditions in the private sector, the UK, Australia and Canada, to name but a few of the market competitors.  Who can blame them, when there is a consistent failure to address realistically the issues of pay and conditions for nurses?  At the end of the day, this is the only realistic solution that will stop the haemorrhaging of our nurses abroad and encourage those abroad to return.</p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to briefly outline the extent of the ongoing crisis in child and adolescent mental health services, which we know is impacting severely on the children and parents of this country.  I assure the committee that the Psychiatric Nurses Association is determined to see the issues in CAMHS addressed before they deteriorate even further, and we would welcome the committee's support in achieving the provision of properly resourced and staffed CAMHS that meets the needs of children, families and communities throughout the country.</p></speech>

I have a very quick question about preventative measures.  We are very bad at preventative measures in the general area of mental health and particularly in the area of child mental health.  Do the witnesses have an opinion on the introduction of play therapy as part of primary school or access to a play therapist?  Many schools who are in the school completion programme have it but most other schools do not.  Many people do not even know what play therapy is.  I am big advocate of it and I wonder what is the opinion of the witnesses, given that it will not always work but in some cases it might be a preventative measure.</p></speech>

A situation arose in Cork recently whereby if a child had presented to either accident or emergency department in the city at, CUH or Mercy University Hospital, there would have been no CAMHS available to them, which is an issue of significant concern in Cork.  I am sure it is an issue that probably arises generally.  Are there significant shortfalls?</p> <p>  Recently, I had an interesting conversation with somebody working in the Bessborough Centre.

Senator Freeman said we will come back to this in the autumn and I support that.  We will set time aside.  The Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs cannot implement much of what we have heard.  It is the responsibility of the health committee or the Department of Health.</p> <p>  Deputy Funchion raised the issue of play therapy and the well-being course is coming into the school system.  We should look at a cross-departmental response to all of this because, as the children's committee, we do not have the power to deal with much of this.  We need to engage with the education and health committees to identify what specifically can and must be done to address the issues that have been raised.

On the play therapy issue, in child care proceedings where children are taken into the care of the State, we are seeing much more emphasis on child therapy and all the feedback is highly positive in terms of allowing children the space to deal with traumatic situations.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire referred to the role of CAMHS and presentations at accident and emergency wards.  One of the biggest difficulties that parents and children face is the fact there are no CAMHS out-of-hours services or weekend cover and, quite often, some of the really traumatic experiences that children and young people face manifest out of hours and at weekends.  The issue of infant mental health is a new development and is something with which everyone is trying to grapple.  It is also related to attachment issues.  We are seeing the need for a lot more specialisation in terms of infant mental health and attachment issues.  </p> <p>  I thank Deputy O'Sullivan for referring to the need for cross-party and cross-departmental collaboration.  One of the greatest frustrations I have as a child lawyer, with which I could paper the office, is that when I highlight an issue to a particular Department or a particular public authority, nine out of ten times I get a letter back saying I should be referring to somebody else.  In one example, I referred something to a particular Department that referred me to a different Department.  When I wrote to the second Department, it referred me back to the original Department and all the while, children are getting lost in that system.  We need to develop mechanisms whereby these things are dealt with properly.  One difficulty with taking Tusla out of the HSE and developing it as a stand-alone agency is that many of the child protection issues, which include mental health, continue to remain the responsibility of the HSE.  That has been a big difficulty in terms of fully realising the ability of Tusla to do its job in protecting children.  </p></speech>

I thank Dr. Shannon for appearing today.  Before we commence, in accordance with procedure I am required to draw the witness's attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence relating to a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p> I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode.  Mobile phones interfere with the sound system and make it difficult for the parliamentary reporters to report the meeting.  Also, television coverage and web streaming will be adversely affected.</p><p> I advise witnesses that any submission or opening statement that have been made to the committee will be published on the committee website after the meeting.</p><p> The witness will make a short presentation that will be followed by questions from the members of the committee.  I invite Dr. Shannon to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

It is hugely important and significant legislation.  Many of the themes that emerged from my audit touch on many of the themes addressed in the last session.  After listening to the evidence given by the previous speakers, I felt compelled to associate my name with the significant development that has taken place.  I look forward to participating in the consultation process.  </p> <p>  One can measure any democracy by the manner in which the needs of the most vulnerable are considered and met.  Nowhere is this more evident than with the most vulnerable of children who are subject to emergency intervention by the State over weekends and after 5 p.m. in the evening.  I welcome this morning the publication by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, of an implementation plan for the audit.  It is my view that reports such as the one I have undertaken are meaningless unless there is implementation.  I urge the committee, if I might be so bold to suggest, to invite me back before it a year from today's date to give an account as to what has happened during the intervening period.  As somebody experienced in writing and producing reports, I sometimes become frustrated at the fact that the pace of implementation is far slower than I would like.  It is my view that childhood does not stand still.  Sometimes the approach adopted does not reflect the limited nature of childhood.  </p> <p>  The audit was commissioned by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It was a response to the Ombudsman for Children's investigation in respect of two discrete cases.  It is unique in its comprehensiveness as a systemic review, in that it paints the national picture.  I would like to state publicly that I had commendable levels of co-operation from members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in conducting the audit.  In terms of the scale of the audit, I understand that this is the largest worldwide audit of the exercise by a police force of its emergency child protection powers.  The audit provides us with insight.  </p> <p>  In terms of ensuring the integrity of the information that I produced, I sought international validation of my recommendations.  For the record, it is important to mention that I sought the assistance of Oxford University.  Professor Laura Hoyano in Oxford has said that my report will break new ground in terms of empirical techniques in the field.  I had asked her to review my document in its entirety.  In her analysis of the report she stated in terms of the overall audit, it seemed to her to employ sound empirical methodology, which was then carried out with admirable thoroughness and was very well written.  She considered that the findings were all borne out by the data he reported.  It is important to state that in the context of the integrity of the data and the findings I made as a result of the data.  A further review stated the report was an outstanding piece of work that was extremely well-written and careful.  This was the international assessment of the work that I have undertaken.  The committee should be in no doubt that this is a large-scale audit.  I have spent two years and perhaps thousands of hours of work and have spent virtually every weekend over that period travelling to Garda stations.  This was an active piece of work and it is the one of which I am proudest as both a researcher and a professional.  I hope that after the outrage there will be action.</p> <p>  I shall outline the extent of the work undertaken as part of the audit.  I travelled right around the world.  I had very impressive co-operation from the police authorities in the UK.  I met the Metropolitan Police.  I looked at the child protection services and the interaction between child protection services and police forces, not only in the UK but in New York in respect of the New York Police Department, NYPD.  I had very impressive co-operation from the NYPD and viewed state-of-the-art facilities in the Bronx.  As a result of those visits, I have compiled a series of recommendations.  My recommendations are not just based on a paper-based exercise.  They are based on my experience of travelling the length and breadth of this country to review how children experience the section 12 process.  In addition, I talked to individual garda&iacute; and travelled around the work to look at other models in order that we can come up with a model that meets the cultural needs of Irish children.</p> <p>  I hope the legacy of my report and what I think of today are the children who are subject to section 12.  Many people, in the aftermath of the audit, talked about the fact that they found the accounts in the audit profoundly disturbing, distressing and upsetting because many of the case narratives documented children's shattered lives.  I appreciate that child protection is complex and challenging.  The impact of early trauma can have significant consequences.  The cumulative adverse experience of early years can have considerable consequences even where intervention by social services follows.  I am of the view that when a child is taken into the care of the State, the State is saying it can do a better job.  If the State fails a child a second time, this can have devastating consequences for the child.  My audit provides us with a unique insight as to what happens when parents fail children, when the State fails children and children are allowed to drift rudderless within the system.  No child should suffer to protect an institution.  We have heard many accounts of children being subjected to institutional abuse.  I would also say that no child should suffer at the hands of parents and no child should be made to live a life of unspeakable abuse to protect his or her abusive parent or parents.  Many of the case narratives in the audit shine a light on some uncomfortable truths.  Child protection is often invisible to families and their communities.  My report shines a light on an unpalatable truth for Irish society about how life is lived for some of its citizens.  This audit also indicates that the prevalence of domestic abuse, and that does not necessarily mean physical violence, has sadly not abated.</p> <p>  One of the biggest challenges facing Irish society is the adverse consequences for many children posed by parental alcohol abuse.  Drug and alcohol abuse by parents can be very damaging on their ability to consistently parent their child.  The failure on the part of society and Government to properly address the alcohol problem as a fundamental threat to the proper functioning of individuals and communities leaves the child protection system dealing with insurmountable consequences.  I am conscious of the fact that a Public Health (Alcohol) Bill is currently being discussed.  We do not have time to address this issue but is a national crisis.  If there is anything to emerge from my report, it is our ambivalence towards alcohol and those who promote alcohol and yet the consequences are devastating. </p> <p>  Another key theme to emerge from the audit is in the area of inter-agency co-operation.  It is essential that those who operate under the umbrella of child protection services can share information on vulnerable individuals and their families.</p><p>Throughout the audit, over a lengthy period of time, agencies kept saying to me that there were confidentiality problems and data protection issues.  My view is that confidentiality is sometimes a bogus issue.  What I found was poor inter-agency communication and co-operation.  I am conscious of the fact that, since the audit, there has been an attempt to say that there are very good lines of communication within the upper echelons of organisations, but I found this bore no reality to the perception gleaned from talking to individual members of, for example, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  What I found is that inter-agency co-operation was overwhelmingly inadequate.</p><p> I would like to address the currency of this audit, its breadth and whether it is relevant to the present.  This audit looked at more than 500,000 fields of PULSE data.  It was a thorough and comprehensive review of PULSE.  I understand that I am one of the first people to have had access to these data, over the period of 2014 to 2015 in particular, but also from 2008 until the end of 2015.  I also conducted questionnaires on all garda&iacute; who exercised their powers for the 2014 to 2015 period.  There were 560 cases, with a full response rate by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is commendable and of enormous assistance for drawing conclusions.  I conducted a random audit in September 2015.  I attended the national headquarters of the child protection unit in Harcourt Street and randomly selected cases to obtain a temporary picture as to how the system was operating.  I then interviewed those garda&iacute; subject to the random audit to get an understanding of how they felt.  Those interviews were lengthy.  I heard reference to the fact that Tusla introduced a national out-of-hours service in 2015.  I want to make it very clear for the record that I conducted focus groups in late December 2015 in the aftermath of the introduction of the national out-of-hours service.  Those focus groups were conducted with both senior and rank-and-file members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in order that I could get an understanding of the position.  I continued to liaise with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, up until the earlier part of this year.  Perhaps I was a source of incredible frustration for those within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, because I continually updated the report, and tried to present as accurate a picture as I possibly could.  I think it is important to emphasise that point.</p><p> To return to the issue of inter-agency co-operation, it is essential that children do not slip through the net, and we heard that in the previous presentations.  It is a question of pulling children back from the brink.  We need greater links between agencies.  There is reluctance in this country to look at much broader structural reform.  This is a real problem and this committee has a central role in solving this problem.  Looking at the international models, the solution to this problem is co-location.  Every professional that has a role in child protection needs to feel equal.  No-one has an exclusive reserve on child protection.  A very good example is the state-of-the-art facility opened in the Bronx, where the equivalent of Tusla, the New York Police Department, NYPD, a forensic paediatrician and the prosecution service sit around a table making decisions about children.  That is relevant to the out-of-hours service.  If a garda and social worker are co-located, then the out-of-hours service does not become such a big problem.  Be in no doubt that I do not believe that the national out-of-hours service is currently fit for purpose.  Look at the evidence given before this committee last week, which I have read with great care, the fact that there are service providers for four locations, and the suggestion that we look at demand for services in other jurisdictions.  I would point to my own report, which comprehensively documents demand.  On page 50 of the report, I provide an analysis, county by county, of the number of section 12 incidents between 2008 and 2015.  What more information do we need to determine what is necessary for an out-of-hours service?  My view is to ask why a child in a county that is less populated should receive an inferior service because the child lives in that jurisdiction rather than a heavily-populated area?  We need equality across the entire country.  That is something that we deserve.  We passed a children's rights referendum.  It has to mean something for all children, not just some children.  We did not pass a referendum just qualifying that.  It is important to emphasise that point.</p><p> To get things right, we need to take a rights-based approach.  There are a number of core rights, including non-discrimination, the best interests of the child, the right of the child to life survival and development, and also the voice of the child.  All children should have the right to survive, grow and develop in the context of social, physical and emotional well-being.  Every child should have the opportunity to reach his or her full potential.  Coming back to the mental health issues, in my opinion the system fails children with psychological or mental health difficulties.  The failure to recognise mental health issues at an early stage can have profound implications for the family.  Warning signs need to be treated with sufficient seriousness.  Referrals need to be timely and appropriate.</p><p> I will go through five of the key findings of the audit.  The first was the overwhelmingly positive findings that exist in respect of certain actions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The garda&iacute; commit great effort to treating children sensitively and compassionately when a child has been removed under section 12.  What I found as part of the audit is that some members worked well beyond the rostered hours to ensure that children removed under section 12 obtained the appropriate care.  One of the principal objectives of the audit was to examine the appropriateness, proportionality and legality of section 12 removals.  The audit team and I found that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na exercise their powers following a period of careful consideration of the circumstances and available evidence.  All cases examined involved an appropriately restrained use of section 12 powers.  The audit also found that there was no evidence of racial profiling when exercising section 12 powers.</p><p> That said, that finding must be tempered by the fact that certain ethno-cultural demographic information was not routinely documented on PULSE.  The audit found difficulties with the PULSE system.  It found that the PULSE system was not perfect.  It also found that there was no routine gathering of ethnic data.  That needs to change.  If there is a legislative block, that needs to be removed.  From a child protection perspective, the audit found evidence of the removal of children under section 12 from the same family circumstances - in other words, repeated removals.  The audit also found little evidence of discrete child protection training in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  On-the-job training seemed to be preferred over formal core training.</p><p> The critical thing to emerge again and again was that notification is not communication.  If one fills in a form and pushes that on to another office, that is not communication.  Communication is shared decision-making.  I think that critical theme of notification not being communication emerged at every stage of the audit.  The presence or absence of out-of-hours services was subject to considerable criticism.  Children had to be criminalised or pathologised in order to gain access to the necessary welfare and support services.</p><p> The audit found very positive evidence of the operation of specialist child protection units in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is why I am such a strong advocate of co-location.  Nothing predicts like the past.  Those who are not aware of history are bound to repeat it.  There appears to have been a failure to learn from past mistakes.  We need to learn from the shattered lives of those children whose personal stories are reflected in the audit.  When a child is the victim of abuse or neglect, it is the responsibility of statutory services or agencies to provide a timely and proportionate response.  It is my view that, to protect children, we need to promote co-location.</p><p>Co-location has several advantages.  In my opinion, there is less system inflicted trauma, better decisions, more appropriate interventions and, in fact, more efficient use of resources rather than this silo mentality where we all are doing something separate.  It is no different to passing the correspondence from one Department to the next Department.</p><p> Working upstream also has huge benefits.  The importance of schools at an early point tackling problems should not be understated because education is the gateway out of disadvantage.  Certain behaviours are clear and strong indicators that the child may be at risk.  Among these are substance, alcohol and solvent abuse.  Escalating patterns of at risk behaviour and poor impulse control should raise flags for all professionals involved and should designate the child as being in need of urgent attention.  It is my view that the system is unable to cope with children with emotional behavioural problems.  I was deeply distressed by a number of examples where children who had emotional behavioural problems did not receive an out of hours service because the providers would not accept them.  Those children inevitably ended up in hospitals or Garda stations.  That is a matter of profound concern.  Intervention, when it comes, must not be too late to vindicate the right of the child to have his or her welfare protected.</p><p> Many challenges remain to be resolved before we can say that we are a country where our children's rights are fully vindicated.  It is always a work in progress.  It demands new perspectives, renewed efforts and real energy.  A system designed to protect children must protect children.  The system must be accountable.  It must be consistent.  It must always seek to minimise the risk to the welfare of the child.  It is salutary that one quarter of our population are children.  When we talk about the political response to this, we should not lose sight of that fact.  They are our greatest national resource.  The right service at the right time is crucial, and we must get it right for every family and every child.  We need to imagine a Republic where all children are treated equally.  Any such republic must necessarily include a robust, 24 hour, 365 day a year service - I am passionately of that view - alongside a properly co-located service.  The manner in which society treats its vulnerable citizens reflects not only its qualities but also its sense of justice, its commitment to the future and its ambition to enhance the human condition for the next generation.</p></speech>

It gives a clear picture of what life is like.  He said that he hopes after the outrage comes the action.  Me too.  He also described how life is lived for some of our vulnerable children.  Those were poignant, strong and profound statements.  We will now take questions from the committee.  I will call Deputy Jan O'Sullivan first, as she has to leave.  If he does not mind, Dr. Shannon might take two or three questions at a time in case of repetition.  When everyone is finished, he might allow me to ask a couple of questions as well.  I call Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.</p></speech>

The extraordinary passion that Dr. Shannon brings to the welfare of children is hugely significant.  I thank him for his report.  I immediately propose what he suggested at the start about inviting him back.  I do not know if he has a monitoring role in terms of implementation.  If he does not, he should.  Implementation is absolutely crucial, as he and the Vice Chairman have stated.</p> <p>  The main issue for me concerns co-location and inter-agency communication.  Representatives of Tusla have attended the committee and we have already had some discussion around Dr. Shannon's report.  As Dr. Shannon said, notification is not communication and we need a working relationship that puts the children at its centre.  In his written submission to the committee, Dr. Shannon said that the audit sought to evaluate the nature of inter-agency communication between Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that it sought to examine the processes and cultures, if any, in which Tusla social workers provide feedback on cases to Garda members following their removal of children under section 12.  Section 12 is relied on where there is a serious and urgent child protection risk.  It is an extraordinary responsibility for the Garda and, from what Dr. Shannon said in the report, it is highly sensitive to it.  The real concern, however, is the fact that there does not seem to be the interaction and real mutual respect for professionals that Dr. Shannon spoke about as well.</p> <p>  The Minister has stated that she will publish an implementation plan and speaks about having an assigned social worker to the recently established Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na national child protection unit.  What I want to tease out  is what is required at the local level for each individual child in terms of communication between the Garda and Tusla and the requirement on Tusla to have that real proper communication, feedback and engagement with other services and not just the Garda.  This may be with teachers or whoever else might identify issues for children.  That is the main area I wanted to ask Dr. Shannon about.</p> <p>  I fully support Dr. Shannon in terms of the need for a full 24 hour, out of hours service for all children in the country.  The ISPCC, which operates a listening service, has pointed out to us as well that it is absolutely essential.  Does Dr. Shannon know if there is some kind of resistance from Tusla to that?  I do not know if there is but I would be interested to know if there is.  As a committee, we have to say that it is essential.</p> <p>  There is a new system called Signs of Safety being introduced by Tusla.  I was pursuing this last week.  It sounds good in so far as it is concerns involving and training people such as garda&iacute;, teachers and community people.  I do not know enough about it.  It will be implemented.  Tusla staff are already being trained in it.  My specific question relates to risk assessment in that situation and ensuring that, when spreading responsibility for child safety, we are not in a way leaving nobody responsible where there is a significant risk level.  I apologise for all the questions.</p></speech>

I will start off with the Signs of Safety framework.  I welcome the development but it needs to be monitored.  It is the primary responsibility of the State to ensure that children are properly protected.  That cannot be delegated to any third party.  We need a conversation around the benefits of Signs of Safety, and there are undoubted benefits, but also the downsides of this approach.  It is a core part of the Tusla vision and therefore needs to be comprehensively examined.  It is beyond this discussion but the issue is a particularly important one because it will have a profound impact on how children are protected within this jurisdiction.  It needs a much broader discussion.</p> <p>  In respect of inter-agency co-operation, I support the ISPCC approach.  Sometimes I think that there is a misunderstanding on the issue of inter-agency co-operation.  I have read the transcript from last week's meeting.  If I may, I will reference a number of the issues raised.  They include a national call centre where social workers consult with and provide advice to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I do not see that as a robust, national, out of hours service.  It is a stop gap and I acknowledge the fact that in November 2015 it was a significant step forward and that there were the beginnings of an out of hours service.  However, and I must say this publicly, if we are referencing Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow and Cork city as areas where there is a "full social work service", I come back to the point I raised earlier about those children who happen to have a need.  I refer the committee again for further consideration to page 50 of my report.  If we look at the areas outside of those discrete towns and cities, we will see that there is a need.</p><p>I would argue that even if only a small number of children require a service, why should those children not receive a service?  I would also argue that the children most in need of a service are the children who seek to access State services after 5 o'clock in the evening or over a weekend.  Sometimes those are the children with challenging emotional behavioural problems and, arguably, they need an enhanced social work service because of the difficulties presented.</p><p> To come back to the audit, it unambiguously found poor inter-agency co-operation.  Even if that was the perception among rank and file members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it is problematic.  If one agency believes there is a mystification and a lack of understanding of the way Tusla operates, it is a real challenge for the child protection system in terms of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na exercising their powers but not understanding what is happening next.</p><p> If I could share with the committee what I wanted to do, I had provided Tusla with a robust proposal to delve deeper into the Tusla involvement.  What is needed, and I see a reference to it in the Minister's statement this morning, is to look at what happens next.  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire referenced some public comments around this broader audit of the system.  We need to get a 360 degree picture as to how the system operates.</p><p> I share Deputy O'Sullivan's views on all the issues she raised.  I am conscious of her long track record in this area, but the key issue for me is around implementation in a meaningful manner, not a document.  It is how those actions are implemented and that there will be a timeline in respect of the implementation of those actions.  That is what I will be suggesting.  I hope that answers Deputy O'Sullivan's questions.</p></speech>

I said it at the time and I will say it again.  The audit was a remarkable piece of public service.  The report underlines that there were examples but some of the examples given in the approximately 91 cases were shocking.  Anyone would find them harrowing.  They show the adverse and difficult circumstances in which many young people in Ireland grow up.  It was well worth shining a light on that and the way it is being dealt with.</p> <p>  One aspect that was clear in the audit was that there were difficulties between the two agencies specifically involved, namely, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla.  It is worth stating that the audit clearly shows that there is a high level of commitment on the part of the individuals involved, and I acknowledge that the work is very difficult.  There are great difficulties facing social workers and garda&iacute; and they show a great deal of commitment but in regard to Tusla in particular, and we discussed it last week, there seems to be both structural and cultural issues which raise very serious concerns.  We discussed individual cases, but the concern was not simply about the individual cases.  It was the structural and cultural weaknesses that existed.  As far as I recall, the culture referred to by a number of garda&iacute; was one of people leaving it until the last minute on a Friday to get in contact with the garda&iacute;.  I ask Mr. Shannon to comment on that and on his experience of cultural issues because that seems to be a significant concern.</p> <p>  The issue of inter-agency co-operation has been largely dealt with, but I might return to it later.  On the area of out-sourcing which we discussed in considerable detail last week also, I expressed my concern about that.  The level of reliance on agencies, particularly the Five Rivers agency, in the past 15 to 20 years has become very significant.  A huge proportion of the out of hours cases are referred to it.  In particular, I expressed my concern that that agency has the ability, and exercises it, to refuse to accept children who it perceives as displaying problematic behaviours and who could then end up in Garda stations or other unsuitable places.  That is a very unsatisfactory, dangerous and problematic situation.  I would like to hear Dr. Shannon's response to that and what he believes should be done about that reliance.</p> <p>  I was interested to hear Dr. Shannon's comment on the issue of an audit because as he noted, it was an issue I raised last week and on a number of other occasions.  The question of whether our child protection services are fit for purpose needs to be asked.  If they are not, how do we get to the bottom of that?  Does it require a full audit of our child protection services and, if so, what would that involve?  Are we looking specifically at section 13 or is a much broader audit of child protection services required?  Dr. Shannon might give us a roadmap on how to get to a child protection service that is adequate and fit for purpose in an Ireland that passed the children's referendum.</p> <p>  We had a brief discussion on Tusla's response to the audit on the day and subsequently.  A press release was issued.  It was withdrawn.  Last week's statement from Tusla stated that no member of staff was involved as part of the methodology for conduction the review or writing the report.  I would be interested in Dr. Shannon's response in terms of the nature of his communication with Tusla, his subsequent communication with Tusla and, harking back to the previous question, his engagement with Tusla on a further audit.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.124" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Geoffrey Shannon" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017062800002#L00500"><p>Yes, it would be very helpful.  If I can start with the last question, I made extensive efforts to consult with Tusla prior to the audit commencing.  That dates back to when Gordon Jeyes was the national director.  I sent what was then the proposal to Gordon Jeyes.  Once Fred McBride was appointed chief executive officer I sent a copy of the framework to him at that stage.  As this was an audit of the exercise by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of their child protection powers, it was looking at it with that lens.<br/><br/>In response to Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's question, I had suggested that we needed that complete picture.  There has been much discussion around the 91 cases and whether there should be a further review.  If I can I will use take this opportunity to say that I have written to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have asked for my view on this and what I say is that it is nowhere suggested in the report that those cases are either all examples of problematic cases, since they are not, or that they are exclusive examples.  I say that the cross-section of these instances was used to reflect the themes arising in the course of the audit and, for example, to illustrate the grounds pursuant to which section 12 was invoked.  I say also that a further examination of these particular examples set out in the audit would not be helpful or appropriate in the context of all other cases which arose, and that there are data protection issues as well.  The data provided from the PULSE review is only one of several bases of research set out in the audit to include interviews with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, reviews of questionnaires and other documentation on focus groups.  I say that I believe there is little or no purpose to further examining these historical cases, which have already had the benefit of a thorough examination, and that I would respectfully submit that the interests of children the subject of section 12 orders would be best served by enabling the previously proposed contemporary review of section 13 cases to proceed as speedily as possible.<br/><br/>What I wanted to do was look at the system as it operates currently.  It is all very well to say that these were historic concerns.  We need to look at whether there were contemporary concerns.  I had prepared a detailed proposal, which I had sent to Tusla.  Issues emerged regarding the <i>in camera</i>rule and to sample.  There were a number of females with Tusla in August of last year, but suffice it to say that conducting this further stage of the audit was a lengthy process.</p><p>What I wanted in regard to section 13, if it were possible, is that it would mirror the same size and the scale of the Garda audit in order that we could have a broad systemic review of the system as it operated but difficulties were identified.  I am not going to get into the nature of the correspondence but suffice it to say a number of emails were exchanged and some time was spent developing a proposal.  I made every effort to consult with Tusla on this project in so far as it was relevant because we were looking at what happens when a child is removed under section 12.  The sad reality is that in some of these cases Tusla has a very minor involvement because the children, in some cases, were brought by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to a private provider, the Five Rivers organisation.  I want to state publicly that I found no fault with the Five Rivers organisation.  I will address later the point Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire mentioned, and I share his view on the State outsourcing its child protection responsibilities to anything other than a State agency.  I have said publicly, not only in this but in other forums, that I have a big difficulty with this.  We know what happened in the past when the State outsourced its services.  If there is anything we have learned from the past it is that the State must take responsibility.  It is very similar to the question Deputy Jan O'Sullivan raised regarding the fact that the State has to assume responsibility in this regard.  </p><p> I received a letter from Mr. Gordon Jeyes's successor, Mr. Fred McBride, and I will read extracts from it.  It stated that Tusla has welcomed the strong collaborative approach I took to our shared agendas.  It also noted that as stated previously and publicly, the report has provided very important insights into the child protection system in Ireland and provided Tusla with a greater impetus to address the challenges.  It further states the media statements made by Tusla were simply an attempt to clarify that the audit was solely focused on a review of section 12, as undertaken by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that my findings were based on information obtained through what it calls my detailed and comprehensive review of information obtained from the Garda.  It references stage 5, which is what I had hoped to do in regard to section 13, which would have been a further stage of the audit.  It states that other than the basic information provided to me on the emergency out-of-hours service, the audit did not review any file material.  The audit could not review it because the intent of the review was to look at section 12.  I wanted to look at section 13, and I am not going to go into the detail of the correspondence, but I wanted to do it at the same scale and with integrity.  The reality is that there were difficulties on who would fund that process. </p><p> I am an independent person in that if I prepare a report, I would regard it as not being subject to review by any third party.  I produced the report as it appears.  That would be a key feature in my becoming involved in any such process.  Mr. McBride's letter stated that this was in no way an attempt to undermine what he called the rigorous research I undertook.  It is important to note he also stated he was equally aware that I had met the interim director of policy and strategy and the head of legal services in November last year, when I read sections of the draft report to them and outlined some of the key legal issues from the audit, including the need to review the contract with Five Rivers.  I had identified at that stage that there was no reference in the contract with Five Rivers to the foster care regulations, a key part of best practice in the area, and my understanding is that Tusla may have changed the contract in the intervening period.  We also discussed the need to expand the emergency out-of-hours provision and the need to address the challenges of suitable placement for children with complex emotional behavioural difficulties.  The members can see from that the engagement I have had was appropriate and I made every effort, in so far as it was appropriate, to consult with Tusla on this project.  I acknowledge the programme of reform being undertaken by Tusla.  Everybody wants Tusla to succeed but what we need to do is to have an honest conversation.  This report shines a light on an area that, to date, has not received much attention.  </p><p> As for children with emotional behavioural problems, I was deeply troubled by the finding that children who presented to the private provider did not receive a service because there was a suspicion that the young person had consumed alcohol or drugs.  In those circumstances, arguably, I would submit that it is more important that they would receive a proper service.  I read the Minister's statement this morning that there would be a review of the legislation as to whether there are legislative issues to be dealt with in the context of this issue.  It is deeply concerning that children would end up in Garda stations or in hospital beds because there is not a proper service available to them, not least because this has an impact on the criminal justice system and the health system because a young person would be taking up a hospital bed or depleting Garda resources sometimes in areas where those resources are challenged.</p><p> My view on outsourcing is very clear.  We should have a seamless social work service and we need a comprehensive social work service.  We should be in no doubt that co-location involves investment.  It involves a Government commitment and such a commitment needs to be given.  If we want to have a comprehensive child protection system, it will involve a cost.  If our greatest national resource is our children, surely it is worth spending that money because it will reap rewards in terms of better outcomes for children upstream rather than having to deal with problems downstream.  I hope I have answered Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.127" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Geoffrey Shannon" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017062800002#M00300"><p>I suggest the focus on section 13 would then provide the basis and the question on the broader audit might well emerge from that.  What I have - hopefully successfully - undertaken is a highlighting of how the section 12 process operates.  I am confident the conclusions I have arrived at demonstrated two high-level points, in that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na exercised its powers proportionately.  There is no evidence of racial profiling.  What it demonstrates is poor inter-agency co-operation between the agencies.  We now need to examine what happens next in the aftermath of the section 13 review and having looked at the court files.  I had seen this in three phases, first, looking at the section 12 phase, next looking at section 13, in other words, what happened when the case ended up in Tusla's office and then what happened ultimately when the case was disposed of by the court.  That would give us a comprehensive picture as to how a large part of our child protection system operates.  If that produces issues that need further explanation, I would suggest at that stage that we would consider a broader audit.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question and is of assistance.</p></speech>

I am delighted he is on the side of children.  He has swept away the politics and engaged in straight talking in claiming the independence of his office.  He has been very strong on that and about not being influenced.</p> <p>  We have been comprehensively dealing with a Public Health (Alcohol) Bill in the Seanad.  I regret that the former Minister of State is no longer in her former position.  She was very purposeful in brushing aside any vested interest that lobbied and was seen to try to dilute that Bill and its potency for children and their parents.  Alcohol is a leading cause of dysfunction and mental ill-heath in our country and that affects our children from pre-birth and infancy and upwards.</p> <p>  We discussed mental health earlier and Senator Freeman made a presentation on it.  Our lack of mental health services is a child protection issue.  We are woeful in what we are doing in that area.  We are trying to kick-start the process and get something done immediately to protect our children because it is a child protection issue.</p> <p>  Representatives of Tusla appeared before the committee last week.  The culture in that agency is one of defensiveness but we need to get beyond that.  There are reasons for it being defensive but that agency is the foundation of in terms of where our children are at in this State and looking after them, making sure we can embrace that and can nurture them.  Tusla is not doing that.  I put it to one of its representatives that the agency is not fit for purpose.  We need to promote it, encourage it, and bring it up to the level where our children are adequately embraced and looked after.</p><p>Childhood is limited and we need to recognise that every slow step of politics and legislation condemns more children to an adulthood or young adulthood of broken promises that we have not kept.  We need to be more immediate and be seen to be more immediate.</p><p> Dr. Shannon alluded to the reference to equality in the Proclamation of 101 years ago.  I always allude to the pursuit of happiness of every child.  Some of the children Dr. Shannon has dealt with and some who I have dealt with professionally have never known the concept of happiness.  That is an emotional feeling.  What is happiness?  Children should own happiness every day.  Yet, every day some of the children we deal with do not know that concept or what it means.</p><p> Will Dr. Shannon talk about co-location in a practical sense?  How does he envisage it in the Garda station or wherever the co-location happens?  Where does Dr. Shannon envisage it?  Who does he envisage being involved?  Is it going to be overly bureaucratic?  Are we going to try to simplify it in the interests of expediency, ticking the boxes and ensuring that we do the right thing?  We will always take risks in making decisions.  We are adults but we do not know every answer to every question.  A duty of care to the mental and physical well-being of children will guide us in everything we do.  I thank Dr. Shannon and I am delighted that he is on the side of our children.</p></speech>

If you wish, please go ahead and answer Senator Devine's questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.131" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Geoffrey Shannon" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017062800002#N00300"><p>I will start with the last question.  It seems to be a trend.  The question of how this can be realised is particularly important.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na confirmed to me on Friday last week that it will be implementing without delay all of the recommendations in the report, and a key part of these is co-location.  The way that will operate at a practical level involves specialist child protection units being established.  There will be a social worker with a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We will have joint decision making.</p> <p>  That is why I was trying to make that link and reduce the reliance on the national out-of-hours service.  We will be building up expertise where it is needed, that is to say, in the local Garda station.  The vision is that 28 social workers would be assigned to the various units.</p> <p>  Senator Devine asked what I would like to see in terms of practical recommendations.  I would like to see from members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla a joint plan, perhaps presented to this committee, on how it is envisaged that this proposal will be rolled out along with the timeline.  What I have seen in respect of the four specialist child protection units has been impressive in terms of far greater cohesion between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla.  We build up a relationship of trust when we work with people on a daily basis - no one needs a high-level degree to understand that.  Sometimes the simple solutions are the most effective solutions.</p> <p>  The one key recommendation in this report is the recommendation around the need for co-location and the need for it to happen as soon as possible.  Senator Devine is absolutely right: we need to make it real.  We need a roadmap for how and when this is going to happen.  Otherwise, we could be back here next year.  That is why I hope it was not inappropriate for me to suggest that we review this a year from now.  I have considerable experience of reports and I have been central to the drafting of many reports where many of the recommendations remain un-implemented.  I hope this report will be one of the first reports in respect of which there will be a speedy implementation plan.  My key recommendation at the end of the report was that, one year from the date of publication, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would publically demonstrate the efforts undertaken to implement the recommendations.</p> <p>  I share the view of Senator Devine on mental health issues.  In my view the State has a mandatory obligation to protect children and ensure children who are in need of services receive those services.  A key part of that is the mental health issue.  There is a natural alignment between the presentation this morning and my presentation, because many of the issues to emerge in the audit revolve around children with mental health issues and how, if those issues go undiagnosed, they can have far-reaching consequences.</p> <p>  The final issue raised related to alcohol.  That is a key issue.  In fact, it is the stand-out issue from this report.  Everywhere we turn in this report alcohol features.  This is a national crisis.  Committee members should be in no doubt that it needs urgent Government response.  However, it is not only a question of an urgent Government response; there are far broader societal issues.</p> <p>  There are several key recommendations.  I met officials from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and I warmly welcome the commitment of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone.  Undoubtedly, she is a committed Minister.  There is an implementation plan in this report and the fact that she has come out so quickly with an implementation plan is impressive.  I notice that as part of the implementation plan the report is to be sent to the Minister for Health.  This is a key part of it.  I am conscious of the fine work done by Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy in the area and I wish to acknowledge it.  However, we cannot afford any further delay.</p> <p>  I have asked for an additional feature when Tusla undertakes a risk assessment.  If a parent is persistently abusing alcohol, that should be a risk indicator.  Some of the examples in chapter 3 will horrify committee members.  I still have memories of tracking these cases on the PULSE system.  It beggars belief how some of these children are treated.  This demands not only a Government response but a societal response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.132" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1231" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017062800002#N00400"><p>I thank Dr. Shannon for an outstanding report.  This is the third time we have had conversations since the report was launched.  Hindsight and 20/20 vision are great things.  If we had known some of the answers this morning we might have approached Tusla somewhat differently last week.</p> <p>  In her statement this morning the Minister said that there is a new inter-agency protocol reflecting the children first legislation and that it is awaiting sign-off by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I would welcome some commentary around that and what exactly needs to be done there.</p> <p>  In response to Senator Devine, Dr. Shannon mentioned 23 social care workers.  Does this correspond to 23 divisions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where we are looking at doing the co-location?  How will that come with the data protection and some of the problems that Dr. Shannon has encountered along the way?  Do we have the systems in place and the communication between both organisations such that they can interact and use the same computer database?  Even though we might not have an out-of-hours service, we have built up trust and knowledge.  How do we access the information around the families?  I believe that is a major part of it.</p> <p>  I was concerned to hear about the repeated removal of children from families.  Once was acceptable but twice is unforgivable.  What was the link with Tusla at that stage?  When it becomes repeated, then all of a sudden a pattern is developing.  Were people removed more than once?  Were there instances where this was repeated?  That is an interesting part of it because to me it shows that the system failed completely.</p> <p>  I thank Dr. Shannon for his openness and honesty in respect of the fact that he engaged with Tusla.  While I know the report was commissioned by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na I was of the opinion that Tusla did not have a role to play because this was a report of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the force requested the audit to be carried out.  Dr. Shannon has told us how, after the audit, he engaged with Tusla in November and December 2016.  Tusla was aware of this before it came out.  Has Tusla asked Dr. Shannon or invited Dr. Shannon to continue with the next section of it?  Has that door been opened?</p> <p>  The report is outstanding.  It is live and in-the-moment and we have 91 cases.  Have we looked at any preventative measures other than those identified by Dr. Shannon?  Has Tusla asked Dr. Shannon about aspects that it would like guidance with, for example, the structure of frameworks to be put in place?</p><p>There are aspects here on which we would like guidance, with structures and frameworks put in place.  Can he continue with this work?  It would be hugely important for me to understand that there is continuation, that this is the start of a scope of work where we have done the audit.  However, it will be no good unless we have implementation and an action plan for that implementation.</p><p> While I welcome what the Minister highlighted this morning, I am worried about timeframes.  In terms of what the Minister outlined this morning, Tusla is to have actioned something.  What is Dr. Shannon's comment on manageable timeline expectations?</p><p> There is a national crisis around alcohol and drugs.  Alcohol abuse was a key issue running through Dr. Shannon's report.  What can this committee do about this?  Does Dr. Shannon recommend we invite in the Minister for Health to discuss that central element?  Are there other issues he feels we should highlight with the Minister?  I thank Dr. Shannon again for his report.  It was mind-blowing.</p></speech>

On the question about the follow-through of section 13, I can say publicly that I have framed a proposal on this.  I am not sure what the Minister's intentions are on this and this committee will have to ask about that.  I have about as much information as the members do.  The press release states that &quot;the Minister has asked Tusla to commission independent research immediately into Tusla's current practice where children come into care following an emergency intervention by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&quot;.  I presume that is a reference to section 13.  I am not asking that I be asked to undertake this piece of work but there is real value in me continuing, having spent some time on it until now.  I do not know if this is an attempt to say that somebody other than myself will be asked to undertake this research.  All I can say publicly is that I have given a lot of thought to how this could be undertaken.  I am not suggesting that it should be me but I am saying that from a State perspective there are benefits to having spent two years and thousands of hours on framing the first part of this proposal.  The committee may know that I have made some professional sacrifices to continue this work.  I am passionately committed to it.  I share Deputy Rabbitte's view that this needs to be done as soon as possible.  I am anxious to be honest with this committee.<br/><br/>When it came to the repeated removals, I was able to track them on the PULSE system and track whether or not the same child was subject to a section 12 within a relatively short period of time.  Question marks will, of course, arise.  It comes back to the Deputy's question, however, which was quite an important observation.  When attempting to look at this one is faced with a difficulty around the <i>in camera </i>rule.  If the child has been subject to care proceedings, one could run into this kind of difficulty in the next stage of the audit.  Ministerial direction would give the Minister much greater power.  Even if this required a legislative amendment, I think that this is a hugely important piece of work and one worth pursuing.  We need to have the full picture.<br/><br/>Hand on heart, I cannot give the committee an honest answer to the question of repeated removals.  What I can say, however, is that there was more than one episode of repeated removals under section 12 from the same family circumstances.  I cannot give an answer as to whether or not that was appropriate.  That answer lies in the comprehensive examination of a large number of cases to see how many were subject to repeated removals and whether or not they were justified.  That is important.<br/><br/>The Deputy is also right about the data protection issues.  This day next week I will appear before the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality to discuss the general data protection regulation.  I am happy to share my presentation for that meeting with this committee if it is of assistance.  There are important data protection issues.  I have long argued that both the <i>in camera </i>rule and data protection are there to protect citizens, not the system.  If they are used as a defence mechanism, then the Legislature needs to address this.  Data protection emerged as a central problem again and again through the course of the audit.  I have indicated in meetings with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs that if there is a legislative difficulty and a perception of a legislative difficulty from the perspective of either the Department of Children and Youth Affairs or the Department of Justice and Equality in the context of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, then there is an obligation on the Legislature to legislate.  In no other jurisdiction that I have reviewed were data protection issues perceived as a barrier to child protection.  It would be a real tragedy if we were to use data protection as a barrier to protecting our children.  That would be lamentable.<br/><br/>I warmly welcome Deputy Rabbitte's comments about alcohol.  What she suggests would be very helpful.  The issue raised this morning about cross-departmental response and a whole-of-government approach is hugely important.  Alcohol is such a fundamental issue and I think the Deputy's suggestion is a very good one.  </p></speech>

There is a lot of information there for me to get my head around.  I recently had a communication from the office of the Minister for Justice and Equality about this report.  It stated that the then T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, agreed that a protocol would be signed between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla on the operation of section 12 and that personnel from Tusla would be co-located at the national child protection unit at the Garda National Protective Services Bureau.</p> <p>  I also received an update from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on both of these issues, the first being the signing of a protocol between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla on the operation of section 12.  It stated that following the development of a proposed agreed protocol between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla on the operation of section 12, the Garda National Protective Services Bureau, GNPSB, had forwarded the document to policy development, implementation and monitoring, PDIM, for the section's consideration and that a response was expected from the PDIM in the near future after which such arrangements would be made for it to be signed.</p> <p>  On the second issue of the proposed co-location of Tusla personnel at the national child protection unit at the GNPSB, it stated that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na welcomed the intention of Tusla to co-locate Tusla personnel at the national child protection Unit at the GNPSB and awaited the receipt of a communication from Tusla in that regard and that upon receipt of confirmation from Tusla of its intention to co-locate Tusla personnel at the national child protection unit, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will immediately commence discussion with the agency with a view to making of necessary arrangements regarding such issues as role profiles, duties, roster periods, line management, etc.  It stated also that the NCPU had only recently been established and was currently working to advance the readiness of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for commencement for the Children First Act 2015 and that it was envisaged that the proposed secondment of Tusla personnel would take place post-commencement of the Act but that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would discuss earlier secondment of relevant personnel if proposed by Tusla.</p> <p>  That is just an update I received for the purposes of this committee.</p> <p>  Dr. Shannon has done work on the drug and alcohol area and I found his findings extremely interesting.  What we have to do here is to educate people about the issue of alcohol and its knock-on effects.  Many people are unaware of these, and I have also spoken to Senator Black about this.  Many people are unaware of the knock-on effects that even moderate or chronic moderate alcohol intake can have.  In anything we do on alcohol, we need to prioritise where it is that we need to specifically target.  Sometimes we get blanket approaches that are so spread out that they lose their effectiveness.  Behaviour towards and consumption of alcohol has changed over the last ten to 15 years.  Binge drinking was not the phenomenon 20 or 25 years ago that it is today.  We also have drugs and alcohol, uppers and downers, being used together, in particular by young people and unfortunately also by children of 14, 15 or 16 years of age.  We have a huge binge drinking culture.</p><p>My view is that what we need to do is prioritise and target a specific area.  The binge drinking culture is affecting the situation, notwithstanding the findings of Dr. Shannon across the board.  Perhaps it is not a question Dr. Shannon can answer, but from my own research the consummation of alcohol in Ireland has dropped by 25% in the past 15 years but the question is whether the abuse of alcohol has increased.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.137" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Geoffrey Shannon" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017062800002#P00200"><p>I think I can answer that question with a little insight because I co-chaired with the current chair of the Child and Family Agency the review of the just under 200 children who died in State care over a period of ten years.  Alcohol was a central feature of that report.  If we roll on to 2015 I returned to look at the issue and found it is as prominent as it was in 2010.  While the pattern of drinking may change, I would argue that the abuse of alcohol has not changed.  I am being very honest with this committee.  The issue is our ambivalence towards alcohol and whether we perceive alcohol as a risk indicator.</p> <p>  All I can do is respond in so far as it impacts on child protection.  In terms of the implementation plan prepared by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, which I welcome on this issue in particular, Tusla needs to confirm that persistent alcohol abuse is seen as a risk indicator and that is something we need to tackle.  I have had the benefit of looking at the approach of other jurisdictions and relative to other jurisdictions Ireland is particularly ambivalent because there seems to be a culture within this jurisdiction of a certain level of alcohol abuse being acceptable, yet the evidence points to the fact that it has a profound impact on child protection and welfare.  It impacts also in a very significant way at a financial level because it places an insufferable burden on the child protection system.  I think that this needs a whole-of-society approach as well as a Government-led approach.  I acknowledge the fact that there has been an implementation plan and that the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs met on the Thursday following the publication of the report.  The point I am making this morning is that not only do we need an implementation plan but we need a timeline.  An implementation plan is only a piece of paper unless the recommendations are actioned, and there needs to be a regular review as to what is happening.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.139" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Geoffrey Shannon" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017062800002#P00400"><p>Yes, I can respond to that by referring to the cases I was reviewing.  I have had the benefit of looking at a large amount of PULSE data which gives one an insight into the changing face of substance abuse.  It is not just alcohol, there certainly is an increasing tendency towards drug abuse and I think there is a message therein for legislators in terms of much tougher legislation being introduced on drug use in terms of its impact on children and vulnerable people.  The landscape has changed.  My view is that there is an increasing instance of drug and solvent abuse.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.140" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1266" speakername="Kathleen Funchion" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017062800002#P00500"><p>I also thank Dr. Shannon for his presentation.  It is refreshing to have someone speak so genuinely and passionately about children's rights because as I have said previously we continuously fail children in this State, both in the past and present.</p> <p>  Deputy Rabbitte touched on some of the questions I wanted to ask about section 12.  Where there is repeated removal of a child, what recourse is there for a garda who comes across such situations on a regular basis?  Is there anything he or she can do?  Lack of accountability is an issue.  Social workers can say the Garda is dealing with an issue because it was out of hours and then the Garda can say it thought the case had been handed over to a social worker.  The inter-agency approach outlined by Dr. Shannon would address such situations because there must be accountability.  Where does the buck stop in the case of repeated removals?  Is it with Tusla?  Can we say Tusla is failing children in such situations?  If a child is constantly being removed it is the role of Tusla to oversee that.</p> <p>  Tusla was before the committee last week.  I said that personally I did not have any confidence in it and the role it plays and that it has failed far too many children.  A case was referenced about two foster children in the same home where there were repeated complaints by the birth mother of one of the children.  The response, that one would not necessarily remove a child as it could be detrimental and one would have to review the situation and monitor it and put different systems in place, was very vague.  Does Dr. Shannon have any comments on a case such as the one I outlined where there are two foster children and there are repeated difficulties of a serious nature?  What is best practice in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.141" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Geoffrey Shannon" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017062800002#P00600"><p>I thank Deputy Funchion very much for her questions.  The broader issue was raised by Deputy O'Sullivan on the terms of Signs of Safety.  We need an honest discussion on the issue.  In fairness, while I cannot comment on the individual case what we need to do is take a positive approach to child protection.  All I can tell the Deputy is what the State's obligations are.  Article 19 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child provide that children are entitled to be protected from harm and ill treatment.  It is a mandatory obligation to protect children from harm and abuse.  That is the standard.  That is reflected in our domestic legislation.  The Constitution also provides for that.  In implementing Signs of Safety, Tusla must have regard to that.  It is not just a passive approach.  There is a legal obligation on the State to be proactive in protecting children.  That is why I think we need to look at the policy which is Signs of Safety, alongside the legal obligations that exist.  Deputy Funchion has raised a really interesting question which deserves an entire discussion because if the future of child protection is going to revolve around Signs of Safety, surely that demands a national discussion around this issue?  It is a very important issue.</p> <p>  The second issue the Deputy raised concerned repeated removals.  The difference between this research and other pieces of research is that it was a very active piece of research.  I travelled around the country with a small number of colleagues, Cian O'Connor, Hilary Coveney Nash and Dr. Imelda Ryan, who is a child psychiatrist.  We met with individual garda&iacute;.  We are not cub researchers.  We are very experienced professionals looking at this issue and what we were getting from members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is mystification as to what happened next.  I share Deputy Funchion's response.  It is all down to inter-agency communication and co-operation.  That ties in with what Deputy Rabbitte said.  I asked why the information cannot be shared.  The perception of the Garda is that there is a data protection issue.  I cannot see how there would be a data protection issue in having a case conference at the end of the year, going through a number of cases that occurred during the year and examining what happened next.  That is why I passionately believe that the next phase, looking at section 13, is important, so we get the complete picture.  As I outlined this morning, I believe that co-location will provide a very real and meaningful impetus for change.  That is why this needs to happen within a specified timeline.  I am talking about the big picture issue, namely, broad structural change.  We need to reimagine our child protection system where all agencies work together to protect children.  There is a saying that it takes a village to rear a child but it takes all agencies working together to protect a child.</p></speech>

Dr. Shannon repeated a couple of phrases a few times, one of which is "a timeline".</p><p>I am sure Dr. Shannon was not being cynical, but how confident is he that the Garda and Tusla will ensure his recommendations are implemented?  Is he confident that the Garda and Tusla will follow through on the recommendations?  I fully agree with Dr. Shannon that someone should oversee whether the recommendations are implemented.  Dr. Shannon spoke about coming back in a year's time.  What if nothing has happened in a year?  There are 12,000 reports on children.  Where are they?  I am not sure whether I am out of order, and I hope I am not, but is there anything we can do to recommend that Dr. Shannon is the person to oversee implementation of his report?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.144" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Geoffrey Shannon" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017062800002#Q00200"><p>I would of course be delighted to be the person to oversee it.  I guarantee the committee that, as those around the table know, I will give an honest account.  Sometimes the truth is uncomfortable.  Nonetheless, I would not be doing the State any service by sugar coating any of the messages.  I have been around long enough to know that reports gather dust in a large number of situations.  We cannot afford for this to happen on this occasion.  The issues raised in the audit are hugely significant and strike at the heart of our child protection system.  As the Vice Chairman said, we need timely and meaningful implementation of the recommendations.  It cannot just be a box-ticking exercise.  When I looked at interagency co-operation I did so with a very neutral eye.  When I started to unpick it, what I found again and again is it was tokenistic.  It was about filling in a form and passing it on and the box has been ticked.  This is just not good enough for children.  Certainly from my review of section 12, and I have not done a section 13 review, we need agencies to move out of their silos and work together.  The report shines a light on the fact this is not happening.  It is not just Tusla or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is also about mental health services.</p> <p>  The points raised this morning are equally valid.  Children need a cohesive service.  They cannot be pushed from agency to agency.  The advantage of co-location is all of the services that children need would be located in one place.  This commends itself to a good sense.  It requires a complete rethink as to how we deal with child protection.  It would be an exciting project for the committee to undertake.  At present, discrete issues are dealt with as they arise.  I am calling for fundamental reform of our child protection system, which would bring about the cultural change required.  If that does not happen we will be back here in four or five years' time with quite a similar report and we will all be outraged.  As I said, and it was picked up on, after the outrage must come meaningful action.</p></speech>

I am an optimist by nature.  I welcome the Minister's statement this morning.  The Minister has a strong record in the area of human rights and I hope we can deliver on this.  Confidence requires a timeline for implementation.  It would be unfair and disingenuous of me to state that I have confidence until such time as I see the timeline and the staggered implementation of the recommendations.  I can say I am conscious of the fact and reassured that the Minister has moved very quickly to deal with this but I welcome it as first step.  The first step is we have the implementation plan.  I will state I have absolute confidence when the recommendations are implemented or there is significant progress in the implementation.  As I have also said, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have indicated they will implement them as soon as possible, but actions speak louder than words and this is something of which we should not lose sight.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.147" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1231" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017062800002#Q00500"><p>As I was listening to the questions I came up with a little brainwave.  The Garda requested the audit be carried out.  I sit on the joint policing committee in Galway.  It would be very welcome if An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na dedicated a section of its bimonthly report to children.  Various offences are documented in the report.  Could there be one specifically looking at where the Garda had to invoke a section 12 with regard to children, with a breakdown on whether there was domestic alcohol or drugs?  The spotlight would be shone at a local level every two months, which would feed into the national idea.  It would strengthen the hand of awareness and continuous media coverage, and it would keep it on the agenda.  Unfortunately if we do nothing we will not speak for a year and much might have passed.  Timelines are essential for implementation.  This is something to which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has access because it is on the PULSE system.  What does Dr. Shannon think of this idea?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.148" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Geoffrey Shannon" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017062800002#Q00600"><p>Information is power.  The proposal would enrich our understanding.  As part of the PULSE chapter I attempted to provide very detailed data.  We now have data, which is why I was slightly at a loss to understand why there was a recommendation on having to gather data on the demand for a national out of hours service.  I have an entire chapter detailing forensically the circumstances in which section 12 was invoked from 2008 to 2015.  This could be updated to look at 2016.  It is unlikely there will be a significant change over that longer period relative to the shorter period of time.  I support having this type of information in the public domain and that it is regularly available.</p> <p>  Deputy Rabbitte has prompted me to make a further observation.  It would be helpful if the implementation plan from the perspective of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would be shared with this committee.  This is the committee for issues relating to children.  I commend Detective Superintendent Declan Daly and Detective Inspector Michael Lynch, who are the two key lead people.  I found them very receptive to suggestions.  Continuing to feed the information gives us an accurate picture.</p> <p>  To come back to Deputy Funchion's question, it is not mystification.  Something that has remained with me since the audit is that rank and file members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are unsure as to what happened the case.  They are deeply invested.  The nation should be particularly proud of some of the junior rank and file members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I was hugely struck by the sheer commitment of young garda&iacute;.  I remember one case where a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na exercised section 12 powers on a Friday.  She said she thought of nothing else over the weekend only whether she had taken the right decision.  While I have criticised Garda training and the PULSE system, the State is well served by front-line social workers and front-line garda&iacute;.  What we need to do now is create the proper framework for our child protection system to operate.</p></speech>

There was another example of a child being returned to the person who was alleged to have abused that child.  I accept I am a layperson and these cases are illustrative.  Dr. Shannon spoke about mystification in terms of the Garda and I am mystified by a number of these cases.</p><p> Briefly, I wanted to ask about the 24-hour service.  In his audit, Dr. Shannon found that, in the context of the 24-hour service, garda&iacute; did not necessarily have access to the requisite files on the children who were the subject of section 12 orders.  I will ask a very simple question because Dr. Shannon has talked in terms of his confidence in progress and implementation.  Does Dr. Shannon believe Tusla is fit for purpose?  Does he believe our child protection service is fit for purpose?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.151" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Geoffrey Shannon" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017062800002#R00200"><p>It is a difficult and political question and I have always tried to stay out of the political domain.  Where we get confidence in our child protection system is in audits of this nature and people willing to accept where there are gaps.  We all make mistakes and we all can improve and we need to create a culture where we are receptive to change.</p> <p>  I am not avoiding the question.  I support Tusla's programme of reform.  It is hugely important that we have a child protection system that is fit for purpose.  That is unquestionable.  What Tusla now needs to do is build up public confidence in our child protection system.  That involves taking an open approach to all reports and being receptive to different approaches.  It comes back to Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's signs of safety.  Let us have a debate.  These decisions should be discussed at this committee.  This committee has a key role.  The members represent the citizens of this country.  It is important that the members have a say in how our child protection system operates.  Ultimately, these decisions will be taken by Tusla but having that conversation is important.</p> <p>  Coming to the discrete question, as I said, I am reluctant to comment on an individual case.  What I will say is that I accept the point that the public needs to have confidence in how individual cases are dealt with.  If, in fact, the factual matrix the Deputy presented is that the public needs to understand why it is acceptable that a child would remain in a high-risk environment, it is not sufficient to state that it is complex or challenging.  We need to be able to explain in layman's terms why, in situations such as the example the Deputy demonstrated, it may be acceptable from a child protection perspective for the child to remain in the family.  The case is one of many cases.  As I say, I have not seen the file and it would be unfair of me to comment on the individual case.  Nonetheless, there is an issue of public confidence.  Of course, the public, looking in at an example like that, should feel confident that the right decision was taken.  If the public does not, it undermines public confidence.</p></speech>

Given the challenges the Garda has had to go through over the past six to 12 months, it is imperative that we, as a committee, highlight that.  We see from Dr. Shannon's report and his audit that rank-and-file garda&iacute; are doing the job to the best of their ability and with the best of intentions.  We should highlight that rank-and-file garda&iacute; are out there and that the majority are doing the job for the right reasons.  That needs to be highlighted.  I welcome that from the report.  It is one aspect that struck me straight away.</p></speech>

I may have been an irritant at times as I continued to pursue, for example, the PULSE data.  I was forensic in terms of seeking answers to anomalies in the PULSE data.  I am concerned that we have a database where the only element of accountability is inserting details on the PULSE system, particularly if that system is not perfect.  One must remember that section 12 is exercised without a court warrant and the accountability that Deputies &Oacute; Laoghaire and Funchion referred to is in ensuring that there is an accurate recording.  I found that there was a receptiveness within that unit.  I cannot speak for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but I am giving an honest account.  While there are fundamental problems with how PULSE operates, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, by and large, does a good job when it comes to dealing with emergency child protection.</p></speech>

Knowing that makes the terrible issues a tiny bit softer.</p> <p>  I thank Dr. Shannon.  He really has been incredible this morning.  I thank him for the way he answered all the questions.  It was certainly a rapid-fire approach and we are very grateful.  If there is anything we can do, as I said, to promote or encourage that Dr. Shannon is part of the next stage, I am sure that the committee would agree to do something in that vein.</p> <p>  I was somewhat remiss earlier so I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, on his new appointment.  That is why I am here today.  I am only taking his place temporarily.  It is terrific that he has been made Minister of State at the Department of Health with special responsibility for mental health and older people.  We wish the Minister of State the greatest success.</p> <p>  I would like to introduce Ms Emer Crooke, who has replaced Ms Dervila Flynn as clerk to the committee.  I probably was not supposed to do this publicly but I am saying, "Hello and welcome", to her.</p> <p>  Before I adjourn proceedings until our next meeting on Wednesday, 12 July, I wish to point out that the latter is supposed to start at 10 a.m.  However, in order to help Deputy Function with her report, would it be acceptable to meet here at 9 a.m.?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.169" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2017062800002#A00600"><p>I move amendment No. 1:</p><blockquote>In page 3, to delete line 19 and substitute the following:&quot;In this Act&mdash;<br /><br />&quot;Act of 1998&quot; means the Education Act 1998;<br /><br />&quot;Act of 2000&quot; means the Equal Status Act 2000;<br /><br />&quot;The Council&quot; means the National Council of Special Education.&quot;.</blockquote> <p>This amendment provides that under this section, we would make reference to the Equal Status Act 2000 as well as the Education Act 1998, which is in the Bill, as put forward by the Government.  Everybody knows why I have put forward this amendment to make reference to the Equal Status Act.  It is because the Equal Status Act contains the infamous section 7(3)(c), which, incredibly and disgracefully, gives a derogation to religious schools to discriminate.</p><p>The Equal Status Act is supposed to eliminate discrimination and ensure equality, yet that subsection gives a derogation to schools to discriminate against the children of all people, which is shocking.  Amendments related to my amendment have been ruled out of order.  I find it extraordinary that an amendment relating to admission to schools has been ruled out of order simply because it relates to another Act.  That subsection of the Equal Status Act is the key to facilitating the ongoing discrimination against children in the vast majority of schools.  This intolerable provision has to be dealt with.  To discriminate against anybody is bad but to discriminate against children is outrageous.  A total of 72% of parents believe the law should be amended in order that baptism would no longer be a requirement for school admission, while 24% say they would not have baptised their children if they had not needed to do so to gain entry to schools.  It is incredible that people are baptising their children purely to gain admission to schools.  More than 90% of schools are Catholic and children who are not of that faith are segregated, excluded, isolated and made feel different because they do not share the dominant faith, yet they do not have the choice in many cases to attend a multi-denominational or a non-denominational school.  They are, therefore, forced into this invidious position.  Any reasonable person would say this is not acceptable.  Whatever reasons successive Governments had for kowtowing to the Catholic Church primarily and allowing them to dominate schools and pursue this discrimination, times have changed.  Even people who are of the Catholic faith recognise the inequity and injustice.  </p><p> As the Minister will be aware, another reason has emerged in the last while; as if the substantial discrimination against kids was not enough, those who run Catholic schools are now sick and tired of the Catholic Church's domination.  That has emerged in the recent period because of religious denominations selling off facilities and degrading the quality of schools and their facilities to pay off their debts or whatever else.  There is nothing for the Minister to be afraid of anymore because even the people running schools who may have long subscribed to their values and ethos are fed up with the church's domination of schools.  There is nothing to fear politically.  The discrimination is partially due to the political establishment being in hock to a particular religious viewpoint, but, more recently, it probably has just been caused by political fear of standing up to the Catholic Church because of the consequences that might flow from it.  However, there is no need to fear anymore.  On a moral, reasonable level, we should remove the baptism barrier under this legislation.  Even on a purely pragmatic, expedient, political basis, there is simply no reason to fail to do it anymore.  The Government should get on with it and do it.  It should even go beyond it and separate church and State completely in the entire education system and other areas.</p></speech>

I look forward to the passage of the Bill, but a number of major issues have not been dealt with.  Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett mentioned the provisions of the Equal Status Act.  I would be grateful if the Minister outlined his position on it and his intended approach in that regard because no amendments have been tabled.  Clearly, it is the ghost at the banquet and the issue that is central to school admissions, but it is not dealt with at all.  Many are waiting to see what will happen.  In particular, in the past week many school patrons who have a legitimate interest in the legislation have been having an uncertain time because they do not know what the position will be.  A consultation process is ongoing.  This is as good an opportunity as any for the Minister to outline his position</p> <p>  Second, the amendment also relates to the definition of the "National Council for Special Education", NCSE.  Some time ago I stated in the House that Fianna F&aacute;il would not be prepared to facilitate passage of the Bill if a provision, which has widespread support among Opposition parties, was not inserted in that regard, but it has been ruled out of order in our amendments.  It relates to giving the NCSE the power to mandate schools to establish special classes where it designates there is a need for it.  That remains our position and I look forward to a constructive debate with the Minister on the issue.  That has to happen and I understand he has given good consideration to the views that have been expressed on all sides of the political divide.  We would like that provision to be included in the legislation.  The NCSE would never use that power, but it would help a number of recalcitrant schools, particularly at second level, to provide the proper facilities for children for whom special classes may well be the answer.  I do not wish to hold up the debate because otherwise we will be here until all hours.</p></speech>

It is unthinkable we would debate a schools admission Bill and not address section 7(3)(c) of the Equal Status Act.  That is the primary means by which children are discriminated against in the school system and the notion of taking the Bill without addressing that section is just laughable.  I tabled an amendment to provide for the amendment of section 7(3)(c), but it has been ruled out of order.  I would like to challenge that ruling, which I do not accept.  I have been in touch with the secretariat and was told that it had been ruled out order under Standing Order 154, but that does not stand up.  The Standing Order states: "It shall be an instruction to all committees to which Bills may be committed that they have power to make such amendments therein as they shall think fit, provided that such amendments be relevant to the provisions of the Bill and are not in conflict with the principle of the Bill as read a second time".  Amendment No. 181 in my name would meet that requirement.  I do not know the basis on which, with others, it has been ruled out of order, but I am challenging the ruling because my strong view is that my amendment would be in order.</p></speech>

The amendment proposed to amend the Equal Status Act rather than any provision of the Bill.  It must be ruled out of order as it is outside the scope and not relevant to the provisions of the Bill.  I will not delay the meeting, but I am happy to discuss the matter with the Deputy after the meeting.</p><p>There is an opportunity to rethink and resubmit on Report Stage as well.  I shall not delay the meeting further by dealing either with this amendment that has been ruled out of order or, indeed, any of the other amendments.  A number of the amendments  have been ruled out of order by the Bills Office and I suggest that we proceed. </p></speech>

Through the Chair, I believe that section 7(3) of the Act is directly related to admissions to the schools.  The provision is fundamentally tied to it.  The baptism barrier is a huge issue in admission policies as it allows discrimination across the board.  It makes me wonder the following.  Why have we discussed the Labour Party's Equal Status (Amendment) Bill for more than a year?  Perhaps our discussions have been a complete waste of time and it should have been discussed by the Oireachtas Select Committee on Justice and Equality.  It is bizarre if we have been misguided in that way and the legislation will be delayed.</p> <p>  A huge issue of discrimination, along with the baptism barrier, is discrimination on the grounds of special educational needs.  That is why I echo what Deputy Byrne has said.  I am massively disappointed that the amendment that gives the National Council for Special Education the power to compel schools to open autistic units has been ruled out order.  </p></speech>

I intend to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage that deals with the issue that Deputy Byrne and other Deputies have raised.  It would provide that the National Council for Special Education could advise the Minister on the requirement to open a special class in schools.  I will bring forward a Report Stage amendment on that specific topic.</p> <p>  I shall bring forward Report Stage amendments on some other topics that I will mention for the sake of speeding up the committee.  While I am providing in primary legislation most of the provisions on prohibitive selective criteria, I will bring forward an amendment to provide that the Minister may still regulate on any criteria additional to those specified in primary legislation.</p> <p>  I will bring forward amendments to clarify that practices such as mandatory interviews, meetings, open days and testing of parents are prohibited in all cases, including where a school is not oversubscribed.  I shall table an amendment that provides for the replacement of a section 29 appeals committee member.  In other words, a member of an appeals committee could be replaced to allow continuity.  It is just an efficiency. </p> <p>  I will consider a concern that has been raised by a number of Deputies.  I refer to the ability of Irish language schools to prioritise children from Irish speaking homes.  I will reflect on how that option can be achieved in a fair way.  To clarify, I will bring forward amendments on Report Stage and there may be some additional tidying up amendments.</p> <p>  On the substance of amendment No. 1, everyone probably recognises that the Bill already provides for a definition of the Equal Status Bill in section 7.  The definition of the NCSE has been provided in the appropriate section, which I think is section 66.</p> <p>  I wish to be helpful on the wider issue.  The issue of religion in school admission is not currently in this Bill.  Previously I have indicated that I intend to act on this matter but on a separate track.  I have had consultations on the matter, as has the committee, and I know that the Labour Party is preparing a Bill.  I have always indicated that I think it is unfair that preference can be given by a denominational school to a child who lives far away over and above a child of no denomination, no religion background or a different one who lives close to the school.  I believe that parents should not feel obliged to have their child baptised.  </p> <p>  If today's Bill is passed then religion will not be used in the admissions for 80% of the schools, namely those that are not oversubscribed and no child may be turned away.  Religion cannot be used as a ground.  It is in respect of the 20% of other schools that the issue needs to be addressed.  Following the consultations and discussions, I would prefer to deal with this matter by removing religion as a criterion for admission to oversubscribed schools except in three limited circumstances - first, where it would otherwise be possible to maintain the ethos of the school; second, where the school is established by a minority religion in order to ensure that students of that religion can find a place in a school of that ethos; and third, where the school is established by a minority religion in order to admit a student of that religion who resides in a community consistently served by that school.  This is a version of one of the fourth options put forward to deal with this issue that we discussed before.  The reason I have put forward this provision is because I believe it is a fair way to provide options for parents of children of no denomination or, indeed, of a different one from their local school in order to get reasonable access to a school without unfairly encroaching on the rights of other parents who want to have their children educated in a particular ethos.  This is a fair and proportionate way of using the religious aspect.  It will mean that religion is only very rarely used as part of a school's admission criteria in the future.</p> <p>  At the same time the Bill recognises elsewhere other strengths of a school community.  For example, the school decides its admissions policy.  It can give priority to students from the local area, the siblings of existing pupils or the children and grandchildren of past pupils.  There can still be a strong ethos around the school, which I support.  </p> <p>  The provision protects minority religions.  Many sides expressed that concern when we debated this matter in the House.  At the same time the provision respects the Catholic community.  Ninety per cent of schools are now Catholic.  The provision ensures that a child can get reasonable access to a school of their denomination under the existing provisions where 90% of the children are accommodated. </p> <p>  I looked seriously at the catchment area.</p><p>Deputies from a number of parties were keen on that approach, but I believed it was not as good as the one I was taking because, although it would be an improvement, it would still leave children from non-denominational families at a considerable disadvantage in their local area.  It would also not be as good for many technical reasons.  There are no catchment areas.  If we were to wait for various denominations to come forward with catchment areas, we could be waiting a very long time.  There would need to be boundary commissions to deal with disputes over schools sharing catchment areas and so on, but that is a debate for another day.</p><p> This is a difficult constitutional issue.  There are provisions in the Constitution on religion, education and equality of treatment and we must steer a proposal such as this or any other advanced by members through them.  I will be consulting the Attorney General to make sure I can draft a robust amendment along the lines proposed to bring back to the committee in due course.  It was not intended to be the subject of today's debate.  We have had a separate track and separate consultations on it.  I hope the committee will accept my good faith in this matter.  Not everyone will agree with my proposal, but I ask people to consider it in order that when we do have a debate on the substantive issue, we can, I hope, reach some agreement on it.</p></speech>

Do not get me wrong: people have a right to their religion and if they wish to instruct their children on a particular religious view in their own time, privately or some other way, they are entitled to do so, but the idea that publicly funded schools could discriminate in any shape or form on the basis of religion, or any other basis, is just not acceptable.  That is what equality and equal status mean.  That is what equal admission to schools means.  Equality means no discrimination.  It is an unambiguous concept which does not need to be qualified.  The reason it is being qualified by the Government in its proposals which represent some improvement is we have outsourced our responsibility in the area of education to religious bodies.  Therefore, we are forced into trying to find compromises with them, but we should not have to and I do not accept it.  Equality is equality and equal status is equal status.  Eliminating discrimination should occur across the board or it is nothing.  Therefore, I will press the amendment.</p> <p>  With regard to the rest of the Bill, the removal of some of the soft barriers is an improvement.  I am not disputing that but to have a Bill about admission to schools that does not deal comprehensively with the issue of ensuring equality of access, on religious grounds, is not acceptable.  I forgot to mention in my introduction that I also have an amendment on the issue of special needs, special needs units and the obligations of schools in that regard, but it, too, has been ruled out of order.  That just does not make sense to me.  What I am describing are barriers to admission.  Barriers that are discriminatory or create a playing field that is not level are not acceptable.  Therefore, I will press the amendment.</p></speech>

When it is written down and the proposal on the Equal Status Act is also written down, we will certainly give them absolute consideration.  I am prepared to take the Minister at face value today, but I will certainly wait until Report Stage to deal with the issues in question.  The equal status issues and the baptism barrier ought to be dealt with in relatively short order because we just cannot keep talking about them.  We need action on them.

A very significant number of parents nowadays do not subscribe to the belief system of the patron of the school their children are attending.  We know that these children and their parents have a constitutional right to withdraw from that religious instruction, but I believe we need to go further than this.  We need to provide for the spirit of the constitutional protection.  As it is exercised within schools, it is quite divisive for children.  Certain children are excluded from the activities of the rest of their class.  This highlights difference between children.  I do not believe we should be doing this within the education system.  It also causes many organisational difficulties for schools.</p><p>At particular times of the year or in particular classes where a considerable amount of time is spent on preparation for the sacraments, it is especially unfair to children who do not subscribe to the faith formation activity in the school.</p><p> It is wholly inappropriate that religious instruction classes will be held during the school day.  There is a strong argument for moving them out of the school completely in the context of a publicly funded school.  This plays into the wider issue, which we discussed earlier, in respect of the rights of parents for their children to attend their local State-funded school and that it should be free of any religious influence - certainly free of denominational instruction - during the regular school day.</p><p> My three amendments provide for the timing of classes in religious instruction outside of the normal school day.  At a minimum, they should be moved to the last class slot in the day.  Ideally, they should be held after the normal school day and at school finishing time.  That is the only fair way of ensuring the integrity of the school day remains intact and that children are not made to feel excluded in any way because their parents have chosen for them not to attend faith formation classes.  We need to take this step now.  Ideally, it should be outside the regular school day.  At a minimum, we should be ensuring schools move faith formation to the last class in the day to allow parents the option of collecting their children and taking them home.  It would remove the awkward situation in which children are placed as a result of religious instruction taking place and they having to move out of the classroom with arrangements put in place for alternative supervision during those periods.</p></speech>

The idea there would be instruction in a particular religious denomination or viewpoint during school time inevitably creates a discriminatory atmosphere for, as well as isolation and segregation of those who might not share the school&rsquo;s religious view or have no religious view.  It is wrong.  It is not the job of the State to finance that.  I would fight to the death for somebody's right to freedom of religious expression.  However, it is not our job to allow public moneys or the law to uphold a situation where particular religious views are pushed in school at young people.  We are long past the time when that should continue to be the case.  That is not to say there should not be a general discussion about religious, philosophical or humanist ideas.  There should be but not specific religious education and instruction of a particular viewpoint.</p></speech>

Under the Constitution, children have a right to attend school without attending religious instruction, as well as having the right to opt out.  Every school is obliged to honour this.</p> <p>  The approach we are taking on this issue in the Bill is that we are requiring a denominational school to make absolutely clear what provisions it will make for children who do not want to attend the religious programme of that school.  It should be made clear from the outset in the admissions policy before a child is enrolled how this will be dealt with.  It has always been a matter for the individual school to make these practical arrangements.  The best way forward to deal with this in a sensible and flexible way is for each school community to look at this.  Progress has been made in this area since the forum on patronage and pluralism reported.  There have been efforts to provide good practice in schools generally, and in Catholic schools in particular.</p> <p>  I noted later amendments stated the provision should not, as far as practical, be unduly burdensome for parents.  That is a correct sentiment.  I will have to look to amending the legislation to accommodate this on Report Stage.</p> <p>  The amendments preventing any faith formation taking place during the school day or requiring it only to take place at the end of the school day are likely to raise constitutional issues about the rights of religions.  The way forward in this area is to improve practice and to use the forthcoming approach of having a parents and students charter to develop that.  We should also give parents the right, if they are not satisfied that a reasonable accommodation is being made to pursue that, to go to the Ombudsman for Children with their concerns.  The approach we are taking with this Bill and with the prospective parents and students charter is the right way to go.  It respects the different school communities and their right to organise themselves in the right way.  We recognise there are schools with a particular ethos and parents who want to provide for their children to be educated in those schools.  This is the way of trying to accommodate, as best we can, the different needs of parents where their children are enrolled.</p> <p>  However, I cannot accept the amendments put forward by Deputies Shortall and Catherine Murphy.</p></speech>

The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has raised the issue for the Minister&rsquo;s attention that section 30(2)(e) of the Education Act 1998 provides that the Minister &ldquo;shall not require any student to attend instruction in any subject which is contrary to the conscience of the parent of the student&rdquo;.</p> <p>  My amendments Nos. 56 and 84 deal with the opt-out for students who do not wish to attend religious instruction.  Many schools with a religious ethos do not have alternatives for children.  We have scenarios where children will not attend school when communion and confirmation are being prepared for.  There are students in secondary school who were told to sit at the back of the class, given a study class or are told to go to the library when religious instruction takes place.  There are no guidelines in place, however, for the schools or students.  These two amendments would require the Minister to provide definite clarity and guidelines to schools on how they should put in place alternatives for children who do not wish to attend religious instruction and require a timeline for same.</p></speech>

What we want is to make a progressive improvement.  I do not believe we can make a one-size-fits-all regulation when they all face different situations.  Some schools allow children go to the library or resource rooms under supervision.  Some pupils go to a classroom where they can participate in other lessons.  Some schools are able to stagger religious classes to facilitate pupils moving from a class to class.  Some parents choose to collect the children for the periods of religious instruction and do other activities.  I do not believe we can have a regulation which provides a one-size-fits-all approach to this.</p> <p>  The right approach is the one I outlined to Deputy Shortall in that this is an issue for the school community to develop.  We will have a parents and students charter which will set out what is fair provision in general terms.</p><p>There will be a provision to enable parents who are not happy with the way in which the school is providing for their child to take the issue further.  We also provide in the Bill that the school will be obliged to set out the level of provision from the outset in order that when parents enrol their children they will know what approach the school takes.  The package is fair and reasonable in achieving improved provision in this area.  That is the way to go.  It is not the case that we on Marlborough Street decide for 4,000 schools and that there is a central regulation that sums up how it should be done.  That is not the tenor of the approach of the education system.</p></speech>

Other members have spoken about the need for a general education programme in schools on world religions, belief systems and philosophy.  Such a programme would be very worthwhile.  I also feel very strongly that we need to provide a moral and ethical education for all children in all State-funded schools, an ethical education based on civic morality.  The State is remiss in outsourcing responsibility to provide an education based on civic morality to different religious groupings.  There is an onus on the Government and the Minister for Education and Skills to ensure proper instruction on moral and civic matters and I would like to see it developed, as it is long overdue.  However, the Minister is proposing to continue is a situation where increasing numbers of children are being separated from their peers in the classroom.  That is not good practice.  He is also talking about a situation where in many cases children are being removed from the classroom and sent to another room or the principal's office to fill in time while their peers are receiving religious instruction.  That is not acceptable.  He is talking about a situation where children are being excluded from their peer group on a daily basis.  We should not allow that to happen in State-funded schools.  The provision of religious instruction or faith formation should be discrete.  Ideally, lessons should be held outside school hours or, at the very least, iat the end of the school day in order that parents would have the option of taking their children home.</p> <p>  The Minister did not respond to my proposal in amendment No. 181.  It relates to the rule book covering this issue.  It is Rule 69 in the rule book of 1965 about which I am particularly concerned.  For the benefit of members, it is important to point out what that rule provides for.  It states the religious denomination of each pupil must be entered in the school register and the roll book.  I do not know why that should be the case in a State-funded school.  Why is it the religion of a child or his or her parents anyone's business?  Why should it be kept on the register and in the roll book?  Rule 69 goes on to state "this information should be ascertained from the parent (the father, if possible)".  I do not know why that should be the case.  I am referring to the 1965 rule book, but we are saying it is the father, or the guardian of the pupil, where necessary, who should be asked to state the child's religion.  The reference to "the father, if possible" indicates how archaic the rule is and the need to change it.  It was drafted at a time when the diversity now evident in Ireland was not envisaged.  It is utterly out of date and needs to be removed.  </p> <p>  The section allows for religious instruction to be given during the school day.  I propose that the teaching of religion be taken out of the school day and that we move in agreement to make that change in the amendment.  What the amendment states is that "religious instruction shall take place as a discrete lesson at the end of the school day and shall not take place at any other time during the school day, nor shall it imbue or permeate education at any other time during the school day.  This provision exists to afford equal respect and dignity to all pupils, regardless of religion, ethnicity or family background and to uphold their constitutional rights under Articles 44.2.3 and 44.2.4.  Further, this provision exists to give effect to subsections (2) and (3)".  My belief is that, as parliamentarians, we, the Minister especially, in his role, should be taking steps to ensure we afford equal respect and dignity to all pupils, irrespective of their background.  If the Minister allows the current situation to continue, he is patently not doing so and disrespecting those children who are being removed from their peer group every day.  In the eyes of most people, that is not acceptable practice.  It is both discriminatory and divisive and unacceptable in this day and age.  I appeal strongly to the Minister to at least consider amendment No. 181.</p></speech>

Making them feel different by pulling them out of a class is tantamount to abuse.  There is no other way to put it.  If a child is taken out and treated differently from the rest, separated from his or her peers and put wherever else, without guidelines being provided as to how that should be done, it is a form of abuse.  Without guidelines, it is left open to being even worse.  I hope and believe most of the staff and principals in schools are very decent and compassionate to all children.  If we are honest, however, when a particular ethos is at play and prioritised and this behaviour is considered acceptable, it can be the case that the child who does not fit in is looked down on, frowned upon or seen as lesser.  The system is open to that potential possibility which no doubt has manifested itself in children who have opted out being singled out.  Whatever way one cuts it, I cannot see how it is not totally unfair to sensitive, vulnerable young children and how it will not have a significant effect on them.  Anyone who has children knows how sensitive they are.  They ask questions about obvious contradictions and conflicts in the treatment of one person or thing against another.  It hits children really hard in how they look at and feel about the world and their place in it.  It is just wrong.  I again note, to quote from the survey of these matters commissioned by EQUATE, that 71% of parents agree that we should introduce a subject in school on all religions and ethical systems, while 18% neither agree nor disagree and only 12% disagree.  Only 12% believe we should hold on to the idea that a particular ethos should prevail and that, as a consequence, those who do not subscribe to it should be separated.  Most see the sense in it.  We know that a majority in the country have some religious views.</p><p>People with religious views understand that this has to change.  Any fair and reasonable person would say that is the case.  Let us not be behind the curve of where people in Irish society are at now and the intelligence and sensitivity they are displaying, instead of upholding what is the fundamentally and unfair and potentially abusive treatment of children who are the minority and are stigmatised, isolated and separated in this way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.222" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2017062800002#G00200"><p>I call on the Minister to be a little bit braver than he has shown himself to be.  There is no doubt that for most teachers, parents and students, singling one child or a number of children out for removal from a general classroom at particular times of the day is not appropriate.  While that it may not affect many children, there is no doubt that children very often feel that kind of separation very deeply.  It marks them out as being the other.</p> <p>  In Dublin West, as well as in many areas of Dublin Bay North, most of our schools have between 30 and 40 different nationalities.  Some schools have up to 80 different nationalities.  It is almost certainly the case that within that cohort there are wide variations of religious beliefs, ethnic backgrounds and parents who have come from different parts of the world.  The population statistics in the last census are very striking.  I am not sure whether the Minister has taken that into account in the Bill.</p> <p>  Some 30% of the population in Dublin West were not born in Ireland and-or their parents were not born in Ireland.  For different reasons, different groups of people from different countries and backgrounds have settled in small towns around the country.  The statistics show that Ireland has changed utterly over the past 25 years in terms of the diversity of its population.  It is very bad educational practice to pick some children out and tell them to go to the back of a room, the principal's office or elsewhere.  Children are being segregated from the group.</p> <p>  There is a very strong precedence for this in Irish education, as the Minister will know if he has read any of the works by various people on the history of education and its relationship to institutions.  Around Ireland, there was a widespread practice whereby children from institutions, such as a local orphanage, were made to sit in a group in a special place in the classroom so that they were marked off from the other children.  That is part of our legacy from a hidden Ireland.  People were in no doubt that those children were to be regarded as different socially and, in some cases, to be effectively shunned.  I am not suggesting that is the intention of the Minister, but he is following in the tradition of enormous insensitivity to children's experiences.  </p> <p>  There is an emerging consensus.  A distinguished educationalist, Professor Kathleen Lynch, has written extensively about this issue.  For the past 30 or 40 years, she has been an adviser to Educate Together and has set out the curriculum around ethical, humanist and social values and understanding the world of the family, neighbourhood, town, country, region, world and the great religions of the world.</p> <p>  A lot of work has been done in the area.  In fairness to many of the major faiths, their religious curricula also reflect a wider appreciation that we live in a diverse and globalised world and, therefore, different religions are globalised.  The numbers may vary from place to place.  The Minister needs to think this through and not go for a convenient and tidy solution.  He also needs to bear in mind that young teachers coming to work in places like Dublin West are keen to be positive and make every child welcome.  Boards of management are the same.  It may take time, but we need to recognise what has happened and what parents want.</p> <p>  I frequently meet parents, as I am sure the Minister does, who are very distressed if their child is picked out and sent elsewhere.  The Minister might say that if the parents knew a child was going to particular school that was of one or another denomination, what should they expect?  They expect their precious child to be treated as equal to everybody else.  That may surprise the Minister and people in the Department of Education and Skills, but the world has changed. </p> <p>  As I said, there are very distinguished people in the world of education who have written extensively about this issue.  We have a lot of documentation on teachers' experiences and their unhappiness with being forced to segregate children on particular occasions.  School principals go to enormous lengths to try to mitigate the negative impact of these differences.</p> <p>  I strongly suggest to the Minister that he rethink the proposal and offer his support.  The language of the recent Fine Gael leadership contest suggested a strong respect for diversity.  That is not evident in the Bill.  It is very narrow and obscurantist.  It harks back to an older Ireland. </p> <p>  We need to bear in mind that we have a significant population of young children in areas of growth.  There is enormous diversity, which is confirmed by the census figures.  That has been the case since about 2000 when very large numbers of new people came to live in Ireland within a relatively short period of time, and they now comprise a significant proportion of our population.</p></speech>

There should be minimum standards in regard to the nature of the exemption for students.  It is not fair on students who are being excluded, whether they are being put to the back of the classroom or sent to a library.  It is not fair on the students and teachers in the class who want to study religion because teachers are being asked to manage classes and teach religion, along with dealing with seven others who are not doing the subject.  That leads to discipline issues.</p> <p>  Students coming into schools in September will see from the timetable that religion is scheduled for 2.40 p.m. on a Tuesday, but a student who does not do religion will ask what he or she should do, and his or her tutor will not know because the school has no idea what is happening.  If those not studying religion are not included in the timetable provisions, will a teacher be available to supervise those students who are not sitting at the back of a classroom?  Are those students unsupervised, which is wrong?  Are they with an SNA, which is not fair on him or her? </p> <p>  It is a domino effect.  I ask the Minister to set down minimum guidelines to at least ensure that those who are not studying religion are doing something of educational benefit during the time involved.</p><p>We have to consider the children in the class who are willingly doing religion and ensure their learning experience is not impacted.  With everything that is happening in society, particularly in the past year and a half, we should be promoting an inclusive approach.  Instead, we have those who do religion and those who do not in the same classroom.  That is wrong on many levels.  I appeal to the Minister to put in place minimum standards to ensure that every child gets the best value out of their education.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.225" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1225" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2017062800002#H00200"><p>The amendments are interesting and they certainly raise issues.  I am not supportive of amendment No. 2.  However, there is no question that arguments can be made for it.  My worry is that the ethos of the school becomes affected.  I do not know how we distinguish between religious instruction, faith formation and the ethos of a school because they are intertwined in some ways.</p> <p>  Deputy Martin's amendment No. 56, which is grouped with this one, is reasonable and it would be very helpful if the Minister were able to reflect on it.  I would be inclined to support it.</p> <p>  I agree we have to protect the rights of those who do not wish to attend religious instruction.  My own children do not attend a Catholic school.  Religious instruction takes place after school hours and seems to work quite well.  It is entirely voluntarily, both on the part of the children and the teachers who do it.  They work extra hours, but they are under no obligation to do so.  They have no agreement with the school to do so, but they do it.  As it happens, there is quite a large take-up, but that is a matter of individual choice.</p> <p>  This is something that works in practice.  I would be reluctant to rush it through in this legislation.  Catholic schools are entitled to be Catholic schools.  That is a statement it is necessary to make.  We either have faith schools or we do not have faith schools and if we want to go down the road of abolishing them, that is not a road I want to go down.  I worry that amendment No. 2, in terms of putting religious instruction in faith schools into law, has the potential to effectively remove the ethos.  From my reading of it, there would be no religious issue at all during the school day, for example, First Communion or whatever, or no talk of it.  It would be kept completely separate.  I am not sure that is reasonable for a faith school and it is a decision we will have to make.</p> <p>  If we are to take this debate to its logical conclusions, we should say that we will fund a State system and not have faith schools.  I am sure that is Deputy Boyd Barrett's objective, and he is entitled to it.  It works very well in the United States where there is no difficulty with it.  Catholic schools work side by side and charitable donations allow poor children to attend those schools, so it seems to work reasonably well.  On the other hand, if we say we will be like the United Kingdom and other countries and allow faith schools, they have to be allowed to be faith schools.</p> <p>  This is a much bigger debate than simply the wording of amendment No. 2.  Deputy Martin's amendment is reasonable in terms of making some kind of regulation.  However, personally I am not aware of all these stories of how children feel, and I have not seen the evidence of that.  I am sure there are many examples, but I have not seen them and it is certainly something I would like to see before we start making decisions about it.</p></speech>

There is a need for guidelines.  Class size is a huge issue for teachers and if children are opting out, some guidelines have to be put in place.  I call on the Minister to try to address that issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.227" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2017062800002#H00400"><p>I absolutely recognise change.  The census is very clear.  The proportion of Catholics is down six points from 84% in 2011 to 78% in 2016.  The proportion of those with no religion is up from 6% to 10%.  Among parents between 20 and 40 who have children going to school, the non-religious proportion is 60% higher than that 10%.  We are talking about one in five or even more across the country who are of no religion or non-Christian religions.  I recognise that we need to change in the face of that and I want to see more diverse schools being opened.  I want to see the transfer of patronage from existing Catholic schools to other patrons, but I believe also that it is good that parents want to send their children to schools of their own faith.  That is something parents are entitled to want and I respect and value schools of different ethos.  The strength of our system is that we have schools of different ethos.  Deputy Boyd Barrett does not believe that there should be a different characteristic spirit and ethos in our schools.</p> <p>  To be fair, my experience is that schools of all denominations strive to be open and inclusive.  As Deputy Burton said, many of them have children from many different religions and countries and they work hard to be inclusive and open for them.  That is my experience generally.</p> <p>  There is a constitutional obligation that these schools must respect the right of parents to withdraw their children.  We are providing that this must be stated openly as to the arrangements they will put in place to provide that for the children who want to opt out.  I support that and want to see that evolve through the parents and children's charter, and that we would see that improve over time.  Good practice guidelines have been developed by both groups of both denominational schools and otherwise.  The question is whether we start imposing regulations and saying it must be this or that.  We then get down to the practical issues.  For example, what provision has been made in one-room schools?  Are we providing that they must have a separate place and so on?  The difficulty I have with regulations is that every school is different.  There are 4,000 different schools and to come up with a one size fits all system that is fair and reasonable to the different situations in which schools find themselves would be an extraordinarily difficult proposal.</p> <p>  I recognise Deputy Byrne's point, and he has an amendment to the effect that these arrangements should not be unduly onerous, which is correct.  There should be a test of reasonableness for schools as to how they provide, but if we come along with regulations and tell schools these are the regulations they must have there is a risk that many schools would say they need the Minister to provide them with extra rooms, for which I do not have the budgets.  Practical issues arise.</p> <p>  Developing a system where we change and evolve, putting pressures on the system and testing its reasonableness in the system such as the right to go to an Ombudsman if one is unhappy with the way this provision is being made is the way we evolve from a system which has enormous strengths.  Every day, I go into schools, many of which are denominational, and they do not fit into what some Deputies are portraying as the way in which children from other denominations are treated within them.  They are treated with dignity and huge respect for their diversity.  That is the dominant approach of schools that are denominational.  I am not saying it is perfect in every instance.  That is why I believe there should be a charter and a right of appeal to have that tested.  However, to go down the road Deputies seem to favour of a legislative framework being imposed on 4,000 schools of a different ethos and many approaches does not fit with the evolutionary change we need to see to respond to the greater diversity of the population coming to our schools.  It risks portraying many denominational schools in a very black light that does not reflect the reality.  Many parents of other denominations choose denominational schools because they value the ethos they believe they will find in those schools, even though they are not of their own denomination.  That is the reality.</p> <p>  I am trying to evolve with what I fully recognise is a changing situation.  I will ask my Department to examine this rule 69 which, to be honest, I knew nothing about.  My notes inform me that rule 68 was removed.</p><p>I am happy to have that identified with a view to removing it, as from what the Deputy  has said it does not sound appropriate.  What I am trying to do is respond across the frontier of our education system to the changing environment but I do not want to impose impractical obligations on schools that makes it more difficult for them to do the outstanding work that is being done in most cases.  The communities around the schools have a commitment to their school.  My approach is to try to strike a balance.  I think our approach is evolutionary; it is not to impose a model that we have decided on.   I do not think that is fair to those who have invested their time and effort into creating outstanding institutions across the country.  However, we must create the pressure for change and articulate obligations, such as what we are introducing in the Bill, so that we continue that progress.</p><p> While I will not accept this group of amendments, I will reflect on the points made by Deputies Thomas Byrne and Catherine Martin.  My instinct is that setting up regulations is difficult when one has to accommodate 4,000 different situations.  I would like to see a test of the reasonableness of the efforts so that schools are continually trying to improve the way they accommodate people.  That is the approach that the famous American Disabilities Act took.  It did not require immediate action but it operated in the expectation that people would evolve over time.  That is the approach that can be embedded in a parents and students charter and can be tested as it evolves over time.</p></speech>

There is nothing onerous or complex about moving religious instruction to the end of the school day.  That facilitates children at many levels.  There has been many arguments put forward today on reasons of fairness and respect for children who may not share the religious beliefs of the patron of the school they are attending and many reasons why it makes practical sense to do what is proposed in the three amendments, which is to move religious instruction to the last class of the day.  That makes sense.  We have given the Minister the reasons but he has not given us any reason as to why he should not do that.  For that reason I am pressing the amendment.</p></speech>

I think one has to bear in mind that some schools have already worked out the particular practices that suit the student and parent body.  It would be a very positive to allow students to take religious instruction in the first half hour and the children who do not wish to join the religious instruction classes could skip that class.  It takes the burden off the teachers and the school principal.  For instance in many multidenominational schools the practice in regard to preparation for Holy Communion, as Deputy Thomas Byrne referenced, is to arrange for the instruction in preparation for the Holy Communion class after the school day has been completed.  By and large that has been working very well.  I can understand that Deputy Byrne states that he is not aware of any of these instances but I am making the case that in parts of Ireland, particularly in the north and west side of Dublin, the level of diversity is unlike the experience in any other part of the country.  I accept the point that Deputy Byrne made.  Of course the parents, who are parishioners in the local parish, value their local school and they also do that in areas that are diverse, but the level of diversity must be dealt with in a fair and reasonable way.</p></speech>

Act of 1998 made before the commencement of this section and section 29 shall continue to apply in relation to such appeals as if the amendments concerned had not been made.&rdquo;.</blockquote> <p>This group of amendments involve the replacement of section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to make the entire appeals process fit for purpose and less cumbersome for parents.  It is based on the experience of the Department, which has dealt with more than 5,000 appeals and these are improvements that will make the system work better for both parents and schools.  There is a number of amendments.  An amendment removes a section that never was activated, it was a class of cases that could be brought by appeal, which has never been used.  It was a general power for the Minister to add new categories to which section 29 should be applied.  We have been advised by the Attorney General that it should be removed and we think it is better to deal with this through a students' charter rather than adding to provisions in section 29.  </p><p>The second set of amendments is to distinguish between two separate types of appeals.  One are appeals where a school is not over-subscribed, and where an appeal against expulsion, suspension or refusal occurs in such a situation, there will be an oral hearing.  The appeals will be dealt with fully <i>de novo</i>, so the appeals committee will come to its own conclusion, having examined and considered the evidence and materials available to it.  We are providing for a fast track for this process as it does not have to go to the board of management of the school first.  We are providing for a preliminary decision and the opportunity to appeal before it is confirmed.</p><p>This is trying to deal with the situation in a different way.  It is different from the second category, so we are distinguishing between under-subscribed and over-subscribed schools.  In an over-subscribed school, where there is a refusal to admit a pupil, the appeals will be on the record.  That means the appeal committee will rely on the same evidence and materials as were available to be relied upon by the board of management when it made its decision to refuse admission.In that case we will require that the board has reviewed the refusal first before it can go to the appeal, unlike the case of a non over-subscribed school.  It is only if the grounds offered in the appeal would materially affect the decision that the appeal will be heard.  There is additional hoops to ensure that the appeal process is not being used unnecessarily.  A third element of the group of amendments is that the new section 29 removes the requirement for parents of students in an Education and Training Board's schools to appeal in the first instance to an ETB committee, before taking a section 29 appeal.  That was in the old legislation, but it is a loop that is unnecessary and is being removed.</p><p>There are some other elements.  The new section 29 includes a number of provisions to improve the day-to-day operation of the process.  These include removing the requirement for an inspector to be on every appeals committee and setting out the number of days of suspension before an appeal can be made.  The number of days of suspension is being set at 20 days.  This has been agreed with parents' groups and is based on practice that has evolved.  We are removing the current mandatory requirement for appeals to be heard within 30 days from date of receipt and instead we are providing that procedures set out the timeframes for making and determining appeals and for providing notification of the outcome of any such appeals and that different periods can be provided for different categories of appeal.  Again, the intention is that none would go beyond 30 days but it would allow for different periods of time and that they would be set by regulation.</p><p> There is a provision that an appeals committee may refuse to determine an appeal in certain circumstances.  One is if it is vexatious, frivolous or an abuse of process while another is where the appeals committee has attempted to have a facilitation, there have been attempts to facilitate parties or subsequent steps have been taken by the parties and, in particular circumstances, the committee feels the appeal should not be considered further, that is, where there has been an effort to try to find a solution, that has been exhausted and there is no point in a further appeal and it cannot be proceeded with.  If an appeal has not been made within the timeframe determined, for example, and if it is late, it can be refused.</p><p> There is a provision whereby the appeals committee can rule that a child must be admitted but it is not within its remit to recommend a change in the admissions policy of the school.  However, it can comment on the lack of clarity of the school's admission policy.  Section 29 is not trying the admissions policy of the school itself.  The admissions policy must comply with this Bill.</p><p> The other significant element here is the introduction of compellability so that where an appeal has been allowed, the school must admit the student, readmit the student or adjust the ranking of the student on the waiting list.  Those are the sort of provisions that are being set out in this amending section.</p></speech>

The amendments in different circumstances allow the Minister to require schools either individually or collectively to apply positive discrimination in the admissions policies for groups that have specific difficulty in finding a school place.  The two groups we have identified in these amendments, and there may be others, are children from Traveller families and children from homeless households.  If I feel there is support for it, I will pursue it.  If not, I will withdraw the amendments.</p><p>Amendment No. 83 is grouped with amendments Nos. 11 and 12.  Amendment No. 83 involves our catchment area proposals.  In respect of what I am going to do with regard to catchment areas, I have had no time to examine the Minister's proposal on the so-called baptism barrier in any detail.  I am prepared for the time being to not proceed with my catchment area proposal in this legislation until we study the Minister's proposal fully.  I should very clearly say that the catchment area proposal is Fianna F&aacute;il's preferred approach and we are not entirely convinced of the Minister's reasons for not doing it but I am willing to look at what the Minister is proposing and to examine it.  I think it will require the committee to examine it with stakeholders as well because it is not a proposal that has received examination so far.  The fact that I am not pursuing my catchment area proposals today does not mean that they are not Fianna F&aacute;il policy.  It certainly is Fianna F&aacute;il policy and one we want to pursue.</p></speech>

Basically, what we are providing for here is that every school must have in its admission policy a statement that relates back to the equality legislation so that it has to provide that it will not discriminate on grounds of gender, civil status, family status, sexual orientation and so on.  That includes the Traveller community grounding of a student.  It provides that the school must have a statement that states that it does not discriminate on the grounds of someone being a Traveller.  There is nothing in the Bill that stops a school giving priority to the Traveller community.  Therefore, it is our view that the Deputy's amendment is not necessary.  A school is perfectly entitled to give priority to a Traveller if that is what the school chooses to do.  There is nothing in the Bill that stops that.</p> <p>  In the case of homelessness, it is slightly different in that homelessness is not a category in the equality legislation at the moment, but again there is nothing to stop a school providing in this area.  The equality legislation does not contain any ground relating to the housing status of a person.  However, amendment No. 12 appears to require a school to state that it does not discriminate under equality legislation on that ground.  Having regard to amendment No. 83, I do not think the amendment as worded is necessarily what the Deputy is trying to achieve.  With regard to providing for regulations that set out that schools be required to prioritise children from homeless families, I am not aware of any calls for such an approach but I can confirm that I am willing to look at this matter.  If it is clear that such an approach is needed, I will consider it.</p></speech>

This means that special schools or classes will not be required to admit students who do not have the category or categories of special education need for which the school caters.

It will not be deemed to be in breach of the legislation if a school refuses a child who does not fit into the school's special need category.  If a school has a class for six children with special education needs and there is a child seeking access who does not have a special education need, the school can say that it is not taking on the child in its special education need class because that has been reserved for children who require it.  Otherwise, we would find ourselves in a situation in which, if a school had half-full special education provision, a child with no need would be put into that class because the school could not say that it was not making that place available to the child.  It is to allow the school to refuse in those circumstances.  Of course, were any such refusal unreasonable, it could be appealed under section 29.  If a child had a special need and was being unreasonably refused, the parents could appeal.  This amendment prevents children that could go into an ordinary class from saying that the special education school must give the child that place.  I think it is a reasonable provision.</p></speech>

What we are trying to do is provide for a situation in which, if a special school or special class has been provided for and is seeking to cater to a particular type of need, the admission statement of the school shall include a statement that the school may refuse to admit a student who does not have the specified category of special education need concerned.</p><p>The purpose of this measure is to allow the Department to make special provision for certain categories.  If we believe that the autism spectrum disorder, ASD, category has a particular need or that a different type of special class should be provided - we make provision for in that not all special classes are ASD units - we can have that differential type of provision in order that we can tailor our intervention to the individual needs of the child.  All we were trying to provide for here is that if we have made such a tailored provision, it is reasonable to reserve those places for the children who have that need.  Otherwise, it would be very difficult for us to plan the spectrum of provision for different types of special need.</p></speech>

I find the Minister's statement quite confusing because at primary level in a large primary school we are talking about two special units of six pupils in each class.  By and large, there is a significant over-subscription by parents of qualifying children for those classes.  I am not sure what the Minister is trying to achieve here.  This is a process which has been ongoing.  I am talking about very large schools  that in total comprise 750,000 pupils at primary level and the number would be a little more at secondary level.  Again, I am referring to the experience in Dublin West which may not be the experience in the rest of the country where schools may be much smaller.  What is the Minister trying to tell us?  We are trying to mainstream children with disabilities into the special units where that is appropriate given whatever level of support they may need, but what the Minister has said does not sound great.  What is it that he is proposing to do?  Is Tusla going to make the decision or is the school-----</p></speech>

First, did the Minister say it is not only the autism units?  Second, if a special needs class was dealing with three specific needs, would that lead to a school deciding, for example, that a child who has all those needs but also has, for example, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, and an emotion behaviour disorder, would not be suitable in terms of the needs provided for in the class and, therefore, the school will not take in the pupil?</p></speech>

A special class is defined in the legislation.  A special class means a class that has been established by a school, with the approval of the Minister, to provide an education exclusively for students with a specified category or categories of special educational need.  The admissions policy of the school must state that it has special classes and it is specified what they provide for, and there is an admissions process.  If we did not have these provisions, the default position of the Act would be that any mainstream child making an application could insist that they be admitted with respect to these special provisions.</p> <p>  The purpose of this measure is to protect the special provision for children who have special needs.  That is not to say that if we set up a unit, a school can discriminate and say it does not want to take in a child with this special need or that other special need.  It is to protect those special provisions from being occupied at the insistence by a child with just mainstream needs.  It is solely to protect the provision for the purposes for which it was intended and that is made clear by the school in its admissions policy.  This has been requested by the special needs bodies.  They are seeking to protect the integrity of their provision for the children who have such needs.</p></speech>

Some of the soft barriers are erected in schools by the professions who are advising the Minister, but not by all of them.  A huge number of them do outstanding work.  The soft barriers are not imposed by me.  I certainly do not want to impose them by legislation and they are not directly imposed by the Minister either.  If we are allowing categories now to be preferred, surely that legislates for soft barriers.  I am open to be convinced that I am wrong, but I am not convinced of that at the moment.</p></speech>

It is staffed with people with the experience to deliver to those particular children.  If it is a deaf unit, it will have different categories of staff and all the rest of it.  All this measure is doing is protecting the integrity of the provision that is being made, namely, that it will be for children who meet those categories.  This is not designed to find a way of denying access.  It is to protect the provision of those places for children for whom it is the appropriate setting.  In view of the concern, I will ask for a note to provide that assurance but I am assured by my officials that is the purpose of this measure.  That is the way it has been drafted.  It has been done specifically at the request of groups who want to see that the special provision is provided to the appropriate children.</p></speech>

When I became Minister for Social Protection in 2011, I found in regard to applications for the domiciliary care allowance where children were on the spectrum but particularly where children had  behavioural disorders, that they had not been provided for in terms of accessing the allowance.  We had to completely overhaul the system, close it down for a period and create a new system.  That resulted automatically each year in an extra couple of thousand children and families accessing it.</p> <p>  My recollection is that the Department of Education and Skills traditionally does not particularly recognise behavioural disorders.  The test on the social protection side is broadly does the child require care and attention that is very different from the norm.  Also, in that case, quite a number of parents, if they are parenting full-time, would go on to qualify for carer's allowance, but in terms of the school provisions, the approach of the Department of Education and Skills, from my experience, is far more restrictive.  Does this measure cater for children who have been accepted in terms of the domiciliary care allowance?  It may well be that they will be accepted into mainstream classes in the school because, for instance, they have a physical disability which can be addressed and catered for within the mainstream.</p><p>What I am specifically interested in is the child with severe behavioural disorders.  In my experience, the Department of Education and Skills will not always recognise the issue.  While it has moved a long way in recognising spectrum disorders such as autism and asperger's syndrome, I am not sure the same applies in the case of behavioural disorders.  I would like the Minister to enlighten us on that point.</p></speech>

Over 60% of children with special needs are accommodated in mainstream classes.  In terms of policy, the NCSE advises on what is the most appropriate setting for them.  As I said, almost two thirds of children with special needs are in mainstream classes which are deemed to be the most appropriate settings.  Where it is established that the needs of a child are such that a special unit is required, that provision is made.  We have doubled the number of places in that regard in the space of five years.  There are now 1,200 special units in schools and the level of provision is growing rapidly on foot of NCSE identifying a need.</p> <p>  As indicated by Deputy Thomas Byrne and others, the Department now has the power to compel a school, after a process, to provide a special unit where it is deemed by the NCSE to be necessary for children in the area.  The NCSE, not the Department, advises on the best accommodation for a child, with or without a domiciliary care allowance.  What we are seeking to do, in the context of the amendment, is to ensure that if special provision is made, it will be used for the purpose for which it is intended.  The Deputies have raised the legitimate concern that a child presenting with additional complications could be refused on this ground.  I will withdraw the amendment and ask my officials to re-examine the provision with a view to reintroducing the amendment on Report Stage when I will have a satisfactory explanation for the Deputies.</p></speech>

It is the case that all legislation is open to all sorts of interpretation.  It is not possible to frame legislation that would address all possible bizarre interpretations, but the Minister must have concrete evidence of the experience of parents in trying to get children with mainstream needs into special units such that he was prompted to introduce the amendment?  I do not see the point of it unless it is a phenomenon.  Is it?</p></speech>

On the refusal of admission to children who do not have special needs, as specified, how is the matter to be determined?  For example, will it be determined on the basis of a diagnosis?  When I questioned the Minister on the resource allocation, his response was that there was a move away from diagnosis.  How does this fit in with the resource allocation model?</p></speech>

Taken literally, this means that a school cannot discriminate based on the disability, or lack of, of a child presenting.  The default position, if the amendment is not made, is that if a school has a special class reserved for children with particular needs, it cannot protect the places for children with these needs.  That would be a very strange provision.  Essentially, a school protecting a special education place for a child with special educational needs would be acting in a discriminatory manner.  I do not think any one of us would want to see that position being provided for in legislation.  I am not saying it is a phenomenon.  We are providing that the admissions statement must set out these principles.  In terms of what it might mean, it is a possible unintended consequence.  Following on from the concerns expressed by schools providing special classes, the decision was taken to correct the position by way of amendment.  We need to ensure there is reasonable protection where special provision is made for the purposes intended.  There is no ulterior motive involved.  People have raised a concern that a child presenting who is on the spectrum provided for and has a lot of other needs might be denied a place on the basis that some of them are not included in the list.  That is not the intention and I will ask my officials to ensure the matter is addressed on Report Stage.  In the meantime I can provide a note for Deputies to provide the necessary assurance.</p></speech>

Its purpose is to prohibit schools from discriminating when they are not oversubscribed.  The Minister said they could not discriminate on religious grounds if they were not oversubscribed.  I would like him to confirm this.  The amendment is an attempt to tie the issue to the catchment area proposal, but, as I said, I am not satisfied with it as presented.

It would have to establish it was essential to retain the ethos and it is not an option where a school just decides it does not want a child of a particular religion.  Its only defence would be where it was essential to refuse to maintain the ethos, or if refuses to admit a student who is not of that denomination and, in the case of a refusal, it is proved the refusal was essential to maintain the ethos of the school.

How do we define what is maintaining the ethos of a school, or how does a school make the case it is necessary to discriminate to protect the ethos of the school?  It is not clear to me whether it is clear in the legislation.  I do not think it is from reading it.  If a school is undersubscribed it is clearly and explicitly prohibited from discriminating.  A school could say in a particular year that it has only ten Catholics because there are a lot of Muslem people and non-religious people so to maintain the proportion, as it would see it, of Catholic students it would start refusing people even though the school is not oversubscribed.  It seems this would be allowed because the section does not explicitly state that if a school is not fully subscribed section 61(2)(b) does not apply.  The Bill does not say that.</p></speech>

Where a school is undersubscribed this reasoning has no place.  The ethos of a school is already protected elsewhere, in the Education Act.  The Catholic Primary Schools Management Association, CPMSA, made the case first that there are very few cases of oversubscription where the baptism barrier comes in, but there are examples of it in my constituency.  Even it would state there are no cases where a school is undersubscribed that somebody should be refused on the basis of religion.  I do not see how anybody would support that as long, of course, as the ethos is protected, which I understand it is anyway.  I do not think the ethos is protected by keeping the number of students low so they do not pollute it in some way.  That strikes me as completely unnecessary.</p></speech>

We tabled amendment No. 23 which, surprisingly to me and I may get an explanation later from the officials, has been ruled out of order.  We reference catchment in the amendment because it is the essential point.  The point about all of this discussion is if in the catchment area there is very large demand for places and there is a school of religious denomination, of course that school of religious denomination is entitled to serve the ethos of its religionists in so far as it is required to maintain the ethos of the school.  This is set out in the Constitution.  However, this does not mean the school can have such a wide catchment area that the children living across the road from the school can be denied a place while children from very far and wide are accepted for a place.  This is what the baptism barrier is about and it is the point the Minister is seeking to duck.  It is a balance between preserving and ensuring the ethos of a school and allowing children in a locality, who may not be of that ethos, to access the school in reasonable numbers without preventing the school from preserving its ethos.  Both of these are addressed in the Constitution.  This is what the Labour Party legislation, which the Minister decided to deep-freeze for a year, set out to achieve.  I do not understand, given all of the various amendments which have been accepted, why amendment No. 23 has been ruled out of order.  The Minister's section does not mention catchment.  Without catchment it is ridiculous, because catchment is what it is about.  This is absurd.</p></speech>

I saw in it some way of tackling the baptism barrier.  The amendment states: "In page 6, line 13, after &ldquo;school&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;not aided by the Department of Education and Skills&rdquo;.  I am of the opinion that this would mean schools which are State-funded could not then discriminate.  Is the Minister suggesting this would only apply to the private schools?  To clarify, we are talking about schools not aided by the Department of Education and Skills.  If we are that specific, we can then tackle the baptism barrier to some extent.</p></speech>

Until we amend and come back here with amendments to the equal status legislation, and I have indicated it is my intention to provide amendments, that equal status legislation exists and this Bill is just reflecting what it provides, namely, if a school refuses to admit a student who is not of that denomination, the school must prove that its refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school.  If that is tested, it would be heard by the Workplace Relations Commission because it now deals with equality cases.  That is the existing provision that goes back to the 2000 Act.</p> <p>  We have all indicated there is an eagerness in this committee to change that and I have indicated I will be coming back with proposed changes.  However, until that occurs, this legislation obviously has to reflect the equal status provisions, and that is what it is doing here, and it is not doing any more than that.  I fully recognise that we need to revisit the Equal Status Act but I believe we need to do so in a way that is constitutionally robust.  We need to bring forward proposals that have been approved by the Attorney General and that respect the constitutional right of the religious to organise their affairs and so on.  What we are providing for in section 62, which is what Deputy Byrne raised, is simply the existing provision.  That is the provision as it now prevails.</p></speech>

It precisely addresses the issue.  Let us be honest.  If we are all concerned about the baptism barrier, let us talk about how it operates.  It operates in the context of catchments.  What we are trying to do is provide a balance which provides, as the Constitution requires, for the ethos of the school but which does not mean that children who are not of that ethos in the area can have no access to that school because children in a wider area can jump over them in the queue.  That is what the baptism barrier is.</p></speech>

It would make it very specific to privately-funded schools so, at least, the taxpayer would not be paying for discrimination.  I ask members to support it.</p></speech>

Setting aside amendment No. 15, which I will come to in a moment, the legislation is not clear in its execution of its own intent.  That is the very specific point I am making.  That is what we are dealing with.  The Minister stated that the legislation would not allow for discrimination on religious grounds where there was not oversubscription.  I do not believe there should be any discrimination and I will come onto that point shortly.  However, even if that is the Minister's intent, the legislation does not make it clear.  It leaves the door open for discrimination in cases where there is not oversubscription because it does not spell it out clearly.  I think the drafters need to look at it because it leaves this open.</p> <p>  On amendment No. 15, which I did not realise we had moved on to, this is where I disagree with Deputy Burton.  The Labour Party approach to this is a fudge between allowing some discrimination to continue but minimising it somewhat with the issue of catchment.  However, there is the problem of how to define a catchment.  As Deputy Burton rightly pointed out, one can expand the concept of catchment to anywhere so how is catchment to be defined?  It is problematic to define it in any sort of meaningful or legal way.  Therefore, I think the only way to deal with the issue is to delete the offending discrimination which is contained in section 61(2)(b), which echoes the wording of the infamous section 7(3)(c).</p> <p>  It is worth stating the irrationality of the wording of section 61(2)(b), which reads: "a statement that the school does not discriminate in relation to the admission of students where it admits persons of a particular religious denomination in preference to others or it refuses to admit".  What the legislation is saying is that it is not discrimination to discriminate.  It is just bonkers.  It is so Irish, it is unbelievable.  It is not discrimination to prefer one group over another on a religious basis.  That is the definition of discrimination.  Nowhere else could do this, except some sort of tin-pot dictatorship.  It is Orwellian wording - freedom is slavery; war is peace; discrimination is not discrimination.  That is what we are proposing to put into law.</p><p>That is what we are proposing to put in law.  It is already in the Equal Status Act and now we are going to repeat it in the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016, which purports to be reforming the problems in equal admission to school but is actually restating an Orwellian form of discrimination and trying to claim it is not discrimination or is somehow acceptable.  It is totally wrong.<br/><br/>I restate that it is unnecessary to do this, never mind that it is actually wrong to do this to children of all people.  I have made that point already, but who is the Minister doing this for?  I presume he has read the survey of Equate, which is campaigning on this issue.  The survey, which was done scientifically by a proper surveying organisation, shows that 71% or an overwhelming majority of parents, whether religious, non-religious or of minority religions, state the law should be changed so that baptism can no longer be a requirement for school admission in State-funded schools.  Another 12% state that they do not care.  Only 16% want to retain the <i>status quo</i>that the Minister is retaining.  In this legislation, the Minister is pandering to 16% over the vast majority.  Why is he doing this?  I do not understand it.<br/><br/>The Minister has continued to refer to constitutional issues.  I really want to get to the bottom of this, and I should have asked earlier, but at one point the Taoiseach and the Minister claimed the Government had legal advice about the constitutional difficulties involved in removing this discriminatory element of the law.  I have asked repeatedly if we can see the legal advice the Government received, but we have never seen it.  I do not believe the Minister has legal advice.  That was spoof from the Taoiseach.  In my opinion, it was &quot;the man with two pints&quot; talk.  We have heard it only as a spurious justification for maintaining an utterly discriminatory law directed disgracefully against children.  Could the Minister answer that point?  How can he justify it?  Why does he feel the need to do it when he is pandering to a tiny minority of the population?  Where is the famous legal advice about the constitutional problem that might be involved in removing this discrimination from the legislation?</p></speech>

There is a desire by the committee to consider changes to the Equal Status Act and we indicated that we will revert to that issue.  If we make changes to the Equal Status Act, there will have to be consequential changes to this Bill.  I fully recognise that point.  Some of these provisions, which are taken entirely from that Act, will have to be repealed or changed, in particular, this provision in relation to section 7(3)(c).</p> <p>  Changing this here, however, does not change the Equal Status Act one whit.  That will remain on the Statute Book.  The only way in which we can amend it is by making provisions in respect of that Act and we will have to do that on a fresh occasion in a fresh debate.  All of the issues the Deputies are raising can be considered at that stage.</p> <p>  Deputy Catherine Martin's amendment is trying, by the back door, to change the Equal Status Act by confining this exception to private schools or whatever schools, but the same-----</p></speech>

Whatever changes we make here do not change the Equal Status Act.  Under the Equal Status Act, one has the right, if challenged, to go to the WRC and to prove that a refusal he or she has made is essential to maintain the ethos of the school.  I understand that has not been tested and schools have not been using this ground of refusal as a way of keeping non-co-religionists out.  There has not been a case of this brought to the WRC and it is an unused section.  However, until it is changed, we have to respect it and our provision on education admission policy has to respect the existing provisions of the Equal Status Act.  Obviously, if we come back and change that, there will be consequential changes through this legislation, but that is the debate for another occasion.</p></speech>

An amendment which provides that such schools do not discriminate within the meaning of the Equal Status Act is not appropriate.  There is no provision in that Act and any amendment that proposes to amend the definition of discrimination within that Act would have to be made within the Act itself.  The difficulty with the school making a statement that it is not discrimination would not change the parent Act.  The parent Act does not deal with language as a grounds for discrimination.  Under this Bill, Irish medium schools are not prohibited from prioritising children from Irish-speaking homes.  None of the amendments I am bringing forward today will prohibit schools from doing so.</p> <p>  I am aware, however, that there are concerns that some provisions in the Bill could have a bearing on the manner or mechanism by which a school would ascertain that a student is from an Irish-speaking home.  Some schools, for example, meet or undertake an assessment of the student, in some cases the parents or in some cases both students and parents to ascertain whether Irish is in fact the language spoken at home.  In the context of this Bill, such an approach raises a number of issues.  The overall reach and approach of this Bill is to prohibit priority based on the academic ability, skill or aptitude of the student or parent.  It is consistent with long-standing education policy that the academic capacity, aptitude or skills of a child or his or her parents should never have a bearing on whether a child is admitted to a school.  It is for that reason that entrance tests were explicitly banned back in 1993 by the then Minister for Education, Niamh Bhreathnach.</p> <p>  I assure the committee that the Government and I wish to support and promote the Irish language and Irish medium schools as far as possible.  I am, therefore, open to supporting such schools to prioritise children from Irish-speaking homes, where the schools are oversubscribed.  There are, however, complexities involved with ensuring that any mechanism through which they do so is fair and does not serve to exclude children of lesser academic ability or those with special educational needs.  Such a mechanism must also take due account of the general desirability that public policy and law should ensure that no child is excluded from a school based on his or her family or socioeconomic background.</p> <p>  Furthermore, both policy and legal questions arise in defining what an Irish-speaking home is.  Does it apply where one parent is a fluent speaker but the other parent is not?  Does Irish have to be the exclusive language of the house?  Are bilingual families covered?  How can that be provided for in law?  These are complex issues, both legally and in terms of policy.  Nonetheless, I can assure the committee that I intend to reflect further on how the objective can be achieved in a fair, inclusive and transparent manner so as to ensure that I can bring forward an appropriate amendment which takes full account of these issues and has been legally proofed by the Attorney General.  Subject to such considerations and to legal advice, I intend to do so on Report Stage.  I am not disposed to accepting these amendments at this point.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 26 clarifies that the draft admissions policy should be prepared by the board not later than three months after the commencement of the relevant subsection or where a board proposes making any amendments to its admissions policy.  This means that when a board proposes to make any amendments to its admissions policy it must carry out the consultation process as specified in section 62 (1) of the Bill.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.472" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2017062800002#W02200"><p>I move amendment No. 36:</p><blockquote>In page 7, to delete lines 12 to 19 and substitute the following:&ldquo;(c) provide that the school shall admit each student seeking admission to the school and each student seeking admission to a special class in the school, other than&mdash;<blockquote>(i) where the school or special class concerned is oversubscribed, or<br /><br />(ii) where the parent of a student, when required by the principal in accordance with section 23(4) of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, fails to confirm in writing that the code of behaviour of the school is acceptable to him or her and that he or she shall make all reasonable efforts to ensure compliance with such code by the student,&rdquo;.</blockquote></blockquote> <p>This amendment provides for the use of the term &quot;oversubscription&quot; as it is now defined in accordance with amendment No. 8.  This amendment also includes a reference to the admission policy of a school, providing that it shall admit each student seeking admission to a special class in the school, other than in the case of the circumstances set out in section 62(6)(c).  The amendment also reflects more accurately the language used in section 23(4) of the Education (Welfare) Act which provides that a parent is only required to confirm his or her acceptance of the code of behaviour when requested to do so by the principal of the school.</p><p>Amendment No. 44 provides that the admission policy section of the Bill contains a list of the prohibited oversubscription selection criteria and any exemption from same.  The following are the prohibited oversubscription selection criteria: a student's prior attendance at a preschool, with exemptions for early intervention and early start preschools; the payment of fees or contributions; a student's academic ability, skills or aptitude, except for the admission of students to a special school or special class where it is necessary in order to ascertain whether the student has the category of special educational needs for which the special school or special class has been established to cater; the occupation, financial status, academic ability, skills or aptitude of a student's parents; and a requirement that a student, or his or her parents, attend an interview, open day or other meeting as a condition of admission, other than in the case of admission to the residential element of a boarding school or to a course known as a post-leaving certificate course.  The Bill is silent on a limitation on the power of a school to determine a priority for children of past pupils where it is oversubscribed either by setting a percentage or otherwise.  It was previously considered that this matter could be dealt with in regulations but, following legal advice, it is clear the matter needs to be dealt with in primary legislation.</p><p>The amendment provides that a school may not provide priority based on a student's connection to it by virtue of a member of his or her family attending or h0aving previously attended the school, except where a sibling of the student is attending or has attended the school, or where a parent or grandparent of the student concerned has previously attended the school, provided the maximum number of places filled pursuant to the latter criterion does not exceed 25% of the available places as set out in the school's annual admission notice for the school year concerned.</p><p>The amendment also provides that a school may not provide priority based on the date on which an application for admission was received by the school, subject to the application being received at any time during the period specified for receiving applications set out in the annual admission notice of the school for the school year concerned or, where appropriate, at any time during the period as otherwise determined by the school in accordance with the Bill or regulations made under it.  An exemption from this provision is given where, prior to the coming into operation of the subsection, the school had confirmed in writing to the person who had made an application or expression of interest that the name of the child in respect of whom the application or expression of interest had been made had been placed on a list maintained by the school for the purpose of allocating school places in the year concerned.  This exemption ceases to apply five years after commencement of the subsection.</p><p>The amendment also provides that a school shall compile a waiting list of students whose applications for the intake group were unsuccessful following application of the oversubscription selection criteria and this list shall remain valid for the intake year.  Students will be placed on the list in accordance with the order of priority assigned to their applications after the school has applied its selection criteria and it must offer further school places that become available for and during the school year to those students on the waiting list, in accordance with the order of priority in which they had been placed on the list.</p><p>The amendment also seeks to address somewhat the concerns raised by a number of the education partners about the practice of parents applying to multiple schools.  It provides that, in accepting an offer of admission, an applicant shall indicate if he or she has accepted an offer of admission from another school or schools or if the applicant is awaiting the outcome of the admission process in another school or schools.  If so, he or she shall provide details of the offer or offers or the school or schools concerned.  An offer of admission may not be made or may be withdrawn where the applicant does not comply with this provision.</p><p>The amendment amends the existing wording in the Bill which provides that an admission policy shall provide details of the school's policy on its arrangements for students who do not wish to attend religious instruction.  This provision has been amended to provide that an admission policy shall provide details of the school's arrangements for any student where the parent of that student or, in the case of a student who has reached the age of 18 years, the student himself or herself has requested that he or she attend the school without attending religious instruction.</p><p>Amendment No. 59 is a consequential amendment required to change the reference to the subparagraphs in section 62 which now run from (a) to (q).</p></speech>

Most schools do not give such priority but some do.  The effect of giving such priority, particularly in periods of high demand when it outstrips capacity, is that it can be and is given to children from outside the local area and can be at the expense of local children.  I had direct experience of this in the past in my constituency.  I wish to be clear that the amendment does not suggest there be a prohibition on children of staff members enrolling in a school in which their parents are teaching.  I was a member of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills in the previous D&aacute;il when former Deputy Joanna Tuffy was Chairman.  We prepared a report ahead of the intention of the then Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, to introduce what the Minister is dealing with today.  A recommendation was included in the report that the Minister consider it.  It was Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's proposed Bill at that stage.  I ask the Minister to consider accepting the amendment.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.481" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2017062800002#W03200"><p>Yes.  As the Deputy explained, the amendment would prohibit schools from prioritising the children of staff or board members.  I believe it is a reasonable position that an oversubscribed school may give priority to children of staff members, where it so wishes.  For example, from the perspective of facilitating those families, it is sensible that a teacher who works in a school distant from his or her home can have his or her children attend the school rather than having to make arrangements for them to attend elsewhere.  I have not come across this as a widely prevalent practice.  If it has been used, it does not appear to be having a big impact on admissions policy, but, obviously, the Deputy has evidence to the contrary.</p><p>If the Deputy has evidence to the contrary and he gives me the details of that I will consider the issue and come back on Report Stage to see if it would be appropriate to deal with it.  The Deputy is trying to balance the reasonable expectation of teachers or other staff members who are contributing to that school community that they might get some priority over the concern of those living locally.  I will consider it.  The Deputy might give me the details of the experience he had and I will consider whether that is prevalent or something that should be provided for in these circumstances.</p></speech>

If, say, the factory worker in the factory adjacent to the same school is travelling long distances to his or her place of work, it might be advantageous for him or her to say, "I would like to have my child in this local school to my employment".  It is not reasonable that it is a perk for teachers only, but I will respond to what the Minister has asked me.  I do not intend to press the amendment because I would like him to give some consideration to it.  It has been a problem in the past and it has the potential to be a problem in the future.  The idea that children from outside an area could come into an area and get priority over local children is not something that would be acceptable to me.  I have spoken to many principals and they have said they would not have that and that they would never do it but in so far as some schools do it, I ask that it would be something that is not acceptable.</p></speech>

As we discussed earlier, many schools are in very different positions.  There may be something in this space and I would be willing to come back and consider this on Report Stage.  What we ought to be trying to do is not be prescriptive.  We should not set regulations and say, &quot;That is it&quot;.  As Deputy Martin suggested, we should try to encourage a process of change through the parents and teachers charter, the requirement to state their policies and so on.  There may be something in this space that we could do, and I would be happy to revert on that.</p><p>Amendment No. 46 is probably already encompassed by what we are doing.</p><p>There was a question on the reason for the 25% criteria.  It was an attempt to try to strike a reasonable ground.  A view was expressed that priority should not be given to children of past pupils on the grounds that everyone should be equal.  On the other hand, it seems that continuity within the school and having the sort of association that grows up with various community activities that are built around the school and that parents are involved in and were involved in when they were students in the school, is favourable.  There is a reasonable sense of continuity that we ought to promote, namely, that that school community is a reasonable concept.  It was to try to identify a reasonable level at which this could be set that would be fair to both arguments and strike a reasonable balance so that we would set a ceiling.<b></b>Prior to this there was no ceiling.  This measure is introducing a ceiling where there was none previously and trying to set it at a level that would be reasonable.  There is no science involved in it particularly, but is an effort to set something that is a reasonable balance of the two views of the world.</p></speech>

There does not seem to be any objective research on this.  As the Minister said, he is trying to strike a fair bargain between different views rather than coming up with evidence-based policy.  It is not an issue of which I have direct experience from my constituents in certain areas.  Is it as big a problem as is being made out?  Has the Minister done the research that shows that this requires action and that it requires a cap of 25% or any cap?  Can he justify it based on empirical evidence?</p> <p>  I seek clarification on the waiting list and the grandfather clause.  I presume that means that one would go back five years from the passing of the Bill.  Is that right?</p></speech>

I do not know what the justification for that is.  I heard him say that continuity is important and that we ought to protect the continuity.  We can replace the word "continuity" with the word "elitism", and that is essentially what this is about - that elitism ought to be protected.  I am horrified at the Minister proposing that 25% of places would be reserved.  There is no justification whatsoever for that.  This can only perpetuate inequality in education.</p> <p>  Our education system is very much a two-tier system and many of us would be of the view that there is a need to change the way in which the private school system is funded - that it is about maintaining elitism.  The idea of reserving 25% of places for sons, daughters, grandsons and granddaughters of people who have attended a school is nonsense.  There cannot be any justification for that.  It directly discriminates against people who, for example, have recently moved into the area.  It directly discriminates against people who come here from abroad.  It very much discriminates against, for example, people whose parents did not go to secondary school.  I cannot understand how the Minister can possibly stand over a discriminatory arrangement like this that is about protecting elitism within the education system.</p><p>As there is absolutely no justification for it, I really appeal to the Minister to rethink this proposal.</p></speech>

Will it encourage schools which do not have a quota to have one?  Is there a way this could be stopped?  The practice has gone on forever and I see no good reason to stop it, but neither do I see any good reason to start it.  This issue may have been missed.  If a ceiling of 25% is included in the legislation, it might end up becoming mandatory.  It is an issue for certain schools that already follow the practice, but I certainly would not like to see it starting in other schools.</p></speech>

One can understand the very practical case for having two siblings attend the same school to make transport relatively easy and in order that parents do not have to endure the extreme trial of having to bring children to two schools at the same time of the morning which might be physically impossible in some cases, but that is totally different from retaining a 25% quota within a school for pupils whose parents or grandparents happened to go to it.  There is no practical, logistical imperative in that regard.  The measure is about maintaining some intergenerational family clique within a school.  I imagine the practice is restricted almost entirely to fairly elite private schools.</p></speech>

I totally understand the case to be made for having siblings attend the same school in rural or urban areas.  I understand the difficulty even more in rural areas.  Having to bring children to two villages or towns could be a real hassle.  It is not necessary, however, for somebody in a rural or an urban area to go to the same school as his or her father, grandfather or grandmother.  Why is that necessary?  Why would one allow discrimination on that basis?  If somebody can make a case for it, I will be interested in hearing it, but I do not really see how one could possibly justify it.</p></speech>

Deputy Tom Neville is referring to subsection (9)(a) which refers to siblings.  I have absolutely no problem with it because it makes sense for siblings to be able to attend the same school, if only in managing a household, but I do have an issue with the 25% quota.  I am still not convinced that it is evidence-based and believe it has been plucked from the air.  Why stop at a parent and grandparent?  Why not include a great-grandparent also?  There could be circumstances in which the grandchild of someone who attended a school, who may be travelling 15 miles across the city to attend school, could have a greater right to attend it than a child who is living beside it.  That one in four pupils could have this right just because he or she happens to be the grandson or granddaughter of a past pupil is bizarre, wrong and unfair.  The measure is not about equality and equal access.  Of course, I can see the argument about siblings and do not have an issue with it.  The quota of 25% is way too high.</p></speech>

It is actually reducing the extent to which schools can engage in the practice.  They did not face a restriction before.  The empirical evidence is that the higher ceilings have applied in schools in which it is the custom and practice.  This measure is restricting some schools in giving priority to the children of past pupils.  It is trying to introduce a ceiling.</p> <p>  On the question of why any child should be allowed, the argument is based on the fact that many schools have a tradition whereby past pupils want to send their children to them.  They may have played for the same GAA club or have associations with the parish which they may want to keep for one reason or another.  Schools have facilitated family continuity in terms of being part of the school community.  They often draw members of boards of management and so on from these very involved families.  The provision is trying to strike a balance.  School communities are complex networks and many schools draw their support from past pupils.  It is very understandable they would try to maintain a connection with past pupils.  This is a way by which that connection has been maintained.  It is reasonable to argue that there should be a limit set on the extent to which what I describe would become a practice.  That is why I believe this is a reasonable solution.  Bearing in mind Deputy Thomas Byrne's concern that schools that never followed the practice might introduce it, I will consider the issue and revert to him on Report Stage.  Some continuity is reasonable and in accordance with existing practice in many schools.  The proposal involves a reasonable restriction on the practice.  As I stated, I will consider before Report Stage whether additional changes should be made to this provision.</p></speech>

in the application received before the closing date set out in the annual admission notice of the school or, where appropriate, the date as otherwise determined by the school in accordance with this Act or regulations made under this Act, may be taken into account in determining whether or not a student is admitted to the school,<br /><br />(i) provide, where a school is oversubscribed, that the school shall compile a waiting list of students whose applications for the intake group were unsuccessful due to the school being oversubscribed, which shall remain valid for the school year in which admission is being sought subject to&mdash;<blockquote>(i) the school placing students on the list in accordance with the order of priority assigned to the students&rsquo; applications, after the school has applied the selection criteria in accordance with its admission policy, and<br /><br />(ii) the school offering any further school places that become available for and during the school year in relation to which admission is being sought to those students on the waiting list, in accordance with the order of priority in relation to which the students have been placed on the

and where the applicant has so accepted, he or she shall provide details of the offer or offers concerned, and<br /><br />(ii) if he or she has applied for and is awaiting confirmation of an offer of admission from another school or schools, he or she shall provide details of the other school or schools concerned,</blockquote>(k) provide that where a student has not been offered admission, the reasons that he or she was not offered admission shall be provided in writing to the applicant including, where applicable, details of why the student failed to meet the selection criteria and details of the student&rsquo;s position on the waiting list,<br /><br />(l) provide that an offer of admission may not be made or may be withdrawn where&mdash;<blockquote>(i) it is established that the application is fraudulent or intentionally misleading,<br /><br />(ii) an applicant fails to confirm acceptance of an offer of admission on or before the date set out in the annual admission notice of

by the principal in accordance with section 23(4) of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, fails to confirm in writing that the code of behaviour of the school is acceptable to him or her and that he or she shall make all reasonable efforts to ensure compliance with such code by the student, or<br /><br />(iv) the applicant has not complied with paragraph (j),</blockquote>(m) provide that an applicant may request the board to review a decision to refuse admission and that a decision to refuse admission may be appealed in accordance with section 29(1)(c)(i) or (ii),<br /><br />(n) provide details of the school&rsquo;s arrangements in respect of any student, where the parent of that student, or in the case of a student who has reached the age of 18 years, the student, has requested that the student attend the school without attending religious instruction at the school,<br /><br />(o) be consistent with any agreement in relation to the provision of infrastructure or funding to the school made between the Minister and the school,<br /><br />(p) include a declaration that the board or person acting on its behalf shall not, except in accordance with section 64, charge fees for or seek payment or contributions (howsoever described) as a condition of&mdash;<blockquote>(i) an application for admission of a student to the school, or<br /><br />(ii) the admission or continued attendance of a student in the school,</blockquote>(q) set out procedures and criteria for the admission of students who are not already admitted to the school&mdash;<blockquote>(i) to classes or years other than the school&rsquo;s intake group, and<br /><br />(ii) after the commencement of the school year in relation to which admission is sought including, where appropriate, in accordance with paragraph (i),<br /><br />and</blockquote>(r) contain such additional information as may be prescribed in regulations under section 65.</blockquote>(8) Subsection (7)(e)(iii) shall not, insofar only as determining the student&rsquo;s academic ability, skills or aptitude is necessary in order to ascertain whether or not the student has the category of special educational needs concerned, apply to the admission of students to&mdash;<blockquote>(a) a school approved by the Minister to provide an education exclusively for students with a specified category or categories of special educational needs, or<br /><br />(b) a special class.</blockquote>(9) Subsection (7)(e)(vi) shall not apply to selection criteria based on a student&rsquo;s connection to the school by virtue of&mdash;<blockquote>(a) a sibling of the student concerned attending or having attended the school, or<br /><br />(b) a parent or grandparent of the student concerned having previously attended the school, provided the maximum number of places filled pursuant to that criterion does not exceed 25 per cent of the available places as set out in the school&rsquo;s annual admission notice for the school year concerned.</blockquote>(10) (a) Notwithstanding subsection (7)(e)(vii), a school may apply a selection criterion based on the date on which an application for admission or an expression of interest in applying for admission was received by the school where, prior to the coming into operation of this subsection the school had confirmed, in writing, to the person who made the application or expression of interest that the name of the child in respect of whom the application or expression of interest had been made had been placed on a list maintained by the school for the purpose of allocating school places in the school year concerned.<blockquote><blockquote>(b) Paragraph (a) shall cease to have effect 5 years after it comes into operation.</blockquote>(11) In this section 'code of behaviour' has the same meaning as it has in the Education (Welfare) Act 2000.&quot;.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote> <p>It should be borne in mind that I will revert on Report Stage in respect of the past pupils provision in the light of the discussion that we had.</p></speech>

This requirement is separate to the requirement to prepare and publish an admission policy, which should be done within three months of the commencement of the provision and thereafter whenever it is intended to make any changes to the admission policy.  The annual admission notice sets out how the admission policy and application forms can be obtained and the dates for the admission process.</p><p>The number of places being offered in the intake group and, where a school has previously been oversubscribed, the number of applications received in the previous year and the number and order of offers made in the previous school year in respect of each of the school's oversubscription criteria will also be set out in the annual admission notice.  The number of places being offered in the intake group, as set out in this notice, shall not be decreased.  Different dates may be set out for the admission of students with special educational needs and to the residential element of boarding schools.</p><p>This amendment will provide greater clarity and transparency for both applicants and schools.

Amendments Nos. 50 and 51 also further clarify the subsection by providing that the reference to &quot;school&quot; be replaced with &quot;board&quot;, that the word &quot;for&quot; be inserted after &quot;shall not charge fees&quot; and that boarding schools can only charge fees in so far as those fees relate solely to the cost of providing residential boarding places.</p></speech>

It is all right for us to regulate what schools are allowed to do but it is incumbent on the Government to make sure they are funded properly and are able to do their business without recourse to parents.  It should be front and centre of the legislative process.  If we are going to stop schools doing one thing, we need to make sure the Government steps in, which it has failed to do in the past and has forced schools down other routes.</p></speech>

The approach to the Bill is to provide for the option of regulating where it is necessary and proportionate.  This is in line with the principle of subsidiarity whereby decision-making is with the board and patron as far as possible.  A fundamental feature of our school system is that the governance and management of a school is within the control of the board of management.  As a general approach, this Bill seeks to maintain and support this position and to only interfere with the board&rsquo;s authority to determine and manage the admission of pupils to its school where this is necessary.  While regulations will undoubtedly be put in place for some aspects of admission and over time the aspects that require regulation may change, it is not necessarily the case that the Minister should regulate on all matters set out in this section.  I am also cognisant of the need to ensure that regulations would not make the admission process overly complex or burdensome for either parents or schools.  It is important to note that this section requires the Minister to consult with the various stakeholders specified before regulating.  If the Minister was required to regulate in the manner suggested, then he or she may not be in a position to properly respond to the views expressed through that consultation particularly where there is a clear consensus that a particular aspect of admission does not require any regulatory intervention.  Accordingly, it is preferable that this section gives the Minister flexibility to regulate when and where it is necessary to do so and on those specific matters or issues on which regulation is at any given time required.  This is the more appropriate approach.</p></speech>

It would be very useful where I live in east Meath and also in towns like Ashbourne, where parents could choose from a number of schools, all of which have different lists.  While there is probably more co-operation now than there used to be, schools often do not know where they stand with students if students are on multiple lists.</p><p>There is a case for the Minister to do as the amendment proposes and establish a jointly co-ordinated and operated admissions process in order that, at the very least, schools know how many children are in the area.  We have had problems in east Meath and in Ashbourne and Balbriggan over the years where there were not school places for children, while other areas may be overestimating the number of children.  This should be considered.  I understand the Minister is looking at it and I am glad of that.  I would be interested to hear what he has to say.</p></speech>

I will move an amendment today to this section which will allow schools, for the purposes of facilitating the efficient admission of students, to share information with each other in respect of applications received, offers made and offers accepted.  We earlier dealt with an amendment requiring a parent to provide that information to the school.  I am satisfied that the existing provision in the Bill, which will be strengthened by my amendment enabling information sharing, would allow a Minister to direct schools to co-ordinate their processes in the manner proposed by the Deputy.  I therefore consider that the amendment is unnecessary.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 89 provides that a board may share information about applications for admission with another board or patron.  Boards may share a list of students in respect of whom an application for admission has been received and an offer of admission has been made or accepted.  Such a list may include a student&rsquo;s personal details, including the student&rsquo;s name, address, date of birth and public service number.  The introduction of this provision seeks to address the practice of parents making applications or accepting offers for multiple schools and should make the enrolment process more effective and efficient for both schools and applicants.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 98 and 110 provide that the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, and the Child and Family Agency shall have regard to the admissions policy of schools in the locality when making a designation.  Amendment No. 94 provides that the NCSE should also have regard to the availability of places in schools in the locality when making a designation.  This is a matter to which the Child and Family Agency already have regard.</p><p>Amendment No. 118 also removes the reference to designation being cancelled where a school has proved that the refusal to admit the child is essential to maintain the ethos of the school as provided for by section 7(3)(<i>c) </i>of the Equal Status Act.  This amendment is necessary as a designation appeals committee would not be suitably qualified to make this determination and this provision is straying into the remit of relevant equality legislation legal process.</p><p>Amendment No. 104 is a minor wording amendment which replaces the reference in the Bill to &quot;where the child has not been admitted to any school&quot; with &quot;where the child has no school place.&quot;</p><p>Amendments Nos. 142 and 144 provide that the Minister, in addition to consulting with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, the NCSE and the Child and Family Agency as provided for in the Bill, shall consult with bodies representative of patrons, national associations of parents, recognised school management organisations and trade unions, and staff associations representing teachers, when setting out procedures to be followed by an appeals committee.  Amendment No. 144 clarifies that such procedures shall be determined as opposed to being set out by way of regulation.</p><p>A small number of minor typographical amendments are required, such as amendments Nos. 92 and 105, removing the reference to a school admitting a child &quot;as a student&quot;.  The wording &quot;as a student&quot; is not required as its use in this context is not compatible with the definition of student in the Bill.</p><p>Amendment No. 149 defines child as including a person in respect of whom an application for admission to a school has not been made.  This takes account of situations where a parent may not have made an application for admission to a school.  Amendments Nos. 91, 95, 97, 99, 109 and 111 are consequential numbering amendments.</p></speech>

It sets down the procedure to be followed by the NCSE or the Child and Family Agency for designating a special needs child to a school.  Included in this is an appeals process where the school may appeal against this decision.</p> <p>  The Bill has only two grounds where a school may successfully appeal such a decision.  These are where the NCSE or the Child and Family Agency fail to follow correct procedures or where the child's religion is not compatible with that of the religious ethos of the school concerned.  The school can prove that it needs to refuse admission on the basis of maintaining that ethos.  The amendment I have put forward would remove the second ground for appeal.</p> <p>  The Minister proposes to amend the Bill to delete this second ground.  Amendment No. 110 would, however, have the same effect as it sets down that the agency, in making a decision to designate, must have regard to the admissions policies of schools in the locality.  This would appear to be a backdoor way of doing the same thing and allowing that discrimination on the grounds of religion.  If that is the case, that makes for poor law.  It is unacceptable because it would favour religious ethos over the rights of that special needs child.  This should have no place in our legislation and it is very hard to defend on any grounds.</p> <p>  In the case of children with special needs, we are all too familiar with the difficulties they have in accessing schools and with schools not being prepared to make provision for them to the extent that they should.  The idea that a child who is already disadvantaged due to special needs could be further disadvantaged by being refused on the grounds of religious ethos is an act of double discrimination.  I am open to correction on this but that is my interpretation of what is proposed in amendment No. 110.  If this is indeed the case, then I find it unacceptable.</p></speech>

It would state that the NCSE should have regard to the ability of the school to make all reasonable efforts to accommodate the child, rather as it currently stands, that is, to have regard to the ability of the school to accommodate the child.</p></speech>

We feel the council must have regard to the school that is in the best interests of the child to attend.  I have no problem with that in principle.</p> <p>  With regard to amendment No. 100, tabled by Deputy Martin, the Bill already provides the council must have regard to the school's ability to accommodate the child.  The amendment proposed would reword this to refer to the school's ability to make all reasonable efforts to accommodate the child.  I consider the current wording, referring simply to the school's ability, is adequate and takes account of the fact this will depend on the school in question.  Inserting the proposed wording might cause confusion about this provision and potentially dilute its meaning.</p> <p>  I wish to point out, with regard to amendments Nos. 113 and 124, that the Bill applies to recognised schools only.  It does not apply to schools that are not funded or recognised by the Minister for Education and Skills.  Such a non-recognised school should not, therefore, be designated under this section.  Accordingly, amendments proposing that these particular provisions of the Bill be confined to schools that are not aided by the Department, in other words, non-recognised schools, do not make sense in the context of a Bill that does not apply to non-recognised schools.  I therefore do not accept the amendment.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 115 and 126 relate to a parental appeal, and it must be pointed out that the designation powers in the section are targeted at very specific situations.  They are aimed at children who have no school place at all, including where their parents have tried and failed across many schools to secure a school place for their child.  These provisions are not about ensuring parents in those circumstances get their preferred school or school of first choice.  The provisions give the council or the agency, as applicable, a power of last resort which can be used after a child has been refused access to many schools.  These provisions are not about creating new places in schools that are already full, nor are they about ensuring that the preferred school of choice is designated.  Where a school is designated for a child, the school is required to admit that child.  There is no corresponding compulsion on the parent to avail of the place in the designated school.  The parent may yet decide to pursue other applications or appeals under section 29.  It is, however, appropriate that there would be an appeal process for the designated school as the school is being compelled to admit the child.  A school could be designated, even where it has already lawfully refused the child and an appeal decision under section 29 has upheld that decision.  Therefore, it is reasonable that a school would have a final opportunity to appeal when such a significant interference in its affairs is in question.  It should be noted that an appeal will only be upheld where the appeals committee is satisfied that the agency or council, as applicable, has not complied with the requirements of this section or where the school has established that the decision of the agency or council is unreasonable.</p> <p>  Under this section, parents can appeal where the agency or council has failed or refused to make a designation.  It must also be noted that the agency or council under the Bill must have regard to the wishes of the parents and the school that, in the view of the agency or council, is in the best interests of the child concerned.  However, I do not consider that there should be an appeal on whether the school that has been designated is the preferred school for the parents.  For these reasons I do not accept the amendment.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 121 to 123, inclusive, all propose to delete the provision allowing a designation to be cancelled where a school has proved that the refusal to admit the child is essential to maintain the ethos of the school as provided for by section 7(3)(c) of the Equal Status Act.  I have provided for this provision to be removed as already outlined.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 147 defines "all reasonable efforts" by a parent and I do not consider that such an amendment is appropriate.  It will be a matter for the agency, council or appeals committee concerned to determine whether a parent has made such efforts.  The agency or council must itself also have regard to the interests of the child and the availability of places locally.</p> <p>  Deputy Shortall raised the question about the amendment which inserted the words, "must have regard to the admissions policy".  This is to look at issues such as the gender of the school and that a requirement would not be imposed on, for example, an all-girls school.  The overriding situation is that the best interests of the child is what will be served but this is a factor the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, would bear in mind.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.719" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1222" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2017062800002#HH00400"><p>If the best interests of the child applied we would not have discrimination on religious grounds.  It is not any consolation this might be the case.  The Minister has already spelled out he has deleted the grounds on which places can be refused relating to section 7(3)(c).  My point is that having deleted this, the Minister's amendment seeking to reference the admissions policy of schools in the locality will restore that provision because the admissions policy of the schools in the locality allows them to discriminate on religious grounds.  It is often very hard for children with special needs to get into mainstream schools, particularly their local mainstream school.  In a situation where the parents were not able to locate or source a school and the council or the Child and Family Agency designates a school as being suitable and states it is the school suitable for the child who has special needs, the idea the school could then appeal this on the grounds of religion, and that a child with special needs not subscribing to the same religious beliefs would undermine the ethos of the school, seems shocking.  Many schools are very good at welcoming children with special needs, but some schools go out of their way to not take children with special needs.  This provides grounds for refusing a place to a special needs child where a school has already been designated as the most suitable school for the child but a child with special needs will then be expected to jump another hurdle.  Acceptance of the amendment, whereby the admissions policy of schools in the locality would apply, means if a school has a policy of refusal on the grounds of religion then a special needs child can be refused on the grounds of religion.  While on the one hand the Minister has removed those grounds, on the other hand he is replacing them with the general provision of the admissions policy of schools in the locality.</p></speech>

To this end on Report Stage I will table amendments on the principle of what is in the best interests of the child.</p></speech>

It amends a section where, in making a designation under subsection (3), the agency will have regard to a certain number of aspects, including the wishes of the child's parents, where appropriate, in accordance with the age and maturity of the child concerned; the wishes of the child; and the availability of places in the locality and the school that in the agency's view would be in the best interests of the child.  We will add to that the admissions policy.  The purpose of this is not the purpose the Deputy considers, which is to bring in religion as a basis for refusal.  The purpose is to look at issues such as special schools.</p><p>The admissions policy for special schools will set out the schools for which it is appropriate, so that in looking at the placement of a child with special needs, they will look at the admissions policies around special needs categories and gender and issues such as that.  This is something they will take into account.  It is not binding on the agency obviously, as it considers these issues.  This is in no way providing that the agency will say that religion is the overwhelming issue and it will not consider a school for that reason.  It is just one factor in a list that will be considered, and the intended purpose is not to introduce some baptism barrier, as the Deputy suggested.  As we discussed earlier, the Equal Status Act is an issue to which we intend to return and that is not being dealt with in this Bill.  The intention of amendment No. 110 is not that ascribed to it by the Deputy.</p></speech>

It could well be interpreted in that way.  It is providing local schools' admissions policies as a grounds for appeal.  The Minister does not say it only relates to gender or special needs.  The admissions policies of schools in the locality covers the right to refuse on the grounds of religion.</p></speech>

It is in the issues which will be considered by the council or the agency.  I will look at the wording of this amendment again because if it can be more precise, then we should make it more precise to ensure it could not be construed in another way.  This is just one of a list of issues where the agency will consider it.  This is not offering a grounds of refusal to a school.  This is an issue that would be looked at.  The intention is that the agency would look at what the school was offering in terms of the facilities and the admission policies that were involved in the various schools in the locality.  It would look across the spectrum.  Religion would be one of the issues it would look at.  In view of Deputy Shortall's concern, which is that, on the face of it, it could be drawn a bit too widely, perhaps we should spell out what elements of the admissions policy should be assessed and I will look afresh at amendment No. 110.  It is certainly an unintended consequence if it were to work in the way the Deputy is concerned about.</p></speech>

I have huge respect for the language and I try to speak it as often as I can.  These amendments go too far and it will turn people off the language if we start legislating to ensure all work be carried out through Irish.

I congratulate Deputies McGrath and Byrne on their re-appointment and I welcome Deputy Daly to his new role as part of the Department of Health's ministerial team.  I am also joined by the Secretary General, Mr. Jim Breslin.</p><p>I am pleased on more than one level to be here again.  I have said on a number of occasions that our health service needs stability in its political leadership and direction.  I am very glad and honoured that I, as Minister for Health, will have the opportunity to continue to work with this committee and with all involved in the Irish health service with the common aim of trying to improve the health service for our patients and staff.  Although the name in the ministerial chair is the same, I welcome the opportunity to take stock and take a fresh look at this Government&rsquo;s priorities and, indeed, the Oireachtas' priorities and to refocus our efforts to make things better for patients.  The Taoiseach has made it very clear in his speech to the D&aacute;il Chamber that delivering real improvements in our health services is a key priority for this Government.  I will not deny that we face challenges.  Over the last period of time, however, I have learned some valuable lessons.</p><p>Perhaps one of the most encouraging lessons is that there is an absolute abundance of good people who are making a difference in our health service.  I am talking about clinicians, patient groups, policy makers and, indeed, Oireachtas Members, all of whom share the same goal, namely, to develop a health service we can be proud of.  We need to harness that commitment.  While we need to acknowledge the range of issues and challenges we face we also need to look at our<i></i>success stories, of which there are many.  Just yesterday I welcomed the publication of the third annual report of the national health care quality reporting system.  It is very encouraging to see the improvements in a number of areas.  Hospitalisation rates, for example, have decreased substantially for both diabetes and heart failure.  During the last ten years, deaths following stroke and heart attack have decreased by 28% and 40%, respectively.  Cancer screening and treatment services compare favourably against other OECD countries and rates of MRSA have fallen by 66% since 2006.  </p><p>We have a range of policies and strategies in place to bring about further improvements.  The Healthy Ireland strategy, the maternity strategy and the eHealth strategy provide great clarity on what is required in three important areas, as do the HSE&rsquo;s national clinical programmes at a more operational level.  I will shortly launch a new cancer strategy and the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, will bring a new national drugs strategy to Government following a huge amount of work and engagement with stakeholders on her part.  I also intend to shortly bring proposals to Government on the development of a human tissue Bill that will encompass opt-out arrangements for organ donation.  This can actually help save more lives.  All of these represent real progress in improving outcomes for patients and for service users.  I have also learned the value of using the available expertise to inform solutions<i>.</i>Importantly, the strategies I have just outlined have all been developed with both patient and service user input.  Who better to inform a strategy than those who have experience and valuable input to offer?</p><p>The value of adopting a cross-sectoral approach cannot be overstated.  When I say cross-sectoral I am talking about collaboration within our health services and also across Government.  This is clearly evidenced in the publication of the report of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare<b>.  </b>The near unanimity in support for the report demonstrates that we as politicians can put aside our political differences for vital issues such as the goal of delivering a world class health service.  I would again like to commend the work of all members of the committee, some of whom are also members of this committee, for the time and effort they dedicated to producing the Sl&aacute;intecare report.</p><p>This is a critical milestone in the history of our health service.  It provides us with a solid framework and guidance for the development of health services over the next decade.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that considerable change and transformation is required.  That is why the ten year timeframe is a key strength of the report.  If we want to  introduce meaningful changes on a sustainable basis, we need to be realistic about the timelines required to plan and implement large scale system change in services as important as health care.  We must also ensure sustained buy-in to these changes, independent of intervening electoral cycles and the composition of the Government of the day.  We need a new model of integrated care, centred on comprehensive primary and community care services.  That fact is undisputed by any member of the committee.  Our hospital system will simply not cope with the likely levels of demand in the coming years if we continue with our current model of care.  Our hospital services are already showing the signs of considerable strain in meeting growing demand for services.  Health outcomes and patient experience can be much improved by developing greater services in the community and by bringing about deeper and more seamless integration across the health and social care system.<br/><br/>Since taking up the position of Minister over a year ago, I have been clear that we need more capacity, both physical and staffing.  This problem is being experienced right across the health system.  A capacity review is under way which will report later in the year.  It will give us a definitive assessment of capacity requirements across the system and provide a platform for planning and delivering health services in the years ahead.  We all know we will not address capacity constraints overnight but building on the additional capacity already introduced last winter, we can, through targeted capital investment, start to equip our health services for the growth in demand that is being experienced.  Since last we met, the Government has approved two major capital investment decisions in health facilities in the form of the national children&rsquo;s hospital and the national forensic mental health facility.  We also saw the opening of the new state-of-the-art emergency department at University Hospital Limerick.  There is also a concerted effort under way to recruit and retain staff.  While this is not without its challenges, the development of a more attractive working environment will go hand in hand with the roll-out of system improvements.<br/><br/>The number of consultants has increased significantly.  At the end of April 2017, there were 2,884 whole-time equivalents.  This constitutes an increase of 298 since April 2014.  The number of non-consultant hospital doctors has also increased significantly from 4,982 at the end of April 2014 to 6,092 at the end of April 2017 to support service delivery and the progression of compliance with the provisions of the European working time directive.  This was very important.  Nursing and midwifery numbers at the end of April 2017 stood at 36,549 whole-time equivalents, having increased by 625 whole-time equivalents in the 12 months from end April 2016 and by 1,870 in the three years from end April 2014.  We intend to build on these increases through further recruitment and retention initiatives.  The new public pay agreement, which is under consideration by union members, provides improvements in pay which I hope will make the salaries we can offer in this country more attractive.  However, the committee members know that pay is not the only issue which influences the attractiveness of a working environment.  A number of initiatives are being taken forward by my Department and the HSE, including the continued implementation of the recommendations of the MacCraith group and the task force on staffing and skill mix for nursing, which is beginning to yield real progress.<br/><br/>Significant work is also being undertaken by the office of the chief nursing officer in my Department to widen opportunities for nurses to develop career paths as advanced practitioners or working in the community as part of the development of primary care services.  An essential part of any development of primary care will be the agreement of a new GP contract which we have discussed many times at this committee.  I am very pleased that the next phase of discussions is under way with the aim of developing a new modernised contract to facilitate the shift within the health service away from hospital services towards an integrated primary care service.  I want to see a new contract which has a population health focus, providing in particular for health promotion and disease prevention and for the structured ongoing care of chronic conditions.  The discussions which are currently taking place are wide ranging and ambitious in their scope.  While there will be challenges for all parties involved, I am hopeful that with the goodwill and co-operation of all parties, significant progress can be made in these discussions.  I have always said this was a huge body of work which would take the bulk of 2017 to do.  That is indeed proving to be the case.<br/><br/>To achieve the responsive, integrated, effective system that we all desire, significant investment in information systems is needed.This came up often during the SlainteCare report process.  We were coming from a particularly low base when the e-health strategy was first put in place.  This is a prime example of a challenge which might have appeared too daunting to permit systemic change but we are beginning to see what can be achieved when a clear strategy is put in place.  At end of May, I signed a commencement order and made regulations under the Health Identifiers Act 2014 allowing for access to the register of individual health identifiers and also for the use of the health identifier within the health sector, both public and private, for the purposes provided for in the Act.  The latest legislative provision allows for the beginning of the roll-out of individual health identifiers by the HSE.  While it will take some time to embed the number in all our health systems, the recent legislative action is a timely and important step and an enabler for an improved health information system.<br/><br/>In addition to tasking me with preparing a response to the SlainteCare report, the Taoiseach announced upon his appointment that bringing forward legislation on alcohol is one of his priorities.  Committee Stage of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill will likely recommence in the Seanad in this session of the Oireachtas.  I appeal to all members of the committee and our respective political parties to give their full support to our progression of this critical piece of public health legislation through the Oireachtas.  The Taoiseach also announced that bringing forward legislation to allow for a referendum on the eighth amendment in 2018 is one of his priorities.  I await the report of the Citizens Assembly which I understand is due to be published very shortly.  As members know, the report will be referred to the special joint committee on the eighth amendment which is to report its conclusions and recommendations to both Houses of the Oireachtas within three months of its first public meeting<b>.</b>I have been clear my view is that this is an issue with which we as a nation must now deal definitively.  I want to be the Minister who brings forward the legislation to allow this important referendum to take place in 2018 but I am conscious of the body or work the Oireachtas committee will do over the coming months.  I am committed to making all possible resources available within my Department to ensure we can act on any proposed change.<br/><br/>One of my personal priorities and that of the Taoiseach is to make progress on access-related issues.  While there are may good parts of our health service, access is the key issue that causes so many of our citizens' problems.  Reducing waiting times for the longest waiting patients must be a key priority.  It is for this reason that &euro;20 million was allocated to the NTPF in the budget 2017, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.  I asked the HSE to develop waiting list action plans for inpatient, day case, scoliosis and outpatient services and they are now being implemented and making a difference.  The inpatient, day case and outpatient plan<font color="#001FE2"></font>focuses on reducing the number of patients waiting 15 months or more for inpatient and day case treatment or for an outpatient appointment by the end of October.  The scoliosis action plan aims to ensure that no patient who requires scoliosis surgery will be waiting more than four months for surgery by the end of 2017.  It is an extraordinarily ambitious but important target.  During 2017, my Department will continue to work with the HSE and NTPF to ensure the best use of public hospital capacity and the private hospital system to meet the needs of patients waiting for inpatient, day case and outpatient services.  We will ensure work begins to get under way quickly for 2018.<br/><br/>In turning to emergency care, I acknowledge first the distress caused to patients, their families and front-line staff working in extremely difficult working conditions in emergency departments in hospitals throughout the country.  Data from the HSE indicates that the national situation saw an improvement from January to early May.  Since May, there has been an increase in trolley numbers due to a series of factors including, increased emergency department attendances and elective activity, which shows that when one tries to perform more elective procedures, it has a knock-on effect in the emergency department, showing the clear need to increase capacity.  My Department and the HSE are currently engaged in a process to commence winter planning for next year and to achieve an improvement in emergency department performance.  The HSE is implementing a roadmap which sets out an approach to driving reduction in the number of patients waiting on trolleys and trolley wait times over the period from March 2017 to the end of the year 2018.  Achieving improvements in access times for both scheduled and emergency care is a challenge for health services against a backdrop of growing demand but it is a challenge to which everyone must rise.  I will be working closely with officials and the HSE to show that we can make a positive impact in this area.  It cannot be beyond our health service or our country to improve this situation.  My ministerial colleagues are also progressing a number of priorities within their areas of responsibilities and I am sure they will be able to outline these during the questions which follow.<br/><br/>I am very happy to be returning to work with the committee with a fresh mandate from the Taoiseach to deliver real and lasting improvements in our health services.  Life will never be so dull that we have unanimity on everything-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.929" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017062800002#G00500"><p>I bid the committee a good afternoon.  I appreciate the invitation to be here.</p><p>I am joined by my colleagues: Ms Anne O&rsquo;Connor, mental health division; Mr. Pat Healy, social care division; Mr. Liam Woods, acute services division; and Ms Rosarii Mannion, human resources division.  The committee requested information and replies to a number of specific questions.  I will therefore confine my opening remarks to the following areas.<br/><br/>On the issue of acute services, balancing scheduled care and unscheduled care demands remains a challenge in 2017.  Despite a sustained increase in emergency department, ED, attendances of the order of 6% and particularly in the over 75 age category, overall TrolleyGAR numbers for the year to date are lower than the comparable period last year.  Improvements in ED patient experience time less than 24 hours have also been achieved with national performance currently at 97% compliance, with 12 sites achieving in excess of 98% compliance.<br/><br/>A high priority for the HSE is to continuously improve elective access to services for patients.  A key objective in 2017 is to build on the successes in reducing waiting times achieved last year.  The HSE, working with the NTPF and the Department of Health, has developed waiting list action plans over the last number of months for the inpatient and day-case, IPDC, waiting lists, outpatient waiting lists and in particular for scoliosis.  Analysis of the IPDC waiting lists by the NTPF, as of February 2017, identified that 38,991 patients will be waiting greater than 15 months at the end of October 2017.  The HSE has agreed a plan with the Department that targets a 75% reduction in this number by the end of October 2017.  The HSE will reduce the number of breaches by approximately 23,000 through funded activity levels.  The plan is supported by additional funding of &euro;15 million through the NTPF, which would see an additional 7,000 patients treated through insourcing and outsourcing initiatives.  Latest figures show that the HSE has already progressed treatment for almost 14,300 of these longest waiters.<br/><br/>The HSE has also published an outpatient waiting list action plan that is aimed at achieving a 50% reduction in the number of patients that will be waiting over 15 months by the end of October 2017.  To put this into context, in February 2017, it was established that 191,016 patients would breach 15 months by the end of October 2017.  Accordingly, our plan provides for 95,508 patients from this cohort to be seen by October 2017.  Based on the most recent NTPF data, 36,000 patients have had their outpatient appointments under this plan. This means that the HSE is 12.6% ahead of that target.<br/><br/>Earlier this year, I announced a commitment that no paediatric patient would wait more than four months for scoliosis surgery by the end of 2017.  I am pleased to confirm to the committee that the scoliosis plan now in progress addresses treatment of children requiring both spinal fusion and other spinal procedures.  This includes insourcing in the children&rsquo;s hospital group and the broader public hospital sector, as well as outsourcing initiatives, including private providers nationally and abroad.  In tandem, the HSE is working to develop a long-term sustainable solution for scoliosis and paediatric orthopaedic patients in order that the four-month waiting time becomes the norm.<br/><br/>In quality and safety, the HSE continues to seek to improve the quality and safety of its services.  The recent publication of maternity and hospital safety statements are important steps in measuring the quality and safety of our services and making this information available to both our patients and the wider public.  The national patient experience survey is the largest single survey of the health care system to be conducted in Ireland. We will listen and learn from the findings of this survey to shape future health care policy and improve health outcomes for patients.  The HSE is progressing some key service developments this year to continuously improve the environment for patients and staff.  The new ward block in University Hospital Galway is now open.<b></b>The new emergency department in University Hospital Limerick opened in May and is fully operational.  Recruitment is under way for two additional intensive care unit beds in Cork University Hospital and for the opening of the acute medical unit in Midland Regional Hospital in Portlaoise.<br/><br/>In primary care, the HSE continues to expand its community intervention teams, CITs. The CIT and the outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy, OPAT, service is now operational at 13 sites, which are listed in the document.  The number of patient referrals for the period January to May 2017 was 14,844.  This has increased by 34% compared to same period last year and activity is scheduled to exceed 32,000 new referrals by year end.<br/><br/>Improving the infrastructure for chronic illness management in primary care is a key service plan target, involving structured GP care for those with type 2 diabetes and the recruitment of 49 additional front-line clinical posts in the areas of diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, and heart failure.  The hepatitis C programme is a multi-annual public health plan which aims to provide treatment across a range of health care settings to all persons living with hepatitis C in Ireland.  Advancements in therapeutic treatments for hepatitis C have allowed patients to be successfully treated and fully cured from the blood-borne virus.  Therefore, making it a rare disease in Ireland is becoming a realisable objective.<br/><br/>Improved commercial terms in relation to medication costs are enabling treatment for up to 1,600 patients this year, an increase from the 600 patients treated last year.  Of note for this year is that all patients infected with hepatitis C through the supply of blood and blood products will now have been offered treatment, with success rates of more than 97% within the cohort.<br/><br/>This year's service plan makes provision for improved access to GP care for more than 9,000 children in receipt of domiciliary care allowance and through reduced prescription charges for people over 70 and their dependents.  Charges are now reduced from &euro;2.50 to &euro;2 per prescription item and there is a reduction of the monthly cap from &euro;25 to &euro;20.<br/><br/>Demand for social care disability services continues to increase reflective of demographic trends and the service continues to respond pro-actively within available resources.  Each community health care organisation, CHO, has now established a formal consultative process with service providers to co-ordinate and prioritise responses to emergency cases that are being delivered within the profile for the year.  The year will see the allocation of the largest level of funding for school leavers and rehabilitative training in recent years.  An additional allocation of &euro;10 million has been provided to meet the needs of 14,005 identified individuals, equivalent to a full year cost of &euro;20 million in 2018.  A profiling exercise for each 2017 school leaver referred to our services has been completed and each CHO will be communicating a proposed allocation of places for service users and their families by the end of this month.<br/><br/>With regard to services for older people, home care and transitional care are being delivered within profile for the year while, in relation to long-term care for older people, the nursing home support scheme is being delivered on target with waiting times no greater than four weeks.<br/><br/>In mental health services, the implementation of Connecting for Life - Ireland&rsquo;s National Strategy to Reduce Suicide 2015-2020 continues to be a key priority for the HSE.  Significant progress is reported in the implementation of the actions set out in the Connecting for Life strategy, with activity initiated or planned for 2017 in 65 out of the 69 actions, which is a total of 94%.  The Central Statistics Office has recently published provisional suicide data for 2016 which indicate a decrease of 11.5% on 2015 numbers.  In addition, the National Self-Harm Registry Ireland also confirms a stabilisation and slight reduction in the rates of self-harm presentation to emergency departments.<br/><br/>With regard to recent reports that suggested that Ireland has the fourth-highest teen suicide rate in the EU/OECD region, it is important to note that this data related to 2010.  In May 2017, EUROSTAT updated its OECD suicide rate comparisons based on 2014 data which shows that in Ireland, the suicide rates among young males and females aged 15 to 19 have decreased with Ireland now 19th across the countries studied, with an average rate of 4.64 per 100,000, which is now slightly lower than the European average rate of 4.67.  We are working hard to bring about further improvements. <br/><br/>The HSE will continue to focus on the implementation of key actions in Connecting for Life and the forthcoming recommendations of the youth task force to improve access to and quality of services and supports for young people.  Within the mental health division, there continues to be a focus on service improvement with a view to improving quality of and access to mental health services for all age groups, both for those who are already known to services and for those who present for the first time.</p><p>It is acknowledged that attending an emergency department can be a very stressful experience, and other alternatives are now being explored, including 7/7 day services and out-of-hours services.  The contract for the new 170-bed national forensic mental health service hospital on St. Ita's campus in Portrane has been signed by the HSE and work on the site is under way.  The hospital will replace the 94-bed Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum which was built in the 1850s and is no longer fit for purpose.  The new hospital will play a national role in the provision of a modern forensic mental health service and it will enable the HSE to provide an environment that positively supports patient recovery with modern health care standards.  That concludes my opening statement, and together with my colleagues, I will endeavour to answer any questions the committee may have.</p></speech>

The Minister said in his opening statement:</p><blockquote>I am pleased on more than one level to be here again.  I have said on a number of occasions that our health service needs stability in its political leadership and direction.</blockquote> <p>One has political stability and direction in North Korea but it does not necessarily mean that it is going in the right direction.  I hope we can bring the Minister back to the centre from time to time.  I do wish him well on a personal level.</p><p>I must again raise the issue of scoliosis.  Reference has been made to it in both opening statements.  I accept that a lot of effort is being made but a lot more is being said than done in terms of the output.  A target has been set of a maximum four-month waiting list for scoliosis paediatric orthopaedic surgery, but there is a problem with the target, namely, the delay in diagnosis in the first place.  I have it on good authority that children are waiting an inordinate period for an MRI scan because they have to be anaesthetised to undergo the scan.  I have been informed there are significant delays in accessing MRI scans.  I would welcome an elaboration on that.  It is fine to have a time limit on the waiting times for surgery, but if a child is waiting an inordinate time for the diagnosis in advance of the surgery, it is a problem that must be addressed meaningfully.</p><p>I met the family members of children suffering from scoliosis recently and I am aware the Minister met them as well.  The group was from Kilkenny and was called the Scoliosis Advocacy Network.  The women involved are very powerful and their testimony was very powerful in terms of the evidence they gave about the suffering and delays their children had to endure.  I do not wish to turn this into an emotive issue.  I raised it in the D&aacute;il and the replies from the Minister were very positive.  The sum of &euro;1 million was potentially identified in the National Treatment Purchase Fund to address scoliosis.  However, diagnosis and prognosis are critically important if we are to alleviate the suffering of children who are affected and to give them an equal opportunity.</p><p>Child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, were raised this morning in the D&aacute;il on the Order of Business, but I raise it in the context of Cork.  There is no point in us pretending the service is anything but chaotic.  The service is almost negligible in the South/South West hospital group area.  I have heard about very worrying cases recently, including children being held in inappropriate conditions in St. Stephen's Hospital in Cork.  We are making very little progress with child and adolescent mental health services and we must put a strong emphasis on it.  I accept there are difficulties with recruitment but that has been ongoing for a long time.</p><p>I thank Mr. O'Brien for his opening statement.  I was interested by his statement that, &quot;Ireland [is] now 19th across the countries studied, with an average rate of 4.64 per 100,000, which is now slightly lower than the European average&quot;.  Will he provide reasons for that reduction?  Is there a potential template for other cohorts of the population where we are not seeing as rapid a reduction?  It would be useful if we could learn lessons from that.  Is it due to the national strategy to reduce suicide or is it due to changes in circumstances in the economy?  I would like to hear the reasons or if Mr. O'Brien could elaborate on that.</p><p>My views on the GP contract are well known to the Minister and Mr. Breslin.  I still do not understand why half the GPs are outside the room looking in through an opaque window at the discussions that are ongoing for a new GP contract.  The Minister said all stakeholders should engage in a proactive way, but half the GPs are outside the door.  The key stakeholders are those who will deliver the service.  I believe the National Association of GPs, NAGP, should be in the room as part of the discussions in a formal setting along with the IMO to ensure there is a clear understanding of what the contract will be and that it will not have to be discussed again by others outside the formal setting after it has been agreed in the formal talks.  It defies logic and credibility to say that half the people who are expected to deliver the contract will not even be in the room discussing it.  It is not just about the GPs, it is about the bedrock of all the strategies we are promoting, be that the Minister and his party, my party, Sinn F&eacute;in, the Labour Party and other parties, including as part of the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  We all support the move from hospital-centred care to a primary care and community care model.  I still urge the Minister at this late stage to address the fact that half the GPs are not present at the talks.

I wish to raise the Herity report and the very tragic circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Thomas Power.  He died last Sunday week outside Dungarvan while he was being transferred to Cork.  He drove to Waterford hospital as he did not feel well and he was subsequently transferred to Cork, but he died on the way there.  I know there will be a full clinical review of the case.  I do not like raising such issues as I am conscious of the families involved, but we would almost be failing in our duty if we were to allow it to pass without delving into the reasons it happened.  If there are flaws in the service, as I believe is the case, we should address them.  The Herity report is forming part of the overall acute cardiac service reviews across the country.  If the Minister is reviewing cardiac services nationally, I do not understand why he would allow the Herity report to stand and to work out from there when everyone in the south east knows there is a deficiency in cardiac services.  That is acknowledged by everyone.  It is even acknowledged in the Herity report, which I believe is flawed.  In the south east we have 170,000 people who are up to 90 minutes away from acute cardiac services.  That in itself is a very worrying situation.  I am concerned that the national review will take the Herity report as being de facto and correct, and use it when assessing the overall national cardiac services.  The Herity report should be withdrawn, and when the full appraisal is done, it should be a stand-alone one.  The people of the south east deserve that much, as well as the Power family and others who may have suffered tragic consequences due to the inadequate cardiac services.  I urge the Minister to examine that issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.938" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017062800002#J00800"><p>I add my congratulations to those who were reappointed and those who are newly appointed.  I say well done to them all.  I will try to keep my questions brief.  I will take a deep breath and lash through them.  The first one relates to Brexit.</p><p>We had the Department's Brexit committee before us.  Its members were woefully unprepared for the delights coming in our direction with regard to Brexit.  Have the arrangements for the sharing of services cross-Border been Brexit-proofed?  Do we have a Brexit-proof agreement with the North for the sharing of services in general and specifically in Altnagelvin?  What concerned me was when I asked the members tasked by the Department of Health to deal with Brexit if they had ascertained the extent to which we are reliant on Britain for health care, they did not know.  When I asked them the numbers, they did not know.  When I pursued it with them, they advised that it was only when they got the invitation to the committee that it occurred to them to start asking those questions.  I am prepared to be very surprised on this.  I would like to hear that the Department is very prepared for Brexit and has a plan.  It might be helpful if it was shared with the people on the Brexit committee because they were clearly not aware of it because they could not share it with me.</p><p> With regard to the consultants, an issue was aired at the weekend whereby 128 non-specialist consultants are being paid as specialist consultants.  This is a question directly for the HSE.  Some of this has occurred because of contracts of indefinite duration.  We all know what they mean.  We also know that when a person starts working on day 1 there is four years and the clock is ticking.  The HSE's response to my parliamentary question pointed to this as very bad practice.  When people are being paid as if they are on the specialist register when they are not, it presents a difficulty for patients because clearly they want to know the person they are dealing with has the qualification they believe they have.  A CID is never a surprise.</p><p> Ms Mannion will be very familiar with this.  A CID is never a shock because it takes four years to accrue an entitlement to a CID.  From day 1, the clock is ticking and the knowledge should be there that every day a person comes to work he or she is accruing an entitlement to a CID.  On top of the 128, which we all agree is not good, how many more are on the threshold of a contract of indefinite duration?  They are legally entitled to it but no steps are being taken to ensure that situation does not arise.  I am not suggesting for a moment that the HSE should try to avoid or evade its responsibility to issue CIDs because it should not, but it is creating the situation it gave out about in the response to my parliamentary question.</p><p> Deputy Kelleher raised the issue of GP contracts.  The Minister says he wants it to be finished in 2017.  Is the Minister confident it will be finished in 2017?  Is he confident that all the i's will be dotted and t's crossed by the end of this year?  If not, are there any contingency arrangements in place for the continuation of those discussions?  </p><p> I apologise because I had intended to get the questions in and time ran away from me.  I apologise for not having these question in in advance.  If the answers are not readily available, I will wait for a follow-up.  I understand the boards of the hospital groups are to be put onto a statutory footing.  Every time I ask the question I am told it will happen.  The Minister is nodding his head.  I would like to know when it will happen.  I would also like to know what the delay is because I cannot fathom what the difficulty is.  </p><p> The bed capacity review is a little like Christmas in that it is always coming.  We are told it will be any day now.  Could we have a date for it?  A bed capacity review is not needed to tell us there is a shortage of capacity.  We will have that debate another day.</p><p> I have a question specifically for the HSE.  This is not specific to me or my party because I have talked to other people about it.  There are serious delays in responses to representatives and parliamentary questions.  Is there a staffing issue?  Is there something going on?  People who have been here a lot longer than me advise there is a particular problem and that the delays are not normally as bad as they appear to be at this time.  Will the Minister speak to how we might address that?  </p><p> I understand my five minutes was as long as the previous five minutes.  The Devereaux case was a very tragic case.  We all acknowledged it was heartbreaking and devoid of humanity.  We understand now that due to the intervention of RTE it would appear the issue has been resolved for that family.  The show in question only runs for an hour or an hour and a half so it will not have time to deal with all of the issues that will come up and neither should it have to.  Has any guidance been issued to staff to ensure it will not happen again and that common sense, humanity and compassion will prevail in circumstances where it is patently obvious they should apply?  Has guidance been issued?  If it has not, can the Minister advise me specifically on what is being done to ensure it will not happen again?  It was an awful case and it was heartbreaking.  They should not have had to go to RTE in the way they did.  What will be done to ensure it will not happen again?</p></speech>

I make special mention of my constituency colleague who has been elevated to Minister of State.</p> <p>  Can I have an explanation for the delay in assessing reimbursement applications for new medicines?  The issue at hand is a delay by the HSE in processing reimbursement applications for new medicines which is leading to patients not getting access to these vital medicines in a timely fashion.  It now takes an average 340 days post-authorisation for medicines to be made available to patients and sometimes it can take several years.  Other European countries have systems in place which enable new medicines to become available to patients within six months to a year.  The system in Ireland is pushing us behind our European counterparts.  This is against a backdrop of savings being made as a result of the framework agreement on the pricing and supply of medicines?  It will deliver savings of &euro;785 million until 2020.  Why is it that despite the savings, we are not spending on new and vital medicines? </p> <p>  The first time the Minister came before this new health committee there was a big emphasis on waiting lists.  I gave the example of Bantry hospital in my constituency where a rehabilitation and endoscopy unit would alleviate the pressure on the bigger hospitals in Cork city.  I remember at the time the Minister thought it was a good idea.  Are there any plans for Bantry hospital?  </p> <p>  Home help hours are an issue.  Many people coming into my constituency office are either looking for more hours or to get on the ladder to have hours.  We are finding it impossible to get any help.  There are some very worthy causes and cases.  Does the Minister have any plans to increase the budget for it?  I would like the Minister's comments on the availability of GPs to take up jobs in rural areas and the securing and retention of GPs.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.942" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017062800002#K00400"><p>Yes.  I will try to be as concise as the Chairman requested.  Deputy Kelleher asked about the situation regarding scoliosis.  I acknowledge the huge work of the advocacy groups not only in advocating but also in trying to engage with the HSE to come up with solutions.  One such example is the paediatric scoliosis services co-design group in which parents and advocates are involved with the HSE and the children's hospital group in looking at how to better ensure there is a patient-centred approach to service delivery.  It addresses a number of the issues raised about how people are interacted with from the moment they enter the health service system until the moment they have their surgery and come out the other side, regardless of where they live in the country and what doctor or hospital they are referred to.</p> <p>  I will ask the HSE to comment in a moment on the issue the Deputy raised on waiting times for MRIs.  I thank him for bringing it to our attention.</p><p>I am very pleased that significant progress is being made in the area of scoliosis.  We have set a very ambitious target to make sure no child waits longer than four months.  By the end of the year children awaiting surgery should not have to wait longer than four months.  That will bring us in line with countries like the UK and the NHS but it is a significant and dramatic improvement on the scenario that families were facing in this country.  We have seen good progress in the opening of the new theatre, additional theatre sessions, the recruitment and retention of more theatre nurses, the use of facilities abroad outside of this jurisdiction and the use of other facilities within the Irish health service.</p><p> The figures factor in a growth in the waiting list, in other words, new people coming onto the list as they are diagnosed.  If nobody new was diagnosed a total of 312 patients would require treatment by the end of the year to ensure no one breaches the four-month waiting target but we have also factored in anticipated growth of approximately 135, which means that about 450 patients will need to be treated by the end of the year if we are to ensure we reach that target.  I am pleased to say we are seeing weekly progress towards meeting the target.  I am getting a weekly report on this.  I thank everybody involved in that regard.</p><p> I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, to comment on the south-west child and adolescent mental health service in a moment.  As for the GP contract, first, I question the assertion by Deputy Kelleher that half of GPs or anybody else is waiting outside the door.  There is significant cross-over between the two organisations in terms of membership.  If the GPs to whom Deputy Kelleher has spoken are anything like the ones in my constituency or those around the country to whom I speak&ndash; perhaps the Chair can attest to this &ndash; one will meet many GPs who are members of both associations.  I know people present different numbers but there is significant cross-over between the two organisations.  This is a more inclusive engagement with GPs than we have ever had.  Before I became Minister there was no formal engagement with the NAGP.  It was not just half way out the door but completely out the door.  There is now formal consultation with the NAGP.  I have personally suggested to the NAGP that it should see this as an evolving process and an opportunity to be involved and be consulted.  We cannot get away from the fact that the IMO has a signed framework agreement with my predecessors and with the Department with regard to being the negotiating body but there is a real opportunity for the NAGP and the IMO to have their imprint on a new GP contract.  I share Deputy Kelleher's view on the need for buy-in from all stakeholders, including the NAGP in this regard.  I envisage this as an important step in the evolution of the relationship between the NAGP and the Department and the State and I encourage its members to work within that framework and to build on that.</p><p> In respect of the Herity report, like Deputy Kelleher I express my sincere condolences to the family of Thomas Power on what can only be an unbearable time for them all.  I have commented on the wider issues not the individual case, which will be examined in the normal procedures and they will establish the facts.  It would not be appropriate for any of us to talk about that but on the wider issue relating to the Herity report, as Minister for Health I stand over independent clinical evidence when I receive it.  I stand over it in the exact same way as Deputy Kelleher's party correctly stood over the report on cancer care when it was in government and, to be honest, when political parties in opposition then, including my own, were not helping Fianna F&aacute;il out.  I understand what it is like when one is in opposition and Deputy Kelleher understands what it is like when one is in government.  The Minister for Health, whosoever he or she may be, has a long-established precedent of following independent clinical advice that has served this country well.</p><p> However, we are doing four things in respect of Waterford.  Based on the Herity report, I will put in additional resources - this is covered and funded in the service plan - to increase the number of opening hours of the existing cath lab.  That will ensure more procedures are provided in Waterford.  Second, a mobile cath lab is on the way and will be there as part of an interim measure to reduce waiting times for planned cardiology procedures.  Third, after the benefit of those two measures have come into effect, I am happy to have another independent review of the situation in Waterford to ascertain whether, as a result of the mobile cath lab and the additional hours, more people are using the service in the south east.  Fourth, we will have a national review.</p><p> To be clear, the issue in the Herity report is the view that there should be a consolidated number of primary percutaneous coronary intervention, PPCI, centres around the country.  That is the foundation from which I am starting but the review will be completely independent of Herity above and beyond that.  If Deputy Kelleher and I accept, based on best medical evidence, that there can only be a limited number of those centres, the purpose of the national review is to decide where it is best to locate them to ensure the maximum possible number of people can access a centre within the required clinical time.  That is an aspiration we all share and we want to get there.</p><p> The issue does not just affect people in the south east.  There is no 24-7 PPCI centre in the midlands.  If one lives in parts of County Kerry one has to go to Cork University Hospital.  If one lives in counties Monaghan, Louth or Sligo, one also has to go elsewhere.  The national review is needed given that in any country, there is only an ability to provide a limited number of such facilities and we need to see where it is best to provide them to ensure the maximum number of citizens have access to them.  That is the rationale behind it.</p><p> Deputy O'Reilly has raised the issue of Brexit a number of times in oral and written parliamentary questions.  I have received detailed analysis from my Department, which I will share with the committee.  I will circulate it to members.  It answers a number of the questions the Deputy asked regarding how many people in this country have used the treatment abroad scheme in the UK and Northern Ireland; how many have used the cross-border directive; what is the cost of that each way; how many Irish pensioners benefit from medical cards and medical services in the UK and how many British pensioners benefit here.  The analysis provides a lot of the data Deputy O'Reilly was seeking.  I had a Brexit meeting in my Department yesterday with the HSE and Department officials on those issues.  The data are available.  However, in fairness to everybody involved, a lot of those issues come under the broader issue of the common travel area and as part of the broader negotiation this country and the EU must undertake with Britain on the common travel area and the free movement of people.  The same is true of the Department of Social Protection where a number of issues arise.  I already have had a meeting with the UK Secretary of State for Health, Jeremy Hunt and have written to him requesting another meeting on Brexit.  I have met the European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety three times on Brexit.  I have had bilateral meetings where Brexit has been an agenda item with many health Ministers &ndash; more than a dozen &ndash; from around the European Union.  I also have had engagement with the then Northern Ireland Minister for Health and I hope to be in a position to have engagement with the future Northern Ireland Minister for Health shortly, as we all do.  There is a lot of work going on.  As the Deputy is aware, we cannot negotiate bilaterally with the UK during the process of Brexit, as we have to negotiate as part of the EU bloc.  We have provided significant data and information to the Department of the Taoiseach on the health needs from Brexit.  In September, I hope to host a specific session on health as part of the all-island civic dialogue.  We very much welcome the involvement of members of this committee, along with stakeholders from North and South.  I will keep the committee informed in that regard.</p><p> Deputy O'Reilly inquired about consultants.  I will refer that to the HSE and it will come back with the information.  On the GP contract, I hope we will have enough work-----</p></speech>

What I asked was whether the Minister is confident that an agreement will be reached.  The Minister said that was his hope.  Does he have confidence that the talks will be finished by the end of the year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.945" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017062800002#L00300"><p>Yes, I have but I need to nuance it for one intended reason, namely, the last thing we need is another static document.  The last thing doctors want is for a contract to be agreed and for that to be the end of it the discussion for another four decades, which is what happened the last time with a few bits added on as we go along.  That will not serve the modern needs of the health service or of Sl&aacute;intecare either.  I expect by the end of this year to have a number of significant developments with regard to GP care as part of the negotiation but I also genuinely expect this will be an evolving process and there will be more to build on as we set about implementing a ten-year plan for the health service.</p> <p>  As for the hospital group boards, as I have said consistently since my appointment, I did not move ahead with putting them on a statutory basis because I thought it would have been extraordinarily contradictory to ask the Oireachtas on a cross-party basis to come up with a ten-year plan and, while it was at it, to legislate for a structure that may or may not be aligned with what was set out in the ten-year consensus.  We have been proven collectively right in that regard because while the ten-year plan has regional structures, they do not align with the hospital group boards.  As part of my consideration on how to implement Sl&aacute;intecare I will have to decide whether we try to pursue the statutory element of hospital group boards as an interim measure or whether we actually wait and go ahead with the proposed structures outlined in Sl&aacute;intecare.</p></speech>

I do not suggest it is a flashing blue light emergency but it is an issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.947" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017062800002#L00500"><p>The Deputy is right.  As she is aware, we have put chairs in place on an administrative basis and we have tried to fill boards but I accept that we want to get them set up on a statutory basis.  I am not sure that we should engage significant legislative and D&aacute;il time if we can move ahead with the alternative structure.  I just need a few weeks on that and I will report to Government and then to the Oireachtas on the issue.  As Deputy O'Reilly probably knows also, I have announced my intention to move ahead with the HSE board and the legislation required for that this year, which will address the broader issue of governance that we have discussed previously at the committee.</p><p> The bed capacity review will be completed by September, to be specific.  I disagree with the Deputy.  A bed capacity review is required, because one cannot simply pluck figures out of the air.  Beds in health care are much more complex than the beds in which we sleep at night in our homes.  There are different types of beds.  There are acute beds and a range of beds across the spectrum of care be it primary, social or acute.  The worst thing we could do is just count the number of acute hospital beds we need or think we need without looking at the benefit or otherwise of primary care, social care and community beds, where we need them, the cost of doing this and taking account of the demographic pressures.</p><p> Representations from Members of the Oireachtas is a matter for the HSE.</p><p> On the Devereaux family, we have all shared similar expressions on this in the House.  I had the pleasure of talking to Mrs. Kathleen Devereaux last night.  She is reunited with her husband today.  It is her 86th birthday and she is back where she should be, with her husband of 63 years.  I am delighted that has happened but frustrated that it ever had to get to that point.  I accept that these decisions must be made with regard to metrics in clinical decisions.  We all accept that these are clinical decisions.  However, having looked at the fair deal legislation, I believe there is enough flexibility within the current provisions to enable common sense and compassion to preside when these decisions are being made.  When the issue came to the attention of the HSE nationally, I am pleased that it acted swiftly and in a compassionate manner to reunite Mr. and Mrs. Devereaux.  I am frustrated that the compassion and common sense were not in place at an earlier stage at local level.  I have asked the Department to examine the specifics of this case and, more important, to scan through the CHO areas to find out if there are other potential instances.  I certainly hope there are not, but it is important to do that.  My colleague, Deputy Jim Daly, will be reviewing the fair deal and might wish to comment on the issue shortly.</p><p> Finally, to respond to Deputy Murphy O'Mahony, I will ask the HSE to give its perspective on drug reimbursement.  From my perspective, I read many reports in newspapers about how many drugs have been approved in the Department of Health and sometimes the information is not the same as the information I have.  There are three drugs currently with the Department and I expect we will process them quite quickly.  A number of others are expected within the next month or so and a number of other drugs are still being considered by the HSE.  It is worth acknowledging that the pipeline of drugs is increasing every year, which is a good thing for our patients.  Thank God, people are coming up with new ways of providing treatments and improving people's quality of life.  However, the pipeline is getting bigger and more costly every year.  We saw the great progress the country made with Orkambi, but we also saw the tortuous process involved.  I recently travelled to Malta and signed the Valletta Declaration, along with seven other countries in the European Union, which states that we will work together on trying to procure drugs.  We have talked a great deal about working together over the years but this was the first concrete step.  Indeed, the first meeting of that group at official level is taking place this month.  I will be happy to provide the Deputy with any other information I have.</p><p> On the waiting lists, I agreed previously and still agree that we must examine using capacity in smaller hospitals which do not have the pressures of emergency departments.  There are already some examples of that in some of our smaller hospitals.  I usually use the example of the RCSI hospital group, where a number of scopes that could have been carried out in Beaumont Hospital were carried out in Cavan General Hospital.  Cavan General Hospital has an emergency department but it had spare capacity.  The job is to identify spare capacity and the NTPF and the HSE are working on that.  Perhaps the HSE can respond directly to the Deputy about Bantry.</p><p> The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, can comment on home help hours but, as he said earlier, we must get to the point where we will have a statutory home care scheme.  We cannot continue to tell people that we believe they should have a right to grow old in their own homes with dignity in their communities, yet when they put their hands up and seek any assistance the only statutory scheme available is the fair deal scheme.  Fair deal is working very well now.  It is well funded and the four week turnaround time is being met by the HSE.  However, there is cross-party consensus that there must be an alternative route for a statutory home care scheme.  We must ensure that is done sensitively and by engaging with older people.  We will move on that consultation shortly.</p><p> The issue of GP retention is largely caught up with the contract.  If one offers people a modern, fit-for-purpose contract they are more likely to want to work here.  In terms of rural Ireland, if one offers them an opportunity to have a salaried contract rather than them having to set up a viable small and medium enterprise, SME, it might be more attractive.  These issues are under discussion in the context of the contract.</p></speech>

Obviously, I am also interested in them and in getting a handle on the situation in Cork.  I will share that information with the Deputy when it is to hand.  The issue is reflected across the country in various forms, but typically the same problems are arising.  Despite expenditure of &euro;850 million per annum and 1,100 additional staff in the last five years there are still huge challenges, particularly in the CAMHS area.  I accept that it is tiresome to hear repetitively about the recruitment of staff and that some people will believe it is an excuse, but the reality is that it is very difficult to get consultant psychiatrists.  It is not just a problem in this country but also in Europe, which is more worrying.  Funding is not holding up these appointments and recruitment.  It is a challenge for us and I am not sure how we will overcome it but we must continue to try.  We were talking with the HSE before this meeting about the efforts it is making to address the recruitment issue.</p> <p>  CAMHS teams are typically operating at 50% to 60% of the levels that are recommended, which is obviously not where we wish to be.  There are 67 CAMHS teams and three paediatric liaison teams.  We are expecting approximately 18,500 referrals to CAMHS in 2017.  Currently, 68% of children referred to CAMHS are seen within 12 weeks but I accept that one in three is not, which is not good enough.  The recruitment issue underpins the frustration in this regard.  One of the positives is that sanction has just been received for 100 new assistant psychologist posts for the early intervention primary care area.  When that recruitment gets under way it should take some of the pressure off.  We should be trying to divert people away from CAMHS and intervening at the lowest level possible.  Once that takes hold I am hopeful that it will be a positive development.  The service plan for 2017 identifies CAMHS as a priority for further development, including better out-of-hours liaison and seven day response.  This is a strategic priority action against a background where the population of children is expected to increase by approximately 8,500.  I intend to get my head around this issue.  I will ask the HSE to give a presentation and briefing on CAMHS in the audio-visual, AV, room for all Deputies, because it is an area of concern nationwide.  I do not have a monopoly of wisdom on the solution and I would like to share that load with Deputies across the House to see what other solutions people might propose to assist the HSE in dealing with it.</p> <p>  On the Devereaux case, I echo what the Minister said.  The issue I have and which I have raised with the HSE is who was told about this.  Why did these people have to talk to Joe?  Was it really necessary to do that?  I presume they met and interacted with somebody who is real and who heard that same story.  There was an outcry of compassion from all of us when we heard the story, so one wonders about who they told the story to previously and who did not or was unable to react.  We must find out which it was, whether they did not react or were unable to because of legislation, procedure, rules and regulation.  We will get to the bottom of that case.  As the Minister said, the case has been sorted but we have to ensure that such a case does not happen again and that the flexibility to facilitate compassion exists and is built into any systems we as legislators put in place to govern how clinical decisions are made in admissions.</p></speech>

I was just offering a general comment on the matter.</p> <p>  Deputy Murphy O'Mahony raised the home help hours.  Again, we all have an issue with that.  It has taken a great deal of my time in the last week trying to get my head around it.  We hope to start the public consultation on it within the next week to get the views of stakeholders, people who have been providing the service and so forth.  To be fair, the fair deal scheme is a good scheme and is working well.  Obviously, issues arise in it but, by and large, it is a positive experience and we wish to replicate that-----</p></speech>

Our priority is to get help into the communities and to let people live longer in the community and support them there.  However, it must be put under statute.  It is grossly unfair at present given how people can get access to hours in some parts of the country and cannot in others and how the level of service and oversight varies from area to area.  We want to put it in a statute that applies across the board, but we must get that right.</p><p>The consultation will begin within a week.  I can give that commitment.  We will all be working together to try to bring that through.</p></speech>

I will deal personally with the issue of scoliosis and outpatients departments and the parliamentary question issue.  I give notice to Mr. Healy that I will be asking him to come in on the operation of the nursing home support scheme and to Ms O'Connor that I will be asking her to speak on the decrease in teenage suicide.  Ms Mannion and Mr. Woods will be asked to comment on the issue of contracts of indefinite duration, CIDs, and consultants.</p> <p>  With regard to scoliosis, the final sentence I used was that the HSE is working to develop a long-term sustainable solution for scoliosis in paediatric orthopaedic patients.  I also include issues of diagnosis in that regard.  Through the children's hospital group, we are carrying out a thorough assessment of access to diagnosis and the likely conversion rate to treatment from outpatient referrals in order to ensure that we achieve what we have committed to, which is to bring the waiting time for treatment down to no more than four months for all those who are listed for treatment by the end of this year, including those who will be added to that list as the year progresses.</p> <p>  We also aim to ensure in the two subsequent years that we have sufficient capacity to deal with all those who will need treatment in a much more timely manner, inclusive of the time from outpatient referral to diagnosis including where MRI or any other diagnostic procedure may be required.  For a period of time, we will need a treatment capacity more than double that which we have had historically.  It is our general approach to waiting to always deal with those waiting longest first.  That is why we are using the approach we are now using in respect of those who are on the existing treatment waiting list.  We are using insourcing, outsourcing and international treatment to ensure that waiting list is effectively eliminated - four months would not be considered a waiting list - and will then bring forward the balance of the issue.</p> <p>  In respect of representations and parliamentary questions, a total of 3,570 parliamentary questions were asked in the period between 1 January 2017 and 24 May 2017, of which 2,566, some 72%, received an on-time reply, that is to say, within ten working days.  That means that 28% are non-compliant.  It is difficult to give comparators with prior years because following the last general election, approximately this time last year, new Standing Orders were adopted which reduced the target reply date from 15 days to ten days.  This is monitored very closely.  Mr Ray Mitchell, who is normally with us, is the official who normally deals with that monitoring.  He is on a well-earned break this week.  I am quite happy to share our monitoring reports with this committee or with anyone else.  We check and very actively chase those who have not yet replied to questions.  Something that sometimes causes issues, and the Deputy will understand what I mean by this reference, is that we can sometimes get 50 questions which are effectively on the one issue and it is required that they be dealt with separately.  Our parliamentary unit is very happy to work with any Member who is experiencing difficulty in getting replies to questions.  We will share that report and we are working to ensure that the importance of replying within ten days is understood throughout our system.</p></speech>

Arising from that meeting, I was tasked with looking at the issue of contracts of indefinite duration, those not on the specialist register, and consultants in unapproved posts.  To get an holistic view, those three facets need to be examined conjointly so that we are in a position to respond.  I hope the Deputy will be familiar with the report which we published earlier in the year - "Towards Successful Consultant Recruitment, Appointment and Retention".  On page 7, the Deputy will see that we have itemised this as a key issue in terms of flaws of governance and administration.  This point was specifically picked up.  Arising from that, we have been implementing the doctors integrated management esystem, which is giving us full data in respect of the items I have outlined.  At this point in time, we have 52 potential contracts of indefinite duration.</p> <p>  Regarding those not on the specialist register, we have the details of where they are currently.  What we are doing to address this is again set out in recommendation 1.1 of this report, which I believe has been shared with the committee previously.  We are carrying out a specific examination on a site-by-site basis with each of the hospital groups.  We have started that and we will be working through it.  That will potentially take 12 months to really close off on this issue.  There are three hospitals which we need to bring on board with this - Temple Street Children's University Hospital, Beaumont and Holles Street.  We are very much on top of this issue.  It is not ideal.  It is not a situation in which we would like to be.  </p> <p>  If one looks specifically at the breakdown of those currently employed who are not on the specialist register, one will see that 14 of them are in psychiatry.  Earlier on in the meeting we had discussions around staffing, recruitment issues, waiting lists and so on in that particular area.  Before 2008, there was not requirement to be on the specialist register so a lot of these are legacy issues.  That is not an excuse, it is just the reality.  We are working through it.  Of those 14 who are in psychiatry, every one of them will have been assessed for risk and they will be working under supervision.  There are clear service decisions which need to be taken regarding this issue but I wish to assure the committee that we are working through this, quite complex,  issue.  I invite the Deputy to come in to us if she has the time and we will go through that particular system.  There are some excellent data available which we have not had previously and which will really assist us in the management of our medical workforce in the future.  </p> <p>  I am conscious of the time but we are specifically looking at a much better approach in respect of job planning, workforce planning and sharper recruitment practices in respect of the medical workforce.  Again, time will not allow for that today but we are happy to take the Deputy through a specific briefing on that if it is helpful. </p></speech>

Section 7(6) of the Act sets out specifically what a care needs assessment is.  It sets out the professionals who would undertake it, which include doctors - in our case it is geriatricians - nursing staff and occupational and physical therapists.  When an application is made the first thing that is done is that a care needs assessment is undertaken to determine, based on the criteria, if a person qualifies or not.  There are then a comprehensive set of guidelines established in the system as to how those care needs assessments will be undertaken.  For some years, since the establishment of the scheme, we have established more than 30 local placement fora at the level of the local health office, as they were known.  They have geriatricians on a multidisciplinary team.  Social work is often also involved, along with the therapists, nursing staff and geriatricians.  They work to a standardised, agreed model.</p><p>One reason I asked for a review to be done on this was that, as the Minister has said, there can be a question of standardised interpretation.  Part of what we have to do, perhaps, is to make sure that our professionals, who are working on this in a very proactive way, are supported.  This is to ensure that when rare cases do come up, as happened recently, they know the full extent of the flexibility they have under the scheme.  I await the outcome of the review and the advice I get on this matter.  What I intend to do is to establish a national forum to bring together the 30-plus placement fora in order that there is shared learning across the system on what is happening in different places and how things are progressing and in order that cases can be shared and so forth.  That would provide a positive system to support the professionals involved in dealing with issues like this.</p></speech>

Mr. Healy and I know each other a long time.  I asked a very specific question.  Has the HSE issued guidelines to ensure that this will not happen again?  If the answer is "No", that is fine.

As the Minister mentioned, there is a particular issue around staffing in some CAMHS.  The services in Cork and in the CHO 4 area, which covers Cork and Kerry, are working at 50% of the provision envisaged in A Vision for Change.  They have some vacancies but the total staffing allocation is an issue for them.</p> <p>  When it comes to CAMHS performance in general, we look at three components.  One is the so-called pre-CAMHS, or what exists in an area that could help avoid the need for CAMHS.  This is because we see that people end up in CAMHS in the absence of other local solutions.  The Minster also mentioned assistant psychologists in that regard.  In that area alone, 16 new assistant psychologist and seven qualified psychologist posts have been allocated because there had been a deficit there.  We hope that this will make a difference to the numbers going to CAMHS because there is currently quite a high referral rate from that area.</p> <p>  We are also looking at how we can help the services with their medical staffing.  There are a number of vacancies.  Unfortunately the structure of CAMHS is such that there is a single consultant for a team in an area.  There is one team for every 50,000 people and if the consultant is not there, that has an impact on an entire population.  We are working with the area on that.</p> <p>  Deputy Kelleher mentioned the issues that were arising and the most recent report showed the area had more than 80 people waiting for more than 12 months.  This has already been reduced due to work undertaken to ensure that children who need to be seen are really prioritised and that cancellations are allocated etc.  I can reassure the committee that existing issues are being actively addressed.  They have, however, very real challenges around staffing.  They also have a particular challenge in their inpatient unit where eight beds have been closed.  Our hope is that a new doctor early in the July rotation will resolve that for us.  We have had additional consultant time but we have not had non-consultant doctor time.  We are addressing that in the July changeover.</p> <p>  A number of things are happening in Cork that will hopefully improve matters.  There are certainly challenges there, however, and we are working very closely with the division to give them additional resources and support.  More importantly, we are working with them to look at other avenues for young people with mental health problems.  It is important that we acknowledge that mental health for young people does not begin and end with the CAMH service and that other supports are there before children ever need to go the CAMHS.  We are developing this as well through this new allocation.  That is the update on CAMHS.</p></speech>

Overall, the data suggest that suicide across all ages has reduced in total by approximately 11.5%.  Within that we can see a reduction for males of nearly all ages.  The 55 to 64 age group is the one area where it increased in 2016.  In women, there has actually been an increase in the rates overall.  What we have then in 2016 is a 15.2% reduction in the rate for men and a 6.5% increase in the rate for women overall.  The increase in females is in the older age range from 35-plus rather than in youth.  The youth rate has reduced across both genders.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked if there was something there that we can learn from.  There are a number of factors here.  One is the environment.  The economic environment, for example, has led to a reduction in suicide.  The provisional data suggest that in 2016 we dipped below 400 for the first time.  This is provisional, of course, so there has to be a health warning on it, but it has been published.  A number of other things have happened in recent years to lead up to this.  The Connecting for Life strategy, for example, has allowed for a lot of cross-sectoral work, particularly in looking at local area plans.  This really allows for a cross-sectoral ownership of mental health, looking at voluntary agencies and all of the different State bodies working in an area to change the message around mental health.  We are seeing a lot of that.  We are seeing much more positive conversation around mental health, with our current Little Things campaign, for example.  We are seeing much more help being sought and more young people feeling more comfortable talking about mental health.  </p> <p>  As part of the strategy we are also prioritising certain groups.  These include youth, people who are homeless and people who are LGBTI.  We are working very proactively with a number of groups.  It is a combination of all of these factors that has led to these results, along with very significant training.  Through the National Office for Suicide Prevention we have invested in a lot of training in many organisations and State bodies.  We are also working very closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and all Garda trainees now get safeTALK and applied suicide information skills training, ASIST.  Most youth workers and youth agencies have also now been trained.  We offer mental health and first-aid training.  The approach is multifaceted.  It may be the case that greater awareness is having an impact but it is too early to say yet.</p></speech>

There is now a problem, however, in filling GP lists in urban centres.  When a GP retires or when a GP has an assistant who then emigrates or moves on, there is great difficulty in recruiting replacements.  GPs can obviously get ill or die when still in practice and this can be an unpredictable event.  How does the HSE intervene in trying to anticipate the replacement of GPs coming up to retirement?  We know that 33% of GPs are over the age of 55.  Many retire and the HSE is unaware that this is about to happen.  GPs can now practise until they are 72.  How does the HSE engage in trying to anticipate the retirement of GPs and filling those posts before the retirement is announced?</p></speech>

In deference to the committee I did not bring as large a crew as I might have done because not every member appreciates that.  I do not have all of that information to hand but we will certainly respond fully to that point.  The issue the Chairman raises is a very real one.  The age profile of our general practice in the community is a cause for concern, particularly if we are to be in the position to give effect to the significant and laudable aspirations of the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  This is a fundamental issue.</p></speech>

There are currently 23 GMS vacancies in the country as of 1 June.  As there are 2,493 GPs contracted to provide services under the GMS scheme, that is a relatively low percentage of vacancy.  Less than 1% of the total number of GPs contracted to the GMS are vacant.  The number of GMS patients associated with these vacancies is 14,495.  A total of nine of these vacancies have been open for less than six months, six vacancies have been open for between six months and twelve months, and eight vacancies have been open for more than 12 months.  A total of 18 of these vacancies, or 78%, are in urban areas and five of them, or 22%, are in rural areas.  The rural practice support framework payment is associated with four of these.  Where GP vacancies arise in the GMS then, the HSE must and does take all necessary steps to ensure continuity of service.</p><p>I am informed that all current vacancies are covered by a locum service and, therefore, a general practice service continues to be provided in all the affected areas.  While I am not in any way downplaying the importance of this issue, it is useful to provide some statistics to give a sense of the context.  There are 2,493 general practitioners contracted to the General Medical Services scheme and there are 23 vacancies. </p><p> While the Government is consistently and constantly trying to increase the number of GP training places in line with the commitment in the programme for Government, it is disappointing that not all the additional places were filled.  This must be viewed in the context of the increase in GP training numbers in recent years.  For example, the number of training places rose from 120 in 2009 to 186 in 2017, an increase of 55% in seven years.  The number of places filled has increased by 43% in the same period.  While it is right and proper that we do this for all the reasons outlined by the Chairman, including the average age of general practitioners, it is important to provide some facts.</p></speech>

Many villages and towns no longer have a general practitioner, yet the vacant positions are no longer counted or identified.  I am sure there are four or five practices in each county which, having failed to attract a GP, are no longer on the list.</p></speech>

I am also pleased to see the old ministerial faces from the Department.  I submitted four questions to the Department, the first of which relates to the welcome commitment given by the Taoiseach in his first address to the D&aacute;il following his appointment to ratify the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities by the end of this year.  The Taoiseach's commitment allows the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, off the hook in the sense that the commitment he gave previously has been restated by someone else in government, which is good news.  As the clock ticks towards 31 December, what work must the Department do to facilitate the implementation of this commitment?  The Minister referred to the declaration of liberty, the decision support service and a small amount of work to be done on the Mental Health Act.  He was shy, however, about setting specific dates by which the various measures required to facilitate ratification will be implemented.</p> <p>  I am unhappy about the failure to even attempt to answer my question in which I sought an estimate of the extent of unmet needs and supports for people with disabilities and mental health needs.  In requesting an estimate, rather than precise figures, I deliberately asked a pass rather than an honours question, as it were, because I know it is not always easy to provide exact figures.  Of the 11 paragraphs in the quarterly update, ten take us on a tour of strategy plans, current funding levels, pilot projects, policy orientation and commitments to standards and safety.  While this information is useful, it does not address the question.  The closest we get to an answer is in the final paragraph, which notes that the Health Service Executive is engaged in a review of current service requirements and crucial unmet needs in planning and prioritising service requirements for 2018.  This, the statement adds, is informed by best practice and so forth.  However, we are not given even a hint of an estimate of the number of people who may need personal assistance or the quantum of services required to enable people to continue to live in their homes, not to speak of in the community.  How can the Department usefully engage in a review of current service requirements and unmet needs if it unable to provide these data or does it have the information but has decided not to release it?  It is a serious matter when the Department does not even provide a guesstimate as to the level of unmet need in a range of core areas.</p> <p>  While I do not wish to stray into the issue of the Devereaux family, in that context we spoke earlier about the statutory underpinning of the fair deal scheme.  I know people with disabilities aged under 65 years who are in nursing homes.  Who can say there is not a connection between the lack of provision or planning for provision in the community and that fact?  The Minister referred previously to the need for a statutory underpinning of the community side.  This must be done across the board, rather than exclusively for older people, if we are to bring some balance to the equation. </p> <p>  My third question related to section 38 and 39 bodies.  My sense is that the answer is very much about industrial relations and personnel development issues.  I asked what was the impact for organisations related to the sustainability of person-centred services from which there will be greater staff migration to better paying roles.  I was not asking about industrial relations or human resources issues.  I am told that people working in section 39 organisations are not public servants.  Are those working in section 38 organisations public servants?  The point at issue is that we want to have quality public services.  If an organisation on one side of the road is funded under one section of the Act and another organisation on the other side of the road providing the same services is funded under a different section, one could swap over.  The issue is that staff will cut their teeth in one and then migrate to the other.  While I wish them luck if they can do that, it leaves one organisation to face the problem of staff churn and related issues.</p> <p>  On 30 May last, when I raised this matter in the Seanad with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, he stated he would "anchor this matter in current negotiations through the concept of affordability."  He continued: "I am aware that the decision that we make about public service pay will have consequences for other organisations that are not of the public service but provide public services".  Has the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform engaged with or knocked on the door of the Department of Health in the meantime given that an agreement has been concluded which could advance this issue?</p> <p>  My final question related to the determinants of health, although the word "determinants" was not used.  I raised this issue as a result of a meeting at which representatives of a number of groups addressed the joint committee on the impact of services or lack thereof on other areas of health.  The response brought me on another tour, this time of the national disability implementation strategy.  This strategy, which is about to be published, should have been live a year and a half ago because it was intended to follow the strategy that concluded in 2015.  This means there has been no strategy in place for the past 18 months.</p> <p>  The comprehensive employment strategy, which should have been introduced in 2013, did not commence until the end of 2015.  To cut to the chase, may I assume that the Department has no issues regarding services in other Departments that would help people to migrate - I use that word advisedly - from the health area to education, employment and other supports in the community?</p><p> Are there no poverty issues?  The SILC statistics show increased levels of poverty for people with disabilities.  Are there no social housing issues?  The information we have received has told us that difficulties in this regard have increased by 16% or 17% over the past three years.  Employment is a chronic issue.  If we are trying to move people on after school or people who become disabled as adults, how do we get them into work if nobody on that side is taking things up?  Accessibility and transport are other issues.  I thank the witnesses for their work but I do not find a lot of value in the text I have received.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.996" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1297" speakername="Kate O'Connell" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017062800002#Q00200"><p>I welcome the witnesses and congratulate the Minister, Deputy Harris.  I am happy he is still Minister for Health.  I note from his statement he has learned the value of using the available expertise to inform solutions, which is good to see.  I also welcome the Ministers of State, Deputies Byrne and Finian McGrath, and congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, on his appointment.</p> <p>  The Minister's opening statement referred to the increase in the number of consultants to support service delivery and the progression of compliance with the European working time directive.  Has the increase in consultant numbers been eaten up?  Is there a net gain in working hours or is it simply the case that we cannot have consultants working 70 hours a week?  From memory, I understand the European working time directive limits the working week to 48.5 hours.  Are we just complying with employment law or has there been an impact on hours worked and the services delivered to patients?  I seek some information on that.</p> <p>  Is there any good news in respect of the recruitment of nurses?  We repeatedly refer to consultants but we all know that health care necessitates a team approach and nurses are vital in the delivery of services in Ireland.</p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Harris, and Mr. O'Brien referred to primary care.  I understand Mr. O'Brien referred to a 34% increase in primary care referrals.  Is there an impact on the demand on acute services, taking demographics into account?  Is increased activity in the primary care setting reducing pressure on acute hospital settings?  Are we transferring work or providing better care to certain people?  Are we layering on more types of care and still allowing a cohort of people to languish?  What is the impact of the movement of care on people's lives?</p> <p>  Mr. O'Brien provided great information on scoliosis treatment and the four-month target.  Are there data to show any other child patient cohort has suffered as a result of this improvement?  Has the diversion of the resources into scoliosis treatment left children with, for example, cancer, worse off?  Have others suffered?</p> <p>  I refer to the reduced rate of teen suicide.  My initial instinct was this was a result of the environment and economy rather than interventions.  Perhaps services in the community have had an impact, rather than the economy.  I would not like to think we are attributing success rates to something the HSE may have had nothing to do with.</p> <p>  Does the Minister have an update on the National Maternity Hospital?  Is an update available on the operation of crisis pregnancy agencies and the type of information most people think is not suitable for vulnerable women in such places?  I ask the Minister to comment on the female who was sectioned, who, I believe, is under 18 years of age and was forced to become a mother without wanting to become a parent.  Can the Minister update us on anything regarding that case?</p> <p>  The Minister will receive a report from the Chair of this committee on the national maternity strategy implementation, which we discussed before the Minister came to the meeting.  I do not want to ruin the surprise, but the first line of that report refers to 20-week scans.  We listened to Professor Kenny from Cork who spoke about what I can only describe as the rationing of 20-week scans.  The scans are being performed on women who are more likely to have a child with a defect.  From memory, I understand one a week is provided to the non-high-risk group.  A women who is 25 years of age and gives birth in Sligo, for example, rather than one of the Dublin teaching hospitals, may not have a scan. </p> <p>  Children are being born with undiagnosed birth defects.  If those defects were diagnosed at a 20-week scan they could have received better treatment.  They may have better outcomes if dealt with in a teaching hospital.  It is very concerning that children who, along with the families and extended families, would have had better outcomes are being delivered in hospitals without staff having the correct information.  Is there any update on the provision of 20-week scans?  We seem to be an outlier compared to the rest of Europe.</p> <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, is new to the area of health promotion.  She probably heard I am obsessed with the HPV vaccine.  There was a catch-up programme.  Is there any information on the figures in terms of herd immunity?</p> <p>  In the context of the Sl&aacute;intecare report, perhaps Mr. Breslin or someone from the Department could provide members with information on the alignment of hospital groups, community health organisations, regional health organisations and other matters we have discussed over the past year in terms of whether we can quantify results.  We need defined populations and we need to know with what we are dealing.  I am sure the witnesses are sick of listening to me going on about that but we have to keep going.</p> <p>  I do not want to overdo it on the couple who were separated in a nursing home but the case involved common sense and compassion.  If the system involves an algorithm, and somebody inputted data into a computer and it said "No", we could blame the computer and algorithm.  Human beings with hearts and pulses are making decisions.  It was not a very difficult decision.  It could not have been difficult to accommodate the couple.  Who makes the decisions and how can they not tick the right boxes?  It would make one wonder.  Perhaps we would be better off with a computer that said "No" as then the file could be examined.  Clearly, the human beings involved in the system are not able to do their job right if a vulnerable couple had to fight for the flexibility to allow compassion to be applied to their case.  </p></speech>

I am delighted that a Minister of State from Cork is dealing with the Department of Health.  I look forward to working with everyone.</p> <p>  I refer to future planning of hospital services for Cork.  I note the last line of the report I received.  As I have said, the population of Cork city and county has increased by 130,000, from 410,000 to 542,000.</p><p>Senator Buttimer and I had a meeting with the Mercy Hospital group a few months ago.  Last year, they had to cancel 40% of their elective surgery because of admissions through the accident and emergency department.  Their major problem was that there was an increase in 12% in the over 80 age category of patients being admitted through that department.  It is more difficult to discharge them and, therefore, they had to be admitted.  It is in that context that I asked about new hospitals for Cork.  The final line in the reply I received is that there is no definitive decision that Cork will be included in the next national plan.  However, this is a priority area.  Major funding has been allocated for hospital development in Dublin.  Three or four new developments are going ahead in the city but there is a need for a centre of excellence in Munster and not just for Cork.  The Minister needs to focus on that rather than diverting services to Dublin.  Will he respond to that?  The other aspect of this I am concerned about is UCC seems to be doing the driving on this matter.  This is not a criticism of UCC but any new hospital must be patient-focused and located where it is needed and not necessarily where a third level institution needs it.  We need to get hold of this project and not allow others to make the running.  I ask both the HSE and the Minister to respond about where this is going and where we will be in six months on this issue because I will not want to repeat the same comments then.  I may not be an Oireachtas Member in six years but I do not want someone else coming in here in then to ask the same question.  I would like clarification on where this project is at in respect of current planning, identifying a site and forward planning.</p><p> The second issue I would like to raise relates to respite care.  I have a serious concern about this in the Cork area, particularly in respect of provision for people with disabilities.  I have met a number of parents who cannot access respite care.  In fairness, I received a detailed reply dealing with the HIQA issue and the maintenance of standards, with which I fully agree.  However, this is also about forward planning.  I asked whether the HSE has age profiles of those with disabilities who require respite care and of their current carers.  For instance, I was contacted by a man who will be 80 next month.  He drives his daughter to day care in the COPE facility, which provides an excellent service, in Cork every day.  He drops her off in the morning and collects her in the evening.  The journey is between 15 and 20 miles each way.  He will not be able to do that forever and, therefore, I am wondering about the long-term planning in respect of services for people such as his daughter.  Will the Minister outline what is being done to identify the numbers involved and to facilitate these carers who have been providing the necessary care at home for years?</p><p> I hope people do not take up me wrong on the third issue I would like to raise, which is the increase in the number of administration and management staff.  I am a little confused by this.  This relates to governance.  When was the decision taken to increase staff numbers and how was it taken?  The number of staff at senior level has increased from 201 to 289 in two and a half years, which is a 43.5% increase.  Has a clear plan been set out for recruitment at administration and senior management levels?  At what stage is there a cut-off point?  This has been a phenomenal increase in numbers in comparison to other areas.  I previously instanced that the number of public health nurses in the same period increased from 1,460 to 1,499, an increase of 39, yet on the most recent figures, the number of administration and management staff increased by more than 1,900.  Where is the cut-off point?  I would like to identify each of the 71 positions that were created.  Some detail has been provided on that but I am still not satisfied as to why that increase occurred.  Will somebody outline the cut-off point?  Will the increase in senior management numbers continue?  What is the final target number?  There are 289 management staff now.  Will that number reach 350 this time next year?  What is the plan?  That has not been in the public domain.</p><p> Finally, I refer to the issue of hospital doctors.  I understand that 40% of doctors are non-Irish graduates.  We brought in the McRae report which set out clear plans for retaining graduates.  Has a review been conducted of whether this report has achieved anything and whether additional changes are needed to retain graduates or to attract them back to the State?  Ireland is first among OECD countries for bringing in doctors from outside the jurisdiction and, indeed, from developing countries.  It is a serious issue that the Government and the HSE have not got a handle on yet.</p></speech>

I will not repeat questions.  I congratulate Deputy Jim Daly on his appointment.  He is a good parliamentarian and I am delighted he secured this role.  I also congratulate the other Ministers who were reappointed.  Perhaps some were nervous but fair play to them.  I am delighted for all of them.  As a group of Ministers, they are approachable regarding issues, whether they are national or local, and I appreciate that.  I cannot say that about every other Department but considering it is such a difficult Department, they are all approachable and I thank them for that.</p> <p>  I will focus on a number of issues, some of which I have raised previously.  They are mostly national issues but one or two are local.  The eHealth issue is critical and somebody will have to bite the bullet.  We have had many disasters as a country as regards IT projects costing a fortune.  It has led to reticence among Departments spending large capital amounts on such projects.  I had to come in and sort out the Leap card implementation.  Now there is an issue with electronic health records.  I am a big supporter of the public services card and making that a G2C or a C2G card.  Public services cards, travel cards and health records should, with layers of security, eventually become one.  Security can allow for access at whatever level and fraud would be reduced immediately but that is for another day.  I would like a commitment from the Minister that he will be brave enough to kick the ball off significantly in this space in the capital plan that will be announced following the summer because this is a fundamental health issue.  It features in our future of health care report.  I know of somebody quite close to me who has spent two and a half weeks in hospital.  After two and a half weeks, she has found out the hospital had two charts on her, which they have now brought together.  That is insane.  Basically, we are unsure about some of the readings and they have to start all over again.</p><p>That is just one example.</p><p> Fundamentally, if this is all carried out through a proper, electronically recorded system, then that information should be at everyone's fingertips.  Some people I know of across some hospitals have systems and pilot projects in place and, by all accounts, they work well.  This is not rocket science.  The scale of it is huge and the Department will have to spend humongous amounts of money, but someone must kick the ball to ensure this happens.  I ask the Minister to do so.  I will support it 1,000%.  I have been on about it for years.  When I was in government, we did not have the money, but someone must kick it off.  The problem for the Minister is that it will not be physical building, no one will see the results of it and there is no political capital in it.  However, it is the right thing to do and I encourage him to do it.</p><p> To move on to political capital, I have had a number of discussions about buildings.  I represent Tipperary, and we have two of the worst accident and emergency department situations, namely, at South Tipperary General Hospital and University Hospital Limerick.  The new chairman of the latter and I come from the same area.  We were together at the opening of the emergency department, which is a fantastic facility.  I am open to correction but I think there has been an increase of over 30% in the number of patients going through it, so it is a victim of its own success in that sense.  However, the real issue here is speed and capital development.  I will take South Tipperary General Hospital by way of example.  We had this glorified announcement about the provision of a super-hotel, temporary hotel or whatever the hell it was called at the hospital.  I will not get into the politics of this, so the Minister should not worry, but it was a pre-announcement and an overstatement and it should not have happened.  I am trying to help the Minister here.  It will not be in place for this winter, never mind last winter, when it was said it would be in place.  In the long term, unless the Minister says otherwise, I presume South Tipperary General Hospital will be included in the capital plan because it is as clear as the nose on one's face that it is desperate.  I remember my time as a Minister with responsibility for housing.  Is there a way in which the Oireachtas, myself, as an Opposition spokesperson, and others here can put forward some form of process to fast-track the development of critical capital infrastructure in, say, six to eight hospitals throughout the country?  We could all unite politically behind that because it is desperately needed.  I had to do this for housing.  Can we do it for hospital infrastructure?  The Department will have capital, to be fair, but the time it will take will be huge.  We cannot bypass the law but measures can be taken from a planning point of view.  If the Minister wants to come back to me separately on this, I will work with him on it.</p><p> I wish to jump in on the discussion about cardiac issues.  I am trying not to overlap with previous speakers' comments to be fair to the Minister.  There is the issue of what happened in Waterford.  Like everyone else, I am very sorry for the family involved.  My wife's family come from south Kerry.  I ask the committee to imagine trying to get to Tralee or Cork from Ballinskelligs or Waterville or to hospitals in the region from west Clare or north Sligo, and all the issues relating to these places.  The cardiac issues in the north west are very similar to those in the south east.  This probably exists already, to be fair to the witnesses, but has a map been produced which shows the critical times it takes to get to every hospital?  If it exists, may we have it?  I have not seen such a map.  If we had sight of it, then we could examine solutions - politically and collectively - here with the witnesses.  Unfortunately, this will happen again and again, and we need to take a bit of the politics out of it.  We need to plan for this.</p><p> The next issue I wish to raise is home help.  This is a bugbear of mine.  I am trying to help the Minister again.  When I began in this spokesman role over a year ago, home help hours were a critical issue.  They still are, but the biggest issue now is not the hours but the people.  It is the bane of my life.  I have two neighbours in their 80s who have 21 home help hours.  However, they have never had 21 hours; they have had ten, and very recently, until a very good intervention by a member of the HSE, they were going to be down to two hours.  Through working perhaps with the Minister for Finance or someone else, is there a mechanism whereby we can encourage more people out there to be trained up one level and work in this area where it is financially more viable?  A lady I know provides home help hours but it is financially only viable for her, given child care and everything else, to provide a certain number of hours.  It is not worth her while doing 20 or so hours so she does ten.  Can we change this equation?  We need these people.  It saves the taxpayer a huge amount of money.  We all know that the more home help hours, the more we save because nursing homes are so expensive - &euro;1,200 or &euro;1,400 a week - and a bed in an acute hospital costs over &euro;1,000 a day.  It is like a step, and if we can keep people from getting into the second or third step by increasing home help hours and getting more people into it, we will obviously gain.</p><p> By the way, I agree with Deputy Kelleher about the issues in general practice.  I think we passed a motion here on this.  It is illogical that one GP organisation is outside the window in these discussions.  It is quite obvious that we will have to look at direct GP contracts as part of the solution to this in certain areas where the viability of being a GP is very questionable.  I also agree with the Minister about the statutory home care scheme and I will work with him on it.  I have always agreed with him about this.  Will Mr. O'Brien send out a diktat across the HSE to remind people of common sense because of what happened to the elderly couple this week?  Not everyone can get on "Liveline", to be fair.</p><p> The model 1, model 2, model 3 hospital relationship must change, particularly when it comes to emergency care.  I represent Tipperary.  We have a fine hospital in Nenagh that does what it says on the tin.  We have Ennis Hospital and there is also St. John's.  They have minor injuries units.  They do not open for long enough and the pathways to the kinds of procedures they should be doing need to be widened out a little.  It would not take much to do so, which will alleviate somewhat the crush and the scale of the situation in Limerick, so I ask the Minister to consider extending the hours, evaluating the safety issues involved and examining various actions that might be taken.</p><p> The real issue I wish to discuss in this regard relates to intermediate care vehicles.  I have asked about this before.  It is farcical that, first, there are not enough of them on the road, second, that there are not enough trained people to operate them and, third, that the vehicles only operate Monday to Friday most of the time.  The bugbear we all have is that hospitals should not stop operating for two days each week.  If one does not get one's scan reviewed by a Friday, one must wait until Monday.  That is insane, but it is a matter for another day.  I am really asking about intermediate care vehicles.  Such vehicles are, I believe, are part of the solution.  They can be used to move people from model 1 hospitals to model 2 hospitals, etc., in order that they do not take up the critical acute beds in Limerick and they can be seen in Nenagh for their aftercare or pre-care or whatever it is.  There are not enough of these vehicles on the road.  It is simple as that.  They are not operating.  I know about this because the Mid West hospital group is probably the one that has been in this role the longest.</p><p> I have always been of the view that we need to introduce some form of public scrutiny or scorecards when it comes to the numbers of GP referrals - individuals names would not be included- when it comes to emergency theatres in particular.  It is quite obvious that in some cases and some areas, certain GPs are referring much more than others.  Why is this?  It does not make sense.  Obviously, some GPs will have bigger lists and we can extrapolate out all of this, but something should be done in this regard.  Another issue falls within the same area of publishing for public scrutiny the percentage of work of consultants in private versus public hospitals.  I am not saying I have all the answers, but there is not enough public information on either of these two matters and not enough public scrutiny as a result.  Both matters cause issues if they are lopsided, where a GP is making too many referrals and the proportion of private versus public work, particularly in public hospitals, carried out by a consultant is on such a scale as to cause difficulties down the road.  Those are my questions and they are all different from everyone else's.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Brien's opening statement referred to a 6% increase in accident and emergency attendances, a significant number of which are patients over the age of 75.  Patients aged over 75 will stay longer in hospital and have more complex needs.  We certainly need a response to our ageing population and changing demographics.  As stated in the Sl&aacute;inte report, perhaps some of those patients do not need to be in hospital and can be looked after in the community, either in model 2 hospitals, and not ending up in accident and emergency, or to be maintained in their nursing homes by employing community intervention teams to supply services to these lower level hospitals.  I ask the Minister to comment on that aspect.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Brien mentioned that 14,300 people who have been waiting longer than 15 months will be taken off the National Treatment Purchase Fund's procedure list.  Into what category do they fall?  When representatives of the National Treatment Purchase Fund appeared before the committee some weeks ago, they addressed long waiters who were waiting for day case or simple procedures.  It was not really taking people who needed complex procedures off that list.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Brien's opening statement indicated that 191,000 people have been waiting longer than 15 months for an outpatient appointment.  It is proposed that 50% of those would be dealt with in 2017, which equates to 95,000, some 36,000 of which have been dealt with already.  How has that been achieved?  How was it possible to remove 36,000 from the long waiting list?</p> <p>  I ask the Minister to give an update on the access programme for cannabis products in cases of epilepsy, muscular spasm, MS and intractable vomiting as a result of chemotherapy.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Brien has said that the Sl&aacute;inte report represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reform our health service.  The Minister has stated that he is happy to deal with areas outlined in the report that are compatible with Government policy.  It will hardly reform our health service if it is confined to areas incompatible with Government policy.  I ask him to comment on that point.</p></speech>

If a patient who requires a treatment that cannot be provided in this jurisdiction can locate to an institution or doctor that can provide that treatment outside Ireland, the patient is entitled to receive that treatment and have the cost reimbursed by the HSE.</p> <p>  I wish to sow an idea in the Minister's mind.  Deputy Kelly asked about the development of urgent treatment centres sitting beside accident and emergency departments.  A number of GPs in the mid-west have proposed to the CEO of the UL hospital group the development of urgent-care centres which keep people out of the accident and emergency department, but supply them with an intermediate service between GP out-of-hours and accident and emergency.  Deputy Kelly spoke about the huge increase in attendance in University Hospital Limerick - perhaps the modern new accident and emergency department is a victim of its own success.</p> <p>  The Minister can add those questions to his list and I ask him to answer the last tranche of questions.</p></speech>

I will address as many as possible and some of the HSE officials, particularly Mr. Pat Healy, might like to expand on particular items.</p> <p>  The Senator asked for an update on the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  I intend to ratify it and we have moved forward in recent weeks.  We have had weekly meetings involving the Departments of Justice and Equality, and Health.  We are dealing with the blockages relating to the deprivation of liberty and the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act.  We have consulted with the HSE, the National Disability Authority and the Mental Health Commission, and have made major progress, particularly in recent weeks.  As previously mentioned, we have met parents, disabled people and advocates.  They have been lobbing me on this issue.  We have been involved in a listening process.  I have met individuals who have given me advice on how to progress the convention.</p> <p>  One important aspect of the UN convention is the decision-support service, DSS.  Interviews have been held in recent weeks and we are coming to the conclusion of those.  I am optimistic about having a director and a project manager in place as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  I will meet the Taoiseach and the Secretaries General before the summer recess to again drive the UN convention.  The Senator probably heard that in his speech.  The focus is on trying to move this forward as quickly as possible and develop the co-operation between different Departments.</p></speech>

I have been waiting here for a while and I wanted to get back in on a few things.</p> <p>  Listening to some people, one would think not much was going on in the disability sector.  It is important to remind people of the huge amount of work going on in the disability services and the disability sector.  Recently, 9,800 people in receipt of domiciliary care allowance for sick and disabled children have been given medical cards, which has a very significant impact on families with disabled children.  We have also had the restoration of the carer's grant, which 101,000 families are receiving.  Some &euro;1.688 billion is being invested in disability services, an increase of 6%.</p> <p>  Senator Dolan spoke about figures, estimates and plans.  I know from my day to day job that, for example, we are dealing with 1,500 school leavers every year.  There has been a major improvement since last year.  The families of all those 18-year olds leaving over the next week or so have been told what service they will be attending.  That was a problem when I first came into office and one we also have to deal with.</p> <p>  We will be offering 8,400 residential places, 182,000 respite nights and 1.4 million personal assistant hours for 2,400 people with disabilities.  We will deal with 24,800 day places and 2.75 home support hours for 7,500 people.  Those are the kind of numbers we are dealing with.  Regarding emergency cases, we will have &euro;16.2 million supporting 395 people this year.  In that sector we will provide support for 210 emergency respite places.  These are the kind of figures we are talking about.</p> <p>  I agree with the Senator's point on unemployment and poverty.  The high level of unemployment among the disabled is totally unacceptable and I again raised this issue at Cabinet last Tuesday.  We have a target of increasing the employment of people with disabilities in the public service from 3% to 6%.</p><p>Some Departments have a good record in this, where up to 3.6% of employees are disabled.  I welcome that, but a hell of a lot more must be done.  We also have the national disability inclusion strategy which it is hoped will make a huge difference to people's lives.  I am bringing forward these practical, hands-on, measurable actions.  Make Work Pay is a group which is working to make it worthwhile for a person with a disability to take up employment.  I have already mentioned the comprehensive employment strategy.  There are many actions ongoing.  On the points raised on section 38 and 39 hospitals, and I might ask my colleagues from the HSE to develop this as well, I agree that the staff migration to better paying organisations is an issue-----</p></speech>

To return to section 38 and 39, staff migration is an issue.  I have raised it with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe.  I agree that we must retain people in these services, because otherwise the services are going to be damaged.  This is in the interests of people with disabilities.  I am working closely with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on this issue.</p> <p>  On the issue raised by Senator Colm Burke concerning respite care, we have to develop the respite care service.  I accept that argument.  We have started work on that.  For example, last year we planned for 182,000 respite overnights and 41,000 respite day places.  We also have 210 new home support hours for families.  I mentioned earlier that families should not forget that we have restored the carer's grant, which was formerly known as the respite carer's grant, which amounts to &euro;1,700 per family.  That allows people to access and buy respite services.  We have choices in respite services.  We have to make plans for such services, and we have many such plans.  The COPE foundation was mentioned.  In 2016, the COPE foundation got &euro;47.5 million in funding, but in 2017, we are going to give it &euro;49.6 million.  That &euro;49.6 million includes &euro;317,000 in a full year for respite services and a &euro;45,000 once-off payment for the extension of the day service building.  We are investing in the services, but we are also reforming the services in the interests of the person with disability.</p> <p>  On Senator Dolan's point about progress in other Departments, disability is not just part of the health, social protection or justice areas.  It applies right across every Department.  The national disability inclusion strategy contains many themes, which are equality, choice, joined-up policy, public services, education, employment, health and well-being, person-centred disabilities services, living in the community, transport and accessible places.  In all, 32 key objectives are identified.  The whole issue of disability has to be broadened out and the services have to be developed.</p> <p>  My focus is on three things.  First, we must reform disability services.  Second, we must invest in disability services.  Third, we have to design the service around the person with the disability, whether it is a physical or intellectual disability.</p> <p>  Perhaps some of my colleagues might answer some of the other queries.</p></speech>

Deputy Kelly's point about home helps is very valid and we have to take a wider look at that issue because it is going to be a greater challenge.  Something that we are all pricking up on the doorsteps as practicing politicians is that people cannot be found to do the hours, even if the hours are available.  We have to look at incentivising it in some way across Government, be it through-----</p></speech>

Senator Burke raised the issue of respite, and as the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, has said, we set out in the note the specific increases for COPE, plus some of the losses of beds due to HIQA compliance.  On the specific planning data he referenced, while we do not have them for the Cork area, we do have them nationally.  Looking at the age profile, the recent Health Research Board, HRB, report which informs our contribution to the Estimates process and so on would indicate that 49% of people currently registered are 35 years of age or older, which clearly has implications for planning, particularly with the ageing issues in some of the cohort of that population.</p> <p>  On respite, at a national level, approximately 90% of those waiting for respite live at home.  That is important.  We have identified just over 2,000 places nationally, and 400 a year are looking for respite care.  As Deputy McGrath said, we came up with an innovative approach this year in terms of new in-home respite to deal especially with emergency cases because there is a greater level of need there, and we are prioritising that in the current share.</p> <p>  The broader figures of need have recently been identified based on the 2016 figures with a five-year horizon.  All that would fit in.  There are roughly 500 new residential places a year for the next five years, and around 400 a year for change of needs.  That is an indication.  We have many other figures concerning day care and education and training, and all those will be used to inform our consideration of Estimates for 2018.</p></speech>

I am very pleased with my answer to the first question.  I have not received a substantial answer to the question about the extent or estimates of need which has not been met.  I have information about what is being done, and that is fine, but I have not received a response to my question, which is quite worrying.  I want to put that on the record.</p> <p>  On the issue of section 38 and 39 hospitals, I am delighted that the Minister of State has been speaking to the Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe.  I specifically asked if the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has been in contact with the Department of Health on this issue.  I also asked about the pressing areas that need to be moved on.  The answer laid out eight, nine or ten areas that are the headings in the disability strategy implementation plan.  I asked the Department whether, if a handful of these items were moved to other Departments, it would rightly take pressure off the Department of Health and have resources directed to where they should be.</p></speech>

It is not something that was dealt with in the recent pay negotiations because that was restricted to public service employees, and whatever way it is cut, section 39 employees are not public servants.  That is the position of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Health.  If there were reductions to salaries in those agencies in the bad times, how will that play itself out?  It is not correct to say that every employee in a section 39 agency had the very same reductions as the standard right across the public service.</p><p>There may, however, be organisations where they did and employees will come forward and say to their employer in light of what is happening in the economy they believe they are entitled to have some of the reductions restored to them.  That will raise funding issues, and that was the point that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, made.  It is unlikely to happen all in one go and it is unlikely to happen in a standard way as happened in the public service because they were not reduced in a standard way.  It will have to be done on a case by case basis. </p></speech>

It is likely to play out across the usual industrial relations machinery.  If in doing that it raises funding issues they will become the subject of discussion between those organisations and their funders, the HSE being the primary source of funding for many of them.</p></speech>

The Department is emphasising handing the money over.  I am trying to focus on the effect on service provision.  That will vary in different places.  It has to be a concern for the Department that some services will become less sustainable or unsustainable because of people choosing where to work.</p></speech>

It is a bit premature in that the funding of the restoration of public servants' pay increases has yet to be fully addressed.  What happened this year and the new national negotiations have not formed part of budgetary allocations.  There are many steps to follow before the budgetary implications are properly washed out.</p></speech>

I met the national voluntary bodies' network who made that point very strongly to me because it is concerned about staff.  We are anticipating this and have to respond to it and I am very conscious of that.</p> <p>  In respect of support between different Departments and the choices for people with disabilities, the Senator knows that my political position is that every single person with a disability has to be treated equally and that we have to change the mindset of Irish society.  There is fantastic co-operation between the Department of Health under the Minister, Deputy Harris, the Department of Social Protection and other Departments particularly in recent weeks in dealing with the recommendations on making work pay and the medical card and earnings issue for people with a disability.  In recent days I have been working closely with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  We have to ensure that every Department is focused on people with disabilities and their views so that they can have equal rights and make their choices. </p> <p>  The task force on the personalised budgets, which I set up a couple of months ago, chaired by Christy Lynch, is coming up with an interim report in the next week or two.  The final report will be done by December and it will focus on giving people with disabilities more choices and personalised budgets to have services for themselves.  A lot of work is being done to push out the equality agenda for people with disabilities but I accept we have a hell of a lot more to do.  We have, however, done a lot in the past 11 months.  </p></speech>

The increase in the number of consultants is a separate and distinct issue that should lead to service improvements.  The HSE may want to comment further on that.</p> <p>  I am very pleased with the significant progress on the National Maternity Hospital.  When there was a lot of public concern a few weeks ago I asked for a month to ensure engagement with the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, and the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  The officials and the Secretary General in the Department have done Trojan work in engaging with the hospitals and the Sisters of Charity have made a very significant decision to withdraw from the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  Several things happened immediately, including that the Sisters of Charity stepped down from the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group board.  That is a concrete and tangible example of the ultimate separation of Church and State.  I acknowledge the huge contribution that order made to health care.  That has dealt with one of the most significant concerns people had in respect of this, that there would be religious interference, whether real or perceived, in any shape or form in the provision of maternity services which nobody wants to see happen.  Any concern about a religious ethos has been removed.  </p> <p>  The other concern was who would own the asset the State was going to invest significant taxpayers' money in.  There is still engagement between the Department and the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group on that.  That engagement has been positive, constructive, and everybody is trying to find a satisfactory solution.  I hope to be a position to report progress on that to Government and the Oireachtas very shortly.</p> <p>  I am pleased that the Deputy raised the issue of rogue crisis pregnancy agencies because I have been extraordinarily concerned about the idea that someone who finds herself in a vulnerable position due to an unexpected pregnancy, or some other difficulty, seeks advice and support from somebody who is rogue.  We have seen despicable examples in this country of nonsense, mistruths and disgusting things said to women in a very vulnerable position, which is not information.  I was serious about trying to put concrete measures in place to rectify this.  After significant engagement with the Department we arrived at the conclusion that the best way to address this was to regulate the professions of counsellors and psychotherapists.  Someone who wants to call himself or herself a counsellor or psychotherapist must meet standards and be regulated and the person going to get information can see the plaque on the wall to say this is a regulated, authorised, legitimate counsellor or psychotherapist.</p> <p>  This is an extraordinarily difficult area to regulate.  It has been tried for many years in the UK but it has not been done.  I am pleased we are going to do it here.  I went out to public consultation to give stakeholders an opportunity to have their say.  We received approximately 84 submissions and last month after reading those submissions I decided to proceed with the designation of two distinct professions under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.  Each of these professions will have its own register under one registration board.  I have communicated this decision to CORU, to the relevant professional bodies and to anybody who took part in the public consultation process.  I committed to do this work and have done it in advance of the summer recess.  Now I will turn it into the necessary regulations to designate these professions and these regulations will be drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and will require the prior approval of the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  I hope to be in a position to bring these to the Houses in September.  This will be a very significant measure.  There has been cross-party support for it.</p></speech>

He worked with the Department on it and this committee scrutinised the Bill on 30 March which recommended that it should not proceed to Committee Stage because we were going about the regulation of professions.</p> <p>  I assure everybody that designating these two professions, counsellors and psychotherapists, is a policy decision I have taken.  We have had the consultation, written out to people, and to the counsel and we have set up the register.  Now the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has to draft it and I expect to lay it before the D&aacute;il and Seanad in September for their approval.  I hope when we get to that point we will have the co-operation of all Members to pass it into law as quickly as possible.  We will then have done something in this country that many jurisdictions have struggled with and not been able to do.</p><p> On the issue of abortion, the Deputy will understand that I do not want to comment on a specific case other than to say that the full resources in my Department in whatever way they are required will be available, in so far as the committee may wish, to assist the special Oireachtas committee examining the eighth amendment following the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  I have made clear my personal view, which is that I want to see a referendum on the issue of the amendment in 2018.  I am respectful of the body of work the committee has to do, but that is my view and the view that has been expressed by the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il as well.  I understand we will see the report of the Citizens' Assembly arrive in the Oireachtas.  It is an important body of work for us to consider.  Under law, tomorrow I will lay before the Oireachtas the annual report I am required to do in respect of the Protection of Life during Pregnancy Act to show how many people availed of terminations under the provisions of that Act in the year just gone by.</p><p> The national maternity strategy is clear on the issue of anomaly scans.  No woman should be at any disadvantage based on geographical location and there needs to be equitable access to these scans.  We will shortly be launching the implementation plan for the women and infants' health programme, which is responsible for delivering the national maternity strategy, and I expect to see the issue of anomaly scans addressed in it.  In the interim, it is important to send out the message that, while not available in every hospital, anomaly scans are available in every hospital group, so every woman in this country should have access to an anomaly scan.  That is an important message.</p><p> Senator Burke raised the issue of Cork and future planning.  The Senator is entirely correct.  Cork has seen a huge increase in its population but, like many parts of the country, has not seen an increase in terms of its health capital infrastructure and bed capacity.  It would be foolish not to plan now not just for the current population but for the future projected growth.  I know that this is an issue about which the Senator is passionate.  I visited the Mercy University Hospital with him in the not too distant past and I understand representatives of the hospital are looking to meet me to discuss this.  I will do that in the next few weeks.  It might be useful to meet Oireachtas Members from Cork - if the Senator wishes to arrange it, I would be delighted to facilitate it - to address the challenge being posed to us in terms of putting in place a plan in order that we can prepare for the mid-term capital plan.</p><p> I will ask the HSE to answer the Senator's questions on the increase in administration and management staff and we will get more detail from Ms Mannion in a moment, but I will make two points.  This is an area that deserves significant discussion by this committee, perhaps when there is more time.  What we mean when we talk about administration and management is important.  We must ensure we are using the correct labels.  What one person might think is the job of an administrator, another might have a very different view on it.  It is important we get a bit of clarity on that.  To make the point, we had a question earlier about the perceived delays in answering Oireachtas Members' parliamentary questions.  The person responsible for answering those parliamentary questions is an administration staff member.  If there was a delay in the processing of the medical cards, people would rightly be on to me about it.  The people processing the medical cards may well be in the administration or management sector.  Every time we set up a new multidisciplinary team, there is an administrative challenge.</p><p> We have also come through a period whereby many posts had been suppressed.  The Senator has probably heard through his clinics - I have certainly heard through my own engagement - health care professionals saying that the support structures were not in place to empower the health care professional to get on with his or her job.  I will ask the HSE to answer it, but that is my initial response.  However, Sl&aacute;intecare poses significant questions in this regard because it speaks about the significant restructuring and reconfiguration of our health service.  The question the Senator asks about what the management structure and the numbers will look like in the context of the implementation of a ten-year plan is something on which I would like the HSE to hear his initial thoughts.  It will be a question I will be considering in the context of the implementation plan.</p><p> I thank Deputy Kelly for his series of questions.  I say sincerely that, as well as being questions, they are some very fine ideas that merit significant and serious consideration.  I will try to answer some of them.  In terms of eHealth, he is entirely correct.  It is exciting that there is now a political consensus that we have got to do this.  He is right that, after many years of ICT projects in different areas of the country not working, there is perhaps a reticence in many parts of the public service.  I am proud that that is not the case in the health area.  I was very proud when we had the extraordinarily difficult cyber attack that the health service in this country held up extraordinarily well.  People worked incredibly well and the investment that had been made paid off.  The health sector showed a leadership role within the public service at that time.</p><p> We have now begun to roll out the electronic health records for newborn babies in hospitals in Cork and Kerry and it is about to go to the Rotunda Hospital.  There is a roll-out plan for it.  As I stated, I have signed the commencement order and the regulations for the individual health identifier.  The Deputy is right that there is a big bill attached to this, but I will not be found wanting in terms of prioritising it in the context of the needs of the health service and forthcoming capital planning because it unlocks a lot of potential within the health service.  I am struck by the issue of eReferrals.  It used to go through 16 pairs of hands from when the GP wrote a referral until it got to the consultant.  The GP can do it now while the patient is sitting in the clinic and send it off to the consultant.  That frees up a lot of capacity in the system.</p><p> On speeding up capital development, the challenge the Deputy has posed to me is something on which I would be interested in working with him.  I will revert to him on it.  Is there a way of fast-tracking critical infrastructure if we consider there to be a real capacity shortage in the health service, which we all do?  To address his question bluntly, I want to see South Tipperary General Hospital included in the capital plan because, from my visit there, I think it is badly needed.</p><p> There is a map in terms of cardiac care.  I have one and will make it available to the Deputy and the committee.  That is the approach to take.  While there is a powerful campaign and quite important issues in the south east, there are issues in other parts of the country too.  It needs to be looked at nationally.</p><p> On the issue of home help, we should take up the question about how we encourage more people to take up the role.  I will liaise with the Department of Education and Skills about it.</p></speech>

The statutory scheme, the consultation process to which we are hoping to launch in the coming days, will begin to address that question.  If working in a sector that is defined under law and structured, many questions will arise such as who regulates it, who can provide home help, and the qualifications and background needed.</p><p>On the model 1, 2 and 3 hospital relationship, we are due in the programme for Government to review the minor injuries units.  I share the view that they could be open an awful lot longer.  On pathways needing to be widened, that is an interesting point on which I will come back to the Deputy.</p><p>On intermediate care vehicles, the Deputy is correct that we have increased the budget for the national ambulance service this year.  Much of that increased funding was for intermediate care vehicles.  More than 90% of transfers between hospital are being done by this service rather than the arrangement of <i>ad hoc</i>situations in the past.</p><p>The point about getting data, without naming people and geographic areas, on what GPs are sending people to emergency departments is a valid one.  I will take it further.  However, I note that I launched the national health care quality reporting system yesterday and there are a couple of interesting indications in it, county by county, such as how many people in County Tipperary are being referred for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, or for this, that and the other to various emergency departments.  The Deputy is right that if we scrutinised it, it might give us some more indications.</p><p>I thank the Chairman for the questions.</p></speech>

That is not the full extent of the fund's work this year and it is looking at including complex orthopaedic procedures as well.  It will be a mix of day cases and inpatient cases, including some quite complex procedures.</p> <p>  I am pleased to tell the committee that the cannabis access programme is going well in the sense that the expert group is working away diligently.  It had another meeting either today or yesterday and is due to provide me with a report next month.  I will be pleased to come back and discuss that with the committee at a time of its choosing.</p> <p>  On Sl&aacute;intecare, the reason I slightly interrupted the speaker, for which I apologise, is that there is a remark being attributed to me of which no one can find any record whatsoever of me ever saying.  That is quite frustrating because I say an awful lot of things on the record for people to attribute to me if they wish.  As recently as last week, I also said on the record at the Committee on the Future of Healthcare that I believe that this is a once in a generation opportunity to get this right.  It is good to see that the director general and I are on the same page on this issue.  I never suggested that it is only about moving ahead what the Government thought was a good idea.  I said it was encouraging to see that a number of things in Sl&aacute;intecare are already things that have been identified by Government, but by the health service, if that makes sense.  National standards such as the Healthy Ireland framework, the eHealth agenda and the new GP contract are items that are already under way.  In addition to that, it is in relation to the new stuff that I am duty-bound as a Minister to come back with an implementation plan.</p><p>The challenge with voluntary care, to which I am happy to rise, is in the sequencing of change.  If one had the funding and were to provide everybody with automatic entitlement to free GP care in the morning, one has to ask whether we would have the GPs to deal with it.  As one increases entitlement one has to build capacity and if one does it with the wrong sequencing it will become an issue.</p><p> The second issue is funding.  I accept the committee did some costings but it would also concede - with a degree of pride, I believe - that there is agreement on how we would fund it and there is agreement on how much it would cost.  I am looking forward to going to Government with my views on an implementation plan before the summer recess.  I am really committed to advancing this as it is a really honest, diligent effort by politicians not to be partisan with the health services but to lay the foundations for the future.  There was an idea for urgent treatment centres and I will certainly reflect on that with colleagues in the Department.</p><p> Deputy O'Connell asked about HPV.</p></speech>

I hope to be able to implement the national drugs strategy in my role as Minister for State.  Deputy O'Connell is right that there has been a significant fall in the numbers of young girls having the HPV vaccine.  This is a very serious development for a large number of girls who may develop cervical cancer later in their lives.  The Department of Health and the HSE are working to counteract the misinformation connected with the vaccine, which undermines our national vaccination programme.  As parents, we understand that there are risks with all vaccinations.  I once sat on the opposite side of the room and I listened to parents speaking about the HPV vaccine, as well as the counterarguments from the HSE.  I am not a medical professor but the Minister attended the national vaccination conference where he heard about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine and the work being done to increase the uptake by girls as part of the school immunisation programme.  All parents are given an immunisation pack outlining what a vaccination is about, what diseases it will be effective against and the risks.  The Minister can comment more on the conference.</p></speech>

Every year approximately 300 women get cervical cancer and 100 will die.  The HPV vaccination has been tested to within an inch of its life and is internationally recognised as saving lives.  Due to misinformation and scaremongering being put out by some people - some of whom should know better - it has led to a significant decrease.  The HSE, my Department and I will continue to put forward the benefits of HPV and I appeal to all colleagues on all sides of this House - and I know there is cross-party support on this - to take every single opportunity to debunk the myths.  It is straightforward.  If one wants to give medical advice, become a doctor.  If one does not want to become a doctor, do not give medical advice.  If people give medical advice on Twitter and other social media, confuse people and engage in scaremongering, it will have a detrimental effect on the lives and well-being of girls and boys in this country.  It will cost lives so there is a responsibility on all of us - the health service and the political system - to show leadership.  It is a very important vaccine.</p></speech>

Is that having any effect?  Are we having an impact on the falling rates?  This is so serious that it needs to be reviewed every three months.  The decline has been so rapid that it is not good enough to have an annual review.  The current rate is 83% but if we get down to 75% it will all have been a pointless exercise.  I take issue with the Minister on one point - pharmacists can give medical advice too.</p> <p>  Mary Harney started the good work on this and Senator James Reilly was very supportive-----</p></speech>

If what elected Members and the HSE are doing is not helping, we need to do something else.  There are 40 girls walking around today who will die from cervical cancer because of the reduction in the vaccination rate.  They could be daughters of any of us.</p></speech>

In a past life I commissioned the first health technology assessment on the HPV vaccine and I regard the campaign against the vaccine as nothing short of emotional terrorism.  Unfortunately, however, so far it has been successful.  Vaccine uptake rates in 2014-15 were 87% and they fell to 72% in 2015-16 but provisional data for the current year indicate that only 50% of girls received the first dose in September or October 2016.  There has been some improvement on that in the programme this year but the net effect renders hundreds, if not thousands, of teenage girls at risk of a substantially preventable illness.  The campaign is absolutely without evidence or foundation and those who are engaged in it are literally playing God with people's emotions and lives.  We are committed to redoubling our efforts to counter this misinformation and to restore confidence in what, in conjunction with the cervical check programme, can be a hugely effective campaign to substantially reduce both the incidence of and loss of life from cervical cancer and other conditions.</p></speech>

I will deal with a number of them and my colleagues, Ms Mannion, Mr. Woods and Mr. Healy, will deal with the others.  The 34% figure in my opening statement related specifically to the community intervention teams, in what is an OPAT-focused programme.  Two things occur.  Either there is admission avoidance, in the form of discharge from an emergency department into a community-based care system, or there is an earlier discharge.  The programme specifically relieves admissions or discharge pressure in acute hospitals rather than layering on something new.  We are seeking to avoid referrals to emergency departments altogether by making this a viable option for general practice.</p> <p>  I categorically state that the specific, targeted scoliosis programme is not to the detriment of other patients.</p><p>No existing service will be degraded as a result.  There may be an opportunity cost in that if we were not doing this, we could be doing something else.  There will be no existing level of service compromised as a result of this.</p><p> I did not include the information about the rates of teen suicide in my opening statement to claim any particular credit, but to counter a significant amount of misreporting - it is not so much disinformation - based on old data and the desire to correct current understandings.  This is a very significant issue.  </p><p> I will ask Mr. Liam Woods to address the issue of waiting lists.</p></speech>

There is a weekly rate of reduction in long waiters of about 2,800 and that is continuing in the system.  The reduction is achieved through the targeting of long waiters within the normal outpatient process.  That is the figure that was referred to.</p> <p>  There were a number of other questions.  One was on the increasing consultant numbers and whether it reflects European working time directive, EWTD, compliance or additional clinical decision-making hours.  By and large, it is the latter.  We are monitoring EWTD compliance in NCHD terms.  Growth in NCHD numbers could be more closely aligned to EWTD compliance but not always.  Sometimes it is also additional.  </p> <p>  A question was asked about nurse recruitment.  Nurse numbers in the HSE acute division are up nearly 600 in the current year; 220 of those are permanent and the balance, 377, are students who will graduate at a future point.</p> <p>  The HSE is actively involved in the hospital services in Cork and the designed new hospital.  The observations made about UCC are noted.  </p> <p>  I will also mention eHealth.  A laboratory system is going in nationally.  There is a national radiology system referred to as NIMIS.  There is a maternity system for women which is an electronic health record, EHR, for women and infants.  It has started to roll out in Cork and Kerry and is spreading nationally.  It is working very well.  </p> <p>  On the issue of the scorecard, there are data on GP referrals.  The Minister referred to it.  Not all patients attending emergency departments are referred by GPs.  The propensity to be referred by GPs varies around the country.  We have the data and can make them available.  They are the questions that were related to acute areas.</p></speech>

For the information of the committee, we are making progress on the issue of trying to ensure the hours individuals are employed are meaningful in terms of being a full day or a full week.  The history has been of a large number of people with a small number of hours, perhaps ten or 20.  We engaged with the unions last year and it was agreed that as people leave our employment and we recruit home helps, we match them to full-time employment.  Good progress is being made on the issue Deputy Kelly raised.  We are on a good trajectory.  It would help in increasing the availability of staff.  On the point about incentivisation, we will work with the Department and Minister on any initiatives on that front.</p></speech>

He has returned so we will give him the last word.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.1067" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017062800002#Y00600"><p>I will be kind.  I apologise for being absent twice during the meeting.  If there is no time to answer my questions this evening, I will be happy to accept a written reply.</p> <p>  Is there a trouble-shooter in the system who monitors the capacity to deal with unforeseen accidents or emergencies that arise at any location throughout the country?  We did that many moons ago when I was a member of the health board.  We did practice drills that showed up any inadequacies and showed management if there was capacity and capability.  </p> <p>  The Minister mentioned the word capacity which we became very familiar with in the course of the meetings of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare.  As I said before, I believe we can work out all these things mathematically.  We can identify the extent of a deficiency in any area.  We can identify where it is at and how to counter it.  To what extent, if at all, has that concept been employed by the HSE to identify a lack of capacity in certain areas whether it is hospital beds, nursing staff, doctors, consultants or any other aspect of the service?  It is only when the service is tested that its weakest point shows up.  It is that which determines what is the service. </p> <p>  I will comment on the unattractiveness of GP practices in city and country at present.  There is an ongoing negative attitude in the commentary on health services and it is unhelpful.  Nobody wants to go to work in a place that has an aura of negativity hanging over it.  They do not want to be victims, and rightly so, of the general criticism of the system.  We have to improve the system but, on the other hand, we have to be conscious that people who work in a particular situation at any given time like to feel they are doing a job that is appreciated.  An issue that comes up from time to time is quality of life in the workplace and job satisfaction.  If one removed that from the delivery of vital services such as the health services, there would be a serious void which would show up to a greater extent.  </p> <p>  Home care packages have already been mentioned so I will not go over it again.  There is a case which has received publicity in the past number of days.  I compliment those who dealt with the issue when it became a national issue and an emergency issue.  Capacity needs to be put in place within the system to deal with the human elements that arise from time to time for which there is no set piece on paper.  There is no tabular form that can be referred to.  There is a necessity to be able to take the situation and deal with it.  That applies to medical cards too, which is an area in which it is improving.  It does not only apply to health services; it applies to all services throughout the country.  That is the way it is.</p> <p>  Drug costs have been referred to already.  I compliment the Minister on his work so far in experimental drugs.  I do not know if we can resolve it permanently or not.  I am strongly of the view that the Single Market should apply in this as it does in everything else.  If one is ordering a product on behalf of 500 million people, one certainly has greater clout than if one is ordering it on behalf of 5 million people.  I would ask that special emphasis be put on bringing it to the fore as soon as possible.  </p> <p>  I have two final points.  The first is on orthodontics.  It is something that causes awful problems in households and huge expense.  Parents go to the ends of the earth to borrow money to carry out orthodontics.  We have a system of category one, category two and category three.  Category three patients never get treated at all.  Category one patients get treated on a long ongoing basis.  It is not a satisfactory system.  Will somebody please identify what the problems are and try to deal with them in a way that is more dependable and efficient and which reflects a modern society? </p> <p>  The last point I will make is on the disability sector.  I compliment the Minister and Ministers of State on their reappointment and new Ministers of State on their appointment.  I wish those who have moved on to other places the very best.  Mid-term reviews are always difficult times.  It is good to see people back in the roles they have become familiar with.  I have always held the view that if one has an agenda in a Government Department, one has to bring it forward.  If it is a five-year plan, one better bring it forward to six months because it will take five years to implement the six-month plan.  What is the extent to which adequate resources remain available to the Department and the Minister to cater for the transport needs, day care, respite care and residential needs which seem to be merging to a greater extent now?  I have spoken about it before, as has everybody else.</p><p>The same people are carrying the burden for many years.  They get tired and worried.  We do not always respond in the way that we should, but follow a blueprint that seems to have the answer, but does not always work out that way.  The blueprint can work to the detriment of Ministers as well, as they will be informed of the prototype, which is usually trotted out to diffuse the Minister's concern and anxiety about the lack of progress or whatever the case may be, but we need to come to grips with this in so far as we can.<br/><br/>In response to the point on social media and the vaccination inoculation programme, yes, serious damage has been done to the vaccination programme on social media.  The problem is that public representatives have to ask themselves if the points made on social media are accurate.  It takes time before there is a rebuttal.  My advice is that there is no point responding in the newspapers such as the <i>The Times </i>or <i>The Sunday Times</i>to a point made on social media.  One must respond to it through social media.  Otherwise public confidence in the health system will be eroded, and it will be eroded before the Minister or Minister of State has had time to get to grips with the situation.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that Deputy Durkan has consistently raised correctly the issue of the drug costs and that we should utilise our membership of the European Union in this regard.  I could not agree more with him.  I have attached a significant degree of importance to this since coming to office.  In fact at the last meeting of European health Ministers in Luxembourg two or three weeks ago, I took the opportunity to raise the matter.  We are beginning to see finally the building blocks of people working together, because none of us, regardless of whether one is a large or small country can afford to do it on our own any more.  I am confident that we will see further progress.  The officials from my Department will be at meetings with officials from a number of other countries, exploring concrete steps we can take in that regard.</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy's viewpoint on orthodontics.  We all see the impact of this service though our constituency work.  It is an important and sensitive issue in the life of a young child or adolescent.  We have a commitment in the programme for a partnership Government to provide timely access to orthodontic care.  Already the HSE has undertaken a procurement of orthodontic services with a number of private service providers.  This commenced towards the end of last year and we now have treated an additional 11,080 patients who were on the waiting list for the longest time.  The HSE is looking at procurement locally, including service level agreements, SLAs, with dental schools.  Orthodontics is an important area and one to which we attach priority.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.1071" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017062800002#Z00400"><p>Deputy Durkan is absolutely correct on social media.  The HSE has increased its social media presence quite significantly in terms of monitoring and communications.  At the risk of sounding pithy, I make the point that all the people who do that work are clerical and administrative staff too.  There is a bit of theme coming through.</p> <p>  In relation to emergency management in the health sphere, the HSE carries the statutory responsibility for emergency management.  In the last period we have developed the national emergency operations centre, which is the centralised control system for all of our emergency resource deployment.  We have also significantly increased our emergency planning capacity.  It is now formally part of the brief of one of our national directors.  We also have a head of emergency management and we carry out frequent risk assessments and drills.  Fortunately our national risk assessment on terrorist related emergency health care related incidents remains low, but we have observed very closely what has happened in our nearest neighbour in terms of recent events and have engaged directly with our counterparts in terms of lessons learned and so on.  Clearly in the health space, mass casualty events are more likely to come from transport related incidents and so on.  We carry out live exercises in that space and are working on conjoined planning on a cross-public sector basis with the Defence Forces, the Fire Brigade services and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who would be in the lead in the context of a security related incident.  I am pleased to say this is an area where we are well prepared, notwithstanding all the other challenges that the health service has in responding to emergencies, which is what we do.  We have gone through a very elaborate process of ensuring that we are well prepared.</p> <p>  The recent cyber security threat to our health service, to which the Minister referred, is a textbook example in that we followed our major incident approach.</p> <p>  The issue of morale has also been raised.  I am glad it was, because it is not necessary to denigrate the quality of what our 100,000 plus staff do in order to make the case that we need to improve the health service.  Others do that.</p> <p>  On the issue of cyber security, in the National Health Service, NHS, in the United Kingdom they were susceptible to more risk and more targeting.  I think they lost 40 hospitals for a whole weekend.  The BBC celebrated with a special programme on the work of the cyber security team in the NHS.  We in Ireland took some steps, protected the entire health service from attack and the headlines we got were actually critical in that same week that we had successfully rolled out a maternal and infant information system to create Ireland's first so-called digital babies, real babies, of course, with a digital identity.  The contrast was, of course, not lost on me.  We have a terrible habit of looking for the negative in our health service, when there is tremendous work done day-in and day-out by the staff who work in it.  They showed resilience under the cyber security attack, which is not yet over is but was one example.</p> <p>  On the general point made in respect of the fair deal scheme affecting the Devereauxs, this is a people business, it is delivered by people and people sometimes make judgments that they regret perhaps afterwards or which they would change.  There is a great phrase that covers it, that "to err is human".  I would not jump up and down on an individual who made a decision in good faith.  The important thing is that the decision in caught and corrected.  Clearly "Liveline" is a national institution originally under Marian Finucane and now under Joe Duffy.  What we need to do of course is to make sure that people understand that it is not the place they go to, to get issues resolved.  Just as I once appointed and continue to have a confidential recipient in the area of residential disability services, we will be giving serious consideration to how we have our own "talk to Joe", response so that things can be resolved even more speedily and more effectively.  Not that I want to steal the real Joe's thunder or anything, but I do not want people to have a feeling that in order to get common sense applied, where things have not worked out well initially that it is necessary to expose his or her life to national radio.  That adds a further trauma.  We will look to see how we can improve on that.  </p></speech>

These service are  very important key dimensions to disability services.  It is all very well to go along and talk about the rights of people with disabilities but we need to have the services for them.  That is my focus at all times.</p> <p>  Other issues, such as what happens when people with disabilities are school leavers, safeguarding adults were touched on by Mr. O'Brien.  We have a very good service with a confidential recipient who is very good at working with the families of those with a disabilities.  People who are concerned about vulnerable adults, and such cases, can contact that service, so that we have that in line as well.</p> <p>  The other direction we are taking is to have therapy posts, we have an issue with the number of posts.</p> <p>  The final issue is the new rehabilitation strategy, and we are looking at the idea of exploring a pilot day service.  These are all important issues in respect of disability services, but let me emphasise the service have to be reformed, we have to invest in them but also we have to design the services around the person.</p></speech>

Today's meeting will consist of two sessions and I welcome to our first session Dr. Ronan Lyons, assistant professor of economics at Trinity College, and Mr. John McCafferty and Mr. Gavin Elliot from Threshold.</p><p>Before we begin, I wish to draw witnesses' attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite Dr. Lyons to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

This is in the context of perhaps one of the most important items of business for the Government, namely, housing and the increasingly acute shortage of housing around the country and particularly in Dublin and the major cities.  In considering solutions for that overall problem, we must think about the scale of any solution and the costs and benefits associated with a proposed solution.</p> <p>  In that regard I wish to make three main points in this part of the proceedings.  First, we must distinguish between regulatory and taxation issues and supply and demand issues when considering the short-term lettings market.  Second, there is a role for short-term lettings in respect of tourist demand.  Third, and this is perhaps the main point, there is the scale of short-term lettings relative to the scale of the problem with the shortage of housing.</p> <p>  On the first point, as I note in my prepared submission we often read horror stories about short-term lettings, particularly for those residents nearby, with regard to noise, anti-social behaviour or unsocial hours.  These are genuine bad experiences faced by those residents.  They are not necessarily related to the challenge we are trying to address here, which is the shortage of housing.  Instead, they are about the regulation of that segment.  If one converts a full-time residence into full-time, short-term letting accommodation, for example, one might be in breach of management company rules or, and I understand an example of this happened in the Dublin City Council area recently, in breach of planning in terms of change of use.  Where those rules exist, they must be enforced.  If there are gaps in the rules and they are not protecting people, obviously we must introduce rules that give the protection that is missing.</p><p>Any connection between those kinds of rules and the wider housing market, in terms of the lack of supply, is certainly not the intent behind such rules.  It is about making sure the rules are followed and are complete.</p><p> The taxation of income generated by short-term lettings is a related issue that crops up often in the popular media.  I understand that Airbnb, for example, gives information to the Revenue Commissioners on a regular basis who in turn ensure tax compliance.  If one changed the tax burden and singled out the segment for particular treatment, the supply of short-term lettings would be affected.  The design of the tax system and its broad principles should not be done in a way to have a particular effect on the reallocation of housing or real estate across different segments of the market.</p><p> I shall make a slightly broader point on the importance of demand.  I am a demand fundamentalist because I think all demand is good.  It is a good thing if somebody wants to spend time in Ireland.  We should facilitate people if they want to live here or visit and if they would rather not leave, as has been the case for many individuals in recent years.  When thinking about suitable regulations for short-term lettings, we should remember that the market is important as it caters for a person or tourist who has a particular price point or income level and for people who wish to remain here for longer than a hotel stay.  A short-term let is an important option for people who wish to spend three or four weeks in this country.  The distinction has become somewhat blurred in recent years due to a lack of hotel accommodation but the situation is being rectified.  There has been a 40% increase in the stock of hotel rooms being built in Dublin so there will be less pressure on the segment.  The addition of new hotel beds does not mean there is no role for short-term lettings into the future.  Short-term lets cater for a particular price point.  Dublin and other cities should not just be tourist destinations for the wealthy.  The cities should be accessible to anyone who has the means to afford the cost of flights and suitable accommodation.</p><p> The main point I wish to make relates to the relative scale of the short-term letting segment and the shortage of accommodation throughout the country.  I know that the committee will hear from Airbnb later.  It may have the specific numbers.  However, in terms of what members have heard and what I have heard, for the size of the full-time short-term lettings segment in Dublin, one rarely hears of a number larger than 3,000.  Typically, most numbers one sees for short-term lets in full-time dwellings or residences are much smaller than 3,000.  If one looks online using a sufficiently distant date into the future, one would get a few hundred in Dublin.  To put the figures in perspective, if there are fewer than 4,500 rental listings in Dublin in any given month, then rents in the city will rise.  That is the rough rule of thumb that we have seen over the past ten or 12 years.  The Dublin rental market needs approximately 4,500 listings every month.  Even if it were possible to commandeer the entire stock of properties in short-term lettings, one would only meet two to three weeks of rental demand.  We are talking about different scales in the context of any proposed solutions.  There is also the scale of the problem to consider.</p><p> I recommend that the committee and the Legislature consider using vacant homes.  The vacancy rate in the Dublin City Council area is close to 10% and excludes over-the-shop vacancies that are not often classified as residences.  That is about the twice the vacancy rate one would expect in a healthy housing system and it means that there are between 15,000 and 20,000 unnecessarily vacant properties in the capital.  That would be the more fruitful area to look in terms of tackling the scale of the shortage of housing.</p><p> To conclude, I shall outline the scale of housing need.  People will have heard various numbers on how many homes should be built on a yearly basis.  I shall add my own number.  It is based on my understanding of all of the different components of housing demand, including market, non-market, obsolescence, existing housing stock falling out of use, changing demographics in terms of household size, the natural increase in population and net migration.  If I add in all of those components of demand, I cannot come up with a number smaller than 40,000 a year.  Realistically, it would be closer to 50,000 a year.  In Dublin, that would translate to between 15,000 and 20,000 units a year.  The vacant stock is a potential quick win of about a year's worth of demand.  It probably would not all come on stream overnight but it is a potentially quicker win as it takes longer to build housing supply.  The primary focus needs to be on such stock.  There may be issues with short-term lettings.  In terms of what one could do, even if one could commandeer everything, it would be small relative to the scale of the challenge.</p><p> I look forward to the wider discussion and I thank the committee for the opportunity to present to it today.</p></speech>

Halfway through my presentation I shall hand over to my colleague, Mr. Gavin Elliott, who is the legal officer for Threshold.<br/><br/>Threshold is a national housing charity that has regional advice centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway.  Threshold provides front-line advice and support services to people with housing problems across Ireland and our main focus is the private rental sector.  Threshold's advice services interface with a high proportion of the 320,000 households who live in the private rental sector.Last year, our housing advisers took almost 39,000 actions in terms of advising and assisting tenants who were experiencing housing problems and almost 150,000 users accessed our website.<br/><br/>We would like to take this opportunity to raise the issue expressed by other people before the committee about the proliferation of short-term lets.  We sense that there is a potential for it to have a negative impact on the supply of properties in the private rental sector.  The current high rents experienced by many in the private rental sector are in a large part due to a lack of overall supply.  Clearly, anything that reduces the supply requires analysis and, on foot of sound analysis, action where appropriate.  We have no evidence to suggest that the increase in short-term lets has led to a reduction in the supply of affordable private rented sector accommodation.  However, rents have substantially increased, especially in urban areas, in the years that short-term lets have been in the ascendent.  The relationship between short-term lets and private rented sector supply warrants close and ongoing monitoring.  Having said that, it is our analysis that the abject lack of social housing since the 1980s, deliberate Government decisions on social housing provision since then and the perform storm of rent increases in the past three to four years are the key drivers of the current crisis.<br/><br/>Last Monday almost 1,400 properties were advertised on <i>www.daft.ie</i>for Dublin city.  Only 122 properties or fewer than 9% were advertised at rents of &euro;1,250 per month or less.  That amount is the maximum monthly rent limit for a family with two children in receipt of rent supplement or a housing assistance payment from Dublin City Council.<br/><br/>It is clear that there are a number of actors in the short-term letting market.  There are people who own or rent and list their properties for a few weekends a year.  There are people who list their properties more regularly but retain them as their primary residences and there are those who list properties full-time.  Any attempt to regulate the market must take account of different letting scenarios and motivations.<br/><br/>My colleague, Mr. Gavin Elliott, will continue the presentation.</p></speech>

The city approved new private rental laws allowing residents to occasionally rent their homes for up to two months per year under certain conditions such as the payment of related taxes, including tourism taxes, and special arrangements when neighbours complain.  In addition to Amsterdam attempting to constrain the number of short-term lettings, it also sought to regulate and clean up legal uncertainties within the market.  For example, hosts must comply with health and safety and fire safety rules and a new category of "private rental" was legislated for.</p> <p>  Beyond the issue of supply and demand, there are other issues in the short-term letting market, most of which relate to the legal status of the parties involved in it, such as the legal position of tenants using services like Airbnb without their landlord's knowledge or permission.  It is common for a standard lease to contain a provision that no commercial activity should take place on a private rented property.  It would be understandable and reasonable if a landlord who found out his or her tenants were renting the property on Airbnb said that was a commercial activity and, therefore, a breach of the lease.  Ultimately, it would be a decision for the RTB dispute resolution process, but Threshold would be remiss if it did not caution tenants to reassure themselves of their legal position before listing on sites such as Airbnb.</p> <p>  Similarly, insurance is a vexed issue.  Liability for accidents in Airbnb properties is unclear.  It seems likely that an insurer would not cover a landlord who has a claim brought against him or her by somebody who had rented the property on Airbnb because the insurance would not have been taken out on that basis. Similarly, renter's insurance would probably not be honoured either.  This issue would be considered on a case-by-case basis but there is a nightmare scenario where a landlord who does not know his or her property is being rented out could suddenly be sued by an Airbnb customer claiming that he or she should have known and should have had more control over the property.  That would be up to the courts but this area of legal uncertainty should be examined.</p> <p>  The issue of fire safety was examined in Amsterdam.  It is likely that an Airbnb property would be considered guest accommodation under the Fire Services Act 1981.  A host is required to take all reasonable measures.  In essence, he or she is required to conform with the guide to fire safety issued by the Department.  It is unlikely anecdotally that many hosts are even aware that they are required to do this.  Landlords who rent properties on short-term letting sites for longer periods may be caught by the Property Services Regulation Act 2011.  That sums up much of the legal aspects of Airbnb.  It is not at all clear what position people are in.</p> <p>  The rent-a-room scheme comes under section 216A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  The Revenue Commissioners say it does not qualify for the tax relief under the scheme.  Ernst &amp;amp; Young disagree and its advice to Airbnb is it could potentially qualify.  There is uncertainty again.  That issues boils down to the definition of "residential accommodation".  There are issues, therefore, that go beyond supply and demand and the effect that has on the private rented sector, though they are incredibly important.  There is a need for certainty for everybody concerned - landlords, tenants and customers, who are mostly tourists visiting the country.</p></speech>

I live in County Louth but my office often obtains excellent legal advice from Threshold for people who have difficulties regarding tenancies.  The organisation provides a professional service.  Notwithstanding everything that has been said, particularly by Dr. Lyons, whom I greatly admire and would not dare contradict, members of my family who are single and working live in Dublin city centre.  They lived in accommodation for a year or more but their landlord told them he was going to use Airbnb because he could increase the revenue from the accommodation by 60% from &euro;1,500 per month and they either had to match that or get out.  They had to get out.  They know of many cases of young people being driven out of the city because they cannot afford the rents being sought and they say that Airbnb, notwithstanding its positive aspects, is impacting the rental market.  Would it make sense to prevent Airbnb from listing properties in certain areas, particularly in the city centre or where people work and live or where the company is displacing working people?  That would be hugely important.  Airbnb could be told to keep its listings outside the M50 or whatever zone.  There is less demand for properties in that zone.  This is a significant issue for single people, in particular.</p> <p>  I welcome the comments about tackling the issue of vacant homes.  Unless the Government tackles this, particularly in the areas of greatest need, it will not solve the housing crisis.  If all the new houses in train are built, we will only stand still in the context of meeting demand.  What mechanisms might assist in that?  In the UK, for example, local authorities can double the property tax on a vacant property while the city of Bolton has empty homes officers.  If a property is empty, they actively engage positively with the landlords to encourage them to let them and offer them deals or suitable tenants or tenants for whom they will guarantee the income.  A total of 625 empty homes were commissioned in nine months last year for families to live in.  The city has a population of approximately 200,000.  This was a quick win in a short period.  If that was introduced in Dublin, empty properties could be tackled in a constructive way with the carrot of a grant to upgrade, if necessary, before using the stick.  What views do they have on putting significant pressure on people to rent properties they are not using, which is not their principal private residence or subject to litigation or probate and so on?  That is the key to solving the problem.</p></speech>

Dr. Lyons referred to the housing crisis and the fact that these platforms are not having a huge impact relatively speaking.</p><p>We are not going to solve the housing crisis with short-term lettings, but we are looking at whether it is having an effect on the homelessness crisis which we are facing in Dublin.  Moving on from that, there is a heavy concentration of short-term lettings in areas with high levels of tourism, but at the same time there is a high concentration of homeless people within those areas as well.  While the scale is not big, there are nearly 700 families still living in hotels today, yet there are potentially a few hundred houses available.  They could be available in the areas in which there are destinations popular with tourists.  If we had 7,000 extra bed spaces in Dublin tomorrow morning, how strong would the platform of short-term lettings be?  What impact is the significant shortfall of bed spaces in Dublin having?  Equally we must say that there are 690 families living in hotels and that is also having an impact.  None of us seems to able to get our hands on information regarding the levels of short-term lettings before these web-based platforms arrived.  Is this a completely new phenomenon?  Is the heavy concentration of short-term lettings in areas with high levels of tourism causing a ripple effect which is shoving the crisis further out of the city?  It it driving the shortfall because bed space is taken up in these areas?  Is it having a ripple effect in areas surrounding that sweet honey pot?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.1090" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017062800002#E00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for their submissions.  They are really helpful.  This committee is looking at two issues which are separate but related.  The first is what is the best way, in our view, for the short-term letting sector to be regulated for its own benefit, both in terms of hosts and people availing of the services.  We are also concerned, however, with ensuring that those regulations prevent people from abusing short-term letting platforms or the short-term letting sector to evade existing regulations for commercial landlords and that they prevent any other unintended consequences arising from genuine peer-to-peer home-sharing or short lets.  Those are the two things which we are looking at.</p> <p>  All members of the committee have pretty consistently said that we do not believe that short-term lets caused the homelessness crisis.  That is clear.  I believe most of us would have a similar view, to some degree, to Mr. McCafferty.  At the same time, given the fact that short-term lets are so heavily concentrated in four postal codes in the centre of Dublin - Dublin 1, Dublin 7, Dublin 2 and Dublin 8 - and given that they are often in areas where people at risk of homelessness can get their foot into some kind of lower-cost rental accommodation, we really want to make sure that, in that very defined area, there are not negative spillovers from what is clearly a positive development in terms of tourism and income generation for hard-pressed families.</p> <p>  Obviously Mr. McCafferty will not have data, but knowing those four Dublin city areas as well as Threshold does, is there any anecdotal evidence that there is some displacement from properties that previously would have been commercially rented properties, particularly at the lower end of the market in, for example, Mountjoy Square or Stoneybatter, shifting over into short-term lets?</p> <p>  A lot of the issues Mr. Elliot has raised are really interesting.  Has the Department's working group on short-term letting regulations contacted him?  Is he considering making a written submission?  While that information is really interesting to the committee, Mr. Elliot's input could certainly be of value in the Department's considerations.</p> <p>  From Dr. Lyons's knowledge of how the regulation of the sector for its own benefit has operated in other jurisdictions, what is his preferred model?  I would also like to hear what he has to say specifically on the potential impact on lower-income housing supply in those four Dublin city areas.  The impact of 3,800 lettings across Dublin or the State would be miniscule, but if one was to take 500 or 700 properties and put them all in Dublin 1 it could have a very significant impact in that very defined area.  Is that something Dr. Lyons has look at?  What are his thoughts on it?</p></speech>

We are looking at the possible effects of short-term lettings on the housing market.  There is some anecdotal evidence that it has had an impact but short-term lettings have been there for many years.  It is not something that has happened overnight.  There are a lot of issues around some of the short-term lettings.  There are issues in terms of planning, for example where houses were built with certain conditions attached to them and now we find that some of them are being let out and used by Airbnb and similar services.  The planning issues must be looked at.  Perhaps there should be guidelines in that regard.</p> <p>  We have talked about vacant homes and the witnesses have mentioned accommodation over shops.  One of the biggest issues I have had is with shops which have been left idle for many years.  With a change of planning they could be used, whether for short-term or long-term lettings, and they could be renovated.  The whole country is littered with such shops.  They are in towns and villages in every area.  They are everywhere in my own area of Finglas, Ballymun and Santry.  It frustrates the life out of me because in the Ballymun area they are left idle for ten or 15 years rather than anything being done with them.  They are just left there.  It is absolutely scandalous.</p> <p>  I would like to ask about the Revenue issues and the tourism tax because I am curious.  We probably need a proper register to deal with short-term lettings, whether arranged through Airbnb or otherwise.  Obviously they have to be registered with Revenue, or they are supposed to be in any event.  There must be a proper register.  There is also the issue of using a tourism tax.  Could such a tax be used a bit more because we have lots of people in mortgage trouble who allow people into their houses for extra income?  They do not necessarily register in any way.  It is just a way to pay the mortgage and it has been accepted in a way.  I can understand it.  There has been a huge number of people renting out one or maybe two rooms.  They are in financial trouble.  We do not want to penalise them or make their lives any harder but perhaps there is a way in which we could implement some sort of a tourism tax as opposed to going through Revenue, where we are hitting these people very heavily.  I do not know.</p> <p>  There is a big concentration of short-term lettings in the city areas, but I was quite surprised, when I saw the map for Airbnb, at how many of them were in some of the other areas.  I did not think there were many in my own area but I then found out that there are actually quite a few around the suburbs - Ballyfermot, Finglas, Cabra and all these areas.  Most of the short-term lettings, however, are better suited to being where the tourism is.  That concentration has surprised me.</p></speech>

Deputy O'Dowd spoke about a single person in the city centre to whom the landord says that they can either pay 60% higher rent or that the landlord will move to Airbnb.  This ties into a point he made about the increase in hotel stock.  To some extent the short-term letting sector could be blamed for it being an option for the landlords to switch to short-term letting, but that sector could be taken away completely and the landlord would still be able to say the exact same thing.  If a rent of &euro;1,000 a month was being paid a few years ago, a landlord can now ask for &euro;1,600 a month such is the imbalance between supply and demand.  That is why I made the point about scale.  I am not accusing anyone here of having thought that short-term lettings were the entirety of the problem, but when we think about solutions we could easily imagine a situation where there were not short-term lettings in Dublin and that landlord would still be able to say the same thing - that the rent is going up 60%.</p><p>The main reason is that we have a rapidly growing population with changing demographics and preferences to such an extent that there is huge demand to live in apartments in the city centre.  The census figures indicate that there are about 250,000 one and two-person households in Dublin but only about 125,000 dwellings that would suit one or two people.</p></speech>

With rent pressure zones, that should not be a problem because it could only go up by a set amount.  However, this is far in excess of that and is not controlled because it is not being let.  That is the point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.1095" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ronan Lyons" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017062800002#F00300"><p>That is a fair point.  It raises a second point that came up in some of the contributions relating to how we classify people in short-term lettings.  Deputy Ellis mentioned a register.  In Ireland, in general we are bad at having registers of things.  We do not have a register of who owns what.  We have a partial register, but we do not have a complete one.  The ones least likely to be in there are the empty ones.  We do not have a register of who lives where and do not have a register, for example, of what is catering to tourist demand, however broadly one might define it, versus catering to commercial need or permanent residence.<br/><br/>As Mr. McCafferty said, without the information, it is not possible to make fully informed decisions and we are poking around in the dark somewhat.  This also deals with Deputy O'Dowd's point about vacancy.  Probably the single best thing the country could do to lower the vacancy rates would be to set up registers of who owns what and who lives where.  Then it would be possible to have these empty-homes officers or inspectors who figure out if it is a fair deal house.  I have just moved into a house which I would say was empty for four years.  At no point was it cynically empty; it was just because various bits of the fair deal process and legal process took too long.  They did not need to take that long and therefore it was empty for too long.  Until we get the information to understand why they are vacant, we cannot take the right kinds of actions.<br/><br/>Deputy Casey spoke about the increase in the hotel stock, which I touched upon briefly.  When those hotel rooms come in, I believe it will take some of the Airbnb demand.  I still think there will be a segment that wants short-term lettings.  However, it comes back to the original point that the demand for apartments, particularly in Dublin, is so strong that removing that entire chunk would not have a major effect.  This city needs 4,000 or 5,000 listings a month so adding 7,000 hotel rooms  - I am switching between scales here - would equate to a maximum of a couple of months of rental demand; it is that bad and that is just Dublin.<br/><br/>Deputy &Oacute; Broin spoke about postal areas 1, 2, 7 and 8, which ties into the same issue.  Mr. McCafferty made the point that the problem here is not the short-term letting segment, <i>per se</i>; rather it is the really poor supports for people in need of social housing.  I used to live in Stoneybatter and know it reasonably well.  People in that area might even be squeezed out for Airbnb - potentially we could come up with a rule preventing those becoming Airbnb.  If they are in rental, they would still be squeezed out by people on higher incomes.  There is no support to keep them where they are in a market where rents have increased by 60% or 70%.  The underlying issue is that we gave up on certain models of social housing support and we have not adopted sensible ones to replace them.</p></speech>

Irrespective of whether we decide to introduce a tourist tax, we need to know where the tourists are and what kinds of accommodation would be liable for that.  My preferred model would be to have a class of permanent resident, a class of temporary resident or tourist, and a class of non-resident entities such as a business.  They are not people who live somewhere, but are other forms of organisation.  Irrespective of what it may be, we can learn from best practice in other countries.</p> <p>  Having that defined class would then answer many questions on the legal loopholes and escaping the rent caps by switching to Airbnb.  Someone walking into a legal limbo can probably get away with quite a bit, particularly if there is weak enforcement.  My preferred model would be having defined classes as many cities in other countries do.</p></speech>

I do not want to come down and say that the New York or Amsterdam model is the one to follow.  I would want to look into that a bit more.

This is all about a dearth of evidence.  It is important that we can we build up that evidence from statutory sources, from Airbnb, itself, or from other sources.  Regarding the issue of displacement, rent increases used to be the main driver for people to come to Threshold for assistance and advice.  Since the very welcome aspects of recent regulation with the rent pressure zones and rent certainty, the most common issue people bring to us is tenancy terminations.  Why do we have so many tenancy terminations?  That is the $64,000 question.<br/><br/>I believe the Deputy is asking how much of that has been caused by short-term lets.  We do not have an answer for that, but we have certainly seen a ramping-up in tenancy terminations.  Ostensibly the reasons given include refurbishing the property which is one of the grounds for avoiding the RPZ rules, or tenancies being terminated within the first six months.  I suspect landlords are not getting the rents they would like because of the RPZs in certain parts of the State.  While that is a factor, we would need further evidence to determine how much of that is being driven by short-term lets.<br/><br/>On the issue of people being driven further from the city centre, since the 1980s successive governments have let the market decide our housing policies.  We have gilded the lily in terms of capital expenditure on social housing.  We have not embraced a cost-rental or a mid-market rental as it is called in Scotland.  Institutions to underpin that may be appropriate.  We have mentioned other jurisdictions.  Part of the challenge is that we have relatively weak local government and relatively weak municipal authorities.  Cities such as Amsterdam have very strong municipal authorities to drive things such as affordable rent and mixed rent policies.  Short-term lets are part of myriad processes.<br/><br/>On vacant homes, the one word which is politically very uncomfortable or unpopular is tax.  The only reason that property tax is <i>in situ</i>is that three international bodies came in and called the shots.  We ended up getting something over the line using the Revenue Commissioners.  I come from a jurisdiction where property taxes are actually very high and the average house incurs a tax of &pound;2,000 or &pound;3,000.  People do not bat an eyelid because they know they have a social contract with their local authority.</p><p>We are in a very different space in Ireland.  The use of tax measures to change behaviour with regard to vacant homes can be understated.  The measure would not necessarily raise money.  Rather, it is about changing behaviour so people will decide they do not want to be liable for a property and will put the vacant unit or house back into the market.</p><p> Some of the issues around probate are not about financial measures.  Probate takes far too long.  A small but significant number of units are lying idle because of probate and related matters.</p><p> Bolton was mentioned.  There are strong municipal authorities in the UK.  It is no doyenne, and I would rather look at mainland European jurisdictions to push some of these issues.  Stronger local authorities are able to put resources into an empty homes, offices or other issues.</p><p> A good number of short-term lets are located in Dublin 1, 2, 7 and 8.  There are other forces at play in Dublin 2, including many corporate players.  My understanding is that certain corporate players allow their employees to visit houses for sale or rent at 8.30 a.m., but the rest of us have to view such properties at lunchtime or in the evenings.  That is over and above the short-term lets.</p><p> Some Airbnb hosts may have become renters but never did.  It is hard to prove that fact.  In terms of planning, in multi-unit dwellings house rules are coming on stream.  Many management companies now stipulate that units may not be used for short-term lets.  Such measures are on the increase.</p><p> The Kenny report on vacant sites was published a very long time ago, and successive D&aacute;ileanna have baulked from using tax and legislation to change behaviour.  In effect, private property should be used for the common good.  This has not happened yesterday, today or since the advent of short-term lettings.  I again underline the issue of supply - whether that is social housing or broader housing provision for home ownership, which is equally important - market rents and cost rental.</p></speech>

Within the cohort of Airbnb or short-term rental, hosts have a wide gamut of experiences.  Some people are renting properties for two weekends a year and others are renting for 360 days a year.  Any attempt to regulate the sector will have to take such things into account.  We do not want to discourage those who want to rent out properties for two or three weekends a year when they are away.  We need to regulate those involved in full-time renting.</p></speech>

We discussed vacant homes, of which there are approximately 200,000 across the country.  We have never carried out an audit of the number of vacant shops, which I argue would show substantial numbers.  It would be an interesting exercise.  Just because they are private businesses does not mean they should be treated differently if they are left idle for years.  We could decide on a number of years, such as five, ten or 15 years, and have a system whereby properties lying idle for a number of years would be dealt with.</p></speech>

I understand that in England the empty homes commission &ndash; I do not know the correct name &ndash; profiles the types of properties to which the Deputy referred and decides on how to ensure they are occupied.  It deals with properties over banks, banks which are no longer in business, commercial zones that will never be commercial again and places near ports or railway stations, which are often derelict.</p> <p>  It might help the committee if we invited Louth County Council to come before us.  It has identified empty properties, generally homes, which are boarded up.  If the council cannot identify the owner of a property, it slaps a CPO notice on that property and takes possession within two or three months.  The average cost of refurbishment is less than &euro;100,000.  The council has up to 50 properties in Drogheda and Dundalk, some of which are occupied by families.  That is the sort of initiative we need.  It is a constructive engagement by a strong local authority which works with owners, if it can find them.  If it cannot, it uses the law immediately.  The problem is the sense of urgency which some have and which others do not.</p> <p>  On Airbnb, the greatest good is served by having people on the housing list in homes right now.  I am not suggesting that we ban Airbnb in the city centre, but we need a hell of a lot more inquiring into what is going on.  I understand that other jurisdictions limit Airbnb rental periods to not more than 30 consecutive days in a year.  There is a formula which we can apply that would restrict permanent Airbnb short-term letting, which would be in the public interest.</p> <p>  What other, if any, instrument does Dr. Lyons think could be used to ensure that more vacant properties come on stream?  All of the pluses are there.  Perhaps a grant or new roof would have to be provided, and leases of 20 years duration and so on are possible.  Dr. Lyons referred to sticks.  What would he use to change behaviour in economic terms?</p></speech>

I had noted and forgot to mention the issue.  Part of the reason is that until very recently there was a rebate on commercial rates for leaving something empty.  I understand local authorities now have the option to reduce the rebate.  It is the exact opposite of what we want the tax system to do.  We want the tax system to punish, rather than reward, vacancy.  For me, the obvious answer is a land tax., which would replace commercial rates and apply to publicly and privately owned buildings and land.  The same would apply whether the property was occupied.  It is in people's interests if they own sites or buildings to ensure they are used.  That is also the primary tool I would use to lower vacancy rates, whether it be the same land tax or a reformed local property tax.<br/><br/>I understand, from a legal perspective, that taxation of assets on the grounds of nature of use is slippery.  We may end up in the Supreme Court on that point.  Giving per person tax credits is straightforward.  We already do it for income tax.  A property tax which was much higher on paper, but was actually the same tax for a standard family based on the occupancy or nature of the house, would, <i>de facto</i>, punish people.  People would have to apply for tax credits that lowered their property tax bill if they lived in a property.  If nobody lived in a property, the owners would face a much higher property tax bill.  That would be a way of getting around some of the legal issues.  It is the most important stick.  People respond to financial questions.</p></speech>

In the UK  it takes a matter of weeks, rather than months, to carry out inspections.  The UK has a special procedure whereby if one fails an inspection one can get another one very quickly.</p></speech>

We see this as a welcome opportunity to outline Airbnb's views, share some data of relevance to the committee's deliberations and ensure that we and our community are well understood.  I am Patrick Robinson, Airbnb's director of public policy for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and I am accompanied by Natasha Mytton-Mills, the policy manager for Ireland and the UK.  As we answer the committee's questions, Natasha will be best placed to talk about the details of our engagement with authorities here in Ireland while I can assist the committee with understanding some of the wider context in Europe and around the world and also Airbnb's overall approach to policy.</p> <p>  Ireland is Airbnb's international home and we are extremely proud to be part of Ireland's thriving tourism industry.  Our host community across Ireland welcomes a growing number of visitors from right around the world, providing an authentic local Irish welcome to guests.  The opportunities presented by new forms of travel and tourism are significant.  As the committee considers the potential impact on housing, it should balance that against other pressures in Ireland's biggest city such as the increasing shortage of guest accommodation which results in high prices for travellers and may affect Ireland's strategy to grow its tourism industry and attract major events such as the rugby world cup.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland predicts that Dublin's visitor numbers will have grown by between 13% and 34% between 2015 and 2020, which is between 760,000 and 2 million new guests travelling to and within Dublin each year.  Capitalising on underutilised space in Dubliners' homes could provide a sustainable, efficient and economically beneficial alternative to using valuable land to build new hotels.</p> <p>  I turn to the specific topic under discussion today.  As many others have already said to the committee, the phenomenon of short-term rentals in Ireland is not a new one.  Ireland has had a long tradition of non-hotel accommodation and non-professional hospitality.  Online marketplaces like ours have added a new dimension to this existing activity, making it easier for people to share their homes and allowing for greater levels of transparency, safety and quality.  The rapid growth of this new sector in the tourism market challenges long-established frameworks in tourism and housing law.  Unlike many other cities and countries in Europe, Ireland lacks an up-to-date regulatory framework which clearly recognises home-sharing as a distinct kind of short-term rental activity.  The data we have provided to the committee in our written submission supports the picture of Airbnb as a platform dominated by everyday people sharing their homes.  At last count, in fact, 88% of our hosts in Dublin say they are sharing their primary homes.  We have focused much of our submission on Dublin since that is where much of the public and political debate around housing has concentrated.  We have also shared some data, however, on our community in rural and regional Ireland also.  We appreciate that there are policy considerations right across the country, not just here in Dublin.</p> <p>  I digress for a moment to definitions.  It is important for the committee to understand the key concept that has cropped up a few times in submissions from other stakeholders.  When they create listings on Airbnb, hosts are asked whether accommodation is going to be offered to a guest as an entire place, a private room or a shared room.  Looking at the total number of entire home listings in any given area is not necessarily an indication of impact on long-term housing.  Very few of those listings would likely be available for long-term housing in the absence of Airbnb.  The vast majority of these homes are places where Dubliners already live which means there is no simple or accurate conclusion to be drawn on the availability or affordability of housing in Dublin from a headline number of entire homes.  The committee has heard from other contributors that they agree with that analysis.  The data we share in our written submission supports that claim too.  In 2016, a typical Airbnb host within, roughly, the administrative area of Dublin City Council earned &euro;5,000 and hosted for just 51 nights.  In more suburban and rural areas, those numbers are lower.  Looking at County Dublin as a whole, 3,838 entire home listings were booked at some point in 2016, some 85% of which were rented for fewer than 161 nights.</p><p>Only 16 entire home listings were booked for more than 320 nights.  A fuller breakdown of those numbers is in the submission and I look forward to discussing them with the committee.  Moreover, 85% of the entire home hosts in County Dublin, that is, hosts who have an entire home listing, only have one such listing.  Looking at the Airbnb platform on 1 June 2017, 1,432 hosts had only one entire home listing.  Just 36 hosts had more than five, and that includes people who are managing properties on behalf of others.</p><p> If the aim of new planning guidance is to ensure long-term housing is not lost to short-term rentals, a key piece of analysis already referred to in this session is identifying the point at which short-term rental might become more financially attractive to a landlord than long-term rentals.  This number is somewhat higher than many assume.  Our preliminary analysis, and we want to see more work done on this, suggests that this tipping point can be up to circa 185 days per year, depending on the neighbourhood.  In 2016, only 550 entire home properties were booked via Airbnb for more than 160 nights.  To put this another way, these account for just one in every 1,000 housing units in County Dublin.</p><p> We have participated in independent studies of housing impacts in a number of global markets, most recently in London and Berlin.  Experts have consistently concluded that the size and pattern of the Airbnb community has no significant impact on long-term housing costs, especially when compared with other more powerful factors.  The Government has said it wants to clear up the position for professional operators with some clear guidance over when planning permissions are required.  We welcome that approach.  At the opposite end of the market, however, we see this as a great opportunity to clarify the picture for people using the home they live in to welcome guests on an occasional basis.  As the representatives from Threshold pointed out earlier, these home shares currently exist in what is quite an uncertain framework.  We welcome a policy framework that would clear things up for them.</p><p> Ireland is not unusual in considering its response to the growing collaborative economy.  We have considerable experience in working with governments across the world to look at how new regulations can be designed and applied to these new forms of accommodation, and we welcome the chance to talk about the approaches adopted in other places.  Some of these have already come up today.  Platforms such as Airbnb can play a role in helping users understand and follow rules, but ultimately, self-regulatory action needs to be underpinned by clear policy goals which are set by Government.</p><p> We note that Airbnb is not the only player in this market.  As I have noted, Ireland has a long tradition of non-hotel accommodation.  There are a number of other global platforms which are also active in the Irish accommodation market.  The short-term rental sector is diverse and Airbnb is not necessarily representative of all of it.  As the joint committee continues to consider this topic, and as the Government and Dublin City Council consider clarifying the planning rules, there should be a focus beyond Airbnb alone.</p><p> Given this committee's focus on housing issues, we have not gone into detail about many other aspects of our business such as the steps we take to keep hosts and guests safe or our obligations to report host earnings to the Revenue Commissioners.  We would be happy to discuss any of those issues today or to provide supplemental evidence to the committee members if they believe it to be useful.</p><p> I reiterate that Airbnb is committed to working collaboratively with Government, in Ireland as elsewhere.  We have already worked to conclude more than 300 agreements with governments around the world and look forward to looking closely with the Government, city councils and this committee as these discussions progress.  We look forward to addressing any questions and we thank the committee members for their attention.  I hope we will be able to provide useful information.</p></speech>

Before asking some questions I will just outline our own position.  As I mentioned when I met Ms Mytton-Mills earlier this year, we are not against short-term lettings or home sharing.  We support the concept, partly because of the benefits for tourism and partly because of the benefits for the hosts themselves.  We think it is good for the city.  Having said that, I made the point at the previous meeting that I am not a cheerleader for the more benign presentations of the collaborative economy.  That is not to say I am against the idea, but I sometimes think people gloss over the fact that many of these business models, be they Amazon, Uber or Airbnb, were created because very smart business people saw gaps in the regulatory regimes and, as all business people do, went in to profit from them.  I have no difficulty with that, but like many other European capitals, one of the things we are trying to do is play catch-up to ensure the sector is properly regulated to do exactly as Mr. Robinson outlined.</p> <p>  The real issue of concern to those of us who have been raising this matter over the past year is not with the person who shares out, either his or her home for a number of weeks in the year when he or she is away for work or holidays, or a room during the course of the year.  That person is not the target of our deliberations.  Our concern is whether people, knowingly or unknowingly to Airbnb, are abusing the platform either to make more money in ways we think to be inappropriate or to avoid tax, building standards or fire safety regulations.  The problem is, however, that we do not know if this is happening here because we do not have the data to tell us.  In some ways we should perhaps have had the Airbnb representatives in at the very start of the meeting.  I am sure they have read the discussions from the earlier committee.  Many of our conversations concerned whether or if there could a problem and the fact we do not know the extent of it.  That is our difficulty.</p> <p>  I ask questions today in the hope that the witnesses can clarify whether and to what extent we have a problem.  Even if we do not have a problem, the very fact there are very clearly problems in other European states makes it important we get in now to regulate and prevent them.  I appreciate the detail of the data Mr. Robinson has given us, but they do not answer some of the questions that I put both to Ms Mytton-Mills when I met her in January or that I submitted to Airbnb by email just last week.  I am interested in what I call units of accommodation.  By this I mean self-contained units in the form of a house, an apartment or a granny flat, to use one of the examples used by Mr. Robinson in his presentation.  Of the self-contained units on the Airbnb listings, or entire home listings as Mr. Robinson calls them, how many are not the primary residence?  This is an important point for us to know because it is an important distinguishing factor.  How many of these are in multi-unit developments?  Of all these, how many are available, as opposed to let, for a full 12 months?  How many are available for between six and 12 months and how many for between two and six months?  This for me is how we identify whether there is a problem.  We clearly do not have an issue if 95% of the lets are only available for a limited number of months in the year.  This is the categorisation I am interested in.</p> <p>  I would also be interested to hear what the regulations would be if it were up to Airbnb itself to write them.  This was not completely clear from Mr. Robinson's presentation.  Of the models operated under by Airbnb's sister companies in other jurisdictions, which would the witnesses prefer?  Which would they like to persuade us of?  Mr. Robinson referred to this briefly, but I would also like to hear a more detailed response to Mr. Gavin Elliot's earlier comments on some of the legal grey areas in the Irish legal system.</p> <p>  Mr. Robinson mentioned a number of jurisdictions where things are going well for Airbnb.  He did not of course mention the two jurisdictions where things are not going so well, namely, Barcelona and New York.  I listened to the Barcelona housing manager at a conference in Dublin last week and he offered a very different presentation of the company's very specific difficulties in the city.  According to him, Airbnb has been hit with a fine of &euro;600,000 there.  I know that there is probably an intention to appeal or challenge this.  The company has been having real difficulties in New York city for more than a year and fines have started to be issued to hosts.  The most recent one was, I believe, a fine of $5,000 for a set of issues.</p> <p>  While the witnesses present a very positive business model and willingness to engage, the company is clearly having real difficulties in two of its largest markets.  Is it that the people running Airbnb in those two cities are not as friendly, co-operative and collaborative as our witnesses today or is there something else going on here?  I would like to hear the witnesses' responses to these matters.</p></speech>

Working in the tourism sector myself, I know the value of the traditional bed and breakfast in earlier times.  What we are looking at here is the impact on housing and specifically on the homelessness crisis.  Like Deputy &Oacute; Broin, I am not after the person sharing a room or sharing his or her house when he or she is away on holidays for a weekend or for a week or two.  That is not who we are after here.  We are trying to get to the bottom of the issue of entire properties being rented out on a long-term basis.</p> <p>  We also need to define the difference between booked rooms and available rooms.  Coming from the tourism sector, I would be delighted if I could have 100% occupancy tomorrow morning.</p><p>When Mr. Robinson refers to 161 nights, that property could have been available for the entire year but only achieved a 50% occupancy rate.  This is a key point we need to stress.</p><p> We have been informed that Airbnb provides data to Revenue on its income.  How does it provide those data and what information do they contain?  I have never tried to register with Airbnb, but does it have a registration fee and is it paid a percentage of the booking fee?  Is that the information that is given to Revenue?</p><p> We have been told that Airbnb is working with the Department to develop a memorandum of understanding.  What is the likely outcome of that?</p></speech>

I wish to clear up a few points.  Mr. Robinson stated that there had always been a significant rental market in Dublin.  While that is so, there has never been a housing crisis like the one we have now.  Therefore, we have a greater burden to ensure that whatever properties are available for significant periods ought to be family homes or for people who need to live in them for work or other purposes rather than for tourists.  Notwithstanding everything Mr. Robinson says, that competition is creating a burden on our society.</p> <p>  Airbnb's rents are not subject to rent control and I believe they cannot be.  I was shown information, but I cannot relay it exactly because I do not have access to my emails right now.  A Scottish company was offering double the market price for houses in Dublin and claimed it would do everything and the money would flow into owners' accounts.  It is happening.  Houses that are available in Dublin city are being hoovered up by attractive ads and incomes, but many of them are family homes.  I object to that.  We need controls on Airbnb in areas where housing needs are not being met and the market is being abused, albeit not by Airbnb.  I appreciate that Airbnb is there on business, but people are getting much higher rents through it while displacing others who need houses as homes.  There is no control over that.</p> <p>  I have read about the issues concerning short-term letting.  We should set a maximum letting period in certain zones of 30 or 40 days per annum beyond which the accommodation cannot be let.  We are dealing with what Deputy Casey spoke about, namely, a person who is on holidays for a couple of weeks and making a few bob from his or her vacant house.  That is fine and we have no problem with that, but Airbnb is competing with families who have nowhere to go.  That is not accusatory, it is just a fact.  We need to control where Airbnb can operate within city limits and where there is a defined housing crisis.</p> <p>  We must ensure Airbnb's rents meet rent pressure zone demands.  In other words, what applies to a rent pressure zone should apply to Airbnb's lettings.  That is where the problem lies and is why people are being kicked out.  I understand that single young people who cannot live in Dublin because they cannot pay the rents are moving out of the city.  I do not know whether others who are present have experience of that among their families, friends or communities, but it is real.  I am concerned about it.</p> <p>  Regarding short-term lettings, I do not know whether other jurisdictions place obligations on Airbnb, but we should make ours as strict as possible where there is a significant housing need and, where there is none, relax them completely.</p></speech>

If it uses a form, what does that entail?  I assume it registers everyone using that form.</p> <p>  Mr. Robinson has heard our points about houses not necessarily having the required planning permission.  Does Airbnb cover that area?  Does it use student-specific accommodation?  Such accommodation received planning permission for a particular reason.  In some cases, it can be lying idle for a time.  What sort of people are involved normally?  Do many people use Airbnb as a business or is it mainly used by ordinary people who want to share their homes and get a small surplus?  What is the ratio?  How does Airbnb deal with management companies in apartment blocks and elsewhere?  Must it make representations to them?  Does Airbnb have designated inspectors to visit properties and determine that they are up to standard and everything is running smoothly in order that anti-social issues, in terms of which one often finds problems, do not arise?</p></speech>

What details does Airbnb use to verify that individual hosts do not have multiple properties under different accounts?  How does it verify that?  In his written submission to the committee, Mr. Parkinson wrote that professional lettings could, under certain circumstances, be putting pressure on supply in specific areas of the most housing-constrained cities.  What evidence does he have in that regard and are they putting pressure on the market in Dublin?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.1118" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Robinson" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017062800002#K00500"><p>Since I am used to a format where I am asked one question at a time, forgive me if I skip anything.  I am sure we will cover everything as we go.</p> <p>  I will start with Deputy &Oacute; Broin's questions.  The question of what kinds of property are on the site is a complex one.  We do not know the status of a property that someone lists on Airbnb.  We can see from patterns of usage whether a property looks like it might be someone's home.  The data we have provided the committee show that the majority of properties are booked for such small amounts of time that someone is likely to be living in them.  To my knowledge, there is no definition in Irish law of when something is someone's primary home.  That definition exists in many other places.  In France, for example, someone's primary home is where he or she lives for eight months of the year.  In the UK, it is based on a series of circumstances to do with where a person pays tax and votes and typical patterns of occupancy.</p> <p>  One of the issues we are facing is that, once people start considering specific definitions, they need to get more precise.  For example, what is a short-term rental?  In some countries and cities, a short let is anything less than 30 nights.  In other places, it is more than that, for example, anything less than 90 nights.  We also need to develop a shared understanding of what we mean by "primary home" or "short let".  That will enable us to start examining how we as platforms and the whole industry can begin acting on that evidence.</p> <p>  Regarding the question on multi-unit developments, we do not know what the properties are.  Clearly, we have an address.  There are approximately 3 million places to stay on Airbnb tonight.  There is a great deal of information about them that we do not have, but we know what hosts are declaring when they list.  For example, they declare whether a property is an igloo, tree house or apartment.  Due to the way in which our platform works - I will address the matter of standards and vetting in a moment - if guests are not getting what they expect, feedback is usually bad.  Therefore, the host is either removed or suspended because there has been a mismatch between what the guest has been promised and what has been delivered, or the host gets a bad review score and moves down the search results.</p><p>There is much that we do not know and the work of the working group could well drive us towards much better information about who is using these platforms, why they are using them - that is another question that arose - and in which properties they are using them. <br/><br/>The question on availability versus bookings is very interesting.  In the traditional hospitality sector, occupancy is easy to measure, whereas in our world it is incredibly difficult to measure.  One of the issues we have with some of the sites that look at our website, scrape off the data and publish it, for example,<i>insideairbnb.com</i>and <i>airdna.co</i>, is that they look at a host's calendar.  One of the features of the Airbnb site is that hosts keep their calendars up to date and indicate when their places may or may not be available.  Two things arise from that.  First, when a calendar is blocked it does not mean the host has a booking but probably means the host is at home and the property is, therefore, not available for booking.  On the other side, just because a calendar indicates that a property may be available, it does not mean the host will accept a booking in the relevant period.  This can be a source of some frustration to guests who try to book places that turn out not to be available.  We try to ensure that hosts keep their calendars up to date.  <br/><br/>Availability does not necessarily tell us anything about the nature of the property that is being shown to us.  I am also unaware of any other jurisdiction, certainly in my patch, where the operating framework refers to how often one makes something available as opposed to how often something is used.  Everywhere that we have an experience - night limits or intensity thresholds - they are typically about bookings rather than availability.  Some of this is related to the fact that it is far easier to measure bookings than it is to measure availability.  I caution against disappearing down a rabbit hole around availability.  Bookings are a much more appropriate way of looking at intensity of use. <br/><br/>On the issue of Barcelona and New York, I am much more <i>au fait </i>with the position in the former than in the latter.  Barcelona faces a challenge which, on the surface, many places would love to have, namely, it is incredibly popular as a place to visit.  Since the Barcelona Olympics in 1992, there has been a humongous boom in tourism in the city.  The rise of cheaper flights and new accommodation has meant that Barcelona is a fantastic and very popular place to visit.  The regional Government of Catalonia and Barcelona city hall are trying to find policies to manage tourism effectively.  One of the decisions they took a couple of years ago was to squeeze demand by cracking down on supply.  They have drastically limited the number of licences they offer for professional accommodation in the city and stopped building new hotels.  As somebody stated, there is still tonnes of demand and this is met by other forms of accommodation.  The conversation Airbnb is having with the Catalonian Government and Barcelona city hall is really about how we distinguish, much as the committee is trying to do, between professional operators which should be licensed and home sharers who are contributing to the solution to the Barcelona tourism issue by housing tourists in existing accommodation, driving them away from the central tourist zones and accommodating them in other areas.  The disagreement we have is that the ideas on the table tackle the professional end very vigorously but do nothing to protect casual home sharers.  That is why we have a disagreement that continues to this day.  I am still extremely optimistic that we will resolve that disagreement before long because Barcelona's reputation as an innovative city is beginning to suffer as a result of its dogmatic attitude towards this topic.  I totally understand the issue and I was in Barcelona last week for meetings.  It is a unique case and there are not many commonalities, particularly given that the authorities in Barcelona are dealing with tourism law rather than housing law.  If members wish me to follow up on the position in New York, I can do so but I am afraid I would probably make up much of my reply. </p></speech>

We recognise that the growth of this kind of accommodation presents some questions and challenges and creates some issues, some of which existed long before Airbnb existed while others were intensified or created by the arrival of new forms of accommodation.</p> <p>  I do not know what is the position on student accommodation.  It would not surprise me if some landlords who accommodate students during term time are using some vacant periods to host tourists.  We see that relatively frequently with long-term landlords who may have a void period between tenants and frequently seek to use this period for two or three nights at a time before another long-term tenancy commences.  </p> <p>  As to what types of people use our platform, we see from the data that people all over the city are using spare space in their home or their entire home when they are not there to make some additional money.  A typical host makes &euro;5,000 per annum and hosts for an average of 51 nights.  The reasons they host are not only financial.  When we speak to our hosts, as we do frequently, they usually tell us they started hosting because it presented an economic opportunity but they came to like the experience of meeting new people, showing off their neighbourhoods, of which they are very proud, recommending local businesses and shops and helping people to understand what it is like to live in this city.  There is a very committed and genuine community of people doing this, notwithstanding scepticism about our business model and values.  When one spends time with our host community one finds its members are incredibly engaged, very passionate about what they do and not backwards about coming forward when they believe we are letting them down.  They genuinely believe they are providing a great service to this city and they are very proud of it.</p> <p>  Working with management companies is a big issue that we face around the world.  Looking at the number of policy challenges and challenges to existing legal frameworks, the landlord-tenant relationship is an obvious issue and one which we are thinking hard about.  We have a team of people who have started some pilot programmes in the United States and we expect them to start working in Europe before long, although the two markets are very different in nature.  The programmes are on how we can work directly with management companies to give them transparency about what is going on in their buildings, potentially give them a cut of some of the revenue that is being made in their buildings and provide them with information and tools they can use in order that they can more confidently allow activity in their buildings at a volume that is allowed by law. </p> <p>  A question was asked about where burden of regulation should lie.  The central questions for the Government are what does it want to allow and not allow and what does it want to allow given certain conditions.  The planning rules here are very unclear.  Even specific cases that are pointed to as proof that planning permission must be required given certain circumstances do not necessarily present precedents for other things.  Now is an opportune time to ask what is the definition of a professional letter in Dublin and where should the right balance lie.  Where some cities fall on this spectrum is that they want to permit all of the non-professional activity, do not want to permit any professional activity and will not grant any professional short-stay licences.  I do not believe Dublin is in that place.  There are lots of established short-term rental businesses in Dublin that are providing a great service which people want.  The question is what else should be permitted.  Where can we draw the line and how can we make clear to hosts where this line is in order that they know, as they approach that line, what they then need to do.</p> <p>  I am heartened that there seems to be consensus that the vast majority of our host community is engaged in the type of activity that does not present concerns.</p><p>We genuinely believe that clear regulation is good for our host community and good for our business.  It does not currently exist in Ireland and this is why we are part of this conversation.  I hope I have managed to deal with the question.  I shall ask Natasha to address the issue of what we believe the likely outcome of the memorandum of understanding process shall be.</p></speech>

He has a job to do.  The point is that people who are working and who have families are being displaced because their tenancy is legally up and they are told to get out or pay an excessive amount.  The excessive amount is because the properties can go to Airbnb.  While we cannot control that, it is because it is a short-term let, these guys just cannot pay and they have to get out.  I could write to Mr. Robinson about the details.</p></speech>

Clear and fair regulation of the short-term rental sector would play a very strong role in preventing that kind of outcome.  Looking at short-term rentals in isolation versus the situations that apply to long-term rentals also may lead one to take certain steps and make certain choices that have some knock-on consequences there.  With regard to the issue referred to by the Deputy, the previous speakers from Threshold and Trinity College spoke a lot about what else would be going on in the market if short-term rentals did not exist at all.  It sounds as though the level of pressure in Ireland is such that there could be negative outcomes regardless.  I hope that I can assure the committee that this is not the outcome we seek from this process.</p></speech>

Hosts keep 97% of the money they charge.  If a person lists his or her spare bedroom tonight they can list the space for &euro;100 and keep &euro;97 of that.  As a guest I will pay &euro;106.  Airbnb takes a cut from the host and the guest.  The fee is 3%, which is actually quite low in comparison to lots of other short-term rental platforms.  It is one of the reasons why we have become quite successful.</p></speech>

This goes to a point that was made earlier by the representatives from Threshold and Trinity College Dublin; the tax position for short-term rentals in Ireland is pretty clear and straightforward.  The Revenue Commissioners have determined and decided that the rent-a-room tax free allowance does not apply in this regard.  This has been done on the basis that Revenue believes it is for longer-term stays and not short-terms stays.  This goes back to the point that Revenue has not provided any definition of the difference between a long stay and a short stay.  We would value some clarity on the matter.  The Revenue Commissioners have the data they need to ensure that the correct amount of income tax is being collected.</p></speech>

We need to get to the figures around availability because this would give the true indication of how often that property is actually available for short-term lettings.  If I had a property registered with Airbnb tomorrow morning, can Airbnb track if I put my availability up or down at any stage, whether it is booked or not?  Can Airbnb track that availability?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.1140" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Robinson" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017062800002#M01900"><p>We can see when a host has declared he or she is available for booking.  That does not mean the host is going to accept all of those bookings.  In some cases, for example, a host could decide to make their calendar available on the basis that if they got a booking the host could go and stay at a girlfriend's flat instead.  Or, they might not be keeping their calendar up to date.  This means that when somebody tries to make a booking they are told "I am sorry it is not available".  Availability and occupancy is very complex for Airbnb to track.   We are talking about individual human beings who are switching on and off their calendars.  Sometimes they would deactivate their listing completely.   They might decide that they are done for six months, they are going to be in their property for a while and not take any more bookings.  The listing becomes inactive and people cannot find it anymore.  Some hosts like to keep their listing active.  On the off chance they get a booking they might choose to go on holiday that weekend because it would be quite lucrative for them to have a guest then.  It is actually quite a dynamic picture, which is why whenever we have got to talking turkey with governments about how to figure out who is doing what, nights booked is a much more accurate depiction of what is going on as opposed to what could potentially be going on.</p></speech>

That is where we need to get.  Nobody here is concerned about genuine people who are just sharing their rooms or homes.  We need to get to the properties that are let longer term.  Mr. Robinson is telling the committee that this data is available.  If the Department wanted to extract my information tomorrow morning around how often I made my property available in a given year, Airbnb could give this information to them.</p></speech>

We know that guests like to know, when they send inquiries to hosts, that there is a decent chance their reservation is going to be accepted.  Hosts get to decide completely what they do.  They get to decide how much they charge, how often they host and who comes and who does not come.  Yes, we could drive hosts to be more accurate about how often they are available.  It goes back to the point that if my empty property in Dublin is made available for a long period and I am going to base my pattern of usage around when I think I might get guests, that is not necessarily a property I would have rented long term.  It might just sit empty the rest of the time.  All I am saying is that availability numbers do not necessarily lead us to a meaningful picture.</p> <p>  Demand in Dublin is really high.  If hosts make themselves available, the chances are that they are going to get booked.  Airbnb has very, very strong demand in Dublin.  The likelihood that one would find properties that have availability all year around and never take a booking is pretty low.</p></speech>

I must declare that I do not use my property on Airbnb.  If I wanted to rent out my property for the 161 days has Airbnb access to finding out that data?  If Deputy Casey is renting his property out for 161 days and tomorrow takes in Natasha, can Revenue, Airbnb, or anybody, tell me if that property rented out for 300 days that year?  This would be irrelevant for how many people or for how long, it would be the nights it is used.  Then we can determine if it is being used.  Alternatively, what happens if I break my contract after 161 days and I go back in on the 163rd day, therefore it is not long term?  We are trying to extrapolate how many nights the one property is being rented.  Is it the case that Airbnb really has no way of verifying whether it is being rented by the same tenant or by multiple tenants?</p></speech>

I forgot to answer a question that was asked earlier.  I am very bad at this.  Under the process we use, users of the site upload Government ID and we verify that it is a legitimate-looking ID.  We are constantly increasing the level of security we provide.  We are using new tools to make sure we know people are who they say they are.  As a result, when someone chooses to stay with Natasha, she knows that her guest is who he or she says he or she is.  The Chairman asked how we track properties that have the same basic ownership, but show up as two separate properties.  If someone has a property and that person's husband or wife also has a property, we have ways of identifying that they might be linked in that way.  Quite often, the payout method will be similar.  It will be possible to match underlying information about the actual address.  I am not going to go into huge amounts of detail because we do not talk about how we track fraud.</p></speech>

Many stays will be short.  A host in London who has lots of short stays might accommodate a business traveller who comes to town and needs somewhere to stay for three months.  As such, a three-month stay would not count as a short stay, different rules would apply to it.  This is sounding very complicated but I do not mean it to be.</p></speech>

I appreciate that an Airbnb host will not know at the start of the year how many nights he or she will want to let for.  If someone wins a holiday on a radio show, for example, he or she might decide that rather than having an empty house for a week, it should be put up on Airbnb at the last minute.  I get that completely.</p> <p>  I suppose I want to propose a couple of things.  Mr. Robinson is right when he says there is no legal definition of a "primary residence".  While that is the case, there is nothing to prevent Airbnb from asking somebody who registers as a host to state whether the property they are letting is his or her primary residence.  It is a straightforward thing.  As Airbnb could not verify that, it would have to take people on trust.  Nevertheless, it would be really valuable information and it would not cost Airbnb anything to get it.</p> <p>  According to last year's An Bord Plean&aacute;la ruling, specified planning permission is needed if the property is actually available for the full year.  The difficulty with Airbnb's inability to answer the questions I asked earlier - Mr. Robinson said he does not have the data - is that it does not know whether any of its hosts are in breach of the An Bord Plean&aacute;la ruling.  I absolutely appreciate Mr. Robinson's point that when those renting out their properties move away from full-year availability to availability for part of the year only, there is ambiguity because of the lack of a definition of "the short term".  I suggest that Airbnb, as a platform, surely has a responsibility - even within the limited regulatory framework we have - to want to know if anybody is in breach of the An Bord Plean&aacute;la ruling, which is the one bit of legal clarity we possess.</p> <p>  I appreciate Mr. Robinson's optimism with regard to the Barcelona case.  The housing manager of Barcelona city said last week that he does not share that view.  He was very upfront about his stance.  Obviously, this stuff is being carried widely, particularly in the British press.  Essentially, Airbnb is being accused of allowing a significant number of people who are not legally compliant to advertise on its platform.  It has been claimed that this issue affects approximately 7,000 of the 16,000 lets in that market.  Mr. Robinson wants to convince us that he is a responsible business person who wants to engage with us.  He is doing a very good job of it so far.  The doubt I have is that in one of Airbnb's most profitable markets, 7,000 of the people it allows to use its platform are not compliant with the law.  I accept that Airbnb might not like the law and might not think it is good for its business, its hosts or the tourism economy.  It has been suggested, however, that 7,000 hosts are in breach of the law.</p> <p>  The State and the authorities have a responsibility to ensure that there is enforcement.  Barcelona is now doubling its number of inspectors.  As a responsible business person, Mr. Robinson has to live up to that.  My point is that it is really important to get the Government regulations right.  We all agree we want regulations that work for people who are contributing to the economy, including the tourism economy.  There is nothing wrong with people generating income for themselves.  We want to make sure there is no abuse of the system.  We want to ensure there are no unintended consequences.  I think that is where we stand.</p> <p>  If Airbnb is not willing or able to give us the data, or to amend its collection process to be able to provide data that let us know definitively whether we have a problem, we are still in the same position we were in two weeks ago before we began holding these hearings.  We just do not know.  I am not necessarily looking for an answer.  I want to propose something.  When officials from the Department appeared before the committee, we asked them what data the Department is getting from Airbnb.  I would like to repeat my final parting comment to the officials.  I said to them that if I was on their side of the discussions with Airbnb on the memorandum of understanding, I would ask it to find a way of providing the data which the Department would really like to have and which Airbnb cannot currently provide.  If that information were provided as accurately as possible, it would demonstrate good faith and would enable us to produce a set of regulations that work for everybody.</p> <p>  Of course saying that something is available all year does not necessarily mean it really is available all year.  We would like to have a better picture of the number of short-term lets by comparison with the number of commercial landlords.  I am not against a commercial landlord who wants to provide a short-term letting.  We have academics who come to Trinity College for three months.  They need somewhere to rent for three months.  I accept that short-term letting is part of the picture as well.  I am a little disappointed that data which I think would allow us to know whether there is a problem are not available.  I would have thought it is in Airbnb's interests to put that information on the table.  If Airbnb does not have it, I suggest it should find a way of acquiring it so that it might be put on the table.</p></speech>

In the interests of making sure guests to know what they are getting, we seek to ensure properties are accurately described.  We ask hosts to provide significant quantities of information about the spaces they are renting out.  Guests do not necessarily care whether they are staying in somebody's primary or secondary home.  They want to know what kind of place it is.  To my knowledge, we have started to ask new hosts for more information about the nature of the properties they are listing.  We ask them whether they live at those properties for some of the year, or whether they do not live there at all.  We are beginning to gather that information.  As there are 3 million properties that come on and off the site, it will take time to get full information from everybody.  We already ask a large sample of hosts to elaborate on what they are doing and what they are using.  We have already shared that information with the  committee.</p> <p>  Some 88% of Airbnb hosts in Dublin say they are renting the homes they live in.  The data we have shown the committee about bookings show that this is not wildly inaccurate.  We cannot map that information on top of the other information because we have not surveyed every single one of the thousands of hosts whose properties were available on 1 June last.  By engaging in a process of interrogation and discussion with a body like the working group, we can begin to build up a picture and figure out what data exist.  Crucially, we can also look at the data other people have.  A week ago, I did a random search on a well-known booking site for a place to stay in Dublin for a weekend in September.  I found 350 properties listed on the site.  Some of them will also be available on Airbnb and some of them will not.  We are in the room and we are providing lots of information to those who ask for it.  I question whether others are doing the same.  I urge the working group to get as much comprehensive information as possible.</p> <p>  I would like to finish what I was saying in response to the point that was made about the authorities in Barcelona.  Members will not be surprised to learn that we disagree with their interpretation of the law.  We think the law - as written - they are trying to enforce against us is contrary to European law.</p><p>That is working through the courts right now and we expect that to take some time.  What has been seen in places such as Amsterdam, London, Chicago, New Orleans, Hamburg and countless other places around the world is that where we find an alignment between clear rules, our platform and what we can do in partnership with hosts, we can end up delivering a really great result for cities and a great result for us.  These kinds of comprehensive deals that result in taxes being collected and devoted to causes such as homelessness, refugee charities or whatever it might be, plus clarity about what happens at the professional end and some certainty and privacy for people engaged in short-term activity, are where we can end up.  This is why we have been debating the MOU.  We have never seen the MOU as a substitute for regulation - far from it.  What we have tried to secure with the Government is a position that primary homes, places where people live, should be subject to a different set of rules from planning.</p><p> I also challenge the idea that the ruling Deputy &Oacute; Broin is talking about has much precedence elsewhere.  The board was pretty clear that it is based on the facts and circumstances of the particular property in question in the particular area in question.  Planning law is absolutely discretionary.  It is about whether a change of use has taken place and whether it is a material change of use, and every circumstance is different.  We face this situation in a number of places.  We have had the same discussions in Toronto in recent years, and we have had the same discussions in London.  If we can find some guidance that provides clarity and states that an entire home in a certain area in respect of which the intention or the activity is the receipt of bookings for a certain amount of the year should be subject to planning, at that point we can begin looking at all the data we can see, all the work we can do with hosts and solutions to the effect that we start putting the host in a funnel towards planning permission or some other form of change of use or declarations that allow us to get consent to share information with the cities.  We can be very creative about this, and that is where we have been with the MOU, but they must come up with some clear frameworks for us to interact with.  Is there anything else Ms Mytton-Mills wants to add on this?</p></speech>

I think we share the same aim as the Department and the committee, that is, to understand what is professional and when permission is needed.  Equally, we can then go away and work out, as Mr. Robinson said, the correct solution for our platform and the way we can interact with it.  The aim is, therefore, very much aligned.  Regarding the likely outcome of the MOU, we really hope it will get to a stage at which we can have clear, fair rules that we can simply put out to the host community for it to be able to follow.  Equally, we can find a solution that the platform can automatically align with those fair and simple rules.  Those are the key things we are looking forward to achieving and which we have been doing for many months now.</p></speech>

When someone is registering his or her property, are the same questions asked irrespective of the country one is in?  Can registration be tailored in such a way as to require the host to state whether the property is his or her primary residence or an additional property?  Do the members have any other questions?</p></speech>

Does Airbnb get clients vetted by the Garda?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.1166" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Robinson" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017062800002#O00700"><p>I will answer Deputy Ellis's questions first because he asked them the first time around and I did not answer them.  No, we do not vet guests or hosts.  In the United States, we run some background checks on hosts and guests because those data are readily available.  We are looking to expand this process as we can access more and more databases in a free and open way.  As an Irish company, we are subject to EU regulation on things like sanctions, money laundering and fraud, which means we check identities against watch lists, sanctions databases and all kinds of other tools and mechanisms that allow us to weed out people who really should not be on the platform.</p> <p>  Deputy Ellis asked about inspections earlier.  We do not inspect properties, but the way the system works means that guests and hosts review one another after each stay.  I stayed in an Airbnb property last night.  I will leave an okay review of the property.  The shower was not great and I will let the host know that the shower was not particularly fantastic.  I hope the next guest will have a better shower than I did this morning.  However, the bed was very comfortable and I will let people know about that.  This is a pretty effective self-regulatory mechanism regarding how quality and standards are set, but where guests bring properties to our attention because they believe they are not safe or there are particular issues concerning how it was described, we can take action.  We have 500 people sitting here in Dublin and another 800 in Cork who are more than capable of taking action against hosts who are not providing a great experience to guests.</p> <p>  To answer the question of whether we can share data and whether we would, we can do a number of things.  We must recognise that we have a balance of statutory responsibilities in this regard.  One concerns data protection and ensuring there is a proper legal basis when we share names, addresses and personal information.  The new General Data Protection Regulation that will come into force next year is even tougher about how we share information.  What we can do, and what we have done in other places, is gradually increase the friction for guests whereby as they begin to host more intensively, we can nudge them in certain directions.  In the case of London, for example, where there is a limit of 90 days before one needs to get planning permission, we are suspending entire home listings after 90 nights.  If one wants to host for longer, one needs to make a declaration that one has sought planning permission and that information can be shared.  Whether that is the right approach here is up for debate and discussion.  In other cases - for example, in some of the US cities where the privacy laws and the dynamics are different - we can interact with the registration system instead.  We look forward to looking at any number of possible options here in Ireland.  The threshold question is the threshold itself, that is, where those numbers should be set and where it is justifiable for those numbers to be set in a way that balances the need for tourist accommodation and the need to protect housing.</p> <p>  One other question was asked which I have completely forgotten.  I think it was from the Chairman.  Did I answer it?</p></speech>

That said, we have implemented slightly different user flows in certain places because things like consumer rights legislation are different or because there are specific laws governing the kind of information hosts need to declare.  For example, in France, the host ticks a box that states the property in question is his or her primary home.  We all know what ticking boxes does - the answer is not a huge amount - but that is what the law requires so that is what we do.  The general data we collect about the quality and services are the same in every country because our guests travel all around the world and they need to know the same things as they go.</p></speech>

Under certain circumstances, could professional lettings be putting pressure on supply in specific areas?  Most of the housing constraint is in the cities.  What evidence do the witnesses have in this respect?  Do they believe this is putting pressure on the market in Dublin?</p></speech>

I can say that the most recent study we did in London, which was designed to answer exactly that question - "Is this having an impact?" - looked area by area.  Those who carried out the study could see that at some point in the future if growth continued with no effective regulation in place, there might be an impact on housing, but they could not identify any today.  They found that if we put in place a few steps to stop that happening, there would continue to be no impact.  I would find it hard to believe Dublin is any different in this respect, but let us see.</p></speech>

We did fund it partly, but we are often in a quite tricky situation here.  In order to demonstrate that something is or is not the case, research is required.  Others do not necessarily always have the resources to do the research so we often have to contribute.  In doing so, we make sure the process is incredibly independent.  We had quite a robust exchange of views with the Institute for Public Policy Research, IPPR, about some things on which we vehemently disagreed.  Ultimately, they were looking at our primary data.  We gave them access on an anonymised basis to the information they needed to do that study.  What came out of the research reflects their views.  Every instance in which we have referred to that report and every way we have framed the research has been with their approval and in a way they would accept.  We would encourage others to do the same.  We have done similar surveys in other places.</p></speech>

Deputy Clare Daly will be with us momentarily; she had to go to the D&aacute;il Chamber.  I ask everybody present to please switch off all mobile phones as they interfere with the sound recording system in committee rooms.  Before we commence, I indicate to members that we will go into private session again to discuss a very brief matter at the conclusion of this particular public session.</p> <p>  The purpose of today's meeting is an engagement with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, to discuss the manner in which the Government recently nominated the former Attorney General, Ms M&aacute;ire Whelan, to fill the vacancy on the Court of Appeal.  I welcome the Minister and his officials to the meeting this afternoon, which is the Minister's second with us today.  I record our thanks to him for acceding to our request.  The format of the meeting is that the Minister will be invited to make an opening statement which will be followed by a questions and answers session.  I am obliged in the normal course, but very especially in the circumstances of the matter under address, to caution members they should be aware that under the salient rulings of the Chair, members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House, or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  </p> <p>  Before we begin, I give members a cautionary reminder that the Judiciary is independent under the Constitution and the Oireachtas has always respected the separation of powers.  I request all members, therefore, to be measured in their contributions and to uphold the principle of mutual respect between the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Judiciary.  While this does not preclude debate or raising the matter of the process and manner of a new judge's nomination and appointment, members should not stray into the areas of a judge's personal qualifications or suitability for any given position.  I ask members to refrain from making remarks that reflect on the professionalism or competence of a member of the Judiciary.  I now invite the Minister to make his opening statement whereupon I will give members the opportunity to ask questions.</p></speech>

This very independence is guaranteed by Article 35.2 of the Constitution which provides that judges are to be "independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and subject only to this Constitution and the law".  The appointment of judges to our courts is of fundamental importance to the administration of justice.  We are most fortunate that we have in Ireland a strong, independent, impartial and well respected Judiciary.  The Irish Judiciary has served this country extremely well and, as I stated in the D&aacute;il last Wednesday, it is now and has always been one of the great successes in our history.  Members of the committee will be aware the matter has been discussed in depth over the past two weeks, having been addressed by the Taoiseach during Leaders' Questions on 20 June and 21 June 2017 and during a two-hour debate held in the D&aacute;il on 21 June 2017.  I have nothing new to add to the information provided last week other than to continue to underline what has been said a number of times by the Taoiseach and others about the appointment of Ms Justice M&aacute;ire Whelan to the Court of Appeal that we have appointed a suitable person who was appropriately qualified using procedures that were at all times correct.  That being said, I emphasise that judicial appointments are made, in accordance with Articles 13.9 and 35.1 of the Constitution, by the President acting on the advice of the Government.  This constitutional function cannot be transferred or delegated.  It is a normal feature of Government in common law jurisdictions.</p> <p>  On 5 January 2017, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board sought by public advertisement applications from practising barristers and solicitors eligible for appointment to the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal, High Court, Circuit Court and District Court.  A vacancy for an ordinary judge of the Court of Appeal arose following the retirement of the honourable Mr. Justice Garrett Sheehan on 23 March 2017.  In response to a request from the then Minister for Justice and Equality, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board reported on 16 May 2017 that it was not in a position to recommend a person for appointment to the vacancy in the Court of Appeal.  I remind the committee that section 20 of the 1995 Act provides that all proceedings of the board and all communications to the board are confidential.  From time to time in the past, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board has reported that it is not in a position to recommend any candidates as suitable for appointment as a judge.  The Government, in nominating a person to the President for appointment to judicial office, is not limited constitutionally to the consideration of the outcome of an appointments board process but is obliged under the 1995 Act to first consider the names of any persons recommended by the appointments board, something which did not arise in this instance since there were no such recommendations.  The Minister for Justice and Equality brings a recommendation to Government in the same way that any other Minister would make a recommendation on appointments to important public roles in the area of Government for which they are responsible.</p><p> At its meeting of 13 June 2017 Government decided to nominate the then Attorney General, Ms M&aacute;ire Whelan, Senior Counsel, for appointment as an ordinary judge of the Court of Appeal in accordance with Article 13.9 of the Constitution to advise the President on appointments to judicial office.  The Government acted entirely within its constitutional powers and responsibilities in making this nomination.  I wish to point out that successive Governments have nominated judges since the foundation of the State.  Furthermore, several Attorneys General have been appointed directly to the Bench, as might be expected given their seniority and expertise as the senior law officers in the State.</p><p> On 19 June 2017 Ms Justice M&aacute;ire Whelan was appointed by the President as a judge of the Court of Appeal.  I wish to remind the committee that Government, in making the decisions necessary to nominate people for judicial appointments, is performing a profound function under the Constitution and one which is at all times fundamental to our separation of powers and to the maintenance of independence and public confidence in our Judiciary.  The effectiveness of the performance of this function by successive Governments has been illustrated by the extraordinary quality of the Judiciary and the public respect in which the relevant people and their independence are held.  Indeed it would not be appropriate to comment any further on specific nominations to judicial office, which are decisions made by the Government and subject to Cabinet confidentiality under Article 28.4.3o of the Constitution.  The Government has sole discretion under the Constitution to nominate persons of its choosing, providing they are qualified and eligible for appointment as a judge.  In this case, a suitable person who was appropriately qualified was appointed to fill a judicial vacancy lawfully using a process that was at all times correct.  I have no doubt that Ms Justice Whelan, having regard to her qualifications expertise and extensive experience, will make a valuable contribution to the work of the Court of Appeal.</p><p> Where existing judges of the High Court or any other court put forward expressions of interest in a vacancy to the Attorney General all such submissions are considered and are treated in a confidential manner for obvious and good reasons.  While of course such expressions of interest are always considered, constitutionally, the Government cannot be bound by any such expressions of interest in exercising its prerogative to advise the President on a judicial appointment.  It is in accordance with the law and the Constitution for the Government to nominate a person to the President to be appointed a judge of any court.  This of course includes the Court of Appeal, providing the person is eligible and qualified.  It is also in accordance with the law and the Constitution for the Government to nominate for appointment an eligible and qualified person who is not already a judge, even if there are existing judges who have expressed interest in the appointment.  As stated on several occasions in recent times, the Government is satisfied that all necessary procedures for judicial appointments were followed in the appointment of Ms Justice M&aacute;ire Whelan to the Court of Appeal.  I am satisfied that Ms Justice Whelan will make a valuable contribution to the work of the court.</p><p> I wish to briefly turn to the Government's commitment to significantly enhance the judicial selection model.  The Bill dealing with judicial appointments is winding its way through Second Stage in the House and will come before the committee shortly.  Among other issues, the Bill deals with the matter of the promotion of serving judges, which is currently outside the remit of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  Members of the committee will be aware of the process.  I look forward to engaging extensively with the committee at the earliest opportunity subject to the scheduling of the Bill by the committee.</p><p> I wish to comment on matters germane to the current debate.  An important feature of the new Bill is ensuring that the process for judicial appointments is open, fair, transparent and accountable and that it promotes diversity.  At the same time the protection of the principle of judicial independence remains central.  The Bill will reduce the number of suitable candidates proposed by the commission for each vacancy to three from the stipulated minimum of seven in the current system.  The Bill provides the commission with 13 members.  I figure all members of the committee were in the Chamber last evening and I imagine Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile is, as always, well-briefed on the issues to hand.  More important, as far as the new commission is concerned, merit is provided for in the new legislation as the criterion for selection and recommendation.  Subject to that, the Bill provides for the objectives that the Judiciary should be equally comprised of men and women and that it should reflect diversity across society and within the population.</p><p> I looking forward to hearing the observations of the committee in the coming period and dealing with any outstanding issues that members may believe have not been addressed.  I will do so in accordance with the long-standing principles for debate and discussion of issues under consideration.</p></speech>

I agree with the Minister that it is important for Members of the Oireachtas to respect the separation of powers.  The three organs of government, the Judiciary, the Legislature and the Executive, must respect each other.  Of course there are responsibilities on each of those organs as well to try to hold other organs to account.  The reason we invited the Minister before the committee was because we, as members of the Legislature, want to hold the Executive to account for a decision that was made on 13 June last by the Executive.  Fortunately, we will not be straying anywhere into the judicial arm of government in our questioning, nor should we.</p> <p>  In the time of the Minister in government, how many times has the Government nominated a lawyer to judicial office without that lawyer being recommended by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board?</p></speech>

It has always been the case that the personal privacy of applicants, for obvious professional reasons as well as, dare I say, commercial reasons, is maintained.  I am not going to depart from that practice now.  This approach is essential to the maintenance of the independence of our Judiciary, which is highly valued, not just by me but all members of this committee, in the context of the separation of powers and our democratic institutions under law.</p></speech>

As I said by way of public comment last week, it is my hope that every Member who has an interest in the issue will have an opportunity to make a contribution during its passage through the House and I will not pre-empt "whens" or "ifs" as far as the matter is concerned.</p></speech>

Given the Minister is prepared to make comment on her suitability and her qualifications, it is fair to ask the following question: is it of concern that the Fennelly commission saw fit to ask her back four times due to contradictions in her evidence and that Mr. Justice Fennelly concluded in the interim report that he did not believe her version of events?  Is the Minister still prepared to stand over his statement?  Did the Minister read the Fennelly report?</p></speech>

I ask him to exercise the greatest care in the construct of his questions.  We have to recognise, and we have to respect, that the former Attorney General is now a member of the Judiciary serving on the Court of Appeal and that the separation between ourselves and the Judiciary is something that we must respect.</p></speech>

I will not comment on what kind of job she will do as judge.</p><p>I will not stray into that, but the Minister raised the issue of her suitability before she became a judge as to whether she was appropriately qualified.  We read the Fennelly report and her role in that is shocking.  I do not even want to go into the Siteserv or the children's referendum aspects.  I am not talking about her role as a judge now.  The Minister raised her suitability and her appropriate qualifications before she was appointed.  Does the Minister have no concerns about the Fennelly report in particular?</p></speech>

That is not the case.  I am going to comment on the suitability of the candidate.  As far as I am concerned, the Attorney General was an entirely suitable candidate.  I refer the Deputy to section 4 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act of 1961, as amended by the 1995 Act, which deals with the question of qualification, eligibility and suitability.  In terms of the decision of the Government to nominate the current Attorney General to office, it is clear that matters such as the significance of her experience as Attorney General and constitutional and legal adviser to Government were important considerations lending considerable weight to the provisions of the 1995 Act.  Further, I refer to the skills and expertise of the Attorney General in providing advices over a number of years, in very difficult and challenging circumstances, to the Government of 2011 to 2017 in terms of the economic, social and political issues it faced.  She provided advice on a diverse range of matters-----</p></speech>

I am trying to avoid the situation because I do believe that we need her.  That is my personal belief.  As Chairman, I have to ask the Minister to hold at that particular point, as in fairness I have already asked Deputy Wallace.  The address today is primarily in regard to the methodology and I ask members to please assist me with that.  I return to Deputy Wallace.</p></speech>

It is pretty much accepted that public trust and confidence in politics in Ireland has been eroded over a number of years.  Would the Minister agree that the manner in which the Government has handled the appointment of M&aacute;ire Whelan to the Court of Appeal has further eroded public trust and confidence in the way we do politics?</p></speech>

I hope I will not ask questions that other members have asked already.  If I do, I can read the Official Report later.  I have a couple of brief questions.  First, we know the Chief Justice and the President of the Court of Appeal wrote to the former Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice and Equality last October asking for the Court of Appeal vacancies to be filled.  They were told at that time that there would be no new appointments until the new legislation and procedures were put in place.  What changed between October of last year and last week that allowed an appointment to be made under the old system in these circumstances, particularly given that the courts were about to go into recess?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.1290" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="16:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017062800002#G00700"><p>It was not the old system.  It was the current system, and the system that still obtains.  My understanding is that there was some public comment on the matter of considerable pressures being brought to bear on the court by way of a number of vacancies not being filled.  Although I was not party to any such discussions, I understand that certainly in the public arena a certain anxiety was raised that perhaps some outstanding appointments would be made, and I understand that some of those were duly made.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.1291" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="16:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017062800002#G00800"><p>That is the precise point I am making.  I called it the old system.  We can call it the existing system, but it was precisely that system that the Chief Justice was told last October would not be used to implement any new appointments, yet between October and last week, something happened.  I am wondering if the Minister has any knowledge of what that was because the Government, the Cabinet or whoever took a different tack by using this method.</p></speech>

That was the issue around which the subsequent debate took place.</p></speech>

How many were appointed outside of the JAAB process in the lifetime of this Government and the previous Government, or even earlier?  I can only ask the Minister to account for this Government's term of office.  Since 2011, how many people have been appointed outside of a JAAB recommendation, apart from current judges who are obviously excluded from that process?</p></speech>

I again refer to the current constitutional prerogative wherein Government makes these decisions in accordance with the law.</p></speech>

In terms of the letter of 16 May in which the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board states it would not make a recommendation, the Minister's answer to the question asked by Deputy Chambers was not clear.  Was the then Attorney General a signatory to the letter or was she involved in any way in that decision?  What role did the she  have in that process?</p></speech>

Under the 1995 Act, the proceedings at the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board are confidential.  This is provided for in the Act and I am not in a position to provide Deputy Daly with the detail of what transpired or was undertaken or discussed or the manner of the discussion at the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, including who was present, who signed the letter, who spoke and who did not speak.  In accordance with the law, I am precluded from discussing this issue.  In addition, I do not have any knowledge of such proceedings.</p></speech>

I am wondering what happened in the period between the letter from the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board going to Cabinet on 16 May and the statement at the meeting of 13 June in which the Government decided to nominate the then Attorney General to the Court of Appeal.  I would like a little more information about how that came about or what steps took place between 16 May and 13 June.  Did the Attorney General turn up at the Cabinet meeting to be informed that the Cabinet intended to nominate her to fill a vacancy?  Was she asked if she would like the job and did she respond that she would be delighted to take the job and thank the Cabinet?  Who initiated the discussion on such a fundamental career change for the then Attorney General?  Did someone ask her whether she would like the job or did she offer herself for the job?  How did it come about that the nomination was made on 13 June?  What steps occurred in the period between 16 May and 13 June?</p></speech>

The Government is entitled to nominate a person of its choosing provided two conditions are met, namely, that the person is eligible and available in accordance with the law and that the person is qualified.  The matter was given appropriate consideration in accordance with the law.  As I stated in response to Deputies' questions, under the strict rules of Cabinet confidentiality, it is not possible for me to enter into any discussion of any form of the detail other than to assure members that the appointment took place fully in accordance with the law.</p></speech>

I am not asking the Minister to divulge what happened at the Cabinet meeting.  He indicated a memorandum arrived at the Cabinet meeting nominating the then Attorney General for the position.  I am trying to find out what happened before that and how the name came to be submitted.  Did the applicant go to the Minister or did the Minister go to the applicant?  Was it a marriage of convenience because the real game in town was to get a new Attorney General to suit a change of leadership in the Fine Gael Party or was it to do with the position?  If I were sitting at a Cabinet meeting and someone nominated me for a new job, I presume I would have been told beforehand that I would be nominated, as otherwise how would anyone know if I was available for the position?  Who contacted whom between 16 May and 13 June?</p></speech>

As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I do not have any knowledge of any issues that may or may not have been discussed between 16 May, when the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board wrote to the T&aacute;naiste noting that the board had decided not to recommend any applicant for the vacancy, and the subsequent act of 13 June.  I was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on 14 June.  I would never be involved in any deliberations on any of these issues, nor would I have any expectation to be involved in such deliberations.</p></speech>

We are left with this gaping hole in that we do not even know how the nomination came about.  It is clear that I will not get an answer to my question.  I do not want to stray into the issue of qualifications but the Minister referred to the person being eminently qualified.  Would the fact that the person in question does not have any experience as a trial judge not be a point of concern?  Does the Minister accept that among the legal profession and Judiciary there was a view that a precedent had been set, albeit relatively recently given that the Court of Appeal is a relatively new court, in that no non-High Court judge had been appointed to a the Court of Appeal previously?  Does he accept, therefore, that there was a presumption among potential applicants that the role would be filled by a High Court judge and that this was a reasonable expectation considering it had always been the case, even if the court is relatively new?  Would that not be a fair assumption to make?  Would this presumption and the particular nature of the job not have stayed the hand of people who would otherwise have been interested in applying for the position?  They will have assumed the only people who would be appointed to the court would be High Court judges.</p></speech>

However, in fairness to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality  I can point to an answer she gave in the House when she was asked if she had discussed the vacancy in the Court of Appeal with the former Attorney General prior to 23 May.  She stated categorically that she did not discuss the vacancy and I accept that statement.</p> <p>  On the matter of forming assumptions, in the circumstances it would be unwise and unfair to the process if I were to make any assumptions about issues that may or may not have happened other than to say once again that practising barristers who are not already members of the Judiciary have been appointed in the past to the superior courts.</p><p>The Government, and I as a member of Government, were concerned about the matter of availability and eligibility to serve and about the question of qualification.  I was satisfied that, in the discharge of my duties and in the circumstances, both of these conditions were adequately met.</p></speech>

I am not going to keep going around in circles but could I have some clarification on a point I may not have heard right?

There is no information to enlighten the committee as to what happened before 13 June, which was when the Court of Appeal nomination was made.

I am going to put you forward for this job."  One would know even by the body language of the person and if they had never heard of the nomination before, they would be floored.  Clearly the matter would have to have been discussed beforehand and it would be helpful to know who approached who, but I appreciate that we will not get the answer to that today.</p></speech>

Again, I come back to the constitutional and legal point that the manner in which these appointments are made - under current law and under the current Constitution - is on the advice of Government to the President as to the appointment of a person who is deemed after due consideration to be both qualified and eligible.  This is the key issue here in terms of the decision-making process.  If the law wishes to be changed in that regard, I too am a Member of the Legislature and there are issues that may have to be addressed in the wider arena of a constitutional referendum, but it is something over which I do not have any immediate control.  It may be an issue that this committee, at a future date, might engage in by way of recommendation to Government or Parliament or otherwise.  I am satisfied that I and my Government colleagues act within the current law and that we have acted in a manner which is entirely consistent with the law as is currently stated.</p></speech>

I have a busy schedule and I note what the Chairman said about the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan.

The whole purpose of the grouping is to seek to clarify that the Bill applies to a wider group of disputes rather than only those in which civil proceedings have been issued.  We feel that the use of the word &quot;proceedings&quot; is likely to cause confusion for the public and for the mediators themselves and could give rise to a belief that in order for the protections of the Bill to apply, proceedings will have had to have been issued.  It is to try to clarify some of those points.  I know the Minister has tabled amendment No. 3 to change the definition of proceedings to civil proceedings that may be initiated before a court.  What I am asking the Minister to clarify here is that this amendment means that the Bill applies to any dispute in which there is a potential to litigate, that the proceedings do not have had to have been issued.  Could he clarify that in the context of this amendment and what kinds of disputes he thinks would be excluded from the provision?  Notwithstanding the Minister's amendment, the argument remains that for the avoidance of doubt in the public's mind, a &quot;dispute&quot; is better than &quot;proceedings&quot;.  It heads off any potential confusion.  This is a critically important Bill as far as we are concerned.  We want to encourage people to use mediation as an alternative to court.</p><p>We do not want people thinking it has to go through the courts process.  There are situations in which this could cause irrevocable damage, for example, a dispute between neighbours.  If somebody starts litigation it is very hard to come back from that and go into a mediation process.  We want people to know they can get to mediation before the issue goes to court and that they can have an early intervention to de-escalate things.  In that sense, I think "dispute" is a better word.  I know Deputy Wallace has "dispute" rather than my wording, which is "civil dispute".  I am open to that argument.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the contribution of my predecessor, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Fitzgerald, on this legislation.  I hope we can advance matters today and set a date for future progress also.</p> <p>  Following publication of the Bill and Second Stage discussions, my Department received a number of submissions on scope-related issues.  It was felt by some that section 3 was so structured as to create an impression that the Bill would apply only to civil proceedings and not to disputes which had not reached the stage of proceedings.  That, of course, is not the intention.  My Department has held discussions with the Office of the Attorney General, the Courts Service and mediation groups, including the Mediators' Institute of Ireland, in an effort to find a wording that would ensure the Bill&rsquo;s provisions would apply to disputes in the civil law arena.  I believe we can reach accommodation on the issues raised by Deputy Daly in her amendment.</p> <p>  In amendment No. 3, I propose to replace the definition of proceedings in section 2 in order to remove the reference to section 3 and to make it clear that "proceedings" means "civil proceedings which can be instituted before a court".  Using that phrasing will resolve the issue raised by Deputy Daly.  In amendment No. 5, I propose to delete section 3(1), which specified that the Bill applied to any civil proceedings.  The title of the section will be changed to "Scope" instead of "Application".  In amendment No. 8, I propose to delete the words "any of the following".</p> <p>  The net effect of these amendments is to make it clearer that the Bill will apply to disputes as well as civil proceedings.  I am aware that amendments Nos. 1, 4, 6 and 7, tabled by Deputies Daly and Wallace, are designed to bring about the same effect.  I hope, subject to the agreement of the committee and of the two Deputies, that the amendments I have tabled will address adequately the issues they have raised.</p> <p>  As regards amendment No. 9, the position is that following further discussions with the Office of the Attorney General, it was accepted that the exclusion of proceedings before a tribunal under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts 1921 to 2011, a commission under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, or a committee under the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013, as provided for in section 3(2)(f), does not arise and, in the circumstances, might be removed.</p></speech>

We note the Mediators' Institute of Ireland was concerned that if the confidential nature of mediation was to be in any way undermined, parties to a dispute would be less likely to use mediation as a process to resolve their dispute.  It is probably necessary to include references to confidentiality in the definition of mediation and also to extend confidentiality to third party participants and oral communications.  It has been recommended by the Mediators' Institute of Ireland, the Law Reform Commission and the Law Society that a reference to confidentiality be included in the statutory definition of mediation.</p></speech>

The bedrock of mediation is trust.  That is going to be undermined if confidentiality cannot be guaranteed.  Parties may not be willing to speak openly if there is a risk that some of the material could be used later in potential litigation.  The whole purpose of mediation is to resolve disputes through an open forum.</p> <p>  The Mediators' Institute of Ireland points out that communications between parties made with the intent of settling judicial proceedings have traditionally been protected by the courts and by common law in terms of the "without prejudice" privilege.  Statements contained in a document marked "without prejudice" or made verbally on that basis in a genuine attempt to settle a dispute cannot be used to undermine a person later on.  This process is about trying to avoid litigation.  If the parties are genuinely trying to resolve a dispute, they need that protection.  It is there anyway in court proceedings.  It is important to say that "without prejudice" privilege also has limitations.  The party relying on it must show that the dispute existed at the time of the communication and that legal proceedings had commenced or the communication was in contemplation of litigation.  It is not enough that the communication concerns a matter in dispute for the privilege to be upheld.  There must an indication of settling the dispute in that sense.</p> <p>  There is a well-accepted value to confidentiality in the resolution of disputes and it has to be spelled out in these provisions if we are to woo people away from the courts into an alternative channel.  The Law Society of Ireland, Law Reform Commission and the Mediators' Institute of Ireland all say this is fundamental and I think it has to go into the body of the Bill.</p></speech>

It is very important that mediations remain confidential, not just between the mediator and parties involved but also to any individual who is brought into the mediation process as an expert or whatever.  The whole process must be recognised as being confidential.  We were going to table an amendment to this effect on Report Stage but since Deputies Daly and Wallace have proposed it now, we will be supporting their amendment.</p></speech>

My experience with both Deputies is otherwise.</p><p>I am happy to hear the submissions.  Discussions on amendment No. 10 should have regard to later amendments, Nos. 28 and 31.  I would draw the attention of Deputies to section 10, which sets out in some detail the confidential nature of the process of mediation.  I do not believe it is strictly necessary to amend the definition in the manner suggested by Deputies Wallace and Daly, but in the spirit of compromise and with due deference to the submissions from Deputies Wallace and Daly, I am willing to accept the amendment.  We will have to adjust the punctuation for the purposes of the readability of the definition, but I am happy to accept the amendment from Deputies Daly and Wallace.</p></speech>

I appreciate the point raised by Deputy Wallace, and indeed the intention behind the amendment, but I really do not see a pressing need for it.  Having regard to section 10 already dealing in detail with the issue of confidentiality, the committee will also note that I have tabled amendment No. 29 for later on, which will further strengthen that section.  It will also serve to clarify that all statements, including oral statements, in any form of mediation, must fully respect the concept of confidentiality.  This will also cover any general explanation of the reasons of the mediator for withdrawing from a mediation.  I accept what Deputy Wallace is saying.  I do not take issue with him, but I believe it is unnecessary for the actual construct of the Bill.  I ask him to accept that and not to press the amendment.  In the context of his reflection, if we complete matters today, I am open to having this issue revisited on Report Stage.  I do not see the necessity.</p></speech>

The subscribed Code of Practice shall incorporate, in full, the terms of the Code of Practice published by the Minister under <i>section 9</i>of this Act.  The mediator may incorporate additional terms; however, any such terms shall not conflict with the terms of the Code of Practice as published under <i>section 9</i>&rdquo;.</blockquote> <p>The amendment is recommended by the Mediators Institute of Ireland.  It would argue that the Bill, as it is, fails to deal with the regulation of mediators.  Without regulation, anyone can claim to be a mediator, and the mediators to whom the courts refer people should be regulated.  The change will help give people a qualified mediator who subscribes to a specific, not just any, code of practice.  As the Bill stands, the mediator could subscribe to any code of practice he or she devises.  Without such an amendment, there would be no standardisation and the code of practice would be non-binding on mediators.  The Mediators Institute of Ireland and the Law Society have expressed concerns about this.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.1417" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017062800002#D01600"><p>There is a large bunch of amendments in the grouping so I will seek to micromanage them, but they all deal with the mediators' code of practice.</p><p>As Deputy O'Callaghan said, my amendment No. 14 is a slightly different version of Deputy Wallace's amendment No. 12.  At present, section 8 holds that &quot;the mediator shall, prior to the commencement of the mediation ... furnish to the parties a copy of any code of practice to which he or she subscribes&quot;.  Therefore, it is proposed that mediators be able basically to write something on the back of a napkin as long as they say it is their code of practice.  My first amendment seeks to place an obligation on the mediators to subscribe to a single code of practice, changing &quot;any&quot; to &quot;the&quot;.</p><p>My second amendment is linked with this in that it provides that all mediators' codes of practice &quot;shall incorporate in full ... the code of practice prepared and published [by the Minister] under <i>section 9</i>&quot;.  During Second Stage debate on the Bill, even Government backbenchers made the point that there is no point in the Minister publishing a code of practice for the conduct of mediators only for mediators not to be obliged to follow it.  It does not make any sense.  In this sense, section 9 is undermined by section 8 in that mediators do not have to sign up to the code of practice and, therefore, all of the good aspirations in section 9(2) about ethical standards being observed and continuing professional development can basically be junked by a mediator who is empowered to design his or her own code if he or she so wishes.  Given that we were discussing in the House last week the regulation of other professional bodies, we need regulation here, and the mediators themselves want it.</p><p>I note that the Law Society said it was very disappointed that proportionate and appropriate regulation of mediators has not been given a statutory basis in this Bill.  Any amendments to do so would probably be outside the scope of the Bill at this stage.  It is particularly against this backdrop that I urge the Minister to accepts these amendments.  My amendment No. 23 is an effort to plug the gap in this regard pending full statutory regulation.  These amendments, if accepted, would at least require mediators to sign up to a code of practice with certain crucial provisions set by the Minister and would require that the code of practice also incorporate training requirements for mediators, a provision that is absent from the Bill at present.  Without this, I believe we are heading into very dangerous territory.  It leaves people seriously exposed to ending up potentially in the hands of rogue operators to be exploited, which we absolutely do not want.  This is important and, as I said, even Government backbenchers made this point during the Second Stage debate.  Amendment No. 15 is linked into this in that it places an obligation on the Minister to prepare and publish or cause to be prepared or published a code of practice for mediators.  At present, it is only an option for the Minister, which is not good enough.  It should be a requirement.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 20, 22, 23 and 25 are another little grouping within this grouping and, again, they seek to tighten things up regarding the code of practice.  At present, the code of practice the Minister may draw up may include provisions concerning continuing professional development, ethical standards to be observed, the determination of costs and fees and so on.  What we seek to do with this amendment is to place an obligation on the Minister to include all of these provisions, but not just these provisions.  It can go broader than them.  The amendment does not limit the Minister to these provisions but it does oblige him to deal with them.</p><p>Amendment No. 23 obliges the Minister to include education and training requirements for mediators in this regard as well.  This grouping, obliging the Minister to put certain things into the code of practice, is very reasonable and I believe it is supported by the profession itself.  Against the backdrop of our trying to professionalise many of these standards, the grouping is more than welcome.  In deference to amendment No. 23, my amendment No. 25 then seeks to remove the item in the list of things to be included in the code of practice regarding procedures to be followed by mediators in the conduct of mediation.  I am seeking to remove this on the assumption that amendment No. 23 will be accepted.  We would be tying the hands of mediators too much if we were to keep that line in the context of the other provisions I mentioned.  We do not want to micromanage what mediators do in primary legislation, and that is not the intention of these amendments, but the option is always there for the Minister to include recommended procedures to be followed.  However, requiring mediators to sign up to procedures that must be followed in primary legislation is too much.  That can be dealt with by statutory regulation.  The aim is to try to overcome some of the shortcomings in the mediators' code of practice.</p></speech>

I invite him to address the grouping.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.1419" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017062800002#E00100"><p>This group of amendments deals with the issue of a code of practice for mediators under section 9 of the Bill.  As regards section 8, I am unable to accept amendment No. 12 in the name of Deputy Wallace and amendments Nos. 13 and 14 in the name of Deputy Daly.  Amendment No. 12 proposes to amend section 8(1)(c) in a manner which would require a mediator to furnish the client with a code of practice which would not only incorporate a code of practice published under section 9 but could also incorporate additional unspecified terms.  While the amendment provides that any such additional terms should not conflict with the content of the code of practice under section 9 it is difficult to see how this could operate in an effective manner in practice.  It would present practical difficulties and so I am unable to support it.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 also seek to amend section 8(1)(c) by substitution of the word &quot;any&quot; with &quot;the&quot;, but that implies that there can be only one code of practice for mediators.  That might present a difficulty.  There may be more than one code of practice for mediators depending, perhaps, on the subject matter of a dispute which might be going to mediation.  For example, amendments 16 to 19, inclusive, to section 9 while mainly technical in nature contains a proposal for the development of a code of practice dealing with the involvement of children in mediation.  I see a potential conflict in what is proposed by Deputy Daly, although I do not believe it is intended.  To amend section 8(1)(c) in the manner proposed would not have the effect sought by Deputy Daly and it could, in fact, be unduly problematic.  </p><p>Amendment No. 14 also seeks to require a mediator to furnish to a client a code of practice which would incorporate a code of practice published under section.  I am unable to accept this amendment for the reasons already outlined in regard to Deputy Wallace's amendment.  </p><p>Amendments Nos. 16 to 19, inclusive, are technical in nature.  They relate to the possibility of there being more than one code of practice for mediators.  This must be acknowledged.  </p><p>Amendment No. 26 proposes the insertion of a new provision allowing a code of practice to contain details of procedures to be followed by mediators in the conduct of a mediation involving consultation by a mediator with a child.  This amendment follows on from a recommendation from the Law Reform Commission in its report on mediation and conciliation regarding the voice of the child.  The commission recommended that where a mediator considers it appropriate to involve a child directly in a mediation, the mediator must obtain the consent of the child and must provide adequate facilities for that specific and special purpose.  My Department has discussed the manner in which this recommendation could be progressed with the Legal Aid Board and the Mediators&rsquo; Institute of Ireland and the consensus reached was that the best way to achieve the objective is to ensure that the voice of the child is included in a code of practice made under the Act.  </p><p>The intention behind amendment No. 15 in the name of Deputy Daly is, I believe, to make it mandatory for the Minister to prepare and publish a code of practice for mediators.  I cannot accept this amendment as it ignores the possibility, specifically provided for in section 9(1)(b), that the Minister may approve a code of practice prepared by a person other than the Minister which purports to set standards for the conduct of mediators.  I believe that possibility must be preserved.</p><p>In regard to amendments Nos. 20 to 22, inclusive, the intention appears to be to ensure that a code of practice must include all the matters outlined at paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>f</i>) in subsection (2).  However, as I have already indicated, there is likely to be more than one code of practice and it would not be appropriate to impose such a restriction.  It is quite likely there will be more than one code of practice and these amendments do not allow for that possibility.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 23 and 24 seek to insert into a code of practice provisions regarding education and training for mediators.  I do not believe that a code of practice for mediators is the correct place to deal with training and education standards and I note that codes of practice for mediators in other jurisdictions do not include provisions for education and training.  I am not saying that education and training provisions are in any way at variance with the role and function of mediators but I do not believe that putting that in a code of practice is appropriate.</p><p>I cannot accept Amendment 25 from Deputy Daly which would have the effect of removing procedures to be followed by mediators in the conduct of mediation from the scope of a code of practice.  I acknowledge what the Deputy had to say about this  being dependent on other amendments.  Amendment No. 25 as it stands, to my mind, would run completely counter to what a code of practice should do and, therefore, I cannot accept it.</p><p>I would ask Deputies to consider what I have said and to reflect on the Bill in its entirety with the Committee Stage amendments following which we can look at what might be done on Report Stage.  In regard to all of the amendments tabled by Deputies Wallace and Daly I see potential difficulties, many of which are perhaps unintended but would nevertheless cause difficulties in practice.  I do not believe anyone is keen to have a Bill that might be regarded as anything less than certainty.</p></speech>

I will therefore withdraw amendment No. 12.  Amendments Nos. 21, 22, 24 and 27 are also in my name and they also pretty much overlap with what is provided for in Deputy Daly's amendments.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 21 seeks the substitution of the word "may" with "shall" in an effort to make the Bill more specific.  The points listed for inclusion in the code of practice are good but there is too much scope to avoid what should be fundamental requirements for a code of practice.  The change from "may" to "shall" is a change from optional to a mandatory provisions for the code of practice.  I am of the view that these provisions should be mandatory.</p> <p>  On amendment No. 24, there should be a minimum requirement in terms of education and training for a person to be a mediator otherwise a situation is created whereby mediators who have completed a short course can be placed on the same level as already professionally qualified mediators with hundreds of hours of training.  That might not be such a good idea.  The Bill as it stands will allow those who undertake significant ongoing education to be equated with those who do not refresh and update their mediation skills and education.  This should be avoided.  There are people who go the extra mile to be better at their job.</p><p>There should be clarity and recognition that they are putting in the effort and trying to advance their ability in order to deal with complex situations.  Therefore, I believe it is important.</p></speech>

What we are trying to do with this Bill is facilitate a major transfer away from the court process of dispute resolution.  It could potentially be a really important thing for citizens, but it has to be done right.  Done right it would be brilliant, but done wrong it could cause a huge amount of damage.  The Bill is full of aspirations about a code of practice but there is no meat behind it.  There is nothing to require that to be drawn up and there is nothing to require the mediator to sign up to it.  As the Bill is currently constructed, somebody could go and do an online diploma course, put "association of professional mediators" or whatever beside his or her name, hand over the code of practice and then be on exactly the same level playing field as somebody who has been highly trained, who has upskilled and who has done it all.  That is just too dangerous.  We have seen too many rogue operators at there.  I appreciate that my staff are obviously more clinical than the staff in Deputy Wallace's office in terms of drafting the amendment.  Our amendments Nos. 13 and 14-----</p></speech>

With regard to our amendments Nos. 13 and 14, we are talking about certain minimum standards.  The Minister said that there would be different codes of practice and all that.  That may absolutely be the case.  However, what we are saying is that for somebody to have the label of mediator, they must require certain minimum standards.  What is the point in talking about a code of practice if people do not have to adhere to it?  Not only that, but the Minister may do some of these things.  We might have confidence that this Minister will do them, but there is no requirement on a Minister to bring about some of these things.  Again, I say that in the context of the likes of the Law Society stating that the regulation of what will be a new, important and growing profession of mediators should be dealt with on a statutory basis.  It cannot be done fully by the legislation as it stands.  Our amendments are just trying to plug the gap pending the statutory regulation of it.  It is not about micromanaging and it is not about dotting every "i" and all that sort of stuff.  It is about certain minimum standards that mediators must adhere to in order to give themselves that title.  I believe it is vital.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.1425" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017062800002#F00500"><p>One of the main issues is whether there should be a code of practice or a variety of codes of practice.  My preference would be for the former.  If we start going down the road of mediators having a series of codes of practice, we would end up like boxing associations with different organisations having different codes of practice and people being able to say that they are regulated by the Malahide mediators business or the Rathmines mediators association.</p> <p>  The preference should be to have one code of practice.  The Minister said that there is an advantage to having more than one code because, for instance, he may want to develop a code of practice for mediations that involve children.  I do not see why we cannot have just one code of practice and, within that, we would have a section that would deal with mediations that involve children.  Section 9 refers to there being a code of practice.  As Deputies, we have a code of conduct.  We do not have a different code of conduct for different parties or anything like that.  I believe we should be seeking to harmonise this in one code of practice for mediators.</p> <p>  With regard to the other amendments about education and training, as I said, we intend to table an amendment to section 9 on Report Stage in respect of the requirement that mediators should have to have a minimum standard of education or training.  I believe that should be put in the Bill.  Otherwise, it will just be open season.  It is not like any other profession in which one has to achieve certain qualifications in order to become qualified to practise.  As Deputy Daly said, under the Bill as it stands anyone can just call themselves a mediator and off they go.  We need to be able to protect them.</p> <p>  In terms of the code of practice, in court there are the rules of court.  If we want to make mediation a success, which we all want to do, we should have just one code of practice for mediators.  It should be there and everyone should know what is in it so that there is no ambiguity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.1426" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017062800002#F00600"><p>I note that Deputy Wallace has indicated his intention to withdraw amendment No. 12 and I welcome that.</p><p>I merely wish to make the point that should section 9(1) be changed to impose a duty on the Minister by inserting &quot;shall&quot; rather than &quot;may&quot;, it would exclude the likely probability of there being more than one code of practice.  I listened to the point raised by Deputy O'Callaghan, but the fact of the matter is that there are different practices and codes that are required for different areas of practice.  I mentioned just one, which was the matter of children in mediation.  I believe that unduly restricting the Minister in section 9(1) excludes that possibility, which is more than a possibility - it is a likelihood.</p><p>I want to make the point again regarding the education and training, which has been mentioned, as well as the qualifications.  I draw the attention of members again to the role of the mediator under section 8(1), with specific reference to 8(1)(b) and 8(1)(c), by which the mediator would be required prior to the commencement of the mediation to</p><blockquote>(b) furnish to the parties the following details of the mediator that are relevant to mediation in general or that particular mediation:(i) qualifications;<br /><br />(ii) training and experience;<br /><br />(iii) continuing professional development training,and<br /><br />(c) furnish to the parties a copy of any code of practice to which he or she subscribes in so far as mediation is concerned.</blockquote> <p>That deals with the matter of qualifications and training and with the issue of experience and expertise and, therefore, I believe it caters for the points being raised by the Deputies in a number of the amendments.</p><p>With regard to education and training, I accept the point raised by Deputy Wallace.  However, it is probably premature in this Bill and therefore inappropriate to deal with it at this stage.  The minimum requirements of the Mediation Council of Ireland, about which there is some reference in the Bill, would deal with that.  This would be an issue for the council.  I refer to the Schedule of the Bill, which will impose a duty and obligation on the council to maintain and develop standards in the provision of mediation, including a system of training, education, professional development and the acquisition of expertise.  I am not against the point Deputy Wallace is making, but I do not think it is appropriate in this part of the Bill and I do not think it is appropriate for this Bill.  Rather, it is a matter for the Mediation Council.  As the Deputy knows, the council will be of consequence in terms of the evolving nature of mediation and the law.  I ask the Deputy to accept our bona fides in this regard.</p></speech>

The point is that, in the absence of a standardised code of practice, how do I know whether somebody with a diploma from the advanced royal mediation institute is highly trained or bought the diploma online?  If we do not define a code of practice ourselves, it will put too much of the onus on the citizen to have to do the digging and find out the standards.  That is why I believe it is important to go ahead as recommended in the amendments.</p></speech>

I ask the Deputy to let me deal with that specific issue on Report Stage and not to press that particular amendment now.  I will consider what she has said to see whether we can address the point she has made without incorporating the amendment before us, which, for reasons I have already given, conflicts with the current section 9 on the matter of there being more than one code of practice.</p><p>We must accept that reality.</p></speech>

The section imposes a general confidentiality obligation on the mediator and parties to a mediation.  Following a review of the section, it has become clear that it does not go far enough in ensuring the confidentiality of the mediation process.  For this reason, amendment No. 29 proposes deletion of the words "by the mediator with the parties" and the insertion of the words "oral statements".   Deputies will accept the fact that this will broaden the confidentiality obligation to all communications made in the context of the mediation, including any oral statement that might be made by a participant.</p> <p>  Deputy Daly&rsquo;s amendment seeks to achieve the same end but, given the fact my amendment is similar, I hope she will feel she is in a position not to press her amendment.</p></speech>

The first corrects a drafting error in section 10(3) by substituting the word "admissible" for "inadmissible".  This makes it clear that evidence introduced in mediation that is otherwise admissible or subject to discovery in proceedings shall not become inadmissible solely because it was introduced or used in mediation.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 31 deletes the word "civil" in section 10(3).  It is no longer needed here following the amendment of the definition of "proceedings" in section 2.</p><p>That is fine.

For this purpose, they must provide clients with information on mediation services, including details of mediators, information about the advantages and benefits of mediation, information on the confidentiality obligations, as discussed earlier, and the enforceability of mediation settlements.  Where mediation is declined or fails and court proceedings are instituted on behalf of a client, the application must be accompanied by a statutory declaration made by the solicitor confirming that these obligations have been discharged in relation to the client and the proceedings to which the declaration relates.</p><p>In submissions to my Department, the Law Society has raised the possibility of confusion and duplication of effort in cases arising under the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, the Judicial Separation and Family Law Act 1989 and the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996.  The society points out that the requirements of this Bill in relation to the making of a statutory declaration would appear to be in addition to the existing requirements with respect to the signing of a certificate under those Acts.  I accept that there is a possibility of duplication of requirements in these cases and I am tabling amendment No. 32 which disapplies section 14 to certain matters arising under the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, the Judicial Separation and Family Law Act 1989 and the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996.</p><p>We need consistency and coherence between the provisions of this Bill and the requirements on solicitors under the Acts of 1964, 1989 and 1996.  For this reason, amendments Nos. 39 to 41, inclusive, will, respectively, amend sections 20 and 21 of the 1964 Act, sections 5 and 6 of the 1989 Act and sections 6 and 7 of the 1996 Act in order to require a solicitor to make a statutory declaration rather than merely sign a certificate to the effect that the requirements under these Acts have been discharged.</p><p>In addition, I consider that the information regarding mediation provided by a solicitor to an applicant under these Acts should mirror the obligations placed on a solicitor under this legislation.  For this reason, the proposed amendments require a solicitor to provide to an applicant under those Acts the names and addresses of persons qualified to provide an appropriate mediation service and to inform his or her client of the matters referred to in sections 10 and 11 of this Bill.</p><p>Two further amendments concern section 29 of the 1964 Act and section 43 of the 1996 Act.  Both relate to the costs of mediation or counselling services.  Since the Bill we are now discussing contains specific provision for costs of mediation, these sections should be amended to delete reference to mediation services.  I ask Deputies to accept the amendments as tabled.</p></speech>

I got a communication late last night from the Law Society on an issue in relation to the domestic violence legislation that sounds quite similar.

The requirement in the Bill to produce a report which outlines any issues raised, or for the mediator to give an opinion on the engagement of the parties, would breach this confidentiality.  This section is of great concern to the Mediators' Institute of Ireland and the Law Society, and was highlighted in the 2010 report of the Law Reform Commission.  In that report, the Law Reform Commission concluded that mediators' reports, if any, should be narrowly restricted and might have some role in assisting a court in determining a successful litigant's cost application after litigation, subsequent to an inconclusive mediation but not otherwise.  In paragraph 4.125 of the report, the commission concluded that:</p><blockquote>[T]he Commission considers that the content of mediators' or conciliators' reports to the Court should be narrowly restricted.  Confidentiality during a mediation session is essential to protect the integrity of the process.  For the mediation or conciliation to be effective, a mediator or conciliator must have the trust of all participants, both in joint sessions and in private caucuses.  Requiring mediators or conciliators to report on the conduct of the parties to the Court imperils the confidentiality of the process.</blockquote></speech>

As Deputy Wallace said, the Law Reform Commission, the Law Society and the Mediators' Institute of Ireland are all keen that there would be some changes here, in particular with regard to the obligation in this section that mediators provide in their report to the court a statement of their opinion as to whether or not the parties fully engaged.  This is way too subjective.  Only a brief report needs to be presented as to whether or not meditation took place and whether a settlement was reached and, if so, what the terms of that settlement were.</p> <p>  It is important we include in the Bill the requirement that the report be a written one.  That comes under amendment No. 33.  Otherwise, we run the risk of much of the mediator's time being spent on court appearances and so on.  A written report to the court, however, should be sufficient.  It should be a neutral summary of the facts.  It is important to include something because in awarding costs the courts can take into account any unreasonable refusal or failure of a party to consider or engage properly in mediation.  I agree with Deputy Wallace's point that the mediator's report should one of advice and for the court decide whether it was unreasonable or not.</p><p>A normal statement should be a written statement to the court to be rubber stamped.  That is an important point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.1510" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017062800002#J00200"><p>It should be a written report and the wording of section 17 implies it would be a written report, so I do not see any harm in stating it will be a written report.  Otherwise, one will not get the detail that is set out in the rest of section 17(1).</p> <p>  A further point concerns section 17(1)(b)(iv), which states: "if no mediation settlement has been reached, a statement as to whether, in the mediator&rsquo;s opinion, the parties engaged fully in the mediation" will be made.  I believe that will change the character of the mediation and it also changes the character of the mediator.  If that is put in place, the mediator will become an individual who can punish one or other of the parties to a mediation, which I believe undermines the voluntary nature of mediation.  One will find situations where mediators in a report to the courts say one side did not fully engage, and as a result there could be costs consequences against that side in court.  There may also be consequences for the mediator in that the parties may say this was unfair and that they did fully engage, and there may be a dispute in which a mediator is sued.  This makes it difficult and makes it potentially adversarial, which is what we do not want in mediation.  This needs to be looked at again by the Minister.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-28a.1511" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017062800002#J00300"><p>This group of amendments relates to the mediator&rsquo;s report to the court under section 17.  It provides that where the parties decide to engage in mediation following an invitation by the court, and they subsequently apply to the court to re-enter the proceedings, the mediator will prepare and submit a report to the court outlining the outcome of the mediation.  I take the point with regard to having the report in writing.</p> <p>  Following publication of the Bill, a number of submissions to my Department queried whether the mediator&rsquo;s report should refer to unresolved matters as currently required by section 17(1)(b)(iii).  I have accepted that it should not be necessary to refer to such &ldquo;unresolved&rdquo; issues and that is the purpose of amendments Nos. 36 and 38.</p> <p>  As regards amendments Nos. 33 and 34 tabled by Deputy Daly, I am not disposed to accept them as of now but I take the point she makes.  Subsection (1) requires the mediator to prepare and submit a report to the court and this already implies that the report must be written.  Moreover, inserting the words &ldquo;short and neutral&rdquo; in regard to such a report, as proposed in amendment No. 34, is unnecessary since paragraphs (a) and (b) already indicate the content of such a report.</p> <p>  As regards amendments Nos. 35 and 37, tabled by Deputies Wallace and Daly respectively, I am willing to give this issue further consideration because I do not believe there is much between us.  The key issue here is the requirement in subsection (1)(b)(iv) that if no mediation settlement has been reached, the mediator&rsquo;s report should contain a statement as to whether the parties engaged fully in the mediation or not.  I recognise that this provision raises sensitive issues for mediators.  Deputies will be aware that a broadly similar provision is already to be found in section 28 of the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011, which requires the chairperson of a mediation conference to include in his or her report to the court a statement as to whether the failure of mediation is substantially due to the conduct of one or more of the parties, and in that case specifying the identity of such party or parties.</p> <p>  I would ask Members to acknowledge the sensitivities here.  I am willing to give the matter further consideration.  I acknowledge the importance of the points raised in terms of facilitating further discussion and in assisting me to come back on Report Stage with a form of wording that should meet the concerns of Deputies as indicated in amendments Nos. 35 and 37.  I would hope to come back with something if Members are minded to leave matters over until Report Stage.</p></speech>

If we are saying it is implied that a report should be written, we should spell it out.  I do not think there is any harm in that.  It is not wordy or cumbersome and will not undermine the Bill.  I would like to press those amendments.  I accept the point on amendment No. 34 and am happy to withdraw that.</p> <p>  In terms of the bigger picture, it is a key area for mediators and we have to come up with something better on this.  Deputy O'Callaghan summarised the points very well in that it could undermine the whole process if we do not get the wording right.  Whether we press it now or deal with it on Report Stage, I do not mind.</p></speech>

The amendment would impose a significant additional function on the proposed mediation council in respect of complaints and disciplinary matters.</p><p>Following publication of the report of the then Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality on the draft Bill in 2012, my Department engaged in consultations with various bodies in the mediation sector to discuss the issue of regulation of the sector.</p><p> The outcome of the discussions was an oversight body, termed the Mediation Council in the Bill, and it should have the following functions: promote public awareness of, and provide information to the public about, the availability and operation of mediation services in the State; maintain and develop standards in the provision of mediation services; prepare codes of practice for mediators for approval by the Minister and oversee application of any approved code; establish and maintain a register of mediators who have subscribed to an approved code of practice; and advise on the establishment and operation of mediation information sessions in family law cases.</p><p> Mediation bodies pointed out that many mediators are members of regulated professions and are already subject to oversight and regulation by the regulatory bodies concerned.  Moreover, the various mediation bodies have their own training frameworks, education courses, continual professional development, as well as disciplinary codes.  I should point out that provision is made in section 9 for codes of practice, as we have already discussed, to include complaint and redress mechanisms and I am not convinced that the council should be given additional oversight in the Bill.</p><p> I would ask the Deputy to accept what I say having regard to the requirements of the council.</p></speech>

I did not have an opportunity of replying to questions raised by Deputy Daly last night because of the orders of the House.  It would not have been appropriate.  I would not have been allowed.</p> <p>  I would like to take this opportunity, by way of intervention in the Chairman's presence, to say to the committee that I am keen to advance matters on the coroners (amendment) Bill, that I have had a meeting with the Attorney General on this issue, that matters are proceeding, and I would be happy to keep the committee informed and would be happy to keep Deputy Daly informed having regard to her expressed interest in this issue.</p><p>While it is a priority, it is one of a number of priorities, as the Chairman is aware, that are matters of importance to the committee and in the justice area.  I have taken careful note of submissions made by Deputy Daly and I have met the Attorney General.  I hope to be in a position to report progress on this matter very shortly.</p></speech>

The committee is aware that on 1 December last year, which is seven months ago, a judicial appointments Bill that passed Second Stage came here for Committee Stage but we never got the money message.  Seven months later we still have not received the money message.  Another judicial appointments Bill is going through the D&aacute;il, as we see on the screens in front of us.  Will the Minister let the committee know when will the money message for the Bill be delivered?</p></speech>
