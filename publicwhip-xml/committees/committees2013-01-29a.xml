Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  I have received apologies from Deputy Thomas Pringle and Senators Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill and Michael Comiskey.  I ask members to switch off mobile telephones and other electronic devices. </p><p>  I welcome from Comhairle na Tuaithe, Ms Finola Moylette, chairperson, and Mr. Des Moore.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give this committee.  If a witness is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and the witness continues to so do, the witness is entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of his or her evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite Ms Moylette to make her presentation. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-29a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Finola Moylette" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013012900003#B00300"><p>I am the principal officer in the community division of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and one of my areas of responsibility is to chair Comhairle na Tuaithe.  I am accompanied by Mr. Des Moore who works with me in the Department on the day-to-day implementation of the national countryside recreation strategy.  Members will have received copies of a document I circulated yesterday outlining the general objectives of Comhairle na Tuaithe.  I will briefly discuss our work, after which I will be pleased to answer any questions members may have.</p><p>  Comhairle na Tuaithe was established in 2004 for the purpose of progressing three specific priorities, namely, access to the countryside for recreation purposes; the development of a countryside code; and the development of the countryside recreation strategy.  Significant progress has been made in all three areas.  The national countryside recreation strategy was agreed and published in 2006 and the principle of "leave no trace" has effectively been adopted as the code for recreation users.  The strategy is dedicated to creating a nationally recognised and accepted outdoor ethic, which encourages all outdoor enthusiasts to act with responsibility in the countryside and take care of the environment.  While not universal, there is widespread permissive access to the countryside for recreation purposes.</p><p>  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government provides the secretariat and chair for Comhairle na Tuaithe, which meets, on average, three or four times per annum.  The membership comprises representatives from a range of bodies, including the main farming organisations, State and semi-State organisations such as Coillte and the national trails office and a large number of non-State organisations, including Scouting Ireland, Mountaineering Ireland and Keep Ireland Open.  While the organisations represented on Comhairle na Tuaithe can and do have different and sometimes conflicting views, the national countryside recreation strategy published in 2006 represents a consensus view of the membership. </p><p>  The document I circulated outlines some of the current areas Comhairle na Tuaithe is trying to address.  They include the development, with the main State agencies, of an outdoor recreation plan for public lands and waters.  These agencies include Coillte, Inland Fisheries Ireland and Bord na M&oacute;na.</p><p>  Comhairle na Tuaithe, through the Department representatives, also works closely with the national trails advisory committee, a sub-committee of the Irish Sports Council, to oversee the implementation of its national trails strategy and assist the national trails office in its work.  With F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Department funds 12 rural recreation officers through local development companies to support the development of walking trails and manage the walk scheme.  While the scheme is closed to new trails, it currently maintains more than 40 trails throughout the country and approximately 1,800 landowners are participating in it.  </p><p>  With regard to future plans, our main aim is to continue with implementation of the national countryside recreation strategy, which outlines five strategic objectives.  Comhairle na Tuaithe has agreed a list of priority actions to be progressed, although our ability to deliver on these will be contingent on resources.  We hope to conclude agreement on the national outdoor recreation plan for public lands and waters during 2013.  This will be significant as the State owns or is in control of in excess of 15% of the land in the country and a more co-ordinated and planned approach to the development of recreation infrastructure can only be beneficial.  </p><p>  We are exploring the possibility of introducing a national indemnity scheme to facilitate access to private lands for recreational purposes.  This has the potential to greatly alleviate landowners&rsquo; fears regarding possible litigation and other difficulties and should facilitate the removal of any barriers to access.  Having provided this quick summary of the types of areas in which Comhairle na Tuaithe is currently involved, I and my colleague, Mr. Moore, will be pleased to elaborate on any aspect of our activities.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-29a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013012900003#B00400"><p>I welcome Ms Moylette and Mr. Moore.  The main focus of the joint committee in this matter is the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and proposals to restrict farmers' use of commonages.  As many people are aware, when pressure is applied to hill farmers on the issue of commonages, there is always a danger that rural recreation, which, as Ms Moylette noted, takes place on a permissive basis, will come into play.  Have discussions taken place with officials in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the commonage policy it is developing, given that walking places a certain amount of pressure on certain hills, especially where they are used by large numbers of walkers?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-29a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013012900004#C00200"><p>I thank the representatives of Comhairle na Tuaithe for their presentation.  I am involved in a walkway in my own area that uses an abandoned railway line.  It is up and running.  There were many objections to it and serious problems from some landowners regarding insurance and fear of the spread of disease.  Even today, I had an e-mail from the north Kerry-west Limerick walking group, which has a fantastic set-up and is organising a walk on Saturday next.  They, too, had their difficulties.  If the route I referred to could be spread throughout north Kerry it would be a fantastic amenity.</p><p>  It is difficult to win over landholders.  This is partly due to genuine concerns about the spread of disease on agricultural land.  While one can overcome that, liability for accidents and so forth remains a difficulty.  That fear is magnified but it can be overcome. </p><p>  Ms Moylette said Comhairle na Tuaithe has a list of priority actions to progress under the national countryside recreation strategy, NCRS.  Could she outline those actions?  Many Departments are involved in this area.  It would make matters easier if all could be brought under one umbrella.  A single entity could negotiate with landowners and communities.  In using abandoned railway lines, for example, difficulties arise with the use of old railway stations.  People who are now living in these stations may have concerns about people passing their windows and so forth.  This creates its own problems and needs to be looked at.  </p><p>  My party and I support the use of land for recreation in a controlled way that protects the land owner.  It can provide a facility which, if marketed properly, could have huge benefits to communities.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-29a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/980" speakername="Tom Barry" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013012900004#C00300"><p>I thank the representatives of Comhairle na Tuaithe for their presentation.  I have a few thoughts on the matter.</p><p>  A few years ago, when a rural scheme was promoting access to pathways through farms, I was anxious to establish a path through my land.  I encountered all the obstacles that other members have noted.  Insurance was a huge issue.  The matter seemed to involve a number of agencies and was very confused.  I wanted no financial reward.  There may be goodwill among landowners, but providing access must be made easy.  Farmers are busy and when planting season starts the pathway will be forgotten until next year comes around. </p><p>  Landowners must be given time to get a feel for permissive access.  We are talking about creating pathways and permanency.  We should forget permanency.  If people get access for a few years and enjoy that, then so be it.  A right of way can be closed once a year until a farmer feels comfortable with it.  Over time, people will see the benefits of walking on hills.  If there are negative effects from access it probably should not have been granted in the first place and can be curtailed.  There might be a fear that, for example, a farmer's son or daughter might want to build a house at some future date and the pathway might impinge on that.  Such fears need to be allayed.  In the majority of cases access, once given, will remain open.  </p><p>  I am involved in tillage.  Very little damage can be done to tillage land.  I might want to restrict access in the week of the harvest when there is a risk of round bales rolling on top of passers-by or from large machinery.  One must take practical precautions and the initiative should be taken in that spirit.  It is said that progress has stopped due to lack of funding.  Very little funding would be required by farmers.  There is considerable goodwill among them.  Many people who live in the countryside work in the cities and appreciate the value of the rural environment.  Losing weight, living healthily and walking has become almost a national obsession.  Granting access also has benefits for the farming community.  They can be seen to be engaging with their rural neighbours and taking a greater part in the community.  This is a great initiative.  It needs to be simplified.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-29a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1128" speakername="Paschal Mooney" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013012900004#C00400"><p>I also welcome Ms Moylette and Mr. Moore.  I commend the work they are doing.  It is very important.</p><p>  I served as chairman of F&aacute;ilte Ireland North West from 2008 to 2010 and became aware of the importance of the development of walking trails, particularly in the north west.  There is an impressive list of 800 walking trails on the national trails register.  During my time as chairman, there was a great focus on developing more and more trails, particularly in areas like the north west where the topography suited them and where they would have generated extra tourism income in a part of the country that had the lowest visitor numbers of all the regions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-29a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1103" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013012900005#D00200"><p>I wish to raise a number of points.  I live in County Wicklow and the National Waymarked Trails, the national trails strategy has worked very well.  Much of the access to the open countryside has necessitated going through land that is privately owned or owned by Coillte but an issue that is now being aired is dogs roaming on the open hills on which there are existing rights.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred to commonage.  The practicality of commonage is under threat, unless the code of leave no trace is developed to include guidelines on dogs which are then implemented.  In most cases there are other lands that are publicly owned that are more suitable for allowing dogs to be let off the leash.  I know of an access route in Glenmalure that is heavily used with the full support of the landowner, but now at the weekends, he has to go out to look after his stock because of the threat that dogs pose to them.  There seems to be a lack of awareness or an unwillingness to take that point on board by some members of the public.  It is undoing a great deal of the good work that has been done since the years 1999-2000.  Perhaps Ms Moylette will comment on that point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-29a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Finola Moylette" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013012900005#D00300"><p>A range of topics have been covered.  We are at the very early stages of the negotiations on the Common Agricultural Policy programmes.  As far as I am aware, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine which takes the lead has recently instigated its ex-ante evaluation in advance of the next programme and has begun very tentative discussions with various bodies.  To date, we have had no direct discussions with the Department on commonage and rural recreation and so on but no doubt that will happen in the future.  As part of Comhairle na Tuaithe we will engage with the Department on these issues.</p><p>  As far as I am aware, Mountaineering Ireland has a proposal on the potential to introduce a scheme similar to an element of REPS 1.  That is at the very early stages.  At this point, I cannot say what will happen.</p><p>  Insurance is a major issue in that there is a perception by land owners who may see a threat to their livelihood from silly claims for compensation and the like.  We are working with all the organisations on Comhaire na Tuaithe to try to iron out all of these issue.  We are trying to make progress on an indemnity scheme.  We are trying to put in place a pilot scheme in the Macgillycuddy's Reeks area but we have come to the conclusion that a pilot scheme for a single mountain is not practical and we need to look at the reeks in the round because there are multiple access routes and all sorts of different approaches to it.  We are looking at a wider scheme but as a precursor to a national scheme across the board.  If we can put an indemnity scheme in place in that area, it probably will solve many of the worries and issues around access to land in general.  The bottom line for farmers and landowners is that they are worried about insurance claims against them.  They are not particularly against access as such but would like it to be structured in a way that it would not impinge on their livelihood's or what he or she does.  </p><p>  Comhairle na Tuaithe is working with many groups.  My colleague, Mr. Des Moore will give an update on the North Kerry line.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-29a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Des Moore" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013012900005#D00400"><p>I can give an update on the Great Southern Trail, which already is in excess of 40 km from Rathkeale down to Abbeyfeale.  It is the intention to progress it across the Kerry border into north Kerry.  Our aspiration in supporting the funding of the development of that trail is that it would eventually link to Tralee.  We have already provided some funding support to Kerry County Council in relation to the development of the Tralee Spa-Finit line as well, which is already being progressed.  I am aware that there are some concerns among landowners on the Kerry side in particular, however, my understanding is that while the line is not in use it is not abandoned.  It is still in the ownership of CIE.  There are significant issues around encroachment on both abandoned and disused railway lines which are impacting on the ability to develop those routes in a timely manner.  They are being addressed on an ongoing basis.  We work closely with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and we have contact with CIE on occasion on resolving issues that can arise on those routes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-29a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Finola Moylette" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013012900006#E00200"><p>On the point about putting people first, socioeconomic committees, SECs, and the abolition of local development companies, at this stage the Minister&rsquo;s plans are not fully developed but as far as I am aware there are no plans to abolish local development companies.  The plans are focused on better alignment of local development and local authority delivery.  There is no plan, as far as I am aware, to abolish local development companies or to lose the expertise they have built up over a couple of decades.</p><p>  On the number of trails, infrastructure and funding for maintenance, our walks scheme currently maintains the 40 trails that are part of the scheme and we will continue to do so, but for the wider national network there is no funding available to continue their maintenance.  We are currently trying to put together a package of proposals for Government that will address the issue.  We can see that a serious issue will arise in that regard if we do not manage and continue to maintain the infrastructure we have, let alone develop new infrastructure, which is vitally important for us.  In terms of additional agencies we want to bring on board, the likes of Coillte has a mandate and responsibility for recreation but CIE and local authorities do not.  We would like to bring more such bodies into the net, in that they would have an official responsibility in the area.  Those are all issues we are currently examining.  Perhaps Mr. Moore could address anything else that we have not covered.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-29a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Des Moore" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013012900006#E00300"><p>There was a suggestion that we would bring all functions under the one Department.  To add to what Ms Moylette said about local development companies and the Minister&rsquo;s plans in terms of putting people first and having an enhanced role for local authorities, our primary focus in recent years has been operating through 12 local development companies that employ 12 rural recreation officers.  The majority of additional trail development and the development of recreational facilities has been funded by F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  We need a national footprint for the delivery of the national countryside recreation strategy.</p><p>  We would very much welcome the involvement of local authorities in the process in partnership with the local development companies.  It has been clearly stated to us where that engagement currently takes place, that local authorities see the rural recreation officers and local development companies as significant actors on the stage in that issues exist between landowners and local authorities over previous planning applications that have been refused, compulsory rights of way, and other such issues.  Rural recreation officers and local development companies are seen as honest brokers and a good buffer between the more formal structures of the local authority and private landowners.  We would welcome the intervention of local authorities in terms of their capacity to develop by-laws and a legislative structure to address issues that impact in sensitive areas, such as the use of motorised vehicles, for example, scramblers and quads.  Another issue on which we would welcome greater engagement with local authorities relates to signage from public roads.</p><p>  Comhairle na Tuaithe works well.  Ms Moylette referred to State agencies.  We are currently meeting with the landholder State agencies.  We have developed a draft national plan for the development of State lands and waters and it is currently being discussed with the agencies.  We hope to conclude discussions on the draft plan early this year.  We are reasonably happy with the structures, not alone those supported by the Department under Comhairle na Tuaithe, but we also work closely with the national trails office of the Irish Sports Council and we participate actively in the national trails advisory committee.  Those structures bring most of the agencies together.  The City and County Managers Association is represented at both of those structures.  There is good capacity for engagement.  As there are many specific actors on the stage it is difficult to get everyone together in the one room at any one time.  Needless to say, we endeavour to get around those issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-29a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Finola Moylette" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013012900006#E00400"><p>It is difficult to see how the area could be brought under a single agency or umbrella organisation because it is so diverse and widespread and there are so many different agencies that must be involved and work together.  From the Department&rsquo;s perspective, we are the honest broker in trying to get all of the groups around the table, including the landowners, those who want to be involved in recreational activities and the other agencies that can assist in that regard.  While progress might appear to be slow &ndash; it is painstaking &ndash; it is being made nonetheless and is being well made.  We are building a solid foundation.  I hope that if we can manage to get across the indemnity hurdle in particular, and we get the plan agreed by the State agencies, we will have progressed matters considerably in the not-too-distant future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-29a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013012900006#E00500"><p>I am very concerned that because of the lack of importance attached to rural recreation and also the fact that it is at the moment being done on a permissive basis that landowners might do something that would seriously upset the apple cart and set back the situation by five or six years to a time when people put up signs on their farms to say &ldquo;No Access&rdquo;.  That very nearly happened at the latter end of 2012 when the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine proposed to introduce commonage framework plans that would have been totally unacceptable to farmers and would have meant a huge loss of income for many of them.  My guess is that if the Department had done that without consultation that farmers would have decided in its absence that they would withdraw permissive access.  As the witnesses are aware, there is no arrangement on 99% of hills; people just go there because farmers allow them.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for appearing before the committee on an issue that is extremely important.  I am a farmer and my holding contains the ruins of a castle and an old graveyard.  I am well aware of the importance of people being able to access that graveyard in which the last burial was in 1974.  It dates back to 1798 and is of great historical value.  As a farmer, there are concerns about people crossing my land regarding livestock, safety, closing the gate, etc.</p><p>  I also accept the point that this covers many agencies and many aspects that make the work of Comhairle na Tuaithe very difficult.  I take it that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is the lead Department in this.  I note Comhairle na Tuaithe has used the Leader structure to hire some rural recreation officers.  I ask the witnesses to explain the Comhairle na Tuaithe funding model in general terms.  Is it geared to try to access funding through existing schemes such as Leader?</p></speech>

I am happy to suggest that its officials would meet us to discuss in general what they intend to do and allow us to talk to them about rural recreation and issues generally, and see where that goes.  Other than that, I am not sure what we can do.  I have no problem initiating that.</p><p>  Deputy Heydon asked about funding.  We are the lead Department.  Comhairle na Tuaithe is a wide group of agencies and interested parties, including farmers, walkers, Coillte, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the local authorities.  The Department itself has a small budget for carrying out the walks scheme and also funds the rural recreation officers.  The idea is to get things started and to develop it into something bigger so that it can continue on its own essentially.  Some areas outside that through local development companies will fund Leader projects but that is not done on any planned or coherent basis.  It depends on what is required in the area or who is interested in doing any particular project.  Much new rural recreation tourism-type infrastructure has been developed in that way.</p><p>  In many ways the funding is <i>ad hoc</i>.  We get some funding through F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Depending on who wants to do what or what its plans are, we try to spread the resources we have.  We would much prefer if we had a more structured funding regime for all that with a more permanent funding stream or structure and a proper plan in place, and we continually work towards that.  The whole thing has grown incrementally over the years and people are beginning to see there is value to it.  It is not simply access to the countryside; the whole tourism issue is significant as is the health issue.  I believe most walkers are locals who are out doing their half an hour or hour in their own locality.  Along with all that the whole tourism side of things is growing significantly.  There is considerable benefit to be gained, but at the same time we need to be very careful with the infrastructure we have, managing the land we have properly and dealing with the thing in a holistic way.  We are making progress slowly but hopefully it will be quite transformational by the time we get through with it.  We have our work cut out and I suspect we will still be working away at this in a decade's time.</p><p>  It is a whole complex area involving several Departments.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in particular, and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, need to become more involved and hopefully we can continue to progress matters.</p></speech>

The discussion today has informed us and reassured us that there is an entity within a Department that has a grasp of all the issues.  Ms Moylette mentioned she would approach the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, which is very important.  To be fair, that Department was handed the draft commonage rules from another Department, the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, and in ways was handed something of a hot potato, but now is the time to engage.</p><p>  The same applies to Pillar II rural development money.  Ms Moylette said it was at an early stage.  The CAP in general is at an advanced stage but the details of Pillar II and how it will be funded is at a preliminary stage.  Now is the time to get involved.  Both of those are interlinked with the issue of access.  Given that Comhairle na Tuaithe has a forum that brings everybody into the one discussion group in order to develop an understanding, it will be important that the commonages and the rural development funding both have a resonance with regard to access into the future.  The same applies to dogs and the leave no trace code being developed.  In the area where I live many of the public lands need to be accessed through private properties in the first place.  Somebody mentioned that one Department would be helpful, but I do not believe it is feasible to do it.  As an entity within the lead Department, Comhairle na Tuaithe is ideally placed.</p><p>  I wish the witnesses well.  As we will discuss later, we plan to invite officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine and the National Parks and Wildlife Service to come and discuss commonages.  They are at a developmental stage.  There was concern before Christmas that letters would be written to farm landowners about having to sign up to these, which really raised the ire about the whole issue.  Access may have been a casualty of that.</p><p>  I thank the witnesses.</p></speech>

He is accompanied by Mr. Philip Kelly, assistant secretary, corporate services, EU affairs and trade policy; Mr. Tommy Murray, principal officer, EU affairs and Internal Market; Mr. Gerard Monks, principal officer, trade policy; and Mr. Paul Cullen, principal officer, industrial relations.</p><p>  The committee considers these interactions with the Department on EU issues very important in the context of Parliament's enhanced role in EU affairs following the Lisbon treaty.  This engagement today is also particularly relevant as Ireland now holds the Presidency of the EU Council.</p><p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses, or any official by name in such a way as to make him or her readily identifiable.   By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to this committee.  If you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I ask Mr. Murphy to make his presentation to the committee on the six-monthly EU scrutiny report.</p></speech>

My colleagues have already been introduced.  I will broadly introduce the key legislative and policy developments that accord to the various Council formations during the six-month period January to June 2012, which is the period covered by the statement.  The report covers three Councils that fall within the remit of my Department, the Competitiveness Council, the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council, commonly known as EPSCO, and the Foreign Affairs Trade Council.</p></speech>

It was down to our agenda problems that we did not have him before the committee previously to discuss the report.  I am conscious it deals with the first six months of last year.  We intended to discuss it in November but we had to defer it.  We will bring the Secretary General before the committee again immediately after the Presidency when we are ready to review how it went.</p></speech>

We are now five years into the economic crisis and I have lost count of the number of orientation debates held.  When will Europe get its act together on how serious this crisis is for business?  We are focusing our Presidency on unemployment and employment creation, as did previous presidencies.  This is the context for my questions.  We should not be having orientation debates five years into this.  We should have answers and, at this stage in 2013, we should also have a backup plan for if these answers do not work.  Unemployment is the biggest issue facing Europe, in particular youth unemployment.  We have nice fluffy flags flying in Presidency capitals which then move to the next capital, but we are not putting a dent in the figures while we keep stating it is a key issue.</p><p>  Is the figure of &euro;2.5 billion for COSME agreed or is it still being negotiated as part of the multi-annual framework?  What does COSME mean for a typical SME?  How will it help a typical owner-manager, never mind a big corporation, to keep his or her business open, and provide new business and employment opportunities and breaks to employ people?  Unless it means something to business people on the street, it is European talk which does not really mean anything.</p></speech>

With regard to smart regulation, the committee has ongoing discussions about the burden of regulation, which is a very serious issue for business in this country.  Deputy Lawlor has done some tracking and much of it comes from Europe.  We seem to be determined to implement to the bone every regulation coming from Europe.  The debate on regulation has gone on for many years and the conclusions of the Council in February 2012 called on the Commission to improve the smart regulation agenda further by keeping engineers, end-users and businesses in mind, which is nice.  These are the people who must pay to implement these regulations.  In many cases the burden of regulation is forcing people to give up.  It has become so heavy that people would rather close shop than have to take on the expense of it.  While many of the regulations are necessary and worthy, the notion of keeping the user in mind sums up for me how the real business people and employment creators - neither officials nor politicians create jobs - are at the back of the queue.</p><p>  Every country in Europe, particularly those in the programme, have serious unemployment issues and there is no sense of a plan coming from Europe to address them.  I get a sense that member states are very much being left to their own devices.  In the next session we will speak about the adequacy of the response here.  When we, and previous presidencies under the Cypriots and the Danes, make unemployment a priority, it creates an expectation among people that something is about to be done, but nothing is done and it moves on to the next Presidency.  At the end of our term, as the Secretary General of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation what does Mr. Murphy think will be achieved which will result in job creation in this country?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-29a.42" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Murphy" time="13:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013012900005#G00600"><p>Deputy Calleary asked a number of questions.  The budget for COSME is not yet agreed because it is subject to agreement of the multi-annual financial framework, which is the overall EU budget for the next seven years.  Its purpose and main focus is to facilitate access to finance for small and medium-sized enterprises through loan facilities.  In an Irish context it would be best to see it as something which complements the range of measures which the Government is taking to address access to finance for small and medium enterprises.  It is a relatively small initiative in EU terms and a relatively small part of the multi-annual financial framework, but it is important for getting an understanding of the issues at European level and getting an EU response.</p><p>  Deputy Calleary raised the wider issue that we are five years into the crisis and where is the EU plan.  It is important to bear in mind the EU's budget.  Its capacity to intervene directly to apply resources to a problem is extremely limited.  Even if the Commission's proposals for the multi-annual financial framework were accepted by everybody around the table, the EU's budget would be approximately 1% or less of EU GNP.</p><p>  In many areas of policy the direct responsibility lies with the member state.  This is particularly true in the area of employment and social policy generally.  However, the role of the European Union, apart from direct intervention through the European Social Fund, is very much to focus on policy and a sharing and understanding of various approaches which work or do not work.  The semester process to which I referred is about examining how member states approach this and making recommendations, particularly where member states fail to take action to address issues in the labour market or rigidities in their business and regulatory environments which may impede the creation of jobs.  This is very much where the focus of the EU has been, as distinct from massive job creation programmes as such.  This is not something which falls within the ambit of the EU or within the resources provided in its budget.</p><p>  Where the EU has a significant role in terms of facilitating employment is under the regulation agenda.  Ireland's focus traditionally has been to try to ensure where proposals are made for regulation that they are proportionate and take account of the administrative and compliance burdens.  Frequently we find ourselves in a minority of member states on some of these proposals because many countries have a tendency to legislate for a perceived problem.  Our first questions tend to be whether the regulation is necessary, whether it will achieve what it sets out to achieve and what it will cost to implement it.</p></speech>

One of the main objectives of this committee is the extreme job creation crisis in this country.  The Government has managed to create one job for every 33 in the past year.  It has made advances but there is still a major job of work ahead of us.  </p><p>  With regard to the scrutiny report, it is hard for me to grasp an understanding of the assessment.  We are analysing a scrutiny document and I expected an assessment of the quality and evaluation of the programmes, whether they are successful and how they will impact on the Irish economy.  I have not got an assessment or evaluation feeling from the report.  Perhaps I am wrong and the delegation might give its evaluation.  The report covers the first six months of 2012 but the more up to date a scrutiny, the more useful it will be.</p></speech>

It was on our agenda for October and November but the committee postponed it on both occasions.  We also prioritised pre-Council meetings and the Department has been very helpful.  The Minister also came here before the Council meeting, which makes more sense.  The problem was the committee's agenda.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-29a.46" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1080" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="13:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013012900006#H00400"><p>I will take that on board.  State aid is an issue and one that I have mentioned on a number of occasions at this committee.  It is up for renegotiation this year.  Ireland has been regionalised historically and each region has been allowed give a particular level of state aid to foreign direct investment, and also to indigenous investment.  When those initial terms of reference were outlined, Ireland was in a far different economic position than its current one.  Due to the closure of Dell and a few other companies, Ireland managed to change its state aid.  I want the Government to fight hard in order to offer County Meath and other counties, which are having difficulties with job creation, incentives to create jobs.</p><p>  Public procurement is discussed in terms of access, which is important.  We do not look at public procurement - or at least I do not get the feeling that we do - as a way to create jobs or act as a tool that will help create jobs.  One of the points that we always discuss here is that we feel that public procurement militates against the easy access by small to medium-sized or micro-enterprises.  Often public procurement is bunched together rather than broken down so its access is limited.  We do not use social clauses enough in this State for public procurement.  They are excellent tools for tackling disadvantage, long-term unemployment issues and apprenticeships.  I have heard that other EU countries use procurement in a manner which, while not against European law, effects some level of advantage to local work and local companies.  In this regard Ireland is the best boy in the class but it is to our detriment again.  I would like to hear the Department's thinking on how it will resolve all of those problems which have general cross-party support.</p><p>  Denmark will hold a referendum on whether to join the unified patent court but will Ireland need to do so?  If so, would it be a good time also to have a referendum on upward-only rents?</p><p>  The Ministers and the Commission had an informal working lunch to discuss the Single Market as a driver for growth in jobs.  Has anything more been done to resolve the issue?</p><p>  Recently agreement was reached on a 60 day payment period.  Can the Secretary General explain what legislation can be used to resolve outstanding problems regarding late payment periods?  I spoke to the MP Ryan company today which has a contract with Bord G&aacute;is Networks but it still has an issue about its payments.  How close is the Department or the State to reaching the 3% GDP target for research and development?</p></speech>

The report covered January to June 2012 and was laid before the Houses in August.  Oireachtas committee are under pressure so it is inevitable that the report is only being reached now.  The report was not intended to be a detailed assessment of programmes and I am not sure how one could provide same.  The report is on developments within a particular period.  One would need a different structure to assess the effectiveness of programmes over a longer period.  I am not sure how one would do it but I accept the point made by the Deputy.</p><p>  The Deputy mentioned a number of issues about public procurement.  The EU rules for public procurement protect the integrity of procurement processes and ensure openness and transparency which provide opportunities to ensure access for SMEs.  Within Ireland the main responsibility for public procurement policy is with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The National Procurement Service also does a lot of work on behalf of public authorities and works out of the Office of Public Works on a lot of the large-scale procurement issues.  My Department works closely with both Departments, in particular on finding ways to improve access for SMEs.  For example, we held workshops that brought together large public procurers such as the ESB, HSE, the OPW and local authorities in order to examine ways to make it easier for SMEs, in particular to avoid over-specifying what is needed to procure.  Instead of saying I want 10,000 widgets, one would say I have a problem for which I need a solution.  Innovative small firms may be able to help devise a solution.  Perhaps there is a different way of solving a problem than what was first thought.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has also worked on guidelines to ensure that can be broken down into smaller lots without damaging value for money and, therefore, facilitating access by smaller companies.</p><p>  Social clauses are not a panacea for all our ills.  They can just as easily be used to prevent Irish firms from accessing markets abroad as protecting Irish or local firms within our market.  I would be careful about what is put into an EU-wide regulation.</p></speech>

It seems to me that it would be an important piece of work for us.  If it is going to be difficult for the Government to provide state aid, it is important that we should have a good debate on it in advance.</p><p>  I understand Mr. Murphy's point about the detailed events that are happening, but the issue of evaluation is still important.  As anyone in business will know, one cannot manage if one cannot measure.  If we cannot measure the effectiveness, or otherwise, of these programmes it is difficult for us to have any input other than to watch them go by.  We cannot give our perspective or bring political pressure to bear if we cannot measure them.</p></speech>

The purpose of the scrutiny process, in particular, is to bring proposals to the attention of the committee at an early stage and give the committee an opportunity to decide what level of scrutiny it wants to apply.  We are always happy to facilitate the committee in that regard.  That is the main business of this committee.  If the committee wants to undertake broader or longer-term evaluations or assessments, it will need a different process for doing so.</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, there are different measures including Government spending, business spending and so on.  I do not have the precise figures here but I would be happy to supply them to the committee.  Ireland's performance in this regard is at least as good as - and, in fact, better than - the average on a number of headings, despite the impact of the recession.  We have worked hard to protect investment in research and innovation because the parts of the Irish economy that have been growing are very much R&amp;D-led, so we want to protect that as far as possible.  We have worked intensively, particularly through Science Foundation Ireland, with the Department of Education and Skills, educational institutions and industry to ensure, first, that we get leverage to the maximum amount of private funding to support what the State is doing.  Second, it is to ensure that we prioritise well and get the best output from research that has the best chance of supporting sustainable jobs in future.  The performance in R&amp;D and the progress we have made in the last ten years have been significant factors in both the IDA and Enterprise Ireland being able to retain, sustain and grow investment.</p></speech>

I thank him for the synopsis he has provided.  I wish to touch on the question of state aid again.  It seems to me that Europe is losing out mainly to Asia in worldwide competition.  It could well be because we have quite strict rules about state aid to manufacturing, export or service companies.  Is there a danger that because we are sticking to strict rules on state aid, we are hindering the export business of European companies?  On the other hand, we continually hear of other European countries, in competition with us, being able to bend the rules on state aid.  I do not know to what extent that is correct, or whether it is just that they are a little bit smarter than we are, or whether we just have a guilty conscience about that aid.</p><p>  My other question concerns small and medium enterprises, SMEs, which we talked about earlier.  How will Europe ensure that if it is going to support SMEs, when SMEs grow bigger - as we encourage them to do - it will not happen that they will be told that as they have become too big they are no longer an SME and these rules no longer apply to them?  For a number of years, I was chairman of a sensible regulation committee and found it interesting to examine this matter.  One of the challenges we had was that if the rule does not apply to small companies, what happens when they get bigger?  We want small companies to get bigger but if they do, the rules begin to apply to them also.</p><p>  I had not heard of the European professional card before now, but it seems to make a great deal of sense.  I cannot believe it takes a long time to do, but maybe it needs the agreement of 27 countries as well as each association and organisation in each of those countries.  It sounds sensible and I hope it goes ahead.</p></speech>

How does Europe, and the Department, define an SME?  Is there a standard definition that would clarify the matter for us all?</p><p>  We appreciate that regulation is necessary, but how is it valued in the rest of Europe?  As regards the food sector specifically, we constantly hear that if one wants to sell in an open market in Ireland one must adhere to this or that regulation.  When we go on holidays to France, however, every street market is selling food, yet we are all part of Europe.  How are regulations measured, therefore?  What happens if it is not working in other countries, or is it just that Ireland is good at enforcing it and making it harder for people to set up business?</p><p>  It is great that we are high up on the research and development scale, which is really important.  How do we assess research and development, how much of it is commercialised and how can we improve it?  I have no problem with the amount of money we spend on R&amp;D.  The more tax credits we give to companies the better, as far as I am concerned.       </p><p>  I cannot help but comment on a seven-page report that does not include entrepreneurship.  If Ireland, and Europe generally, are serious about solving the employment crisis, yet we do not even address entrepreneurship, where do we expect the jobs to come from?</p></speech>

The area of state aid is a bit like procurement where people say they have the impression that no small company can get a contract.  Likewise they will say they have the impression that things are done much more easily in every other country.  It is only when one goes to meetings in other countries that one realises everybody is saying this, so they cannot all be right.</p><p>  As regards whether we are stricter or more lax in applying State aids, for better or worse the Irish public service applies the law.  As regards EU matters, when we have been found not to have applied the law the penalties are severe.  For example, the penalties for late transposition of EU directives, which usually happens for valid domestic legislative reasons, are severe with daily fines. </p></speech>

In respect of other professions, so-called, this is not the case and the card is meant to be a kind of passport for them.  However, this brings one into the anecdotal territory of the Austrian chimney sweep who has a professional card and whether Ireland, when allowing chimney sweeps in or out, will begin to issue professional cards or whether they might in fact not be adding to barriers.  There is a debate under way within Europe as to whether a number of professions should be deregulated before they are given a card and that running debate essentially is one of the issues that has added to the delay.</p></speech>

She asked how the Department assesses research and development and its importance.  A substantial research prioritisation exercise was undertaken, in consultation with the industry and various other stakeholders, in the last year and a half.  It was led by Jim O'Hara, who is a former chief executive of Intel in Ireland, and that group identified a number of sectors in which we should prioritise public funding because they offered the best prospects of economic return over time.  Rather than dissipating scarce resources over a large number of sectors, we must concentrate our effort in the sectors that are likely to give us the most significant return.  I should add that the funds to which I refer, which come through Science Foundation Ireland in the main, are not the sum total of public funding for research.  There are other sources, through the Irish Research Council, which funds basic research in the universities, because it is important that it not be neglected.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-29a.61" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/988" speakername="&Aacute;ine Collins" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013012900008#K00400"><p>Enterprise Ireland also has innovation vouchers.</p></speech>

This funding is assessed.  A call for proposals is being assessed at present following on from the research prioritisation exercise.  Essentially, that involves two tests, namely, excellence of the scientific quality of the research and the capacity for commercialisation and whether it is linked to the actual needs of industry and so on.  This also will be internationally peer-reviewed, which is important for a small country such as Ireland.  I suppose the test of this will be over time.  My concern is to ensure that we try to get the balance right between what one needs to invest to get jobs tomorrow as opposed to what one might wish to spend to get jobs today.  It is a very difficult balance to strike, particularly in the context of the present crisis.  However, given the importance of research and development of the Irish economy, it is very important that we try to protect our level of investment in research and development and in particular to increase what we can leverage from the private sector, which we have been doing successfully.</p><p>  The Deputy asked about entrepreneurship.  I should point out the report is about developments during that six-month period.  We have put a particular focus upon entrepreneurship for the Irish Presidency.  We are anxious, for example, that our informal Council will have a particular focus on entrepreneurship and we will consider the financing of entrepreneurship, of which we have good experience in this country when compared with other countries.  Enterprise Ireland, for example, effectively operates as the largest venture capital company in Europe.  It takes equity stakes in very small companies and finances them at a very early stage and this is experience that we would like to share.  Interestingly, in the context of our co-operation with the United Kingdom, this is an area its authorities have examined and they believe the offering they provide to small companies is not as good as the range of programmes we offer.  It is interesting that this is the area in which they would like to gain from co-operation with Ireland.  We wish to focus on access to finance and are working with our colleagues in the Department of Finance and with the European Commission to get a strong focus on that around the time of our informal competitiveness Council.</p></speech>

While I acknowledge that Enterprise Ireland does fantastic work, it is in a very narrow area.  For example, there is nothing there to help or support an Irish company that is in retail, for example, were it to expand within Ireland.  I acknowledge there is high jobs growth in the technology sector and so on but I believe there are many other sectors that should be but are not being considered.  We cannot ask Enterprise Ireland to do all of that when its framework is very specific in respect of the role it must play.  This is a matter that should be brought into consideration.  In addition, I asked about regulation and how it is viewed across Europe.   I gave the example of food and would appreciate a response in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-29a.64" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Murphy" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013012900008#K00700"><p>I apologise.  I meant to revert to that question.  On the remit of Enterprise Ireland, it is focused on companies that are or can be in the export sector and that is for very good reasons.  Were Enterprise Ireland to try to get involved in funding every small business, one would have a huge deadweight and displacement impact.  That does not mean there the State cannot do things through other programmes.  Consequently, the provisions to improve access to finance or to working capital, for example, would be extremely important to the retail sector.  Moreover, the Deputy must remember that every job supported by Enterprise Ireland and the IDA in turn supports jobs in the domestic economy, which is the sector about which she essentially is talking.</p><p>  On the question of regulation and how it is enforced, there are different issues in this regard.  First, there are issues concerning licensing and who administers regulations, how they are administered and the manner in which that can impose a burden on businesses if they must deal with several different authorities which might have slightly different requirements.  This is something that recently has been examined, at the request of the Minister, by Forf&aacute;s, with a view to bringing forward proposals to try to streamline licensing.  The starting point for this will be the retail sector, because that sector is particularly affected, especially if one has a combination of food and drink or of food on or off the premises and so on.  There can be a large number of different licensing requirements to be met.  In the area of markets, there are many vibrant markets, including within the Deputy's own constituency, and I have attended many of them over the years.</p></speech>

We had to close such a market because the women needed a particular licence to produce food at home and a licence for a market stall.  It was not viable to keep it going.  That does not happen in France.  A person in France can produce something and sell it on the street without any problems but we cannot do that here.  Those are the issues of concern to me.</p><p>  There was an older issue where if a person traded at the side of the street for years, he or she almost automatically received a trading licence but there would be no piece of paper.  There is a great difference between us and other parts of Europe.  The committee might look into this in greater depth.</p></speech>

There will be a chance at our interparliamentary committee meeting on 28 April to discuss the whole area of entrepreneurship and the blockages that exist for small business.  We can tease that out formally then.  There is an informal meeting in March but we can formally discuss this in April.</p></speech>

What is the breakdown of those directives?  I have not seen anyone carrying out regulatory impact assessments.  It is difficult to find out who is in charge of a section in the Department and who analyses the impact of the various EU directives that are being transposed into Irish law.  Who is responsible for this?</p><p>  On the administrative burden for small firms, statistics in a report by the Bruegel think tank in Europe showed only 1.2% of European businesses are classified as large companies.  The remaining 98.8% of EU businesses are small and medium enterprises and of those, 92.1% employ fewer than ten people.  The focus of the Department, however, seems to be on Enterprise Ireland and the IDA.  The report also stated that 85% of all new employment will be created by SMEs and the vast bulk of SMEs employ fewer than ten people.  The emphasis is totally placed on companies with in excess of 50 employees, but the bulk of new employment will come from those companies with fewer than 50 employees.  I see nothing to give me any hope that the Department recognises that.</p><p>  Almost 85% of administration costs are associated with EU directives.  In 2008, the Government decided to reduce the administrative burden on businesses by 25% by 2012, irrespective of any change in Government.  That was the policy that was to be part and parcel of planning in the Department.  Are we close to achieving that target considering the burden of administrative costs is very high for small companies?</p><p>  EU procurement was mentioned.  No section of the Department seems to be responsible for procurement, it appears to be the responsibility of the OPW.  Is there any contact between the OPW and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation?  How regularly do they meet?</p></speech>

We have heard about it in countries like Spain and Greece but the figures from Sweden are a surprise, where there is up to 24% youth unemployment.  The issue is clearly linked to the global problems in finance and banking.</p><p>  On the reform of state aid, ESB, An Post and Telecom &Eacute;ireann were vital services.  Today broadband is as vital and I welcome Commissioner Almunia's report that states the revision of several state aid frameworks in strategic areas such as regional aid, environmental aid, risk capital and broadband are being looked at.  Was Ireland pushing for these changes in broadband, in particular, because despite the national broadband plan, there are still wide areas of rural Ireland where there are problems that could be directly addressed by state aid?</p><p>  What record does Ireland have in terms of procurement of services across the EU?  Do continental countries have greater chances of procuring services from neighbouring countries within the EU?</p><p>  If there is a mandate for the EU-US summit, what are the inherent dangers for Ireland from such a free trade agreement?</p></speech>

That falls for consideration and informs negotiation by individual member states as discussion on the draft legislative proposal goes forward but, as the Secretary General said, it is a matter for each Government Department to use RIAs as a kind of bargaining tool or a counter in the debate in EU working groups if they want to change the Commission proposal.</p></speech>

It would be incorrect to say the Enterprise Ireland programmes, for example, are totally focused on larger firms.  It has a suite of programmes which are focused on very small enterprises and at ways of helping them to grow.  In fact, the vast majority of Enterprise Ireland's 3,500 portfolio firms are SMEs.</p><p>  It was said that 84% of administrative costs were associated with EU directives.

We are directly involved in progressing that initiative.  We have been working with other Departments to do a base-lining methodology and to apply it to whatever measures are being taken to see if it is reducing administrative costs.  I can tell members that we have just about achieved that objective ourselves, in particular through improving customer service in the areas where we directly interface with business - for example, the Companies Registration Office, in the health and safety area, in the industrial relations area, in work permits and so on.  </p></speech>

There is a general principle that state aid is allowable if one can demonstrate that there is a clear public interest and that there is clear evidence of market failure.  In the case of our proposed broadband plan, we would argue that both of those tests are satisfied and, therefore, it is possible to devise ways to implement it which meet state aid requirements.</p><p>  The Deputy spoke about procurement and neighbouring countries.  The statistics show that the vast bulk of public procurement tends to be accessed by firms within the country concerned.  That is certainly the case in Ireland.  I expect that there would be slightly more open markets in say the Benelux countries where distances are smaller and a country on either side of a border is effectively in the local economy.  </p><p>  The Deputy also referred to an EU-US trade agreement.  At a level of general principle here, the EU and the US are the two largest trading blocs in the world and there are significant potential gains from an appropriate trade agreement but there must be balance and reciprocity.  We would certainly be anxious to secure a mandate on that basis because we see significant potential gains, in particular for Ireland because we are a small open economy and we are strongly represented in the sectors of interest to trade between the EU and US.</p></speech>

We further scrutinised and delivered reports on 12 proposals.  There was much work involved and we thank the officials for that.  We also had three pre-Council meetings.  I am conscious of the comments made that we are a bit behind with this report but I stressed that we felt it was better to have pre-Council meetings as well.

Agreed.</p><p>  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy O'Sullivan, and her officials, Mr. Philip Nugent, Ms Aileen Doyle, Mr. Niall Cussen and Mr. Aidan Culhane, to the meeting.  I draw their attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give this committee.  If a witness is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and the witness continues to so do, the witness is entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of his or her evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also wish to advise them that any opening statements or documents submitted to the committee will be published on the committee's website following this meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I welcome the establishment of an independent planning regulator and hope that the Minister of State will in her contribution this afternoon outline the precise functions of that regulator.  Members will be aware that this recommendation arose out of the Mahon tribunal and is one of the steps necessary to restore public confidence not alone in the planning process but in politicians and the body politic.  The integrity and independence of the planning system in Ireland is of fundamental importance to how local government and the body politic operates.  The perception of this is as critical as the integrity around how the system works.  We are all aware of the disrepute to the system down through the years.  Since the foundation of the State there have been approximately 1,120 Deputies.  While the appearance of any number of Deputies before a tribunal is unwelcome there were only a handful of them involved.  In any event, the fall-out from the tribunal has been huge and has left a huge black mark and stain on Irish political life.  It is hoped that the creation of this regulator will go a good way towards repairing some, if not all, of the damage done by those handful of individuals.  </p><p>  I now invite the Minister of State to make her presentation.</p></speech>

While I propose to engage with Members in terms of their views on the role of that regulator I will first provide some background information.</p><p>  We must never forget that the work of the tribunal opened a window to a time when the greed and profit motive of developers and land speculators, rather than the wishes of the community, were the drivers of our planning process.  It must also be remembered that the reason we are faced with severe fiscal and economic challenges is past obsessions with property and property development rather than the type of economic and spatial planning that secures lasting and sustainable economic and social development.</p><p>  While much has changed since those times, we owe it to the people of Ireland to ensure that those dark days cast under the spotlight of the tribunal are consigned fully and finally to the history books.  Accordingly, the challenge facing us as elected representatives of the Oireachtas is to fashion a comprehensive and appropriate response that demonstrates that the political system has learned from the tribunal's work and is determined to apply that learning to the planning process. </p><p>  I am confident that the members of this committee will agree with me that the overriding goal must be to restore trust by the public in their democratic institutions.  The Government gave a commitment to embark on this path after the publication of the Mahon tribunal report, the recommendations of which were far-reaching.  As regards the planning process, as Minister of State with responsibility for planning, I am determined to deliver meaningful reforms of our planning system that will act on the tribunal's recommendations, while continuing with further changes and other measures to ensure the absolute integrity of the system and that planning is in a position to contribute fully to economic recovery.</p><p>  The establishment of an independent planning regulator is one of the most fundamental recommendations in the tribunal report.  I am determined to see this recommendation comprehensively considered and appropriately acted on.</p></speech>

Today is an interesting exercise and the Minister of State has posed wide-ranging and pertinent questions.  We are used to draft legislation, which is very helpful, and in many ways we all endorse the findings and recommendations of the Mahon tribunal.  One of the most important measures put forward by the tribunal was the idea of a planning regulator.  The tribunal indicated that centralising all the powers under the Minister was unhealthy, and the tribunal's finding possibly related to the happenings being investigated by it.</p><p>  The Minister of State has posed questions and I am sure she has done some advance work on the issue.  Does she see this as a quasi-judicial planning regulator with the power to compel witnesses?  The Irish Planning Institute favours this idea, along with the idea that it should be based with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I note the comments of the Minister of State in that regard.  She is right to state that the position is never black and white and one must consider the impact on the work of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It would be helpful to hear the Minister of State's views nonetheless.</p><p>  Planning is a very complex area and councillors play a very central role.  We must ask whether they are really equipped to handle the role they have.  The idea of training courses for councillors seems to be almost essential at this stage.  If the Minister of State is contemplating this, does she see such courses as being mandatory?  That would be important in order to restore any confidence that may have been lost with the planning code, and every level should be examined from the ground up to ministerial level.</p><p>  The idea of transparency was examined by the tribunal very closely as the issue only came to the fore in the tribunal process.  We must now ensure that transparency is evident at all stages.  Will the Minister of State elaborate on that idea?  No matter how good a job we do with the structure put in place, if we are left with a void in transparency, it will be very damaging in the long run.  Bringing that transparency about will require much deliberation as we should accept it is a complex area that is difficult to embrace.</p><p>  These are my main concerns but I am very appreciative of the exercise being conducted by the Minister of State by raising questions in advance with us.  I thank her for the effort.</p></speech>

They were very informative.  I agree with the Chairman's comments at the outset regarding the small number of people elected to the D&aacute;il who have been found guilty of any form of corruption during that period.  Since the foundation of the State, a great number of local representatives have been elected and very few of those tens of thousands of people have been found guilty of any wrongdoing.  Having served on two local authorities, I see it as a great shame that all councillors and Deputies are labelled with the brown envelope culture.  It is right for the media to highlight this issue where it has been found but we should not be slow to argue that the culture does not affect most councillors or Deputies.  That is my experience of people across the political divide.</p><p>  With regard to the transfer of powers, tens of thousands of people have served at a local authority level, with a handful found guilty of corruption.  I wonder if there had been tens of thousands of planning officials since the foundation of the State, how many would have been found guilty of corruption if investigated?  That is not to take from the great work done by planning officials around the country.  They have always been honest and sincere, doing the job to the best of their ability.  Nevertheless, any area like banking or planning could have people looking to gain improperly.</p><p>  I have concerns about setting up a new planning regulator.  We can have a discussion with the Minister of State, who must answer to the D&aacute;il.  As a Deputy I could find it difficult to contact somebody in An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I have made submissions in the past but the level of accountability does not compare with that of Ministers.  With the current planning process, there is a development plan and the Minister of State mentioned there are over 400 of these.  With the newly reformed local authorities, there will not be as many plans and the workload for the Department will diminish.  I understand that it is currently quite cumbersome.</p></speech>

The first is that we would have greater notification of county development plans.  Currently, they go on public display but the notification often does not reach the public.  Members of the public will often come to see one as a councillor and say that he or she did not see the advertisement in the newspaper.  We could have greater notification of that.  Second, we could have a clearer set of criteria on rezoning - that it must be justified.  The Minister of State has gone some way with that in terms of her core strategy, that it must be justified on the basis of population and to take account of whether the services are in place, is there a need for the rezoning, and such planning would not be done on flood plains.</p><p> In terms of the putting through of a material contravention, the current position is that two thirds of the council members present must vote in favour of it.  I suggest that in the case of rezoning we would seek to introduce a similar system.  In a council with 25 members, two thirds of the members would number 17; I am familiar with those numbers as there were 25 members on the council on which I served.  I suggest that the vote of two thirds of the members of the council would be required for a rezoning.  In other words, the vast bulk of councillors would have to be in favour of it and it could not be done late in the evening when half of them have gone home, as happened in Kerry County Council the other day in regard to a different matter.</p><p>  In terms of the standards in public office that have been in place for about the past ten years, most of the scandals pre-date that time.  We have strict standards in public office and the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, with which we and councillors must comply, has been a very positive development.  We have done some of the work on this area.  We are setting about reforming local authorities but we must not kill them altogether and we must not kill the power of the Oireachtas.  We need to be careful about that.  The Minister of State might respond to me on that matter.</p></speech>

It is clear that our system favoured landowners and developers and we have ended up with a very costly outcome and it is incredibly expensive to service that by way of wastewater treatment plants, social supports, public transport and so on.  We should not have such a narrow focus on what corrupts a process.  We have also had examples of good behaviour and we have got to learn from those.  In Kildare we took a strategic approach, for example, in our development plan in the mid-1990s which was a strategy for the development of the county, where we indicated the amount of land that should be zoned and how that would match against the population.  It transformed the approach taken and after that the area committees did the work on the pieces of land that would be appropriate.  That would have been informed, for example, by whether the land was subject to flooding or other constraints.</p><p>  If we put the systems in place we influence behaviour and it is correct that a more strategic approach is taken in terms of having a core strategy but there must be some test for that core strategy and some sanctions if it is deviated from because there will be a temptation to go marginally over or whatever.  I am not saying that everything worked out perfectly in Kildare but the approach taken reduced the more negative impacts the plan might have had.</p><p>  The Mahon report refers to the regional authorities.  I thought the regional authorities had quite a positive impact.  I refer to page 2543, under planning, which recommends what each regional authority should be required to do.  There could be an enhanced role for regional authorities and there should be a connection between land use and transportation planning.  There should be a social plan that goes along with the physical plan because there is no point in building a great number of houses if there is not the necessary capacity in schools or the ability to deal with what is required.  When putting together a core strategy that strategy would have to be informed by the deficiencies in terms of the social supports, be that schools, leisure facilities, transport or whatever.</p><p>  The democratic aspect of this process should be retained but with sanctions.  For example, when a council is preparing a county plan it will have its regional plan but it is when it gets to local area plans that zoning happens.  No one has a greater understanding of that than the people living in the locality.  There are checks and balances in this area and they should be in place when it comes to the ability of people to remove from the process people whose decisions they do not approve of.  That is what our democracy is supposed to be about.  </p><p>  There can be conflicts with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  There is the question of whether it should be entirely independent but there is a value in it being independent.  There is no rush to create more quangos.  If we examine the cost of our not having proper regulation in place, are we prepared to repeat that mistake?  There are areas where regulation gives a financial benefit over time.  I would favour an independent body rather than being hooked on a body that has a responsibility to make decisions and have regard to them but that does not have to take on board the plans.  I consider that to be a conflict with An Bord Plean&aacute;la and that is a concern I have.  The National Roads Authority provides a better example in this respect.  There has been great frustration over the years about where it was separated off, where it went too far in terms of a democratic oversight or the lack of it.</p><p>  I presume I will have an opportunity to make a submission separately and to speak on the second item on the agenda into which the Minister of State has strayed.</p></speech>

We can have bad practice in good times where people believe anything is better than nothing in terms of development.  It is just as important to have good systems in place now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-29a.130" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013012900007#J00200"><p>The first three contributions were interesting.  What has come across is the importance of, on the one hand, balancing the independent role of a regulator but, on the other, ensuring accountability.  Deputy Stanley, in particular, referred to the accountability of the Minister answering questions and similar accountability at local level and we must get that balance right.  Transparency is an element of this.  There must be transparency in the system in order that the public knows the basis on which decisions are being made.  A number of the recommendations in the Mahon report relate to transparency, for example, giving reasons a Minister makes a decision, publishing advice he or she receives and ensuring where councillors engage with the planning process and comment on planning applications and so on, they do so in a transparent way. Other actions have been taken and more will be taken and they are aimed at ensuring that whatever decisions are made, the public knows the basis for them.  If somebody is doing something that does not appear to be in accord with advice given, the public should know that and know what was the advice.  Transparency, therefore, is hugely important in that regard.</p><p>  The issue of evidence-based plans and making decisions on the basis of core strategies was raised.  Whether that relates to, for example, flood plains or projected population growth when deciding on zoning for housing, everything should be done on the basis of the evidence available.  We want that to be a core element of forward planning at every level.</p><p>  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; raised the question of whether the regulator would have a quasi-judicial role.  I do not see that as the way this office will operate.  It is not about individual decisions; it is about ensuring the forward planning process is pursued in the way it should be on the basis of evidence.  However, the Senator raised the issue of education and that will be part of the role.  He asked whether the regulator was likely to come under the remit of An Bord Plean&aacute;la or an independent body.  Deputy Murphy specifically stated it should not be An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  If it is to be An Bord Plean&aacute;la, it will have to be done in a way that there would be a clear separation from its current role in individual planning applications, including those appealed or referred to it.  There would have to be a clear differentiation between the roles.  The downside of having a separate, new, independent body is that we could be setting up what might be described as another quango.  We have to make a decision on that and I value the opinions of the committee members in this regard.  The Ombudsman's office is another possibility but, again, there would have to be a clear division between the roles and there could not be confusion about straying into the role of the body we opt for, if we go down that route.</p><p>  Deputy Stanley raised a number of accountability issues and he referred to the fact that the vast majority of public representatives at local and national level are not in any way corrupt and they want to do a good job.  I agree with him but it is in their interests that we have a system that is clear in how it operates and that is based on a strategic system of forward planning, which takes into account the needs of the various areas.  It must done at the right level and, therefore, the local area plan must be in accordance with the county development plan, which, in turn, must be in accordance with regional planning and the national spatial strategy in order that they are all in synch with each other.  On that basis, public representatives will be able to do a good job.  They will know what are the parameters and they will have clear information as to the basis of the decisions they make.  They want to play their role using clear information and the core strategies are very much part of that.  As the Deputy said, much of the basis for the Mahon report recommendations was a long time ago.  Many changes have taken place and the planning process has been developed considerably since then.</p><p>  With regard to communication with the public, there are clear requirements for consultation on the drafting of plans and prior to the final adoption of plan but I take the point that we should ensure that this is notified.  Perhaps we should use social media, for example, and ensure information is clearly conveyed to the public.  I will take that on board.</p><p>  Deputy Catherine Murphy stated that Kildare County Council adopted the core strategy model at a much earlier stage whereby councillors examined what the planning needs were and what were the limitations of land and so on and organising its planning in that way.  That is what we want all local authorities to do now and that is why the various measures have been put in place.  The regional authorities have a significant role and under the reform of local and regional government planned by the Minister, it is intended that they will have an even broader role in spatial planning and economic planning for regions.  They have the capacity to significantly engage in this area.</p><p>  I agree with the Deputy that checks and balances are required.  She referred to local area plans and pointed out that people understand these but we have to make sure they are required to be in accordance with the entire hierarchy of planning.</p><p>  One of the roles of the regulator might be to have a watching brief to ensure the various plans at the different levels are in accordance with each other.  I do not know whether annual reviews could be conducted or whether the regulator should address queries when somebody says a plan is not in accordance and brings that to this attention but these are some of the areas in which the regulator could operate.</p></speech>

This is D-Day for planning in Ireland given that the Minister of State is here with the recommendation to implement the policy of the Mahon tribunal which is accepted by the Government as a whole.  We have to call the Mahon tribunal what it was: the planning matters, payments and corrupt payments to politicians tribunal.  Given that it took it 15 years to deliberate at a cost of &euro;300 million to the taxpayer, the people want to see an outcome and responsibility.  Some people wanted politicians taken out tarred and feathered and are disappointed that did not happen.  What the Government can do is implement its recommendations and that is what we are about today.  In regard to payments to politicians, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, has brought new proposals to Government on that.  As the two are interlinked, I had to mention them.</p><p>  In regard to the fixation with zoning, I was a member of Dublin County Council at the time.  Deputy Brian Stanley said it all when he said not all politicians had a fixation with zoning.  Not every elected councillor or Deputy had a fixation with zoning.  There are bad apples in some carts.  There are other politicians who strive at all times to do their best and we should not tar them all with the same brush.  We are all aware of zoning that has been driven by developers and speculators.  In all the planning Acts the phrase used was &quot;have regard to&quot; whereas the new Act provides that it must be responsible and must have &quot;heed to&quot;.  Whatever system is put in place, it must be accountable and a methodology must be put in place for imposing sanctions on those who do not carry out their functions because we do not want to spend 15 years asking what to do if something goes wrong.  There must be accountability, openness and transparency.  Independent oversight of all development is important but it is not always the panacea and the be-all and end-all of everything.  We had an independent regulator who was supposed to regulate the banks and it did not regulate them in the way it should have done.  The Mahon tribunal cost &euro;300 million and the bank crisis has cost &euro;36 billion.  Independent oversight does not always bring about a responsible outcome.</p><p>  Politicians are elected to be responsible to their communities.  Participation by citizens is an important part of planning.  It is important that citizens' input is available at local area level in respect of local plans and local development.  While issues may be decided that are in the best interest, there is, however, a great deal of the NIMBY - not in my back yard - syndrome in planning.  If there is a reason to deviate from an agreed plan, at whatever level, the reasons must be written down and explanations given.  That is important because sometimes an issue may come to light that was not on the plate when the area plan was drawn up or it might conflict with another.</p><p>  The regional authorities have a huge role to play in regional planning, as I witnessed in Dublin and Kildare.  However, what is in the interest of Dublin may not be in the interest of Kildare or <i>vice versa</i>.  The regulator will also have to oversee the regional spatial output and input in respect of Dublin and Kildare.</p><p>  The Minister asked if the power should be fully transferred.  Who is accountable and how does one get accountability?  One can be sacked, de-selected and unelected but one should be accountable.  How is a regulator to be made accountable?  I ask the Minister to reconsider the removal of all powers from politicians in this respect because democratic accountability is important.  Section 140 of the Local Government Act has been amended as there was an abuse of the section.</p><p>  The issue of enforcement is probably one of the most important elements.  I spent a long time as a member of a council, as did many others present. The question often asked was whether funding was available for enforcement.  A table should be drawn up in each local authority showing the costs and what has been done rather than an excuse being offered that the authority does not have the funds or the staffing.</p><p>  Perhaps the Minister of State will respond to my question on the directive.  I do not think it changes any of the planning enforcement issues but is merely seeking the enforcement already provided for and stating that one has to be accountable.  I ask the Minister to include the executive of the council given that she has required the senior officer to provide regular updates on enforcement activity and outcomes to the director of planning and the manager.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State and I welcome this extremely important report, arising from the Mahon tribunal.  I was a member of Dublin City Council when some of the events covered by that tribunal took place.  In particular, I am thinking about the Quarryvale module.  It was not a planning matter - it related to the sale of lands, but nevertheless it was of concern and was included in the tribunal's recommendations.  My constituency, Dublin North-East, includes the Baldoyle, Portmarnock and Cloughran areas where substantial rezonings occurred as a result of the 1993 Dublin County Council development plan.  The Mahon report made strong comments about those decisions and payments made at that time to some councillors in Baldoyle and Drumnigh.  The report also commented on the Cloughran rezoning, which did not proceed although that was not for the want of trying on the part of those who wanted it to happen.</p><p>  It has also been said that the property bubble of the Celtic tiger stemmed from the inappropriate zonings in Dublin in the 1990s.  Today, with negative equity and unfinished estates, we are living with some of the fallout from that.</p><p>  The Minister of State asked whether the independent regulator should be An Bord Plean&aacute;la or a new body.  I take the point that we should not rush into establishing a new quango.  We need to bear in mind that some of these planning decisions were made during the making of city and county development plans, which is an open, accountable and democratic procedure.  We need to bear in mind the need for a level of democratic accountability in creating city and county development plans.  I would favour having An Bord Plean&aacute;la as the regulator.  In recent decades An Bord Plean&aacute;la has been demonstrated to be an independent and competent body.  Its decisions have been broadly welcomed.  I agreed with An Bord Plean&aacute;la overturning Dublin City Council's decision on Ballsbridge on the basis that it felt the council was not adhering to its own development plan.</p><p>  Deputy Stanley talked about the brown envelopes which definitely went on and was mentioned in the Mahon tribunal.  I understand that is being addressed by an anti-corruption Bill, about which the Minister for Justice and Equality recently brought a report to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  The brown envelope stuff will be covered in that.  Action needs to be taken.  We cannot overlook and sweep under the carpet some of the things that happened there.  I take the point that it was only a small number, but that small number was able to bring about majority decisions and some people in negative equity are living with the consequences today.</p><p>  I also want to talk about the important issue of planning enforcement.  Priory Hall is probably the worst example of the lack of planning enforcement.  If proper planning controls and enforcement had been in place, that fiasco would not have happened.  Local authorities need to give greater priority and more resources for planning enforcement.  For example, during the property boom Dublin City Council was supposed to inspect 15% of all developments.  I do not believe it was even inspecting 5% of them.  Many things were let slip and the matter needs greater priority and resources.  While I accept we are not in a property boom now, nor is it likely that we will be in one, these things come in cycles and in ten or 15 years we do not want to repeat all the mistakes that were made as often tends to happen.</p><p>  I welcome the report and I would tend to favour An Bord Plean&aacute;la as the independent regulator rather than setting up a new quango.</p></speech>

She has a very important task ahead in dealing with the fallout from the Mahon tribunal.  We need to get this right because we have had a history of poor planning decisions with which many of our people are now living as a result of the corrupt activities of some people.  It is critical that we weed out that type of thing from our planning systems.</p><p>  I will not mention again the concerns a number of people have raised on enforcement, transparency, etc.  When a person makes a planning application to a local authority, will there be any means, possibly through a register, for determining if that person has made a donation to any political party?</p><p>  Regarding a material contravention of a development plan-----</p></speech>

However, it is also important in enforcement.  When we received submissions and presentations on pyrite, many of the people who were evaluating that substance had not necessarily received the training to recognise its impacts or even to recognise what it could possibly do.  Is the Minister of State considering providing training for elected members?</p><p>  Much of the work on planning applications takes place in the early stages when a developer is investigating the potential for a planning application.  Perhaps all of this should be required to be documented on the full file even if it does not result in a planning application so that there is some record that can be referred to in the future regardless of whether it continues to a full planning application.  People should be aware of the planning that takes place prior to the submission of the application.</p></speech>

The Mahon tribunal made 64 recommendations and only ten of them relate to planning.  Much of the corruption-related issues are being dealt with in other ways and do not relate to my responsibilities on planning.  Today, we are specifically focusing on the forward planning area, but many other actions are being taken as a result of the Mahon report that will restore confidence in the political system.</p><p>  Senator Keane spoke about the importance of transparency and ensuring the public know what decisions are made and why.  She also referred to ensuring that where there were material contraventions the information was publicly known.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-01-29a.146" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1084" speakername="Luke Flanagan" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013012900010#M00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for her presentation.  The issue of training seems to arise repeatedly.  I am sure anybody who has been a member of a local authority will be aware that there is training provided, but the problem is the quality of it.  When I first became a member of the local authority, I did not know a great deal about planning but I went to one planning conference and discovered I knew a great deal more than those conducting the conference.  Is there any way to guarantee it will be legitimate, proper and good quality training, not merely a trip to the Ring of Kerry?</p><p>  Will the matters I came across as a county councillor happen again?  If one is a building developer and a county councillor, the first problem is how one defines who is a building developer.  I have my definition of it.  In my experience, those who could be defined as building developers have been chairmen of planning strategic policy committees.  In one situation when the development plan was being voted on, two of the three councillors in an area were developers or, depending on the results they came up with at the end of it, destroyers.  What will be done to prevent that happening again?</p><p>  The Minister of State may be aware that in a local authority there are councillors to whom one would go to get planning and there are councillors to whom one would go to guarantee one would not get it.  By the end of my term on the local authority, it was quite clear - I had to tell constituents this - that a person would have to keep away from me if he or she wanted to get planning because they would not give it to him or her.  As a county councillor, I took up the role of enforcer, reporter, complainer and pointing out if something went wrong.  As to my reward, even my brother said they would not go to me for planning but they knew to whom they would go.  Whatever system the Government puts in place, and while it is a difficult matter, it should ensure these practices are not repeated.  I found it frustrating that one could get punished for doing right.  That is my tuppence worth.</p></speech>

That is why we want to put as much transparency as possible into the system.  For example, there are ethics declarations required of councillors, as well as of representatives in the D&aacute;il, in the context of declarations of interest.</p><p>  The other element is that there is a recommendation that comments which councillors make on planning applications should be recorded appropriately.  Most councillors would welcome that because at times they are quite confused about what they can and cannot do.  They look at the kind of councillors to whom the Deputy referred getting things done and wonder whether they are supposed to do likewise.</p><p>  I would be interested in the Deputy's views on the following.  Councillors, like members of the public, must pay when making a comment on a planning application.  We are looking to possibly waive that fee, but the balance on the other side is that their comments would be fully recorded on the planning file.  I certainly would favour that kind of a relationship of councillors with planning so that they are entitled to an opinion but that the opinion would be publicly known.  Perhaps that would address some of the Deputy's concerns.</p><p>  Obviously, there are the issues we have already addressed with regard to transparency and giving reasons where one deviates from a plan, etc.  All of that would also address some of the issues he raised.</p><p>  On the training area, the Irish Planning Institute has offered to assist with the training of councillors in particular.  I would be minded to accept its offer.  It is a body of professional planners and that would help the quality of the training.  Obviously, there are other bodies which provide training but that would address that issue.</p></speech>

The Minister of State raised a point about how county councillors and Deputies must register their interests.  How rigorous is that system?  In the past month, I made a complaint to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges about a Member of the D&aacute;il which was investigated, and the conclusion was more or less that the Member forgot to put it in.  When I sent the report to the Standards in Public Office Commission, it told me that as the person is not an officeholder, the matter does not concern the commission.
