    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-19a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Teresa Heeney" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2016101900002#A00300"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to present here today on the very topical issue of early childhood care and education in Ireland.  It is timely that we have an opportunity to meet the committee to discuss current issues in this regard.<br/><br/>We are happy to be here to discuss how best we can best contribute to the development of a robust and comprehensive early years strategy and to ensure a bright and sustainable future for early education and care in Ireland.  Today, we would like to talk about the three major and interconnected challenges facing the early childhood education sector in Ireland, which are quality for children, sustainability for services and their staff and affordability for parents.  We will focus our submission on the issues of quality, sustainability and affordability.<br/><br/>Well-qualified staff are essential for the delivery of a quality early education and care system.  The difficulty faced by providers in retaining and recruiting well-qualified staff will not be resolved until the issues of low pay and poor conditions in the sector are dealt with.  Low pay cannot be addressed without proper funding that also supports sustainable business models for child care provision.  There can be no positive progression in any of these areas without recognition of their interconnectedness and significant targeted investment by Government.<br/><br/>Our input today is based on our contributions to the recently established national collaborative forum for the early years care and education sector.  It is also informed by our analysis of budget 2017 and our new report , which was launched by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, on 29 September, with which I know some members are familiar.  The previous Oireachtas joint committee made a very useful policy contribution in its in January this year.  This committee is well placed to continue this particular dialogue.<br/><br/>There are three strategic priorities for this sector, including quality, sustainability and affordability.  In regard to quality, in our recent budget submission we set out the immediate requirements to ensure we can build the quality of early education and care.  We argued that improvements to the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme will contribute to quality as they will address the professionalisation of the sector.</p><p>We called for an increase in the level of capitation with a ring-fencing mechanism to ensure that both service sustainability and staff wages are addressed.  We also called for the extension of the current ECCE programme contract by three weeks in 2017, reflecting an investment in non-contact time for early years professionals.  In our submission we also recommended the creation of a new permanent learner fund to cater for the continuous professional development needs of the sector.  <br/><br/>These investments in the infrastructure of the sector are essential to underpin quality.  Budget 2017 partially addressed the second aspect of this quality agenda, that is, the extension of the programme contract by 1.4 weeks or seven days, through the provision of an additional &euro;14.5 million, representing a significant recognition of non-contact time.  We warmly welcome that initiative because it will allow us to build on the number of days in the coming years.  We are disappointed, however, that the other suggestions relating to ECCE capitation and continuous professional development have not been advanced in budget 2017 and consider these as matters for urgent attention.  <br/><br/>We were equally disappointed that there was no expansion of paid parental leave in this budget.  There is growing research evidence on the beneficial outcomes for a child of being cared for by a parent for at least the first 12 months of life and we have strongly advocated that position.  Prior to the introduction of two weeks paid paternity leave from September 2016, Ireland was one of only nine European countries that had no paid paternity leave.  Since its introduction and together with the provision of 26 weeks paid maternity leave, Ireland now offers a total of only 28 weeks of paid leave compared to the average of 76 weeks for parents across Europe.  We are also mindful, however, that there is a commitment in the programme for Government to extend this leave.  The programme refers to the Government's intention to &ldquo;significantly increase parental leave in the first year of a child&rsquo;s life&rdquo;.  This was also recommended in the inter-departmental group report.  <br/><br/>In addition to these initiatives, we believe that the Government needs to initiate a new plan for the early childhood education and care workforce to ensure that there are sufficient numbers of well trained and well qualified staff in the right places across the country.  That plan must be linked to any plans to further extend capacity within the sector.  The Government also needs to work with the sector to agree a set of recognised salary scales<b></b>for early years educators and introduce subsidies so that those salary scales can be met.<br/><br/>We also strongly support the inclusion of child minding in the new single affordable child care scheme announced in the budget.  There has been much controversy about that issue in recent days.  We have long been concerned about the numbers of children being minded in the informal and unregistered child minding sector where the cost of care is sometimes lower but where there is no regulation, oversight or inspection of quality.  We hope that the new scheme will lead to a much greater engagement by childminders and we are encouraged by the current work of Childminding Ireland and the Department to advance this.  We would like to offer our support for these efforts over the coming months.  <br/><br/>We also welcome the introduction of the Access and Inclusion Model, AIM, a model of supports designed to ensure that children with disabilities can access the ECCE programme.  AIM is very new and a lot of monitoring needs to be done on its implementation within the sector.  It only commenced in September 2016 and we are monitoring its implementation very carefully.  We are anxious to see AIM extended throughout the early education and care sector to ensure that children with additional needs in all child care settings can avail of appropriate supports and not just those availing of the free preschool year.  We are committed to working constructively with the Department, Better Start and the sector to that end. <br/><br/>I will now move on to discuss sustainability and viability for early childhood care providers and their staff.  Some elements of the quality agenda also have a bearing on the sustainability of child care providers and their staff.  It is critical, in addressing the short-term and long-term challenges to sustainability, that the Government bases subsidies on a realistic assessment of the cost of providing child care.  The financial viability and sustainability of child care providers needs to be a key concern of policy makers and not just of the providers themselves.  The Government must address the structural deficiencies in the current funding model, whereby low State subsidies lead to low margins and keep the sector from fulfilling its mission.  The levels of subsidy underlying the design of the single affordable child care scheme, as well as the existing ECCE programme, must be based on a realistic assessment of the cost of providing child care with adequate margins.  Our recent report, Doing the Sums: The Real Cost of Providing Childcare in Ireland, provides useful insights into the sustainability challenge for the sector right now.  Among the key and worrying findings of that report are that the average child care service in Ireland, whether private or community run, urban or rural, operates on a break even basis.  Even when a surplus is generated by a child care facility, it is often too little to meet the cost of reinvestment.  In addition, there is a clear trend for providers towards an ECCE-only or free preschool year only model, alongside out-of-school care, in an effort to remain viable.  This has led to a reduction in the provision of non-ECCE child care such as year-round full day care and care for children under the age of three.  Indeed, I was at a meeting of the Tusla consultative forum last Thursday and that agency confirmed that its recent re-registration process showed a clear trend towards ECCE-only provision.<br/><br/>We know that our report and the analysis and recommendations that are built into our research are being studied carefully by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and will contribute to the design of the single affordable child care scheme.  It is also likely to serve as a useful starting point for the Minister&rsquo;s own study on the cost of child care, as committed to in the programme for Government.  The report of a recent review of the status of community early years services in Cork and Dublin called Breaking Point will further contribute to the discourse.  We look forward to working closely with the Department to ensure that we can add value to the Government&rsquo;s own efforts to address the sustainability challenge.<br/><br/>In order to advance this agenda, the Government also needs to develop a capacity plan for the sector.  This must be based on evidence of need and set out the numbers and locations for provision, as well as measures to address the most effective and efficient setting size mix, subject to geographic and other factors.  We are also aware that the Department intends to launch a new report on school age child care in the coming weeks.  That report must outline a new model of out-of-school care that is regulated, subsidised and avoids displacement.  The Departments of Children and Youth Affairs and Education and Skills need to be cognisant of the important role out-of-school care plays as well as the danger of displacement to the viability and sustainability of many child care services in the planning and development of any new out-of-school care model.  We have made a number of submissions to this process and have included a briefing note setting out our position in the appendix provided to committee members.<br/><br/>We must also eliminate disincentives so that providers can offer a full suite of child care services.  The Government needs to carefully construct its supports for early care and education so that it does not inadvertently create disincentives and barriers to services providing a full suite of child care for children up to the age of six and out-of-school children.  We would also like to, once again, recommend to the Government that it makes all early education and care provision exempt from commercial rates because of their educational nature.  The current inducement to providers to move to an ECCE only model needs to be addressed immediately, where all community and private child care providers offering ECCE-only services are exempt from commercial rates. <br/><br/>I would like to spend a little time talking about affordability.  In budget 2017, the Government made provision for the introduction of the new single affordable child care scheme from September 2017, including both targeted and universal elements.  We strongly agree with the approach that underlies the budget announcements which includes a new child care subsidy for children under three that is universally applied, as well as the development of a new consolidated and enhanced targeted scheme so that families on low incomes can avail of greater supports on a graduated basis, thus directly addressing the needs of children at risk of poverty.  We also agree with the approach whereby the State pays the provider or registered childminder directly to subsidise the real cost of child care, in keeping with the international research I referred to earlier.  However, the initial &euro;19 million investment in 2017 must be increased consistently year on year.  We envisage that the universal scheme should achieve a minimum subsidy equivalent to approximately &euro;60 per week for full-time care by 2021.</p><p>We also believe the targeted element can be further developed to ensure its efficacy in the coming period.</p><p> It is critical that we get the single affordable child care scheme right from the start.  The new scheme must be planned and developed to ensure it provides a comprehensive and coherent system of supports for all children availing of child care, including the free preschool year and out-of-school care, as well as providing a flexible and robust platform for all future investment.  The design of the scheme must be informed by the knowledge and expertise that the sector has to offer.  Preparations for the scheme must include a comprehensive consultation and engagement process to ensure that the voices of providers and parents are heard.  We believe the new early years forum is one step forward in that consultation.</p><p> The scheme must recognise that a one-size-fits-all approach will not suffice and that one level of capitation will not work everywhere.  For example, where the needs in particular communities must be addressed or where there are geographic factors at play, it may cost more to deliver a service.  The universal level of capitation needs to be supplemented, where required, as part of the overall scheme.  Moreover, the new scheme needs to be based on year-round supports and incorporate non-contact time and continuous professional development for all staff.  It must allow parents and providers to interface with a single, accessible and coherent system of supports.</p><p> We look forward to working with the committee, the Department and the Minister to develop this infrastructure.  I am happy to take questions from the committee.</p></speech>

I have one question in connection with some of the criticism directed at the new scheme.  It relates in particular to those who stay at home.  Ms Heeney may have covered this point, so I apologise if it has been covered already.  The problem is those who stay at home to take care of their children should be recognised financially in some way by the Government.  That is what people are saying.</p> <p>  I imagine several people here watched the television programme - I get confused between "Claire Byrne Live" and "Prime Time".  Anyway, no one on the programme was happy with the new scheme.  I imagine no one would leave the house at that time of night to go on a television programme unless they had something to complain about.  Yesterday in the Seanad it struck me that everyone on all sides of the House seemed pretty happy with the scheme.  Those in Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il as well as many of the Independents seemed, for the most part, happy with the new scheme.  What are the views of the Early Childhood Ireland representatives on the points made by those who stay at home and on the criticism directed at the scheme generally?</p></speech>

We will take two or three questions at a time and then you can answer them.  I call on committee members to ask specific questions.  Deputy O'Sullivan is next.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-19a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1325" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2016101900002#C00500"><p>I compliment the Early Childhood Ireland representatives on the work they do.  They have been working constructively in this area for a long time and their contribution to the debate is really important.</p> <p>  By and large, we all welcome the scheme.  I maintain it needs more money but its introduction is welcome.  I suggest it needs more money because the focus is on making it cheaper for parents and families, and that is fair enough.</p> <p>  Some of us were at a presentation in the audio-visual room yesterday from Department officials.  They gave us a great deal of information on how the scheme would actually work for individual families with different levels of income.  The presentation provided details in respect of people with lower levels of income who already have supports under the current scheme and how they will benefit from the new scheme.  The presentation was informative but it made the assumption - I imagine the assumption is reflected in the figures - that parents would benefit entirely from the extra money.  However, one thing was left out and that was the question of low pay in the sector.  The fact that the work is not year-round and that there is no continuous professional development written into the costings presents a problem.  I am keen to hear from Early Childhood Ireland around that area.</p> <p>  We all know of the highly qualified and highly motivated people in the sector who want to continue a career in early childhood and who are passionate about the importance of the early years for children.  However, they are living on the minimum wage in some cases and low wages in general.  This is because anything else is not affordable for the providers.  In many cases the providers are the owners of the operations.  In the case of small operations they are probably trying to run the whole thing and survive at the same time.  Affordability for the sector is crucial.  How does Early Childhood Ireland envisage what needs to be done to give the role the status of someone teaching in a primary school, for example?  In primary school the children are a little older.  Although teachers might complain about pay levels there is recognition of the fact that they have to live for the whole year and not only term time.  My question is really around that.</p> <p>  I have a second question around the monitoring of the access and inclusion model programme.  It is important to monitor the programme and give the relevant information to parents, because many parents who have children with special needs are not yet aware that the new scheme is available to them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-19a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Teresa Heeney" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2016101900002#C00600"><p>I will deal with one or two of the points made and then pass over to my colleagues.  I will manage the allocation and tell them what they are going to talk about.  There was a question about the criticism of the scheme.</p> <p>  There has been such historical under-investment in the sector that it is impossible to imagine that anything could have been introduced in the budget which could have met all of the needs.  However, what is to be welcomed is the policy shift and how it represents new strategic infrastructure.  That is to be welcomed because this sector has been tormented by a piecemeal approach over the years, where &euro;5 million was allocated here, &euro;2 million was given there and then &euro;3 million was given elsewhere.  In other words, there was no tied-up thinking and no thought to the unintended consequences of policy initiatives in the past, perhaps.  From that point of view if there is a tacit welcome, it is because of the infrastructural and strategic nature of the scheme.  Mr. Geoghegan will take the question about parents.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-19a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. D&oacute;nall Geoghegan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2016101900002#C00700"><p>I suppose we are familiar with the media narrative around this.  Sometimes it tends towards a mammies war between those who stay at home and those who are working outside the home.  Perhaps that does not really capture the true dilemmas facing most parents.  Most parents mix and match it.  In some cases they send their children to a formal child care setting some of the time.  At other times care will involve the grandmother or grandfather.  Sometimes care is provided by a local childminder and sometimes it involves neighbours etc.  That is the reality for most parents.</p> <p>  Many parents do not have much choice, especially those on lower incomes.  They find it rather difficult to access quality child care in child care settings and childminders.  We see the new scheme as playing a role.  It is the start of something rather than an end point.  It is the start of helping parents to be able to better afford quality child care in child care settings and registered childminders, thus taking some of the burden from parents of having to fill in themselves or ask others to fill in.  In some cases, parents do not like asking their own parents to help out.  It will bring about greater choice and balance for parents.  There are many other issues that could bring us down the rabbit hole of trying to pit parents against each other, something perhaps not altogether useful to the advancement of the child's best interests.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, I am not in a position to pay anything more than the minimum wage.  My staff give a lot of extra time that they are not paid for and I mean a lot of non-contact time.  As an owner-operator running a small business I often forego a salary because I am not in a position to pay myself.  I am a mother of two children and must provide for a family so that incorporates me taking an outside job.  I provide a sessional service so I do not work for the summer and, therefore, I take on a summer job in order to keep things afloat.  I also tutor part-time so I have evening and weekend work throughout the year.  That is the only way I can keep my family afloat because I make nothing and when I do it is often re-invested into my small business.</p> <p>  One of the things that make life difficult for me is rent.  Recently I became ECCE-only because I cannot afford to pay commercial rates.  My service is located in a small town.  I might mind three or four children and their parents pay &euro;5 an hour.  The sums do not add up enough for me to pay commercial rates.  The situation has pushed me into providing an ECCE-only service, which disappoints me as a Montessori teacher.  I must focus on the ECCE year or the year before a child goes to school, which goes against the grain because the Montessori method focuses on children aged three to six and, therefore, I should incorporate the wider age range and have children learn from each other.  </p> <p>  In terms of continual personal development, we are constantly upgrading and working.  We must meet requirements all of the time like first aid, manual handling and fire safety.  We are the only service in my county at the moment that has been placed on the link programme.  That is another area that we are considering and training in.  I have also just begun a masters programme.  The link programme is great but the funding for the rest of the training has come out of the small pot of money generated by my service.  We love our work and are passionate about it but we are not surviving and that makes life difficult for us.</p> <p>  I hope I have answered the questions.</p></speech>

We have about 4,600 services in Ireland and the number is increasing.  A number of services close every year but there are still about 4,600 services, which amounts to more than all of the primary and secondary schools put together.  All of the services require inspection and mentoring and all of the State infrastructure needs to happen in 4,600 services.  This is part of the reason that Early Childhood Ireland believes that a capacity planning exercise is essential.  We need to know how many services are needed and where they are needed in exactly the same way as the Department of Education and Skills knows where it needs schools to be located, how many and the number of pupils attending.  We take the view that the same must happen in the early childhood sector.</p> <p>  Of those 4,600 services about 1,100 services are provided by one person.  We must be mindful of that fact and analyse whether that is a good model or the best model.  It is inevitable that we have a one person model because the current level of capitation is simply not enough to employ two members of staff.  In 2014, 14% of the staff who worked in the sector signed on the dole for the eight weeks of summer because no capitation was provided, which is another cost to the State.  The situation does not do anything for the recruitment and retention of well qualified staff, which is the essential reason quality and sustainability are so interconnected.</p></speech>

I could ask any amount of questions about the early years sector.  I am also interested in the appendix.  The out-of-school care discussion should be the next topic for discussion as it is an important one but I shall stick to what is particularly topical at the minute.</p> <p>  I am interested in hearing the views of the witnesses on parental leave.  There has been considerable discussion about the options open to parents who stay at home.  The value of parents staying at home with their children for the first year is well recognised.  As well as extending the number of weeks, certainly anecdotally at least, my experience is that many parents feel that the rates are unsustainable.  Many parents feel that even if there were more weeks the rates are such that the situation is unsustainable and it is impossible for them to stay at home with their children.  The point made about rates is important.  </p> <p>  I am interested in the access and inclusion model mentioned by Deputy O'Sullivan.  Is the targeted scheme for children aged 6 months to 15 years robust enough and suitable for the older children in the scheme?  I have expressed the view that what has been done for child care professionals is inadequate.  The initiative of having 1.4 weeks to seven days will not cut it and is not good enough.  I am also disappointed at the lack of continual personal development, CPD.</p> <p>  Most Deputies and Senators broadly welcome the new scheme but we would like further investment.  I have two concerns about the capacity of the scheme and the first is capitation.  This aspect was touched upon by the witnesses.  The findings in the report are alarming because it states that if six babies attend on a full-time basis for 52 weeks then the baby room will operate at a loss.  How does the delegation think the capitation system can be reformed?  </p> <p>  There is a link between capitation and qualifications.  The learner fund has not been expanded.  Not only does it make it difficult for facilities to operate it also keeps workers, who are primarily female, in relatively low-paid employment.  It also does not offer an opportunity to develop.  </p> <p>  I am concerned that there is not a great deal of space available, particularly in urban centres.  On the one hand, the Department seems to have said that it does not anticipate a huge increase in demand but on the other hand, it has said that it expects increased labour market participation, which is a contradiction.  This matter is already in the public consciousness and I imagine that there will be an increase in capacity.  I am concerned that some providers will increase their rates, which will swallow up an element of the additional subsidy, particularly in big urban centres where demand is high.</p> <p>  Yesterday, members attended a briefing on the scheme provided by the Department, which was welcome.  I asked whether caps were ever considered for rates to ensure that it did not excessively swallow up the additional subsidy.  I am curious to know whether Early Childhood Ireland has explored such an initiative.  Ms Heeney spoke about the need for a capacity plan to be provided before the sector expands further.  Does the ECI consider a cap to be a good a idea, particularly at this early stage before capacity expands?</p></speech>

I thank Ms Hilliard for outlining what her work entails.  I have worked in the sector and managed a cr&egrave;che for three years so I know where she is coming from.  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire correctly pointed out that the baby room works at a loss.  Believe it or not, the toddler room works at a small loss as well and one does not make money until ratios change.  That is how it works.</p><p>I can understand why the model is going for ECCE and after-school care.  That is where the money is, because the ratios are 1:10 or 1:11 and that is where my line of questioning is coming from.  I look forward to the witnesses' responses.</p><p> I have a concern about the sustainability of the entire sector.  Ms Heeney says there are 4,600 services throughout the country.  In respect of the breakdown in terms of community versus private, the private sector has rents whereas in the past, the Government gave the community sector a subsidy to get started or community providers do not have to pay for a building.  They are now all getting the same payment or allowance because everyone is coming under the one bracket.  I am worried about both community and private providers.  I do not know how they are going to make a penny.  It is wrong that a professional must take a part-time job during the summer.  We must respect and support people in the profession.  I have a concern about community versus private.  We do not want to pit mammies against mammies and we do not want to pit professional against professional either, be they public or private.  </p><p> I thought the learner fund would have been expanded.  Ms Hilliard is studying for a master's degree.  More people in the sector want to undertake them, as well as FETAC levels 6 and 7.  I was hoping that this fund would come in so that whenever a cr&egrave;che said "my girls are ready.  We want to progress.  How can we support them?  Can we go to GMIT in Galway or wherever?", that fund would have been made available universally so that the managers of cr&egrave;ches could have applied for it.  I was concerned about that.  </p><p> One Parliamentary Question I have tabled since the budget last week asked about the number of registered child minders who are registered on the Tusla system.  I received my response this morning and the answer is 119.  There are 4,600 services and another 113 Tusla-registered child minders who will be able to avail of the funding.  We then have the gap involving approximately 70,000 children who are minded by unregistered child minders or whatever.  I would like to hear the witnesses' thoughts on that because they did say they were prepared to work with them and bring them in under their wing.  Is there a policy shift in respect of where they see this going?  There are more children are being minded by unrecognised minders who will not avail of the service than there are of those who will.  </p><p> The Minister made a comment on radio last Saturday about cr&egrave;ches being open longer and later.  I would love to hear the witnesses' point of view on this.  I have been a mother and provider and I know that routine is the most important thing you can give a child.  What are the witnesses' opinions on the idea of cr&egrave;ches being open longer and later - from getting staff to do it onwards?  It was batted around the large urban areas that this would be a model we could investigate.  </p></speech>

There is no doubt that many services operate riskily.  There is not enough margin to reinvest in their service and we hear constantly from our members about issues like entering into agreements with the Revenue Commissioners.  In respect of delayed payments through the programmes implementation platform, PIP, system, the committee is lucky it does not have to interact with the PIP system because it drives demented those members, such as Ms Hilliard, who do have to deal with it.  It is basically the infrastructure with which they must interact to log the details.  It is a huge system.  Too frequently, there are delays in payments or a provider expecting a payment of &euro;5,000 might get &euro;2,500 and does not know why.  Those things have a significant impact where people do not have the money to pay their staff because there are no margins.  They are down at the credit union trying to get bridging loans to pay staff.  I think Ms Hilliard will probably be able to speak more to that.  The idea of it being marginal is very real.  Any blip in the system has a huge impact.  A member was in touch with us last week.  Her payment was delayed and the Revenue Commissioners put an attachment order on to the payment.  This meant that they did not want to pay the provider because there was an attachment order on the payment.  They are very real-life issues for these people who, let us not forget, are delivering a service on behalf of the Government.  They are doing something under a contract with the Government.</p> <p>  There is no added incentive for all of the people working in this sector to continue to upskill and increase their qualifications.  Early Childhood Ireland carried out a survey of qualifications in the sector last year.  We now think the average hourly rate of pay is in the region of &euro;10 to &euro;11 per hour but it goes up to &euro;12 if someone is a graduate.  For anybody with a calculator, &euro;12 per hour, 15 hours per week, 38 weeks of the year might get you a salary of about &euro;7,500 per annum.  Nobody with a degree will want that job.  There is no hope of car loan, mortgage or any of those things.  They are the essential issues we must think about because it is so important that we retain the best quality staff working in these services, as Deputy Jan O'Sullivan pointed out in respect of trying to become comparable with primary schools.  </p> <p>  The question about capacity is important.  We have to take an informed view about what this affordable child care scheme will do to capacity.  The data are available.  I believe the Department of Education and Skills has all of the data that are required to be able to develop a capacity plan for the sector.  We could probably also do an assessment of where we think the ratios of parents' choice will shift.  At present, about 40% of parents use relative care, if you want to call it that.  About 30% of parents use a more formal childminding arrangement and about 30% used centre-based services.  The challenge in the first instance is to make the single affordable child care scheme available to parents who use centre-based services and formal childminding arrangements.  Relative care is a bit more tricky from a constitutional point of view, probably in terms of what is seen to be a private arrangement.  In respect of planning for capacity, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs has taken a point of view informed by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission that it is a private sector and a private market and that it cannot interfere in what is seen to be a private market.  I use that word in a legalistic way.  We have long taken the view that we could get another barrister who would give us another point of view because I think the Government must take a point of view on provision and ensuring all the services operate in a way that does not displace others, is sustainable and available to parents and does not promote anything approaching prices going up.  As an aside, I would say that the cost of providing child care must go up quite substantially because the current costs are being delivered on the back of very poor wages.  The cost of provision must go up pretty dramatically.  Obviously, this cannot be passed on to parents.  Ms Hilliard might want to say something about fees, demand and whether fees might go up because of the scheme. </p></speech>

All of us are there because of a love and a passion.  Nobody wants to put an extra burden on parents, but, as providers, we are stuck in the middle.  We are talking about quality for children, but we have to talk about quality for staff as well.  It is not possible to separate them.  What position are we left in?  I do not think any provider wants to, but it is a possibility that they might have to increase their rates.</p></speech>

All operators that deliver the free preschool year - it is virtually every operator in the country - must submit a fees policy to their local authority child-care committee.  Therefore, it is very easy to develop a monitoring mechanism to take a point of view about fees because it is already gathered and available.  I have no doubt that some monitoring will be put in place.  Speaking on behalf of providers if something were to be introduced, somewhere along this whole plan the cost of providing child care has to be increased because it cannot continue with the current level of subsidy that is delivering the story that Ms Hilliard is describing.</p></speech>

In our submission for the budget we stuck to the subject of increasing the number of weeks of parental leave up to the year that Ms Heeney mentioned early on as being very important for a child's development as shown by a considerable amount of research.  We did not get into the rates to be paid; we have some materials but we decided not to put those in it.  It is just on the basis of trying to increase the number of weeks.  Obviously, the rates paid for maternity leave and subsequently for paternity and parental leave are very important for that as well so we agree with that.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the potential for capping fees as a possible solution.  We have got advice from some economists on this.  If we were to do so now, we would lock in unsustainability for the sector.  In other words, if everything that Ms Heeney mentioned in terms of the cost of child care were to be locked in and we capped fees right now, the sector would continue as it is with low pay, low margins and low prospects.</p> <p>  Deputy Rabbitte is absolutely right in saying that we need to think of the sector as a whole and not seek to divide it into its various parts here and there - school age, baby room, etc.  If mechanisms are put in for one element, for example one age group or one particular provision be it community or private, it has effects throughout the entire sector.  We need to consider it as a whole sector and not divide it.  Importantly, the Department of Education and Skills has some responsibility in the area of ECCE, the free preschool year.  That Department cares about children from the age of three, but it has no responsibility below that.  We believe that is divisive and it could become increasingly divisive over coming years.  We need to look at the sector as a whole - all the age groups, urban-rural etc.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the availability of parents in the evenings and that type of thing.  We need to talk about such issues.  The underlying principle that should inform any decisions about availability and accessibility at various times, including in the evening or whenever, must be the best interests of the child.  It is about the child's best welfare.  Let us talk through those kinds of issues and come to conclusion on them.</p></speech>

Ireland has the highest birth rate in Europe and has done for decades.  However, conversely we have the worst possible child-care arrangements.  We broadly welcome this engagement and I said so in the Seanad yesterday.  It is a kick-start.</p> <p>  Money has been allocated for the recruitment of the social care staff.  Where will those staff come from?  Will they be under the auspices of the HSE or under the auspices of the private care providers?  I understand there are about 50 community child-care centres.  Just last week the F2 centre in my area in Rialto was threatened with closure.  Will this help them survive in the community child centre?  It is community based.  The rent for the building is provided for.  There is certainly a big uproar from the parents in the area and the staff in the centre.</p> <p>  How does Ms Hilliard feel this scheme will help her practically?  Are there any positive implications for her right now?</p> <p>  I would be wary of the over-regulation of care by grandparents or other relatives.  It is more within the community.  I dread becoming a grandparent because I really do not want to look after children.  I have done my time.  Many grandparents would feel the pressure to do it.  This may well help them to say, "No" and send the children elsewhere.</p></speech>

As most of the points have been made, I will not be repetitive; there is nothing more annoying than that.</p><p>The point has been made that there have been many initiatives over the years.  We have had subvention, this scheme, the ECCE and a number of years ago we had an additional payment over and above child benefit.  For a number of years parents received that payment quarterly.  That was probably geared more towards stay-at-home parents.  The problem has been the <i>ad hoc</i>approach.  There has been no implementation of an early years strategy.  If there was, at least we would be running to a strategy.  It is very topical at the moment.  I welcome that the mindset appears to be changing.  In reality this is probably because it has been so topical over the past two years.  Is this just patching over something?  Will it be something else next year and the following year because we are not running to a strategy?  I ask the witnesses to give their opinion on the fact that we have no early years strategy.  Would having one be of greater benefit?  This scheme might not necessarily have come about in the way it has.  It might be done in conjunction with the education system with community and private providers working together.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-19a.34" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Teresa Heeney" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2016101900002#F01000"><p>There have been a couple of mentions of AIM, the access and inclusion model.  I will assume that not everybody knows about AIM.  It is a complex model for the inclusion of children with additional needs in early years settings.  It has three elements that are universal and are targeted at all services.  Ms Hilliard referred to the LINC training, which is leadership for inclusion.  That training course has begun and 900 people are training in that at the moment.</p><p>Other elements of the universal aspects of the model include the development of diversity and equality guidelines, and there is training currently under way for that as well.</p><p> The elements that require much greater monitoring are the targeted elements.  These address the needs of specific children.  That includes access to equipment, access to mentors and it also includes access to additional capitation to employ somebody, either to reduce one's ratio or to employ an additional member with a grant.  That is all in the mix.  We are watching with interest what comes out of that and are talking to members who are engaged in that process.  An application for funding needs to be made by an early years operator with a parent, which is a positive shift because it is not diagnosis led.  It is a strengths-based approach where an operator and a parent can say, for example, that Johnny is able to do A, B and C but he cannot do D, E and F and will need help for that.  Those applications are currently in train.  We know from some of our members that they have received the additional, higher capitation, which is good.</p><p> To answer Senator Devine's question, the member of staff will become an employee of the service of the operator, which is also a shift.  Up until now, the member of staff may have been an employee of a company contracted by the HSE.  These will be employees of the service.  Our members welcome that because it means that they can be included as a member of the staff team.</p><p> The Access and Inclusion Model, AIM, needs to be monitored very closely.  It was quite a departure in terms of policy.  There has been funding allocated to it, which is good because so many policies are launched without any funding attached to them.  This one has funding.  It is to be welcomed but we need to wait and see what the outcomes for children will be.</p><p> As to whether this scheme will help the community child care services, which is something that causes community services, particularly in disadvantaged areas, a lot of difficulty is the issue of bad debts.  Parents have had to pay &euro;70 or &euro;80 per child per week for child care if they have been on one of the previous schemes.  Those parents cannot afford that.  They do not have the money to pay it.  That becomes a bad debt that the service must bear.  It is a significant problem, and drives many services into an entirely unsustainable position.  This scheme changes that.  If the capitation level is sufficient, then one hopes that the State will not become a bad debtor for the service.  What happened previously, for example, in the Fatima centre, should not happened.  The same parents would be eligible for the scheme but the Government would be paying it and the parent should not. I did not see the presentation the committee member saw, but, as we have read and as we have constructed, that should be one of the consequences and benefits of it.</p><p> Before I let Ms Hilliard answer, I will finish on the issue about the early years strategy.  We need an early years strategy and we need to have a plan about where this is all going.  In response to Deputy Function, the notion that it could all peter out next year depresses me.  I would hate to see that happen.  Having an early years strategy would support a plan going forward.</p></speech>

With the payment for parents, as an ECCE scheme service, it will not affect me.  It will not make any changes for me.  What will affect me is the non-contact time, and that is very welcome.  More would be preferable but it is a step in the right direction.  That will benefit me.</p> <p>  As regards the strategy, this is the first year that I, as a service provider, have felt helpless and at breaking point, not knowing where to turn and what to do.  A strategy would help me because it would give me hope.  It would give me focus.  It would let me see the future, which I cannot see right now.</p></speech>

The European Union gives us country specific recommendations year on year.  The employers' bodies, year on year, call for investment, as do organisations, such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the National Women's Council and the Children's Rights Alliance.  The voices calling for investment in this sector echo each other all of the time.  The door, in terms of policy-making, is wide open.  One need not even push it.  The development of a strategy which all of the stakeholders could sign up to would show us the pathway as we proceed.</p></speech>

I am a little like Deputy Anne Rabbitte in that I have two sisters who were child care providers.  I am talking about 30 years ago and the horse has already bolted in my case.  It is fascinating to hear this and I only wish 30 years ago there was something like this where there was a measuring and monitoring of child care services.  I will address my question, which is probably not relevant, to Ms Hilliard.  Although my children are grown up, one of them, who is a teacher, would say that what is happening here with children coming from care providers such as Ms Hilliard is an incredibly positive development for the child who is more ready now for school than he or she would have been if he or she had not gone to a care provider.  I recall children screaming and crying at the school door.</p> <p>  Is there some sort of structure in place?  For example, one of the primary school teachers would have said that some children come in who do not know how to grip the pencil properly or some places may not be teaching phonetics.  Some places will have a refusal policy, in other words where a child does not have to engage in an activity if he or she does not want to.  Then there is the difference between playing and teaching.  My daughter would have said one can see in a class where there is a difference between the child who has been taught and the child who has not but who has been allowed to play.  Is there a uniform structure?</p></speech>

It is like an umbrella that embraces the many different curriculums.  We are working from an emergent interest of the child.  We are following the lead of the child.  It is unfair and unacceptable for me to promise any parent or teacher that by September I will have every child ready to write, or even to recognise, his or her name because every child develops at his or her own rate.  We, as providers, need to embrace that, acknowledge that and support the child in that development.</p> <p>  Many of us have good positive relationships with our local primary schools and the feedback we get is that for going into school, they would like the children to be independent, to be able to put their own coats on, to be able to follow some simple instructions, to be able to get their lunches out of their bags, and manage those daily routines, for instance, be able to go to the bathroom by themselves.  Those, for me, are the priority as the child goes to school because if a child cannot do those things, he or she will not be able to sit at a table for any length of time.  We need to satisfy the needs of the child, as he or she works through our services.  When the service is satisfying that need, whether that is to paint all day or play in the sand, the child learns many other skills and learns how to concentrate as he or she does it.</p><p>With that development, the child will eventually be able to come to the table and sit, but why would we ask a four year old to sit at a table for any length of time?  It would not be realistic or fair.</p></speech>

My anecdotal experience of schools with DEIS status is that people with a youth work background provide some of the out-of-school care.</p></speech>

I am looking forward to the report of the interdepartmental group.  The programme for Government committed to exploring the use of school premises to deliver on the policy issue of the need for affordable and easily accessible out-of-school care.  Some members of our panel made a presentation to the interdepartmental group during the summer.  We expect the report to be published in a couple of weeks' time.</p> <p>  Many factors arise.  It is a five year old and a 14 year old, so it is not easy to get it right.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs engaged in a consultation process with children about what they would want from an out-of-school setting.  I am interested in hearing what they said and seeing how impactful on the report's recommendations their feedback has been.  Were I to guess, the older children get, the more they want to go home.  If they cannot go home, they probably want to go to friends' houses.  If they cannot go there, they will tolerate going to their grandparents' houses.  It will be something else after that.  This is their voice and if we want to give children some agency in decision making, that is what we expect to see.  However, what children want is not always what they get and it may not always meet parents' needs.</p> <p>  We must ensure that we offer leadership at policy level in terms of what is good for children.  What is not good for them is an extension of their school day in a classroom that is not fit to accommodate them from 7 a.m. or 7:30 a.m. if their parents commute.  Ms Hilliard and I commuted into town this morning.  It took her two hours.  This is the reality for people.  We must be clear about what we are discussing and what we envisage when we talk about the use of school premises.  We mean that children aged five, ten or 14 years will be in that room from 7 a.m. or 7:30 a.m. until 6 p.m. or 6:30 p.m.  We must bring leadership to this issue and make decisions on whether this is in the best interests of our children.  If they set out on their school journeys at five years of age after having had a fantastic experience in preschool playing, as Ms Hilliard described, should that suddenly transform into being in a school from 7 a.m. until 6 p.m. until they are 12 years of age?  That is probably not what we want for our children.</p> <p>  The training needs of the people working with these children are complex and the sector is not regulated.  There is no inspection of after-school services.  A preschool inspector can walk into a service in the afternoon.  The door on the right-hand side will lead to the out-of school room and the door on the left-hand side will lead to the preschool room.  The inspector will go through one but not the other.  The children in one room are five years of age and the children in the other are six and a half.  The inspector will not go into the latter room because there is no regulation.  We must address the regulation of after-school services.</p> <p>  This all forms part of the infrastructure that Deputy Funchion alluded to when discussing a full early years strategy.  There is much to do.  The committee will not be able to stop discussing these issues for some time.</p> <p>  Does Mr. Geoghegan wish to answer the factual questions?</p></speech>

Deputy Rabbitte asked about the troubles experienced by many settings in terms of the arrangements that they make with Revenue, their staff turnover rates, etc.  We do not have much in the way of hard facts on this.  Our report, entitled "Doing the Sums: The Real Cost of Providing Childcare", showed that settings were doing their sums all of the time.  Ms Heeney mentioned the tendency to drop the comprehensive model of overall day care in favour of ECCE-only or ECCE plus after-school care.  This is a major factor.  Instead of closing completely, there is a tendency for settings to concentrate on those services from which they at least get a regular income.</p> <p>  I do not have direct answers for Deputy Rabbitte regarding the types of arrangement that settings reach with Revenue and so on.  However, we get calls everyday from our members who tell us strongly that they are experiencing major difficulties in keeping and recruiting staff.  Recently, someone told us by phone of how, after a key staff member left, she saw no prospect of finding a replacement in her small, rural area.  Something like this can cause significant difficulties.  It is not always about the national picture, overall numbers and so on.  It can be about what happens in a particular locale.  Ms Heeney referred to having a capacity plan throughout the sector for the entire country and an examination of where we need to build child care in the coming years.</p> <p>  I will comment on the Vice Chairman's question about what happens and the link between this sector and schools when children start going to school.  As a society, we undervalue the importance of play for children.  A phrase that is often used is "Play is children's work".  It is also their study.  They learn through play.  They learn to socialise, lead, follow, work as part of a team, fall out and make up again.  We adults need these skills throughout our lives.  Children also learn how to make sense of the world and interact with it, by which I mean objects and things as well as with people.  This lies beneath everything that has been happening in the Aistear curriculum development over the past number of years.</p> <p>  We do not want to "schoolify" this sector.  It has much to offer the future of schooling in terms of valuing play.</p></speech>

Since a full-blown and fully staffed Department that takes a policy lead in this sector is only emerging, we are at a loss for data.</p><p>This lack of data affected answering questions such as those relating to staff turnover or what percentage of services were closed.  It is welcome to see, for example, that Tusla will launch a new dynamic system for inspection reports.  These are currently available online but are not searchable.  The new dynamic system will include information about the registration of services because we are now in the world of registration and not notification.  All of these systems will help us because data will become available.  Whatever we do, we have to look to the evidence and, if the methodology is rigorous, believe what it tells us.  Having all of these systems speaking to each other will be useful.</p><p> There are many parties and partners in this sector, including the Department of Education and Skills and its inspectorate, Tusla and its inspectorate, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, Pobal and many other agencies.  It is vital they work together to plan the strategy to go forward.</p></speech>

We are here to discuss the national cancer strategy as a guide for implementing health care reform.  I think the programme is generally seen as one of the most successful examples of reform in the Irish health service in recent years.  I warmly welcome Professor Keane to our committee meeting.  Before I ask him to give his opening statement, I have a few formalities to go through.</p><p>I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Finally, members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I thank Professor Keane for joining us this morning.  We look forward to hearing his statement.</p></speech>

The concept of having such an all-party committee looking to the future is absolutely essential, when compared with what has always happened in the past.  Coincidentally, I am chairing an initiative for the Royal College of Physicians, Towards 2026, which members will hear about some time in November.</p> <p>  Returning to the implementation of the cancer programme, I thought it would be appropriate to try to go over the lessons learned.  This is all about implementation.  It is somewhat gratifying for me to look at the latest figures which show that patients who were diagnosed with cancer between 2008 and 2012 have a 60% chance of surviving five years.  This compares with a figure of 45% for patients who were diagnosed between 1994 and 1999.  I emphasise that this is a team effort.  There is a huge number of people involved at all levels of the system, from the Department through to the hospitals, doctors, nurses and administrators, and I would like to single out a couple of people for acknowledgement at the beginning.  Probably my biggest support at the time when I came to the position was from Tony O'Brien, who was then the director of BreastCheck.  He essentially became my deputy, and subsequently associate director of the cancer programme.  His knowledge of the Irish system compensated for my lack thereof and, without his help and advice, I probably would have fallen into many dark holes.  Similarly, I had three excellent advisers: Professor Arnie Hill for surgery, Professor Maccon Keane from Galway for medical oncology and the late Professor Donal Hollywood for radiation therapy.  After I left, the programme, as members know, was looked after by Dr. Susan O'Reilly, who is my friend and colleague from Vancouver.  She has now moved on to higher things, and the programme is now led by Dr. Jerome Coffey.  I am delighted to see it in such good health and progressing.</p> <p>  I will move on to the lessons learned.  The first big lesson is all about communication.  Communication probably took up 50% of my time when I was there.  The media were ever present, even outside the front door of my house when I came out in the morning whenever a controversial decision was being made.  I became quite familiar with the surroundings of Leinster House and got to meet virtually all the Deputies present at that time.  I appeared before the health committee, which gave me an opportunity to have a frank and open exchange with people in the political system about what we were attempting to do.  Communication with the clinical community in Ireland is difficult, and I used the colleges - the Royal College of Surgeons and the Royal College of Physicians, and the faculties within them - as a bridge to meet the medical leadership in Ireland.</p><p>This is an underused opportunity in terms of communicating change.  In the colleges, as I discovered with the recent initiative, there exists essentially the main medical leadership for the country.  There is a huge opportunity to have dialogue and influence with clinicians through the college mechanisms.  Similarly, I would say the Irish College of General Practitioners is another body which is underused as a communications tool.  I found it incredibly welcoming, eager to be engaged and generally surprised I was bothering to talk to it.</p><p> The issue of dealing with the public sector unions was potentially huge for us, given that we were going to require relocation of nursing and other staff in multiple hospitals.  Again, I found through sitting down and talking, explaining what we were doing and what we hoped to achieve, and outlining principles of fairness that we would adhere to as we went forward, that ultimately I received significant co-operation without any major public disarray.  Communication about change is the first, and by far and away the most important, priority.</p><p> The next important issue is leadership.  Leadership occurs at multiple levels when change is being made.  Obviously the focus was very much on me as the lead person, but the leadership at local level was invaluable.  The vast majority of oncologists in Ireland have been trained elsewhere.  They recognised that what we were putting forward was correct.  Even though it might not have suited their local jurisdiction, most of them in their hearts and souls knew this was not just an idea but an evidence-based idea, and that we were bringing forward change supported by strong evidence rather than a political whim.  Leadership at the political level I will come back to later, but I must acknowledge, and many committee members probably know, this was almost a pet project of the former Minister, Mary Harney.  She was the person who recruited me to come.  She was the person who drove most of the change.  I have to say that at the time her support and the support I got from the Government was invaluable.  I did not have to fight any political battles and I could focus on the job at hand.</p><p> With regard to support from the Department, and senior officials in the Department of Health, this is another important community.  They were very supportive and, in many ways, the cancer strategy had been fostered partly from within the Department so it had huge buy-in.  We were fortunate we had buy-in at multiple levels.  We had a strong evidence base for making these changes even though, I do not know how many committee members recall, there was much difficulty in some parts of the country.  On my first visit to Leinster House there was a very large demonstration on Kildare Street and I had to be taken in the back way because people were afraid they would recognise me.</p><p> Change in the medical environment, whether in Ireland, Canada or anywhere else, cannot be forced unless it is rational and supported by evidence, and people are willing to engage in dialogue to bring things forward.  There is an issue about dialogue in Ireland.  I was aware there was a real risk when I came regarding the strategy document, which was an excellent document produced over two years by the national cancer forum.  I regarded the document as sacrosanct and I refused to reopen it.  The danger I saw was that the risk of endless talk would pre-empt any implementation strategy.  I was much criticised for refusing to engage in a discussion on the strategy because I knew once I opened up the strategy then basically we would end up talking and I would spend my time in Ireland talking and not being action-oriented.</p><p> Another issue that was important for the cancer programme was the framing of the discussion.  Many committee members are aware that at the time there was a series of horrific instances of misdiagnosis, mainly around breast cancer but not exclusively.  I had made it clear to the then Minister, Mary Harney, that when I came I would refuse to engage on the subject of things that had happened before I had come.  I did not get drawn into many of those discussions, in fact I refused to engage, and I focused entirely on the future, saying if we had a better system these things would not arise.</p><p> There is another issue regarding cancer, which is misdiagnosis.  There is no perfect system for diagnosis in the world and a low level of misdiagnosis occurs in even the best system.  It was important to communicate to the public and media that a misdiagnosis, and this is particularly around mammography, did not amount to negligence or incompetence, and that there is a low level of misdiagnosis simply because one is looking for needles in haystacks, and at a certain level the discriminant ability of the technology and the human mind means is impossible to be 100% accurate.  This is important to recognise.</p><p> Regarding the level of evidence we brought to bear, I would say that in 80% to 90% of it there was significant evidence in the international literature and from other jurisdictions that what was happening in Ireland was not best practice.  We were able to point to comparators at the time.  Ireland was in the bottom quartile of the OECD tables for cancer outcome.  It was not as if we were arguing from a point that Ireland was doing really well and therefore we should leave everything alone.  There was a very strong argument that we were doing very badly.  The tragedies around misdiagnosis helped to focus the public mind on the need for change.</p><p> Several other issues are important in change, and these include talking to people who know what the problem is.  I was fortunate in being able to engage with a number of expert groups here, which saved me huge amounts of time and effort.  I met the Irish Thoracic Society, which is made up of most, if not all, of the respirology community responsible for diagnosing lung cancer in Ireland, and it had a clear picture of what the issues were with regard to delayed diagnosis of lung cancer.  I took the recommendations and we debated them, and, essentially, we moved to put in place rapid access diagnostic clinics throughout the country, which have been incredibly successful in granting general practitioners rapid access for their patients who have red flag symptoms suggestive of lung cancer.</p><p> Similarly, the coloproctology society, which represents most of the surgeons involved in colorectal surgery but particularly rectal cancer surgery which is highly complex, were willing to engage and agree that rectal cancer surgery should only take place in eight hospitals.  Without their support it would have been incredibly difficult.  Many of the changes were supported by the main community, even though there might have been individuals who, at a personal level, saw their situation being potentially negative.</p><p> Another issue is building trust.  This is something which must be earned.  We had a strong sense of the need to be accountable and very transparent in what we were doing, and to demonstrate integrity at all levels.  The programme managed to achieve this.</p><p>It built a trust within all of the communities that we were dealing with that, whatever else we were doing, we were genuinely motivated to do the right thing for the country.</p><p> I will turn to the necessary authority and resources.  Uniquely, no individual in a clinical leadership role previously had been given the level of authority that was given to me to allow me a free hand in making decisions.  I did not have to wade through layers of committees.  Even though I was technically a part of the HSE, I was functioning in large part outside it, in that much of the drive and energy for the programme emanated from the Department of Health.</p><p> Resource issues will always be paramount.  The cancer programme got significant additional resources in 2007 and 2008 before the financial collapse, but a considerable part of the programme's funding was a mobilisation of existing funds.  Whenever we closed a programme down in hospital X, we took the money that had been funding it and moved it to hospital Y.  Historically, this has been difficult to do.  Essentially, we moved the money to follow the patient or to where the patients were going to be.</p><p> I could go on at some length.  Nearly all of the lessons learned in implementing the cancer programme are applicable to any major health care reform that is going to happen in Ireland.

I wish to ask a couple of questions about the funding being separate, which he touched on at the end.   Did he receive initial funding to set everything up and, as programmes were closed down or moved between areas, their funding was also moved to keep the show on the road?</p> <p>  Will Professor Keane clarify the timelines?  The strategy document was prepared over two years, but was that the first action?  Was it accepted by the Minister of the day as the way forward?  How long did it take from the document's inception to the time the programme started?</p> <p>  A major issue was the choosing of eight hospitals.  How did that decision come about?  Will Professor Keane also elaborate on some of the political barriers he came up against and how he dealt with them?</p></speech>

As a trade union representative, I attended a number of his presentations.  There was early buy-in from the trade unions.  That was essential.  It would even have been the case in advance of Professor Keane's appointment, as the parameters for the buy-in had been laid down as part of a national wage agreement that had been negotiated previously in recognition of the fact that significant change would be required.</p> <p>  Professor Keane mentioned that he had been given autonomy.  To follow on from one of Deputy O'Connell's questions, to what extent was Professor Keane able to operate his own budget or was his work dictated - I do not mean that negatively - by the Department?</p> <p>  Professor Keane referred to how he operated separately or in tandem with the HSE.  Does the structure of the HSE lend itself to the type of ground-breaking change of which Professor Keane was in charge?  Has he suggestions on how to better match the HSE with large projects like the national cancer control programme, NCCP?</p></speech>

I was around for some of the debates on the implementation of the cancer care strategy and there was, by and large, buy-in for the project.  This was for a number of reasons, primary among them being that our cancer care was not what it should have been or what we as an ambitious country had hoped it to be.  Let us be clear, in that we were coming from a low base, so there was the potential for a quick improvement that the public could see and the politicians could support.  The clinicians and professional organisations recognised that change was required.</p> <p>  Professor Keane referred to the national cancer forum as being the body that devised the strategy.  Was that engagement, the strategy's development and then its implementation by Professor Keane a model whereby many issues, including the perceptions of the public, politicians and various stakeholders and vested interests of what was required, could be addressed?  Their support came in advance of the strategy's publications.  Was this model helpful?</p> <p>  As Professor Keane knows better than anyone, we have a complex health system.  Public and private are intermixed and general practitioners, GPs, are sole employees.  Did Professor Keane examine the private element of our capacity or did his work focus on the public health system?  In terms of physical infrastructure and personnel, Ireland is still short of capacity in the public system.  Did Professor Keane examine any of these issues to determine whether they could complement one another?</p> <p>  I am interested in Professor Keane's views on parking ideologies and examining the evidence.  Did the national cancer forum or individuals therein come to the table and examine the matter in an evidence-based and rational way as opposed to trying to make the strategy fit into some ideology?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-19a.67" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Tom Keane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016101900002#E00800"><p>Maybe I will deal with the issue of the forum, as it has arisen a couple of times.  I cannot be sure about when the forum published its document, but I believe that it was April or May of 2006.  The forum had been in session for a year and a half to two years prior to then.  It was a group of 20 or so people representing a broad cross-section of the oncology community with some representation from the Department.  I never heard people criticising the forum as being unrepresentative.  Generally, people accepted that it was a legitimately constituted group.  Its report is still available through the Government Publications Office.</p> <p>  The forum's members approached its work entirely on the basis of evidence.  They examined best practice.  Indeed, many of them had first-hand knowledge of what best practice looked like in other jurisdictions.</p><p>It did not have any ideological viewpoint and it did not essentially tread on the public-private issue.  I will come back to that later.  Essentially, the strategy document was endorsed by Government as the way forward.  However, there was a level of detail missing from the strategy document in terms of implementation.  It was not an implementation strategy.  In that regard, the then Minister and the senior officials in the Department visited a considerable number of jurisdictions, including Germany, the UK, the United States, Toronto and Vancouver, where I was, where they engaged with successful transfer programme operators on what they were doing and achieving.  This informed the Minister and the Department, in addition to the strategy, as to where they needed to go.  In essence, they decided to model the implementation and many of the features of the cancer programme in British Columbia, BC, which has a similar population in size to Ireland.  They saw that much of the BC programme was implementable in the Irish setting, which is what led to me being seconded from the University of British Columbia to Ireland.  For me, it was incredibly important to have a strategy document which the cancer agency in British Columbia had already reviewed and found to be excellent.  I had confidence that the strategy was good and did not require any further discussion.  When people would say we needed to re-open the strategy I would quote General George Patton, "A good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan executed next week", because I knew once the strategy was reopened all hell would break loose. </p><p> In terms of the timelines, the strategy was published in 2006.  Some time later in that year a commitment was given by Government to move ahead.  There was a national radiotherapy plan as part of that, that was the so-called Hollywood report, which was separate but part of the same broad initiative.  I was seconded briefly in late 2006 to assist in the drafting of the national radiotherapy plan.  However, an election intervened in 2007, the date of which I am sure members of the committee will recall.  Implementation by the HSE was very slow.  When the then Minister, former Deputy Harney, was returned to Government, she decided to retain the health portfolio and I then noticed a dramatic shift in the level of urgency from the Minister and the Department around implementation.  There was a period of delay between the publication of the strategy and the decision to have a more rapid implementation plan of two years, which I essentially drafted for the Minister and the HSE in August 2007.</p><p> We were not separate from the HSE.  At the time, I reported to Mr. Brendan Drumm and I did sit on the HSE executive but my focus was not around being a full and active member of the HSE executive.  I was situated in the BreastCheck office complex in Parnell Street and I had significant support from within the HSE in terms of HR and some other functions, which were very helpful.  I truly did have autonomy.  The Minister had told me I would have autonomy and that she would trust my decision-making but that she and Government needed to be kept in the loop.  To that extent I met with the assistant secretary, Fergal Lynch, every month and I gave him a heads up in terms of what was coming.  Basically, that interaction was all around communications.  At no point did the Minister or the Department ever push me in any particular direction.  If anything, they always reassured me to stay the course and to keep going.  The committee will recall that there were two Deputies from a constituency in the north west who pressurised the then Taoiseach, Mr. Ahern, and subsequent Taoiseach, Mr. Cowen, to yield on this issue.  I received phone calls from both of those individuals telling me to go ahead and that they would deal with the political issues.  That political support was incredibly important.  I did have autonomy.  Obviously, autonomy sounds like one-man rule but we still have a very good process within the programme for prioritising decision-making and for making decisions based on evidence.  </p><p> On the question regarding public versus private and whether I looked at the private system, the committee will recall that the Health Information Quality Authority, HIQA, was very active at the time I was here.  We laid out standards for the performance of breast cancer surgery, multi-disciplinary teams, MDTs and other technical processes.  Within a short time the private sector withdrew virtually completely from breast cancer surgery.  They essentially saw it as being incredibly resource-intensive and they did not necessarily have all of the personnel required to meet multi-disciplinary requirements.  There was no particular friction with the private sector.  Many of those involved viewed cancer surgery as being very resource-intensive and felt that in many cases they were not capable of meeting the requirements.  HIQA did commit at the time - which I thought was very important - to push for legislation which would ensure that were private hospitals to engage in cancer surgery they would be held to the same standards as the public system.  To my knowledge, that legislation was never introduced.  I believe that to ensure completeness that should occur.</p><p>  I was part of the HSE but given the HSE brand was not exactly a popular brand at the time it suited my purpose to be able to operate in an apparently independent mode.  The budget for the cancer programme was largely written into the HSE budget by the Minister and her staff.  I did not have to participate in the endless wrangling within the HSE over the HSE budget.  Essentially, the cancer budget was dropped in on top of the HSE budget by the Department.  That was incredibly helpful for me because I did not have to waste hundreds of hours engaging in negotiations with the HSE structure.  We were coming from a low base.  I found that people were genuinely appalled to see Ireland at the bottom of the league table.  We are a sporting nation and the idea that we were at the bottom of the league table and wanted to move up was picked up immediately by the media and it constantly repeated the message.  It is probably still true that we are not there yet.  While significant progress has been made there is still a lot of work being done and to be done.  The cancer programme has not gone away.  Owing to the demographic shift in the Irish population in terms of the population getting older Ireland is going to see a dramatic increase in cancer incidence over the coming two decades, irrespective of any prevention measures that might or might not be in place.  I think I have covered most of the questions.  If I have not, the Chairman might let me know.</p></speech>

That was a decision made by the cancer forum or a group working under the direction of the forum.

I expressed that I thought that was sensible.

As Deputies probably know, just having an agreement is not enough to make things happen.  The engagement with the significant leadership within the health care unions was civil, helpful and supportive.  There was much stuff that was really in the small print that was not necessarily in the agreement.  It required a level of trust on both sides that we would keep our word.  The last thing we wanted to do was to lose oncology staff when we wanted to retain them.  Most of the issues were around relocation.</p></speech>

They could see where it was going, and it was not seen as change simply for the sake of it.  There was an identifiable plan and significant political support for it.  That goes back to what we have been discussing at the committee, which is the big bang versus the small and incremental changes.  This was more in the line of a big bang but there was a very defined plan for health care professionals to buy into.</p></speech>

I do not know if Professor Keane agrees but the first point seemed to be identifying the problem, as there was a big issue with cancer then.  It was when Ms Susie Long died because she was a public patient and all the issues that came around it.  The problem was very identifiable.  It was then about implementing the strategy and getting political support.  In a way we are trying to look at that here as a committee, basing our outcome on evidence-based criteria for a national health service free at the point of entry, with equal access for all.  We must develop the evidence to put forward to the political establishment that this is the reason we need such an objective and how we can implement it.</p> <p>  Does the witness believe we need somebody from outside to implement any change?  He was seconded because of his experience in British Columbia, its history and background, and he was given a particular role.  Does he believe we need to consider somebody from outside, potentially, to implement an agreed strategy based on evidence?  Professor Keane made a point that really struck me about linking with colleges, speaking with people and negotiating.  It strikes me that the Limerick group has linked with the GPs, hospitals, chief executives and other strands of health care professionals in order to make something work.  It is something we should look at as a committee if and when we decide what kind of health care system we recommend.</p> <p>  Professor Keane made a point about legislation that has been introduced to ensure the private sector would have the same high standards as the public service.</p></speech>

My question is a follow-up to the previous question in a way.  The evaluation panel report in 2014 identified issues relating to legislation and structure.  What is the witness's experience with regard to the reform process around legislation?  The report also identified significant delays in diagnosis and treatment due to a lack of beds in admissions in accident and emergency departments.  Will the witness give his view on a national level regarding bed capacity issues, given his expertise in the oncology area?  The report indicated that seven centres for gynaecological oncology in a country of this population of 4.5 million seems excessive.  Does the witness have a view on that?  Do we need more centralisation of oncology services?</p></speech>

He hit a couple of key points relating to leadership, accountability, trust, funding and implementation.  Why is the implementation of reform so difficult?  Professor Keane's programme seems to be going in the right direction and it is working.  He stressed leadership and accountability at the start and they seem to come up in many debates that we have.  If this is working in Professor Keane's programme, could it be replicated across the entire health service?  One of the major points that comes up constantly is where the buck stops, who is accountable and who is taking leadership and ownership of the system.</p></speech>

It was an incredible advantage for me to come in from outside.  I did not owe anybody any favours.  People were searching through my CV to see which Dublin hospital I trained in and see what side I would be on.  In essence, I went out of my way.  I refused all social engagements with physicians, golf games and all the usual stuff so I could be seen to be totally impartial and not doing business in the normal way that things are done in Ireland.  It is an advantage if one comes from outside but if I had not come from Ireland and I was not as familiar with the Irish system, I probably would have fled after four weeks.  There is a complexity about the Irish health care system that is hard to explain to people from outside Ireland.  It was good that I was an outsider but it was also good that I understood the Irish system.  I hope that answers the question.</p> <p>  Cancer is a very discrete entity.  It is a very large disease.  After the cancer programme was well up and running, Dr. Barry White implemented what had been very successful clinical programmes around stroke, heart disease and a number of clinical programmes.  Essentially, they were modelled in a similar way to the cancer initiative.  In other words, they looked at best practice and decided where the complex care should occur.  It has already been demonstrated that this type of evidence-based approach can work and deliver results.  In many ways that does not require huge amounts of money.  It means that national standards should be developed, ensuring that those standards are met.</p><p>If one has to bring resources to the table, bring them and then be sure that this standard of care is provided wherever one deems it will be provided.  <br/><br/>One of the issues around all health care work, but particularly so in Ireland, is what I would call an attitude of &quot;it if wasn't made here then it won't work&quot;.  The problems of health care are the same pretty well in every country.  There are issues around hospital beds, emergency room waiting times, access and having joined-up care.  If there is a best practice model in Ireland, and I note that various groups have presented here already, it should be possible for a best practice model to emerge and then for that to become the national standard.  What seems to happen here is that everybody argues that their hospital is different and, therefore, we end up with a hodgepodge of programmes and differences across hospitals.  Coming from outside it is not hard to define what best practice looks like.  If one gets a bunch of experts in a room they can probably define best practice for most acute diseases.  I acknowledge it would be more difficult for some of the chronic diseases but it is not hard to do that.  What has been missing is what I call a clinical governance model and an expectation that once best practice is defined, then that is what actually will happen.  I believe physicians will support that move.  This committee will probably recognise that in order to make change happen it cannot be 16 different models of health care for 16 different regions of the country.  What one will have to look at is something that is fairly simple and straightforward.  Ireland only has a population of 4.5 million people so it should be possible to define a single standard that will work everywhere.  <br/><br/>Legislating that standards for the public and private sectors be the same is a no-brainer for me.  There was not very much in the way of resistance.<br/><br/>On the issue of the centralisation of other oncology services, gynae-oncology was mentioned.  I am not, quite honestly, up to speed on exactly how many centres provide gynaecologic oncology.  Certainly, from my experience in Canada, there needs to be a critical mass and given the population here, the number of centres doing gynaecological oncology would probably be relatively few for the whole country.<br/><br/>In terms of delays in diagnosis and access to diagnostics, there is a particular issue in Ireland inasmuch as the diagnostic centre is highly hospital-focused although things are beginning to change.  Clearly, to improve access to diagnostics, diagnostic facilities will have to be developed outside of the hospital sector, possibly attached to primary care facilities and there are pilot projects ongoing in that regard.  Right now, Ireland is somewhat unique in the sense that one almost has to go to the hospital to get an MRI.  One cannot get an MRI in the public system outside of the hospital system.  That is something that can change and there will be significant issues around implementing that change but they are to be faced.<br/><br/>In terms of beds, there has been a dramatic shift in how beds are used in Ireland in the past decade.  The amount of day surgery has risen by over 100%, as members will be aware.  In Canada we still have the same issue that Ireland has grappled with.  We have people in hospital beds who do not need to be in hospital beds.  We need to find alternative models of care to free up beds.  Finding more beds, and I had this argument with many people here, is not a solution to the problem.  The problem lies in identifying who is in a bed, why is he or she there and why can he or she not be somewhere else.  A considerable number of people who spend time in hospital beds in Ireland are there because there is nowhere else for them to go, and all the members are familiar with the problem.  There are lots of ideas out there about how to address the problem and I am not going to comment on it here.<br/><br/>In the area of legislation, one thing I strongly suggest, and is hugely lacking in Ireland, is a legislated clinical governance model.  Practically every day that I open <i>The Irish Times</i>online, I read about some other tragic case at the Medical Council of a doctor who was unable to diagnose or was clearly deficient in some area but had worked in two or three hospitals before somebody twigged to these facts.  Why should it be at the level of the Medical Council that issues around competency are determined?  There needs to be something at the level of the hospital where clinical governance ensures that the physicians or surgeons who work in a hospital meet a standard of care that is assessed and monitored locally.  In Canada, I ran a department in Vancouver that had 50 specialists.  Every year they had their appointment renewed based on their performance.  There was no such thing as privileges to practice for life.  Following appointment, one's performance was reviewed annually.  If one was deficient in some way it was identified and remedial action was taken.  We did not wait for that action to be such that when a patient suffered it ultimately was resolved at a higher level like the Medical Council.  There is a real necessity in Ireland for clinical governance.  There is lots of evidence available.  Ireland needs a clinical governance model that looks at credentialing quality of care and monitoring care at a local level, and not coming from 30,000 ft. to determine how things are going to be.<br/><br/>Beyond that, replicating stuff across the board will work for well-defined clinical scenarios.  The classical presentations for heart disease, chronic obstructive lung disease, asthma, etc. or for acute medical problems are well defined and their treatment pathways are well recognised internationally.  There should be no real difficulty in saying what is the standard of care, it is a national standard and we will hold people to that standard.  A lot of progress has been made through the clinical programmes of the HSE in some of those areas but it only points that that is the direction of travel.  We need a national monitoring system to ensure that every hospital that is charged with a particular responsibility to provide a particular care model is doing what best care stipulates.  <br/><br/>In terms of leadership, I was struck by the lack of clinical leadership in Ireland.  In Vancouver and across Canada, clinician leadership is seen as being essential to make health care work.  There is a stream and we have discussed it at the Towards 2026 forum with the college.  There is a need to develop a clinical stream for physician leaders who are going to take leadership as part of their job and not as something off the corner of their desk that they do when they get home in the evening after a busy day in the clinic.  My position in British Columbia before I came to Ireland was one where 100% of my position was to run the radiation and oncology programme for the entire province.  I had little or no clinical responsibility but I was paid for that job.  There will have to be an investment in training here and ultimately a career path.  It is not enough to say, &quot;Yes, we are going to have clinician leaders just do it off the corner of your desk.&quot;  There are many incredibly competent physicians in Ireland and, on the same subject, there is a huge number of competent nurses who are grossly underutilised.</p><p>There are opportunities to develop clinical leadership and the results from other jurisdictions would encourage one to believe that such investment would be worthwhile.  I think that covers all of the questions posed.</p></speech>

Clearly in the management of many chronic diseases, the role of the generalist is still hugely important.  The way health care has gone, unfortunately, is towards being further subdivided into smaller and smaller subsets.  That might be okay for a city of 20 million people but for a country of 4.5 million there is a limit to the level of sub-specialisation that is possible to achieve, simply because the critical mass necessary to have a dedicated, world-class unit is simply not there.  One needs a certain volume but the numbers in Ireland argue that the number of specialised units will undoubtedly be relatively few compared to other countries.  One needs very large catchments for significant sub-specialisation to work.  A one person unit run by a sub-specialist, no matter how brilliant, is ultimately going to fail.</p></speech>

I have been watching his career for many years.</p> <p>  I wish to refer back to some of the themes mentioned by the professor at the beginning of his contribution.  He spoke about talking to people who know what the problem is and that is what this committee is all about.  We are trying to identify the problem.  In the professor's view, what is the problem and where should we start to change our health service?  The second theme referred to by Professor Keane was building trust, especially between competing sections in the health service.  Is logic and good data enough to convince people to change and to trust each other?    </p> <p>  Professor Keane also referred to communication and communicating change.  We have heard many witnesses over the past number of weeks suggesting that we orientate our health service in a different way, particularly towards community and primary care in the context of chronic disease management and changing demographics, which mean that we will have an increasing number of elderly patients.  How would Professor Keane suggest that we go about reorientating our health service?  I also seek his views on how we would better integrate primary and secondary care, which is one of the problems we have identified.</p> <p>  On the issue of the generalist versus the specialist, the only generalists left in the Irish health service are GPs and geriatricians.  Everybody else is a specialist and as our population ages, we will have a huge amount of multi-morbidity which requires a holistic rather than a specialist approach.  I ask for the professor's comments in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-19a.94" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1354" speakername="James Browne" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016101900002#J00500"><p>In thinking about the health system in Ireland I am reminded of the old yarn about the Kerry man who said, when asked by an American tourist for directions, "I wouldn't start from here".  That is part of the problem.  As my party colleague Deputy Billy Kelleher politely said, we have a complex health system.  It is effectively dysfunctional but that is no reflection on the people working in it.  Most of the people working in our health service are pulling their hair out with frustration at its dysfunctional nature.  The nature of the dysfunction is part of the difficulty because we have silos, fiefdoms, localism and a lot of vested interests.  Everybody can see that we need change and there seems to be relatively broad agreement on where we need to get to but nobody sees him or herself as the problem or even as part of the problem.</p> <p>  I am interested in the issue of change management.  We met an IT specialist a couple of weeks ago and discussed the introduction of a new technology system for consultants.  The consultants bought into that but the IT guys were given zero funding to effectively bring the consultants along, to train them up and explain why the system should be used.  To bring about change in the health system we need buy in from the public and the trade unions.  When we get that buy in from the trade unions, we need to bring the staff along with us to effectively implement that change.  I am reminded of the scenario, for example, with cancer where we had the very political situation where people did not want to lose their local cancer units.  A similar scenario arose with regard to mental health.  The policy document, A Vision for Change, had broad support from the politicians, medical personnel and patients.  Leaving aside the lack of full implementation, even the suggestion of the closure of certain units did not get public buy in.  There was a trust issue at play there as well.  I ask the professor to outline his views on and his experience of bringing both the staff and the public along in the context of change management.</p></speech>

There have been lots of developments in the treatment of cancer, particularly in our public hospitals and overall, the treatment here is very good.  I am interested in the National Cancer Control Programme, NCCP, in the context of research.  Are there any research programmes embedded in the NCCP itself or is that outside its remit?  Obviously cancer research is very important.  It is hard to believe that we have no cure for cancer with all of the money that is put into cancer research by various organisations globally, not to mention domestically.  I ask Professor Keane for his views on that issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-19a.96" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Tom Keane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016101900002#J00700"><p>There is a fair amount of repetition in those questions and I do not want to repeat myself about the management of change.  I agree with Deputy Harty's point that there is broad general agreement on the direction.  Certainly in the discussions we have been having about the policy out to 2026, there was broad agreement on the direction of travel towards the integration of primary and secondary care and linking up the systems.  The committee will have the opportunity to have a briefing from that working group later in November.  I am encouraged that there is a recognition that the <i>status quo</i>does not work, essentially.<br/><br/>The issue around competing groups is based on a premise that if people compete there will be a winner and a loser.  What needs to be shaped is a situation where everybody is a winner if we come up with the right solution.  The media have a lot to answer for in this country in terms of the way in which health care is portrayed.  Everything is profiled in terms of winners and losers.  There has to be a new way of presenting information so that it is clear that the public is the winner if we come up with a solution that meets the needs of our population.<br/><br/>There is a huge lack of trust.  The biggest lack of trust that I encountered here was between physicians; not necessarily between specialists themselves but between specialists and other groups of doctors.  There were huge issues around the concept that if one doctor takes this then another doctor will lose that.  There was always that sense of a winner and a loser.  That is something that needs to be brought out and debated because the losers in this whole system are the patients.  All health care systems tend to be very provider focused.  It is one thing to mouth the words about being patient focused but ultimately, that is what the system must be.  As long as the system is provider focused and dominated by the interests of the constituencies within the system we will have a problem.  This is not unique to Ireland.  In most health care systems the providers, while mouthing the fact that they have the public interest at heart, are very often simply protecting their own turf.  There needs to be a debate on the fact that there are no winners and losers within the system.  The system has to work for people.</p><p> There cannot be enough communication.  I have said previously that there were weeks when I was unable to talk when I went home because I was so hoarse from talking.  Communication on its own is a tool for building trust, but it must be accompanied by transparency, integrity and a willingness to listen.  Some of the best ideas for improving health care come from the people who are working at the coalface.  Time and time again, it is those who work at the front line who actually understand what the problem is.  There is a way to engage people at that level.  I have to say that a cynicism has built up within the health care system.  Somebody referred to it as "report fatigue".  People are tired of reports and they want to see action.  I think there needs to be an iterative process.  I do not believe the problems in the health care system in Ireland are too big to fix.  They can be fixed.  As part of the public debate, it will be necessary to make it clear that if we want a health care system that is comparable to the systems in the Scandinavian countries, we will have to pay for it.  Countries with large and relatively good health care systems that meet the needs of their populations generally have higher rate levels of taxation.  In other words, what one gets is what one spends.</p><p> The issue of change management could not be more important.  I have been involved in major change in three jurisdictions.  The first thing that needs to be done is to put in place an overall change management structure.  This means making an investment in the business of managing change.  We cannot manage change by telling people "we have had a great idea, it is fully evidence-based and we are starting on Monday".  We need to engage in a way that makes the people who are going to be involved in change part of the solution.  We cannot simply hand them a top-down plan and expect it to work.  The silo functionality that Deputy James Browne mentioned is a problem that can be addressed.  There may be issues around the funding model that can address that.  We tend to build silos when we compartmentalise funding.  Everybody tries to protect his or her piece of the pie.  My view on the integration of hospitals and communities is that there must be a mechanism that enables hospital care and the care that occurs outside the hospital to be funded from a single envelope.  It should not be the case that the hospital gets its money and community care is funded separately.  There are some huge disproportions in funding allocations.  The funding needs to follow where the system wants to go.  We cannot drive the system if the funding model does not support it.  That is a considerable piece of work.</p><p> I was also asked about getting buy-in from the public and bringing the patient along.  I think that is part of the change management issue in Ireland.  I had an excellent press officer, Ann McCloon, when I was here.  She taught me so much about how to manage the Irish media.  We refused to engage in 30-second soundbites.  We let it be known to most of the major media outlets that we were prepared to engage in indepth conversations about the future of the system, but we did not want to give 30-second soundbites.  That was difficult because the media basically wants a quick story and a quick angle.  There needs to be dialogue with the public, but the complicated nature of health care means that these issues cannot be dealt with in a 30-second soundbite.  There is a need to find a mechanism to facilitate engagement at local and regional levels.  I am sure the committee has heard suggestions around how to engage communities.  I am in favour of locally delivered services as long as there is overall national oversight to ensure every region does not deliver the service differently.  I think there is a huge need to engage with the public at local and regional levels.  People need to be part of the change, rather than simply sitting on the outside and acting as advocates.</p><p> Deputy Madigan asked about research.  To my disappointment, the national cancer control programme has no mandate for research.  I had to make a pragmatic decision.  The lack of such a mandate is most unusual because research is part of the mandate of national cancer programmes in most developed countries.  I chose to leave it aside at the time because there were many other burning platforms.  I believe that down the road, the embedding of cancer research within the cancer programme will have to be a key component of the national cancer programme.  This ultimately becomes a major issue when we are trying to attract and recruit world-class individuals.  If they are coming into an environment where there is no research support, it is likely that they will go elsewhere.</p></speech>

I would like to ask a few questions before we finish up.  Practically every group that comes before this committee mentions access to diagnostics.  I think the point about access to diagnostics outside the hospital system was well made.  We are taking that on board.  We hear a great deal about the importance of integration of services.  To what extent has Professor Keane found that the organisational structures within the HSE have impeded that integration?</p> <p>  My second question relates to this country's two-tier system.  Deputy Billy Kelleher spoke earlier about the lack of consistency in access to care, particularly for public patients.  This big emerging problem is being raised by many of the groups that are coming before us.  How did Professor Keane deal with that in terms of rolling out a programme?  How did he manage the entitlement of those with private health insurance cover to quicker access to care?</p> <p>  Professor Keane referred to the need for legislation in a number of areas.  I particularly noted what he said about the need for legislation to cover clinical governance.  Does he feel we need legislation to deal with the issue of entitlement to access to care?  This question relates to my previous question about the two-tier system.</p> <p>  Professor Keane spoke about the importance of having a good and robust strategy to start with, and then having an implementation plan.  What about the monitoring element of that?  Where is the oversight or monitoring of the implementation of the cancer programme?</p></speech>

I am shocked to recall that nine years have passed since I sat in this room, or some similar room, to be questioned at length by Senator James Reilly and a number of other individuals about what I was trying to do for cancer.  In light of my lack of up-to-date knowledge on how well the HSE is doing with the integration of services, I do not think it would be fair of me to comment.  I know it has been pushing hard to develop integration.  There have been some good examples.  I understand the committee has heard from the Carlow-Kilkenny group.  I do not doubt that there are other such examples.  While it would be unfair of me to state any current view, I will say that I think the HSE is signalling seriously that it is working very hard in this area.</p> <p>  The Chair also asked whether I believe legislation is necessary to deal with the issue of entitlement under the two-tier system.  I have never worked in private health care.  In Canada, public health care is accessed by 99% of the population.  The 1% who do not access public health care have to go to the US to get private health care because it is not available in Canada.  That is covered under the Canada Health Act, which is the most popular piece of legislation with the Canadian public.  They treasure it.  It is iconic.  If one asks Canadian people what distinguishes Canadians from Americans, 80% of them will say it is the existence of publicly funded health care.</p><p>The health care system is something in which Canadians take pride, although I am not for a minute saying it is not without problems.  Canada has a publicly-funded system and it has many significant issues, a number of which resonate here.  However, it is a single-tier system based on the premise that a co-existent private system ultimately will bleed away resources and expertise from the public sector.  The issue is being tested in the Supreme Court of Canada this year as some physicians are taking the Government to the Supreme Court to appeal the legislation that prevents physicians from seeking additional funds for privately offered care.  This matter, which is covered under legislation, has been highly controversial but publicly-funded health care was introduced in Canada in the late 1930s.  The predecessor of the National Democratic Party, NDP, Government, which was a labour movement, brought publicly-funded health care to Canada in the 1930s and 1940s.  Since it has been in place, it is the only thing the public generally agree that the government does right. </p><p> While I obviously have a bias in favour of publicly-funded health care, if one looks back at the cancer programme, the vast majority of patients in Ireland are getting their cancer care in the public system, far more than for other non-cancer diseases.  One of the reasons for this was that we were able to assure people that their access and quality of care in the public system were good.  If one provides all of the key features that people are looking for in the public system, there is no reason for a private system to exist.  If people are to pay out of pocket for private care, there must be an underlying premise that somehow they believe they are buying something extra and better than what is available in the public system.  Until that belief disappears, one will have people hanging onto privately-funded care.  I understand approximately 45% of people in Ireland now have private insurance so it is a big mountain to climb. </p><p> In terms of monitoring, the cancer programme has key performance indicators.  While I am not up to speed on all of them, many dozens of performance indicators are published by the programme either every month or every three months and if the programme is not meeting certain performance indicators, the issue is addressed immediately.  There is also a fair amount of competition between the cancer centres to be seen to be the best performing.  This is very healthy because it means they want to be able to state, for example, that 90% of patients will be seen within two weeks.  Undoubtedly, the rapid access clinics that were instituted by the cancer programme for prostate, breast and lung cancer have provided a level of access that is totally satisfactory and comparable with any publicly-funded system in the world.  There is no reason this could not exist elsewhere in the system. </p><p> I do not believe the problems of the Irish health care system are too big to fix.  They can be fixed but what is required is political will, which comes back to the committee, and education of the public to enable people to understand the issues in order that they could be persuaded to pay more in taxes to fund health care compared with some other alternative if asked to do so.  I am not pessimistic in this regard.  An iterative approach is needed, one which demonstrates that this can be achieved through a number of steps.  Trying to take on system change across the whole system at once is unlikely to be successful.  A strategy that is iterative, extends over five or ten years, identifies a number of milestones and takes each one of these in sequence is the way to build trust.  </p></speech>

Apologies have been received from Deputy Colm Brophy.</p> <p>  The purpose in this part of the meeting is to engage with Mr. Mark Toland, deputy chief inspector, and Ms &Eacute;imear Fisher, acting deputy chief inspector, from the Garda Inspectorate on the priorities for and the challenges that will face the inspectorate in the near future.  The committee has identified oversight and the accountability of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as priority issues in its 2016 work programme.  The chairperson of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring appeared before the committee last month, while representatives of the Policing Authority were present three weeks ago.  The Garda Commissioner, Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, was before the committee last week.  This is the last of the four scheduled engagements in our consideration of these most important matters.  Following due consideration of all of the critical points made by each of the delegates in this series of meetings, the committee intends to prepare a report.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I extend a very warm welcome to Mr. Toland and Ms Fisher.  The format is that they will be invited to make a brief opening statement which will be followed by a question and answer session.  I draw their attention to the fact that witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  If, however, they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members should be aware that, under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite Mr. Toland to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am joined by Ms &Eacute;imear Fisher.  Mr. Robert Olson, chief inspector, sends his sincere apologies for not being able to be present.  He is unable to attend oiwng to a family commitment in the United States.</p> <p>  The Garda Inspectorate was established under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 as an independent statutory body with its own remit, working alongside GSOC and the Policing Authority.  Our function is to ensure the resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are used to achieve and maintain the highest levels of efficiency and effectiveness in its operation and administration, as measured by reference to the best standards of comparable police services.  We carry out inspections or inquiries, either on our own initiative or when requested to do so by the Policing Authority or the Minister for Justice and Equality.  A report on these inspections or inquiries, with recommendations, is submitted to the originator of the request.  We can also provide advice for the Policing Authority or the Minister.</p> <p>  The Garda Inspectorate comprises three members who are appointed by the Government and there are nine staff who support it in its work.  Our objective is to help to make An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na a better service - for the public, victims of crime, all those working in the organisation and the criminal justice system.  </p> <p>  While all 11 of our reports have made substantial recommendations for change, three are considered as significant in the context of reforming and modernising An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The examinations were extremely wide in scope and breadth.  The reports offer a unique insight into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and outline a number of issues that have consistently been raised by the inspectorate.  They are on resource allocation, crime investigation and, most recently, changing policing in Ireland.</p><p>The resource allocation report published in 2010 highlighted the need to have the right number of garda&iacute; in the right places at the right time.  It revealed that there is often a disconnect between the demands for Garda services and the number of garda&iacute; on duty.  It identified deficiencies in the information technology systems needed to measure and manage workloads.  It emphasised the need for better data and technology to provide an objective measurement of how many garda&iacute; are required to meet policing needs.</p><p> Recommendations in the report included the implementation of a national computer-aided dispatch system to handle 999 emergency and non-emergency calls for service and the implementation of a resource management system to manage rostering and leave.  The report also recommended an increase in the numbers of garda&iacute; available for front-line policing through a structured programme of civilianisation, a reduction in non-core police duties such as certifying passport applications and the redeployment of officers from administrative duties.</p><p> The crime investigation report published in 2014 examined the policies, practices and procedures used in the prevention, investigation and detection of crime.  It examined how incidents were recorded, classified, reclassified and supervised on the PULSE system and how detections were claimed.  It also included a review of the allocation of resources, the use of technology, the management of caseloads and examined the progress of individual investigations.</p><p> While the report highlighted the good work carried out by many committed members and provided a number of best-practice examples, it also identified a lack of national standards for investigation, inconsistencies in services to victims, an absence of intrusive supervision as well as deficiencies in modern technology to accurately analyse demand, record and manage crime and to deploy resources.</p><p> The report identified an absence of effective systems in Garda stations for recording calls from the public, serious failures in the classification of crime incidents and inconsistencies in the claiming of detections.  A key finding was that inexperienced garda&iacute; were investigating serious crimes, such as rape and robbery.  The report made detailed recommendations to improve recording and classification of incidents at divisional and national levels and recommended the introduction of national incident and crime recording standards.  Recommendations were made for the implementation of systems to improve the quality of supervision and management of crime investigation.  Once again we recommended the procurement of a computer-aided dispatch system to accurately record calls for service and enable the effective deployment of resources.</p><p> The findings in this report were echoed in the examination of recording practices published by the Central Statistics Office in 2015 and reiterated in its recent report.  They included the non-recording of crime and the mis-classification of crime as less serious incidents.  Several of the issues in the report are not the sole responsibility of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and a number of multi-agency recommendations were included that require action by other criminal justice bodies.  The report also identified areas of good practice in different Garda divisions and in different parts of the country.  These included a new community policing model, a range of crime prevention initiatives, crime operations and a number of technological initiatives.  However, such examples of good practice, while used in some divisions and in some units, were not consistently applied throughout the organisation.</p><p> The Changing Policing in Ireland report published in 2015 was a whole-of-organisation review of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and included an examination of the structure, staffing and deployment of resources.  The report is primarily about putting garda&iacute; on the front line and providing sufficient numbers of people, strong leadership and supervision, appropriate equipment, good training and the modern technology needed to deliver a better service to all communities in Ireland.  We found an ineffective structure, struggling to cope with the modern demands on Garda services.  Many headquarters units have duplicate functions in areas such as change management, policy development and oversight.  The current structure, which comprises six regions, 28 divisions and 96 districts, is highly inefficient and negatively impacts on the deployment of resources.  Centralised decision-making takes place for some low-level issues.  We found that people are not always on duty at the right times in the right places or doing the right things.  A two-tier community policing system exists, with high numbers of garda&iacute; in Dublin but significantly fewer in other areas, especially rural Ireland.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na performs some functions which may be more appropriate to other agencies, such as prosecuting District Court cases and the transportation of remand prisoners.  At least 1,500 garda&iacute; are in non-operational roles and could be released for patrol, investigation and community policing duties.  At 14% of the total workforce, there is a low level of civilian staff in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na compared to other police services.  There is no individual performance management system to enable persistent underperformance to be addressed.  We found deficiencies in governance, accountability, leadership and supervision.  The current Garda culture is inhibiting change.  While staff identified positives, such as a can-do culture and a sense of duty, many described the organisation as insular and defensive with a blame culture whereby many leaders are reluctant to make decisions and speak up.  The findings are stopping the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from performing to its full potential.</p><p> In the report we recommended a new leaner structure with fewer senior managers and more garda&iacute; on patrol; a reduction in the number of Garda regions from six to three; the release of over 1,500 experienced garda&iacute; from non-operational roles; the use of garda&iacute; to undertake Garda roles while using civilian staff for support roles; the introduction of a new divisional policing model; the divestiture of functions that could be performed by other agencies; the development of governance structures to ensure accountability and drive performance; the creation of an environment whereby senior managers and other staff are encouraged to speak up and make suggestions to improve performance; and the introduction of a performance management system to encourage good performance and to provide for addressing continued underperformance with an ultimate sanction of dismissal.</p><p> The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has broadly accepted the vast majority of our recommendations.  However, we do not have the statutory authority to oversee the implementation of the recommendations, and the full implementation of many of the recommendations has yet to be achieved.  Recent legislation provides that the Policing Authority has a role in monitoring the implementation of some of our recommendations.  We welcome this and see the implementation of our recommendations as a good way to reform and modernise the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enable it to deliver a visible, accessible and responsive police service.</p><p> We believe that front-line policing services are not prioritised and protected.  All other police services that we engaged with have restructured, reduced the number of administrative areas and operate from far leaner structures with fewer managers to protect the front line.  In total, 83% of Garda resources are deployed to front-line services, compared to 93% in some other police services.  Our evidence, including analysis of data and feedback from the communities we visited, highlights the lack of a visible Garda presence.  Another opportunity to increase Garda presence is the civilianisation of roles that do not require Garda powers.  This area has not been sufficiently progressed.</p><p> The inspectorate welcomes improvements made to the PULSE system.  We believe these to be among the most significant changes ever made.  The changes provide enhanced supervision of investigations of crime.  However, there is still the issue of the non-recording of crime on PULSE.  This challenge is common to other police services and is only properly addressed through intrusive supervision.  There is a gap in the availability of sergeants and inspectors throughout operational Garda units.  We believe many of the difficulties faced would not have occurred if an appropriate level of sergeants and inspectors had been assigned and deployed on a 24-7 basis across Garda divisions.</p><p> We have been impressed by the many hard-working and dedicated garda&iacute; at all ranks as well as the support staff and reserves we met.  These people are doing their best to get the job done, notwithstanding inefficient structures, overly bureaucratic administrative processes, dated technology and inefficient and ineffective management practices.  We welcome the T&aacute;naiste's recent announcement of extra funding for Garda recruits and civilian staff in addition to the previous commitment to additional investment for technology.  The Commissioner's modernisation programme is an ambitious reform plan.  We recognise its complexity and the need for careful sequencing of actions.  For the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to achieve its full potential, we believe the programme needs to move from strategy to implementation at an energetic pace.  The decision to move to a divisional model of policing without a pilot programme demonstrates a commitment to reform, while the planned introduction of specialist units to investigate sexual and domestic crimes will ensure that only specially-trained garda&iacute; investigate these most serious offences.</p><p> The Commissioner now has her top team in place, new garda&iacute; have joined and the Government has provided significant funding for technology, vehicles and stations.  The inspectorate looks forward to working with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to help the force to achieve the significant changes planned.</p><p>I thank the witnesses for their contribution.  In its document Changing Policing in Ireland 2015 the inspectorate said the current Garda culture is inhibiting change; does it still believe that is the case?  What do the witnesses believe is the biggest obstacle to implementation of the inspectorate's recommendations?  Is it resources or culture?  Do they believe there would be value in having some sort of oversight of the inspectorate's recommendations to ensure they are implemented?  Could they say briefly what the inspectorate's relationship is with the policing authority, although it is a new body and does not have the same powers within the Six Counties?  Would they like to comment on that?</p></speech>

The strengths within the Garda culture are a can-do attitude as Mr. Toland said, a sense of duty and of willingness to be able to help the Irish people.  There is, however, a significant negative culture, of blame and being risk averse.  This was expressed to us consistently in all our field visits across Ireland.  Between Crime Investigation and Changing Policing in Ireland we interviewed 2,500 people in the organisation.  There was a consistent strength and weakness attitude.  It is very hard to judge whether that is still the case.  We are encouraged by the fact that the recommendations made in Changing Policing in Ireland have been accepted and one of those significant recommendations in respect of culture was the conduct of cultural audits.  This is practice in many large complex organisations for measuring culture.  It is quite possible to measure culture through cultural audits, to be able to say what is our mission, what is our expected behaviour, does our expected behaviour match our actual behaviour and to see how that is expressed through the service delivered.  In its reform plan the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has indicated that it is going to conduct cultural audits.  It is not possible to give an honest answer to the question of whether it has changed yet but the indications are that there is an understanding that it has to change.  In Changing Policing in Ireland we said that in changing it should not lose the undoubted strengths in the culture.  In changing it needs to acknowledge its strengths and recognise that certain elements have to change.</p> <p>  The significant obstacle to the implementation of change is the expression of leadership in respect of culture and clarity on that.  What is expected?  If change and reform are to happen in a complex organisation like the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, expectations must be clear on what the leadership and the vision at the top want the people on the front line to deliver.  Unless that is reformed that obstacle could stop good customer service being delivered to the public.  Mr. Toland will talk about oversight and the relationship with the Policing Authority.</p></speech>

We have found that we are repeating some of those recommendations in reports and that is frustrating for us.  We believe had they been implemented some of the inquiries and tribunals that have taken place may not have happened or could have been minimised.  We think there was a lost opportunity.  It has not realised the full benefits.  We do not just hand a report over, we try to work with the Garda.  I have noticed a real difference recently in terms of the engagement.  It brings us in now at a very early stage to discuss new policies and our recommendations to make sure it fully understands what we intended with the recommendation and we want to help it achieve it.  An obvious gap has been the implementation.</p> <p>  I welcome the Policing Authority because it will fulfil the role of monitoring the implementation of our reports.  It has taken Changing Policing in Ireland .  We would like it to take Crime Investigation because there are 212 recommendations in that report crucial to investigation of crime and dealing with victims of crime.  I understand there are issues of capacity but we think that would be a good step forward to monitor the implementation.  We have introduced a process where we meet it and check on the status but we have no power to force it to make those recommendations or to implement them.  It is fair to say the majority of our recommendations have been accepted but not always implemented.  </p></speech>

Quite often it will pilot something.  We have been running a pilot on sex offender management for six years.  A positive outcome recently has been the Commissioner's commitment to change the model of policing in existence since the organisation started, to become what we would call a divisional rather than a district model.  It will not pilot that.  The Commissioner has committed to implementing those without pilots.  That is a good way to go forward.  If it is the right direction why run a pilot for a long period of time?  Sometimes we have given it a lot of recommendations and it needs to prioritise them and decide what the most important one is.</p> <p>  We welcome the Policing Authority.  We think it fills a gap.  There are authorities in other jurisdictions we have visited.  We are meeting it more regularly now and we are about to get our first remit from the Policing Authority to consider problems in the deployment of Garda resources around Ireland.  It has also given us documents for feedback, the code of ethics and its strategy statement.  We have a very good relationship with it.  We are independent and need to maintain that independence from the Policing Authority but we have a good working relationship with it.  </p></speech>

Its presentation is utterly demoralising in some ways.  I do not mean that as a negative reflection on the witnesses but because of the realisation that so much had been identified for so long on so many issues that we could all relate to yet the implementation has been poor, that is the politest word I can use.  I understand the inspectorate's point about being statutorily restricted.  Are there 574 recommendations overall or were the 212 in Crime Investigation separate?</p></speech>

Crime Investigation was perhaps the most detailed and comprehensive inspection we have ever embarked on.  It examined what happens from the time a member of the public walks into a Garda station to what happens when the case goes to court.  It was in effect 11 previous inspectorate reports done at one time.  It is an enormous piece of work and that is why there are 212 recommendations.  In that report we referred to previous reports, asking why this was not done in 2007 or 2009 and we find that frustrating.  The current Commissioner now has the challenge of going back, not just with our reports but other Government sponsored reports to try to come up with a plan to address recommendations that go back six or ten years.  It has to now decide what is current or valid.  Had our recommendations been implemented many of the problems we face today would not still be here.</p></speech>

Does he have a rough idea how many of the recommendations had been implemented?  I would like to hear more about where the witnesses think the root of the problem lies, in order to break the logjam.  Is it resources or culture, is it inside or outside the Garda?  Is it the fact that there are now three oversight bodies?  How would the inspectorate see its relationship with the Policing Authority and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC?  Some have said it is a bit cumbersome having three oversight bodies.  Would it be preferable to marry them into one overarching organisation?  I see a particular role for the inspectorate but how does it see itself fitting in with the Policing Authority in particular because it seems to be deferring to its statutory ability to monitor the implementation of the inspectorate's recommendations.  Is that not a duplication?  Should the statutory oversight provisions for the inspectorate not be beefed up or restructured?</p><p>Perhaps the delegates might spend some time elaborating on that point.  </p><p> The worrying report for us is the one on crime investigation, given that it was published two years ago and serious problems were detailed in it.  Perhaps the delegates might address some of the points made in the recent CSO report.  What do they think the similarities are between the inspectorate's 2014 report and what the CSO states?  The Commissioner gave the impression that everything was improving, but I would like the delegates to develop some of the points made a little more.</p><p> Another issue that seems to crop up here is management.  It may be top heavy.  Mr. Toland talked about ineffective management processes, inefficient structures, bureaucratic administration, over-emphasis at the top and a lack of management in the middle.  Are these problems?  Has the inspectorate made detailed recommendations on numbers or how these issues might be addressed?</p></speech>

However, influence and persuasion were as far as we could go within our powers.  In fact, we probably did not even have the power to do that, but we did it and the Garda engaged with us.  That practice continued until recently.  Since the establishment of the Policing Authority, it has that statutory role.  I would not say we defer to the authority; rather, we speak to it regularly.  We have had discussions with it recently on the one report it has been formally given where it has the authority to follow through on the recommendations made on changing policing in Ireland.  It has not yet been given the other reports.  However, on the report on changing policing in Ireland, we have had discussions with it on the process in which it hopes to engage with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to gain an understanding of the recommendations made, what we meant by the words we used, what the spirit of our recommendations was and so on.  I would not see this process as deferential but informative.</p></speech>

My understanding is the Policing Authority is simply building capacity and that the report on changing policing in Ireland is the first and most recent.  However, we encourage particularly the giving of the report on crime investigation to it because the inspectorate believes the reports on crime investigation and changing policing in Ireland are very similar, as far as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is concerned.  One concerns the structure of the organisation and its management, while other concerns its core operation, namely, the investigation of crime.  Therefore, we strongly encourage the giving of both reports to the authority.  If the report on changing policing in Ireland is considered on its own, it will not be enough.  We see the organisation as developing and building capacity.</p></speech>

I know what Ms Fisher is saying, that the Policing Authority does not have the capacity to do it, while the inspectorate probably does not have the power to demand that the authority oversee it.  Does the decision rest with the Minister?  Who decides whether the Policing Authority can take on the task or who should be asked to take it on?</p></speech>

We had a very fruitful meeting earlier this year with all of the responsible people and units in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to which the deputy commissioner brought everybody with a responsibility to see through the recommendations.  We talked through and clarified all of the recommendations made.  In some cases it was just a matter of interpretation.  We understood each other when we considered the recommendations and there was genuine scope for multiple interpretations.  We felt it was a very useful process.  It is not the case that the recommendations have been left in an abyss and not being tackled.  Even though we do not have the authority to oversee their implementation, we have engaged in a constructive discussion with the Garda and continue to do so.  Our point is that it would be better if the reports were given to those with the authority to oversee their implementation.</p></speech>

Technically, the Commissioner could reject a recommendation, for operational reasons, but the Policing Authority will only receive the ones that are accepted.  In the case of the report on crime investigation, all bar one of the 212 recommendations made were accepted.  I would not lose any sleep over the one that was not accepted as it concerned where a unit should sit.  The Policing Authority has, therefore, accepted the spirit of the recommendations made and on which we have done a lot of work.  We were also given the power of review.  I am reviewing a report we produced on child sexual abuse in 2012.  We now also have the power to initiate our own inspections.  Among the issues we are considering are high-risk areas in crime investigation.  We would like to go back to check, reinspect and make sure these areas are being covered.  One power we would like to have is the power to make unannounced visits in order that if we were dealing with a particularly high-risk area and did not want preparatory work to be done before we attended, we would like to have the ability to turn up at a Garda station to inspect some processes live to get a reality check.</p></speech>

The CSO conducted its first review of our crime statistics about six or eight months after we had produced our report and completely validated our findings.  It found what we had found and perhaps even a little more in some areas.  It went back this year to look at the matter again.  This is, therefore, the third time it has arrived at the same findings and for three years running.  Most disappointingly, if a member of the public walks up to a garda on the street or rings to reports a crime, it will not always end up on PULSE, the crime recording system.  That is a real worry.  Once it is recorded on the system, it can be audited, one can find it and decide whether it has been included in the right category.  However, the lack of recording on the PULSE system is a gap.  The CSO has again found Garda stations that do not have a book or a computer system to record the fact that a member of the public has rung to say he or she has been the victim of an assault.  This makes auditing impossible.  It is impossible for senior managers in the Garda to know exactly how busy garda&iacute; are if they do not record every time a member of the public rings to report an assault or a public order incident.  It is very difficult to decide how many garda&iacute; are needed if it is not known how busy they are.  We were disappointed, therefore, to see the CSO come back in three reports running with the same issues.  In my opening address I spoke about a new system as part of PULSE which was introduced in November 2015.  My organisation believes it is the biggest change the Garda has ever made in the management of crime and I anticipate that the CSO's report next year will be far more positive as a result.  The Garda is now monitoring investigations daily; it knows exactly how many investigations each individual garda is managing and has a sergeant assigned to manage the investigation.  It is a much more robust system, one we would like to have seen in place many years ago.</p></speech>

I have a few different points to make.  Following on from Deputy Clare Daly's point about the fact that the inspectorate did not have statutory authority to oversee implementation of its recommendations, do the delegates know who in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been given responsibility to implement its reports?  We have heard reports, but as we cannot be certain, the delegates might confirm who has been given that responsibility.</p> <p>  It is hardly a good system that the Commissioner can reject some of the inspectorate's recommendations and can take them on board as she sees fit.  What do the delegates think about this?</p><p>On the issue of crime investigations, Mr. Toland said he has seen the same problems prevail for three years running.  We would have presented the Minister with evidence from PULSE of the massaging of crime figures in the Athlone area a year ago.  It seems there was nothing to stop the senior garda in that station from doing that.  I have no evidence that this has been addressed.  How does Mr. Toland think that should be managed?  He said the Policing Authority will help in making sure that the inspectorate's recommendations are implemented.  Do he honestly believe that the Policing Authority has the wherewithal to play that role?  We would be very sceptical about Policing Authority's power in terms of  its legislative power having regard to its resources.  We would be very surprised if it will fill the role Mr. Toland might like it to fill.</p></speech>

In terms of crime, John Twomey, the deputy commissioner, has taken responsibility for crime.  The Commissioner has done all the responses to us.  It is part of her modernisation programme and she has taken those recommendations to be part of that programme.  She has been the respondent to us and that is the person with whom we have been dealing.  We had a five and half hour meeting with the Commissioner to discuss the report, the recommendations and the rationale, and that is important.  We have to make sure that we put a proper case, a business case, for change.  We have to persuade the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that this is the right direction in which to move.  Ireland is unique with a national police service.  While we might identify best international practice, it has to fit that into Ireland.  Sometimes we may make a recommendation which needs to take into account rural policing and the geographical difficulties of policing.  Sometimes our recommendations are accepted but have to be modified to fit into the Irish context, and we accept that.  There are very few rejected recommendations and some of the rejected recommendations from previous reports have been accepted subsequently.  That has not been an issue for us.  Sometimes the issue has been technology and the Garda is woefully behind other police services.  From my policing experience, I would say it is 30 years behind.  That necessary investment is now coming through.  The Government has put &euro;200 million aside to invest in technology which will make the Garda a much more efficient organisation.</p> <p>  In terms of crime investigation, we are disappointed to see the same results.  It is getting slightly better but there is still an issue about not recording crime.  That is a common issue in other policing services but where they have that problem, they have intrusive supervision.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, there is an absence of a sergeant being on duty on 24-7 basis in Ireland across all the Garda divisions and districts.  When garda&iacute; are finishing their tour of duty, the sergeant should make sure they put any report from the day onto the system and that it is properly supervised.  We did an evaluation and analysis at 11 o'clock on a Saturday night in August and we found that out of 28 divisions in Ireland, only 14 had an inspector on duty.  I asked the question: who is in charge of that division and who is making sure that people do what is expected to be done?  That is a significant gap in leadership.  Those at the top table and the top of the organisation have a key leadership role insetting standards but if we do not have front-line supervisors on duty to make sure things get done, mistakes will be made and garda&iacute; will have gone home.  They do not go home intending not to put something onto the system but they are busy and then they go home, the matter is not put on the system today and then they are off for four days and some of these matters are not put onto the system.  It is crucial to have sergeants and inspectors on duty with operational units. </p> <p>  In terms of making sure that what goes on is correctly dealt with, Deputy Wallace mentioned a superintendent making a decision about a crime.  There is a call centre in Castlebar manned by civilians and garda&iacute; ring in when they are dealing with a crime.  They should ring from a crime scene and they can report that crime directly to the call takers in the call centre.  It is a very efficient system.  They are very good at what they do.  We have got the consent of the Commissioner to allow those people to be the decision makers.  When a garda rings up, that unit will decide whether the crime is a burglary, a robbery or criminal damage.  If a superintendent in the future wants to change that crime, they will have to go through that call centre and, ultimately, that call centre will decide what that crime should be.  That will stop 96 district superintendents making different decisions because currently there are 96 ways of deciding what a crime should be across the Garda districts.  This will make those in this call centre the decision makers.  It is an enormous step because it is taking away the authority from the district superintendent and moving it to this call centre.</p> <p>  I should have answered Deputy Daly's question on management.  We have also persuaded the Commissioner to move to a divisional model of policing.  This takes away the district superintendent; the superintendents now in a division will have responsibility for a key area.  Instead of a superintendent being responsible for crime, human resources, finance and community relations, they will be responsible for crime.  There will now be 28 superintendents responsible for crime across the 28 divisions instead of 96.  Twenty-eight superintendents will be responsible for community policing, community engagement and partnership-working instead of 96 previously.  We have given them a new structure which will mean we will have experts in crime.  Superintendents cannot be experts in everything.  I was not.  There are superintendents who are very good at community engagement, some will be very good at operational policing and some will be very good at crime.  This model allows them to put people with the right skills in charge of certain aspects of policing instead of expecting 96 superintendents to be good at everything.</p></speech>

I am very clear about our role and I think the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is very clear about its role.  We are working very closely with the Policing Authority.  It has expertise in a significant number of areas.  It has a very senior ex-police officer on that committee.  We presented the Changing Policing in Ireland report and the crime report to it.  It has now started to call us back as it works through the chapters to discuss exactly what we meant.  I am very confident that it will hold the Commissioner to account for the implementing of these recommendations.  It has done it publicly already.  We have already started to see the publication of community confidence statistics by the Policing Authority asking the question: when will they be published?  I am very hopeful that it will fill a gap in terms of oversight.</p></speech>

On the issue of crime, I note one of the inspectorate's recommendations at 1.3 is to establish a serious and organised crime unit which includes cyber crime, human trafficking and serious fraud investigations.   I am very aware from a number of meetings with members of the fraud team that they would find it very difficult at present to get information out of NAMA.  We understand there is a data protection issue around the personal and commercially sensitive information that NAMA would have.  Given that we are depending on section 19, where members within the organisation would report wrongdoing when it happens, we suspect that section 19 is not being used and applied as much as it should be.  The real evidence the Garda needs to follow up on a case is very often within the remit, and within the papers, of NAMA, but the actual getting of them is a major problem.  There is a big problem in this area.  We do not hold white collar crime to account very well.  Has the inspectorate ever examined how we could make things stronger in this area?</p></speech>

We looked at the creation of a serious and organised crime unit.  We have gone far further than the Commissioner has currently gone and recommended that bureau fraud investigation become part of that unit.  Currently, it is drugs and organised crime, and fraud is a separate unit.  We did quite a piece of work in the Crime Investigation report.  We followed it up in the Changing Policing in Ireland report, and we are recommending a much different unit.  We need to follow the criminal now, and not the crime.  It is about having individual units that look at drugs, organised crime, prostitution and fraud.  These people go across many different crimes and what we have recommended is the creation of a much more flexible unit that is able to follow the criminal as they go through the crime.</p> <p>  Information sharing has come up in every inspection we have conducted.  The Data Protection Act is often given to us as a blocker.  When we ask for specific examples, some of the examples we get are complex, and we understand why that is an issue.  What we found is an absence of signed up, information sharing protocols with organisations that allow organisations to share information based on a particular crime.  We are currently looking at child sexual abuse, a very serious crime, and the management of sex offenders.  Again, the Data Protection Act is given as a blocker, and what we are trying to do is come up with solutions to help the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and partner agencies, have the confidence to share information when it is appropriate.  Where children are concerned, it is much easier because it is in the best interests of the child.  It becomes far more complex when we are looking at fraud cases and other serious crime cases.</p></speech>

Most people agree there was merit in closing some Garda stations but does Mr. Toland believe too many were closed and that this has led to a lack of a visible Garda presence, especially in rural communities?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-19a.141" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Toland" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2016101900002#F00400"><p>We went to community meetings and people said they certainly noticed the loss of their community policing garda&iacute; because they were the people who would arrange meetings and send them texts and information.  Certainly in rural Ireland, there is an absence of community garda&iacute; in many areas.  We found divisions that did not have any full-time community garda&iacute;, and some divisions in Dublin that have significant numbers.</p> <p>  On station closures, I recognise the symbolic presence of a Garda station in a community but as a senior police officer, one sometimes has a dilemma as to whether to keep a garda in a station, sometimes late at night, waiting for a customer to call or close the front counter service, not the station, and put the officer on patrol so they can be more proactive.  It is a balance in terms of keeping the station open when it gets very few callers.  My view is that a Garda station needs to have a reception area so that members of the public know they can call at certain times, but the public need a garda to come quickly when they need them in an emergency.  We need to get the balance right between them.  Chief superintendents in divisions are often best placed in terms of knowing the best place to locate Garda stations and the facilities they need to ensure they are accessible to the public, but also making sure they get people out from behind desks and front counters, where possible, to go out and be a visible presence.</p> <p>  What I found, in terms of visibility, is that garda&iacute; often drive down my road but I do not see them.  They might walk down a street but if someone is not out and about, they do not see them.  We have recommended that they knock on doors and let people know they are patrolling their streets because, quite often, people do not see them when they are out on patrol.  Visibility is a difficult issue.  It is about the fear of crime also.  Many people have a fear of crime when the reality is they are very unlikely to become a victims of crime.  One tends to find that more elderly people are afraid to go out because of what they see in headline news.  That visible garda presence is very reassuring to them when they see them.</p></speech>

There are certain crimes that we would not expect a newly trained garda or someone without detective experience to investigate.  If my daughter was the victim of a serious sexual assault, I would want a detective trained in the investigation of sexual assaults to investigate it.  Domestic violence was another area we examined in Crime Investigation, and again we found that there were very few arrests.  Sometimes the crimes were not always correctly recorded.  We have recommended the creation of a specialist unit in a Garda division that investigates serious sexual assaults, domestic violence cases, and child sexual abuse.  The Commissioner has committed to introducing those units.  We are waiting for the dates, but three of those units are likely to be formed fairly soon, one of which we believe will be in Cork city.  In the future, when a victim comes into a Garda station that unit should be contacted and if it is a sexual assault, a specially trained officer, not just a detective, should be trained in the investigation of sexual assaults.  Currently, if a victim goes to the front counter and reports a crime, whether it is the theft of a newspaper or a rape, it is very likely the garda at the front counter will take on the role of investigating that crime.</p></speech>

They have what is called continued professional development, and it is beyond the Garda college.  They have trained sergeants and garda&iacute;, traditionally based on divisions, but in the moratorium on recruitment they stopped doing the continued professional development, and some of those units collapsed.  They no longer existed.  They are just starting to build up that capacity again but they are playing catch up.  They are probably four or five years behind some of the training.  They are retraining the majority of garda&iacute; in interview techniques training, and that is a significant and ambitious target to try to achieve.  Our Crime Investigation report suggested that training needs analysis to consider the critical needs and the gaps in terms of garda&iacute; out policing now.</p> <p>  In terms of the new course, the feedback on the participants coming through the new course is very positive.  The new training programme will give many of those people coming through the system now the skills, but they have a gap of people between 2009 and 2016 who probably did not get the training they needed.

What I do not like is the way they approach an investigation.  If there is a murder today in Tipperary, as a division, Tipperary will manage that murder investigation.  The local superintendent takes charges.  They have to call in people from some of the national units around the division.  That is not an approach we would recommend.  In all the other jurisdictions we visited they would have a national unit that investigates very serious crimes like homicide.</p><p>They would come in to investigate the crime and allow the division to deal with less serious crimes, such burglary and robbery, and some of the sexual assaults.  They have the skills; they are merely not in the right place.</p><p> The sexual assault piece is interesting.  There is a need to develop a specific training course for the investigation of sexual assaults, particularly child sexual abuse.</p></speech>

I think they see them as challenging.  Numerically, there is a significant challenge.</p> <p>  The Commissioner has agreed to move to a divisional model.  The reason I keep mentioning that is it is the biggest change since the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na came into existence.  It is a significant structural change.</p> <p>  They accepted the 212 recommendations on crime and now they have the challenge of trying to deliver them.  The new protective services bureaux investigating sexual assaults is something that we recommended in 2012, and is now coming on-stream.  There is a significant change.</p> <p>  The language used by the Commissioner is different.  It is about implementation.  It is about trying to get things done, but there is an enormous number of previous recommendations that must now be implemented.  That is a challenge but the commitment is there.</p> <p>  The garda&iacute; we engage at operational level are passionate about what they do.  The garda&iacute; themselves, their own staff, want to see this change happening.  The public wants to see the change.  The challenge for them is showing their own staff they are going to change and they need to do that by delivering some of the pieces in the plan as quickly as possible, not slowly.</p></speech>

We talk a lot about failings on the part of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but it is also important to look to see what can be done to improve morale within the force.  Would Mr. Toland agree that improving morale will improve efficiency and effectiveness, and if so, what can the Garda Inspectorate do to improve Garda morale?</p></speech>

We ran workshops to which we brought in garda&iacute; from every rank and grade.  Some garda&iacute; said to us that is the first time that anyone has engaged them about what would make a difference.  They know they answers.  If I sit down and engage a group of detectives, they know the answers to a lot of the challenges facing their organisation.  We have written a chapter about leadership and about what difference that can make, but a major part of that was engagement within their own organisation bringing in staff with the knowledge and expertise because they themselves know the answers.  We found there is a lot one can do.</p> <p>  Certainly, having supervisors on duty to motivate, lead and direct garda&iacute; is a very important issue.  If a supervisor is there who comes on, briefs garda&iacute;, motives them and gives them a task to do for the day, one will find that garda&iacute; will react well to that.  We included a whole section about recognising good work.  They can do a lot more, such as simply saying, "Thank you", more formal recognition, and making garda&iacute; feel valued.</p> <p>  If one looks at the Reserve, one has a group of individuals who are volunteers who are giving up their time to come in and police.  They are highly motivated individuals.</p> <p>  With many aspects of leading staff, there are no costs.  It is about giving time.  It is about spending time and about senior managers being very visible with their staff.  I always try to take myself out from behind my desk to go and drive a patrol car or to patrol with my staff because a senior manager has not lost his or her policing powers.  The senior managers need to be out more with their staff and to spend more time with them, to be more visible.  That will certainly make an impact on morale.</p></speech>

They mentioned that the Garda Inspectorate submits its reports and recommendations to the authority and it has stated it has not the capacity to investigate or explore them all.  Could they provide an international context for our structures and how the Garda Inspectorate fits within what has been created and constructed with the Policing Authority?  We were talking about systems and governance from a policing perspective, but from a regulatory perspective, are we spreading our regulatory resources too thinly across too many organisations which will inhibit effective governance and oversight?  Much of what the inspectorate talks about is something we have heard from both GSOC and the Policing Authority.  The inspectorate has nine staff plus themselves, the Policing Authority has 13 and is trying to hire more, and GSOC has numbers in the 20s.  Would this be a long-term issue where each says it has a resource problem which then constrains their capacity to investigate and explore the different reports properly?</p> <p>  On that, the inspectorate mentioned specifically that it does not have an implementation function in terms of having supervisory intervention but that the Policing Authority does.  With the inspectorate's systems and progression of focus in terms of its reports, can it be guaranteed that the Policing Authority will focus on what the inspectorate is trying to focus on?  Do they see the point I am trying to make?  Could they provide an international context for what we have created because it appears what has been created is very much reactive politically?  We have created the authority based on some of the issues we have seen in recent years but is this the right embryonic structure now and will it work in the long term?</p></speech>

When the Policing Authority was being set up, there was some discussion in relation to our role, etc.  We do not believe that there is any difficulty in relation to clarity of role and in relation to overlap or gap existing because we have regular communication with them.  We have never had a difficulty in relation to resources and I would think that anyone looking at the work that we have done in the reports to date would say that we have used resources quite well, with only nine support staff and three inspectors.  There is no difficulty as far as we are concerned in relation to the effective use of our resources.</p> <p>  In regard to the other bodies, their functions are quite discrete and quite clear.  I am not sure what would be gained by putting the three of them together.  We have quite distinct roles.</p></speech>

In the setting up of the Policing Authority, it was suggested that the roles might be rolled up together.</p> <p>  In regard to the implementation, there is value in our having a separate existence, from the point of view of independence, to be able to go into a situation and identify the problems and bring forward solutions.  The Policing Authority has its strong role in questioning and calling to account the Commissioner in relation to broader issues as well as the implementation of those particular recommendations themselves.</p></speech>

The Policing Authority cannot look at issues around State security or some of those more sensitive issues.  We can look at every area of policing and we are slightly different.</p> <p>  On inspections, the much of what I have done in the inspectorate has involved external agencies and other Departments.  We have started to look at issues because policing is about more than merely what the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can do.  It is about the courts.  It is about the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  In the most recent report, we look at Tusla.  We have gone far beyond the police service.</p> <p>  In other jurisdictions, they are all very different.  The UK now has moved to police and crime commissioners rather than a policing authority, but in England and Wales, they have a completely separate policing inspectorate because they do not want to lose the focus on policing.  We would not like to be consumed into another organisation that necessarily takes us away from policing.</p></speech>

These discussions have taken place and we have been involved in them.  We see merit in broadening the criminal justice aspect to take in sectors other than just the police.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a really important aspect and we would not like to lose the inspectorate's focus on policing in Ireland.</p></speech>

With regard to governance, consider the system I mentioned.  It involves a unit, separate from the operational environment, making decisions on what a crime should be, classifications and detections.  I refer to the centre in Castlebar, the Garda Information Services Centre, GISC.  We have recommended and it has been accepted that it should be the decision-maker, taking responsibility from those who are assessed on their performance.  This is in order that superintendents will not be making decisions on what a crime should be or when a crime is detected when it sits with their operational environment.  It is a matter of taking that decision-making from them and having it carried out independently.  This will result in consistency across the State in deciding what a crime should be.  When I looked at crime statistics, I noted that in County Donegal an assessment of criminal damage might be made in the case of a certain incident but in County Kerry it might be called a burglary and somewhere else, a trespass.  One of them is correct.  A central unit will decide consistently across the State on what the crime should be in the circumstances in which it is detected.  This represents a far better system and takes away any inference that somebody has made a decision that is inappropriate.  Most of the problems were inconsistencies.  Two individuals might have a slightly different opinion on a crime, but if there is a national unit to make the decision, one will start to have consistency in recording, particularly detections of a crime.</p></speech>

We called it as it was at the time.  The plans have now been put in place and the strategic transformation office is in existence.  There was a challenge associated with the volume of recommendations made by the inspectorate and in other reports.  Our understanding is that the plan is now in place.  The Commissioner's modernisation and reform plan has been published and an office is overseeing its implementation.  There is now more than traction and we are in the implementation stage, but we maintain the view that we would like to see more energetic implementation.  It is always the case that we would like to see more timely implementation.  Most of the 574 recommendations we have made to date, particularly the recent ones, have been sequenced according to short, medium and long-term priority.  We would like to see the short-term recommendations implemented, followed, obviously, by the others thereafter.  To answer the Deputy's question, there is a framework now in place, in addition to a structure and staff.  We hope the traction will be a little speedier.</p></speech>

On many occasions, going back seven years, we have made recommendations concerning sergeants and inspectors on duty on the front line, in operational units and in filling the gaps.  That is a crucial gap in the organisation and we have constantly raised it as an issue.  The O'Higgins report covers the years 2007, 2008 and 2009 and crimes when there was no supervisor on duty.  Sometimes one will have inexperienced garda&iacute; investigating crimes; it is necessary, therefore, to have a supervisor with them to lead, direct and train them.  Many youngsters coming out of the college in Templemore at the time in question did not have a sergeant to train, look after and supervise them.  That is a really important part of a young officer's career and it was a significant gap. </p> <p>  Civilianisation dates back nearly 20 years.  The thrust of our last report was to try to get police officers working on tasks and roles in which their skills would be used.  Twenty years ago there was a Government-sponsored report on civilianisation.  It stated that every time a civilian member was brought in, there should be one police officer going out to perform a police officer's role, but that has not happened.  Civilianisation has been woefully slow.  There are many highly trained, experienced garda&iacute; engaged in administrative roles and roles that do not require police skills.  One might need technical skills, but it is a waste.</p><p>That is because it is expensive to train them and it takes a long time.  One then puts them into a role that a professionally trained member of support staff could do.  Other organisations have tried to ensure that when they recruit a support staff member, they release a police officer for the front line.  Those are two where, actually, we would have seen more police officers on the front line and more sergeants and inspectors available to supervise them properly.</p></speech>

It could be career-threatening or career-damaging.  In an organisation in which certainty is really important from the point of view of prosecution, that is almost understandable and it is not unique to the Irish police service.  At the same time, it is a situation that hinders initiative.  There has to be scope for leadership, vision and the encouragement of initiative.  This has happened in the public sector and a wide variety of organisations.  On the second question in relation to time, a change in culture can take years.  It can take years from the point of view of international policing services.  We have studied cultural change in New Zealand, Australia and other areas like that in police services and it can happen.  There are steps.  It is not something that is impossible; it is something that can happen.  There are clear steps that can be taken along the way from the point of view of vision from the top and an agreement to the vision all the way up and down the ranks.  Supervisors all through the ranks can agree with and understand the vision and the need to deliver it.  The vision should be included in performance management through which there should be an assessment of how one has delivered on the vision of the organisation.</p> <p>  There are quick wins as regards the changing of culture.  Culture has changed in large organisations.  I give the example in an Irish context of the Courts Service.  When the administration of the courts moved from the Department to the Courts Service when the latter was established, it had a particular insight into customer service.  The service had working groups, a vision from the top, leadership and it worked and is continuing to work.  It may not be perfect in all circumstances and I am sure organisations would agree with that, but culture can change.  There are quick wins along the way, but it is something that cannot be done overnight.  However, it is not quite overnight at the moment.</p></speech>

Have the witnesses seen it work where a team was brought in to work with the leadership in an organisation?  Perhaps, the team has put a small bit of pressure on the leadership to try to get the implementation done.  Do the witnesses have any experience of that?</p></speech>

Culture, where the vision is only at the top, is also resisted.  While it is important to have some external expertise, culture must be bred from within an organisation.  The most important point here is that there is a vision at the top that is understood and embraced by other leadership and other supervisory levels down through the organisation.  While there is a need for some external encouragement and mechanisms, it must be bred internally.</p></speech>

In New Zealand and Australia, where there has been significant cultural change across very complex and very challenging cultural issues, it was the incumbent, sitting police commissioner who drove the change.  What is necessary is a clarity of the vision in relation to the culture that is required and either a restatement of the values that are there or, at least, a rebranding of them.  There should be a clear focus and a clear plan, which I believe is included in the modernisation and reform plan, to deliver that.</p></speech>

I thank the team.  It is no reflection on them.  There were just two very short questions.  One is on the call centre.  It is an unfortunate title because it suggests young people in India, with whom there is nothing wrong, making decisions about police work.  Are they supervised by a garda?  What level of training do these people get?  I note in relation to the references to civilianisation in court or prison work that the problem in Scotland was that a lot of it was done by private companies.  I assume that is not the case here.  What is the name of that team?</p> <p>  On the inquiries the inspectorate has initiated itself, is the sex abuse one the first?  When are we likely to see an outcome there?  On technology, it has been put to us by garda&iacute; that while the new computerisation is useful, they are bogged down in more administrative work with fewer resources than before.  Has that been the inspectorate's experience?</p></speech>

It is one of the most professional group of people I have met.  They have performance management data and are highly trained.  They become experts in classification and garda&iacute; have been involved in the training.  There are now garda&iacute; attached to the centre, which was not previously the case.  They now have garda&iacute; in there who can answer any technical questions and I was very impressed with them.  It is a professional organisation.</p></speech>

It is part of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  They are civilian employees and they are very impressive.  They understand crime and are starting to become very adept in understanding what a crime is.  They also have prompts so that they can ask a garda whether he or she has carried out a particular action at a crime scene.  That is to assist garda&iacute; when investigating crimes locally.  They are very professional and I am very impressed with them.</p> <p>  On the child sexual abuse issue, we published a report in 2012.

PULSE has been upgraded and there have been significant changes.  We are still recommending a new system.  Garda&iacute; need to get a computer-aided dispatch system in, so that calls from the public are recorded electronically.  Paper still generates a great deal of the activity and they are trying to do a lot of things to reduce that.  However, it is very bureaucratic and they could use e-mail more.  There are technology systems and devices already available that garda&iacute; should use more rather than becoming reliant on paper reports.  They could put all their information onto the PULSE system instead of doing a separate paper report that can get lost.  It is not an electronic, recorded system with times and dates when that information was put on the system.</p></speech>

I thank the representatives of the inspectorate for coming in again.  It is good to see the witnesses who we have met a good few times over the years.  I will be as brief as I possibly can.  I am conscious that the witnesses have been sitting for a while now.  A number of statistics were identified in the opening statement and in the various reports of the inspectorate.  A matter I have addressed before to all the policing bodies, as well as to current and former Commissioners, is the use of professional, non-sworn members or the professionalisation or civilianisation, as some call it, of police services.  At the moment, 83% of our garda&iacute; are deployed on front-line duties while 93% is the average in other jurisdictions.  Will the inspectorate complete follow-up evaluations on the allocations and are there any measures within the inspectorate's suggested recommendations in the past or future that might assist the Commissioner in improving that statistic?</p></speech>

The 83% refers to every member.  That is every uniformed and detective member.</p><p>Up to 83% of garda&iacute; in the organisation are on the front line.  The definition of &ldquo;front line&rdquo; is quite wide, including anyone who has daily contact with the public.  It could be someone receiving a 999 call, someone on a front counter, or someone dealing with a member of the public on the street.  We found that other police services had tried to get rid of all of the back office support and become leaner at the top to protect that front line.  Most European countries have suffered from recession and austerity, resulting in reduced police officer numbers.  When we looked at the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over a five-year period, we did not see that same protection of the front line.  It had lost many people from the front line but appeared to be supporting the back-office support.  We felt that was the wrong approach.</p><p> Civilianisation is about professionalisation.  When we talked to senior garda&iacute;, such as superintendents and chief superintendents, they tended to talk about clerical support.  Civilianisation to us involves people who examine fingerprints or a crime scene.  There is a role for clerical support staff.  However, we are looking at many of the technical aspects because they are training a police officer twice.  They are training them to be a police officer and then to be, say, a fingerprint expert.  There are many bright and energetic people coming out of universities with all sorts of qualifications which would mean they already have many of those skills.  One only needs to train them to do the role, not to be a police officer.</p><p> We also found many police officers sitting in administration units.  The divisional launch will immediately free up police officers to go back out on patrol-----</p></speech>

That does not include posts we had already identified in crime investigation, such as people answering the telephone, people at front counters and people looking after people detained in Garda stations.  In most other policing services, those functions are now performed by support staff.  The 1,500 does not include an enormous number every day who are performing roles in Garda divisions and stations.  Conservatively, I would say the figure is 1,500.</p></speech>

Comparatively speaking between ourselves and the United Kingdom in size and population, we have a massive number of Garda stations.  I listened to Mr. Toland&rsquo;s comments on people&rsquo;s perceptions as opposed to his own and the fact we have a Victorian network.  In my opinion, it has no place in our policing plans in terms of the maintenance and upkeep of X number of stations across this State when we do not need anything near that.  Perception has actually governed policy for decades, which is wrong.  What is Mr. Toland&rsquo;s view on this?</p></speech>

Scotland was interesting because it has similar geographical challenges.  We also went to Northern Ireland.  Most police services have centralised some functions such as prisoners.  Instead of having every station with two or three cells, which are probably not always fit for keeping people, police services are looking at how they can centralise the function with one properly staffed centre where prisoners can be brought.</p> <p>  The problem with that in Ireland is the geographical difficulty.  One has to take into account that one does not want garda&iacute; who have arrested someone travelling for long distances.  Many police services have a central point to take someone who is detained in custody but with a fall-back they can open if needed.  One has to be sensible.</p> <p>  Some of the Garda facilities I have visited were not in a fit state.  One had a tree growing through the middle of it.  Many of them were built 100 years ago and are not fit for modern policing.  Many of them are not in the right place because of motorways and urban generation.  Traditionally, the police station was located on the high street.  Sometimes they are not always in the right place.  It needs a strategic approach.</p></speech>

Deployment needs to be considered.  In my last command, we had some of our units based in two places because of a motorway going through the middle of it.  One needs to get to a place quickly in a 999 call which means many issues need to be taken into account.  We have given them a new model around how they operate at division.  They need to look at what facilities are available.  I believe it is more than just Garda stations.  It is libraries, other premises and clinics where the community knows a Garda will be at a certain time.  They are starting to do that and there are some good examples.</p> <p>  The future remit of the Policing Authority will take us into this territory.  For the first time, we will take a proper hard look at the dispersal of stations and facilities to assist the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to come up with a plan about how best to use those facilities and where best to put garda&iacute;.  I see a Garda station as a building for patrol officers where they start and finish.  For the rest of the time, one wants them out and about engaging with the public.  The public needs to know where it can access Garda services when they need them for non-emergencies.</p></speech>

Clearly, PULSE is an out-dated system which one is constantly adding to but not actually addressing.  Members of the Oireachtas would compare it with the system we use which is equally antiquated and ridiculous.  However, it is there.</p> <p>  Are we flogging a dead horse, asking members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to actually use such a cumbersome and time-consuming system?  I accept all systems for the recording of crime will be cumbersome, take time and officers will have to get over it.  The blunt truth with regard to PULSE is that it is 30 years out of date.  No amount of money will improve it unless it is replaced.  What is Mr. Toland&rsquo;s view on that?</p></speech>

The dilemma is does one invest money on a new crime investigation and management system when one does not have a national call recording system.  The Garda has decided to invest heavily in a call-recording system and is looking at a system where they can manage resources more effectively.  Those are good systems in operation in any modern police service.</p> <p>  The decision has been taken to improve PULSE.  Some tremendous improvements have been made.  As I stated in my opening statement, the Garda has been able to use what it has in a far more efficient way.</p> <p>  One issue we found in crime investigation was the Garda was not using the technology it had to its full capacity.  Some minor changes and use of that technology would make it far more efficient.  We have recommended a new crime investigation system.  The Garda will try to upgrade PULSE to deliver that system.  It will introduce a new major crime investigation system.  If there is a homicide or kidnapping, the Garda will bring in new technology that will allow it to put statements on the system and be able to search words to manage serious investigations.</p> <p>  PULSE is here to stay for the immediate future.  Obviously, from what has been done recently, the Garda can make changes to make it a far better and more robust system.</p></speech>

While I do not like to bring up personal matters in the committee, I have personal experience of this.</p><p>It is something people talk to me about fairly regularly.  I have done it myself.  When I finish work late at night and take my dog for a walk, I have often seen people dipping into bring banks and clothing banks in an organised fashion.  I have called the Garda with a registration number and have called back a week later to find out that there has been no follow-up.  It was never recorded.  The garda&iacute; in question said whatever they needed to say on the phone to get me off it.  I do not identify who is calling but I should not have to.  I find that frustrating, which is why when I heard Mr. Toland saying that those taking calls were not recording them, it sprang into my memory.  This has happened a couple of times in the past seven or eight months.  In terms of the implementation of a programme to ensure officers are doing it, how does the inspectorate oversee that?  I know there are many structural changes it is recommending but at the same time, how does it oversee things in order that the systems are in place to ensure officers are recording crime effectively?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-19a.218" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Toland" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2016101900002#L00200"><p>Some divisions in Ireland, particularly in Dublin, have an electronic call recording system whereby if someone dials 999, it is answered by a call taker and they immediately create an electronic record.  The minute we have that, there is capacity for supervision, and a sergeant at the end of a tour of duty or the supervisor in that control room should contact that individual member to remind them and ensure it goes on the PULSE incident recording system.  We have made a very simple suggestion that the officer gives the number of the PULSE record in order that the call record can be correlated with the PULSE record.  That is now starting to happen.</p> <p>  What cannot be legislated for or supervised is where a garda is approached on the street by a member of the public who tells that garda he or she has had his or her wallet stolen or has been a victim of crime.  That individual garda must then put that crime on the system.</p> <p>  One of the issues for us concerns the way crimes are allocated for investigation.  We have recommended a new model of allocation of crimes for investigation because that garda in the street becomes the investigator if he or she records that crime.  If that garda does not record it, it is one less crime he or she has to investigate.  That is not a good system so we are recommending specialist investigation units.</p> <p>  Domestic violence was one area that was worrying for me.  We saw some shocking examples where a victim had reported an injury and either it did not get on the system in the first place as a crime or was recorded as some other incident but not a crime.  That is unforgivable and needs to be dealt with because it is misconduct and failing to report a crime.  That is not giving a good service to the public.  Sometimes victims have rung up to find out how the investigation of their crime is progressing to find out it was never recorded in the first place.  That needs supervision and a new investigation system will stop that because if a garda is going to deal with a domestic violence incident and there is a specialist unit that will investigate that crime, why would he or she not record it?  That garda every reason to record it because a specialist unit will investigate it.</p></speech>

What is the difference?  There is no doubt that failure to produce an insurance certificate at a station will cause a summons to issue.</p></speech>

I recall how, when I was in Mayo a few years ago, I was asked to produce my tax disc because I had forgotten to put it in the car window.  Of course, I do not live in Mayo, so when I went home, I checked and found my tax was up to date.  If they had checked the system, they would have been able to prove it.  I got notification that I had not produced my disc, which of course I had, and at the time during which the matter was being investigated, my tax disc was valid.  I just did not have it in the car window.  The point made by Deputy O'Brien is an interesting one.</p> <p>  I agree with Mr. Toland's earlier comment that the Policing Authority was the final piece in the jigsaw in respect of oversight.  In respect of all organisations but most especially given that the Policing Authority is the youngest of the three oversight bodies, in observing the creation of the authority and its progress towards operating at full tilt - I am not sure whether it is operating as such yet but I do not believe it is - does Mr. Toland think there are any identifiable legislative weaknesses in the inspectorate's role or remit or weaknesses through custom and practice in dealing with any of the other agencies with which it would have a direct function?</p></speech>

We would not use that power regularly.  It is just that there would be some inspections where we think we should turn up and get a reality check.</p> <p>  In terms of traffic, I cannot comment on the recording.  My teenage son drives.  Sometimes he gets stopped and he is not quite sure what will happen at the end of the interaction and whether he is going to receive something in the post or whether he is being given a verbal warning.  I have found that sometimes with traffic matters, some people, especially youngsters, leave an interaction with a garda unsure about whether they are going be prosecuted or whether they have been given a good telling off.</p> <p>  A traffic matter is a single incident and garda&iacute; have to produce a quick report or say that someone has been reported.  With a crime investigation, a garda has to take statements from victims and witnesses, interview the suspect and put a case file together through to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, or the superintendent will ask that garda a number of questions such as whether he or she has checked CCTV, so a crime investigation is a significant piece of work.  Many garda&iacute; currently assigned to 999 calls have no time built into their schedule to investigate crime.  They will come on today and ask their sergeant for time to take a statement.  We want investigation units where that time is built into their daily work rather than using garda&iacute; who have three or four other functions to do, of which investigation happens to be one.</p></speech>

We always talk about Garda numbers as if they are the be-all and end-all of policing, but I am more interested in Garda hours and how we utilise them.  Even I have had great difficulty in trying to find out not how many personnel are dedicated to investigating burglaries or sex crimes but how many Garda hours are spent in each area.  We would get a better idea of whether resources are being utilised to the best of our ability if we stopped talking about numbers and spoke more about the hours.  In particular, rostering is an issue.</p> <p>  We spoke a lot about cultural change but none of us touched on whistleblowers within the force.  Has there been a cultural change within the force to be more accepting of people who wish to highlight deficiencies within the operation of or even incidences of corruption within the force?  Has that cultural change been significant over recent years?</p></speech>

We have recommended that they run a similar process.  We carried out a live audit that examined what 11,000 garda&iacute; were doing on Tuesdays and on Saturdays and what the outcomes were.  We have put in a huge number of recommendations that they should run the process and ensure that, across Ireland, they have sufficient people with the right skills on duty at times when they are most needed.  Again, it identified that there was an absence of supervisors in place across all divisions.  I provided a separate addendum to the most recent report on rosters.  The current roster is a one-size-fits-all model.  In most other jurisdictions, this type of roster is designed for those officers called "regular units" who deal with 999 calls, it is not appropriate for detectives or community officers who need to be on duty at different times.  Detectives are needed on duty during the day time and at court times, not at 1 a.m. or 2 a.m. unless there is a particular reason.  We have identified a number of issues around appropriate rosters that are specific to the work being done rather than a one-size-fits-all roster.</p><p> We have no remit regarding whistleblowers.  Many of the people we have dealt with are not raising corruption, rather they raise issues relating to poor systems or practices.  Some of those, even senior officers at superintendent and chief superintendent level, have a fear about raising their hands to challenge an approach the organisation is taking or ask why it is not done differently.  Sometimes, when they do say something, it is not always well received.  On occasion, senior managers are afraid to challenge the direction of their own organisation.  I worked in an organisation in which one would be in trouble if one did not raise issues and ask whether we were doing things the right way or whether they could be done differently.  We have made recommendations to try to encourage them to get their own people to raise issues and take it down to the people on the ground floor who can raise an issue.  It does not have to be about corruption.  It could be about a poor system or paperwork or a question as to why something is being done.  There is an absence of engagement at all levels to allow staff to give feedback about what would make the organisation a much better organisation.</p></speech>

He stated earlier that the resource allocation report published in 2010 referred to the need for a national computer-aided dispatch system.  That was almost seven years ago.  The crime investigation report in 2014 also recommended "the procurement of a computer-aided dispatch system to accurately record calls for service and enable the effective deployment of resources".  Has any progress been made in respect of this matter?  During the four years between the two reports, there was no progress.  What is the current position?</p> <p>  The highlighting of the identification of good practice in different Garda divisions and parts of the country is part of Mr. Toland's report.  This was also covered as part of the crime investigation report of 2014, which also mentioned a new community policing model, crime prevention initiatives, cross-district crime operations and a number of technological initiatives to the credit of Garda management within those divisions.  Mr. Toland highlighted the fact that these are not consistently applied across the organisation, yet his report is going directly to the Garda Commissioner.  Is there any certainty that the neighbouring or distant divisions are at any time made aware of what is good practice, if not best practice, in the areas Mr. Toland has highlighted in his address?  Have these examples been highlighted to other divisions directly by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate or is there another conduit that could be employed rather than depending on the Commissioner to disseminate the information?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-19a.229" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Toland" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2016101900002#M00300"><p>The computer-aided dispatch system has been rolled out to some divisions outside Dublin, including Galway, Waterford and Cork.  The majority of other divisions do not have it.  While it does not have to be the most expensive system, it needs funding.  Around the time of our report, the Government had made &euro;200 million available and this is one of the projects that is being progressed.  In the interim, we have suggested that a cheap electronic database or recording system be introduced rather than waiting for the new system to be introduced in two years' time, or however long it takes.  As an inspectorate, we go out and ask questions which result in paper searches.  There is an absence of important management data that could tell management how busy they are, the types of calls coming in, the results of the calls and allow them to audit what the officers are doing in the hours available.  This is a significant gap.</p> <p>  We have sometimes found, even within the same Garda division, that a district was doing something that the district next door was not doing.  Even within one division, good practices was not always shared.  The victims offices are an example of where we found good practice in Waterford and some of the Dublin divisions where a victims office was in operation.  The Commissioner has rolled them out across the 28 divisions.  A victim of crime can now contact a single office, instead of trying to get hold of an individual garda who dealt with the crime he or she experienced.  This is very positive.  There is a Garda professional standards unit that does a similar function to us internally.  They often go to conferences where there are senior officers, who will deliver their findings and try to share good practice.  There is also a Garda portal within their organisation so they can post good practice and initiatives they are running.  They need champions in the organisation to ensure that where they identify something that is good practice, works and makes a difference, it is rolled out across all the divisions.</p></speech>

I asked whether she is such a champion, and she said she is.  I hope that proves to be the case.  Mr. Toland has used strong language in terms of his assessment of the system across the board.  He said it was "highly inefficient and negatively impacts on the deployment of resources".  It is a strong statement and it should be highlighted and should not be lost in the overall presentation.  Mr. Toland also said, "The current Garda culture is inhibiting change".  This is a very strong statement and it needs to be noted and taken on board for all the right reasons.  Mr. Toland also said, "While staff identified positives, such as a can-do culture and a sense of duty [all very welcome] many described the organisation as insular and defensive with a blame culture whereby many leaders are reluctant to make decisions and speak up".  Mr. Toland referred to this in one of his responses.</p><p>The word "many" is significant.  When we spoke to the Commissioner last week, she was at pains, understandably, to reference the number of whistleblowers as being small - a handful - in terms of the overall number in the service of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but many staff have a view of the organisation as insular and defensive and with a blame culture.  In the engagements Mr. Toland has had, would many members have instanced situations he would have felt necessitated advice to refer to senior management or even to the newly prescribed means of highlighting these problems directly to GSOC through the protected disclosures process?  Has such a situation ever presented in those engagements or has the Garda Inspectorate not been viewed by individuals members as an opportunity to reflect on serious matters, several of which have been highlighted in the recent past?  The greater number of us are dependent on what the media tells us about these matters.</p></speech>

We triangulate our evidence and our findings by checking case files, talking to staff, members of the public and other partner agencies.  We, therefore, do not use just one strain of a finding to make a comment.  When we make strong comments, it is because we have found three or four different sources.  Ms Fisher mentioned earlier that we have spoken to more than 2,500 members of the organisation from the Commissioner through every rank to garda&iacute; on the front line, civilian staff and reserves and we see people in rank order.  We do not have focus groups where we mix with sergeants with inspectors with garda&iacute; because we found that people are less willing to talk.  We have not had any trouble getting people to talk to us.  We can have a one to one and people are honest.  I have had people who have admitted not recording crime.  We have had people in large groups who have raised issues.  We have done workshops and we have tried a different number of fora.  People do not see us like GSOC, which is investigating them; they see us as an organisation that can help them with some equipment or can try to work through some of the blockages.  Many people have said to us that they had never had that opportunity previously.  We open doors for people to raise issues with us.  We try to make sure our reports are balanced and fair but, most important, we want them to be accurate and drive change.  We predominantly want to make sure that we help to make policing better to ensure the confidence of the community increases in policing.  I am a police officer and I love going back into a Garda station because that is where I worked for 30 years.  No aspect of this influences us.  I could potentially be a recipient of Garda services tomorrow morning and, therefore, we try to make sure they deliver the best service.</p> <p>  With regard to the culture comments, that is what members said back to us at all ranks and grades.  There were some positives.  We always try to focus on the positives and not on the negative about being defensive and insular and not accepting sometimes that people have found mistakes in the organisation.  Many people contact us.  We give out our calling cards.  Sometimes people come to us after a meeting or an interview.  We always give people what we think is appropriate advice.  People have raised issues with me about the way they have been dealt with by a supervisor and, in one place, I got their consent and I spoke to the chief superintendent personally after the visit to highlight an issue in a particular unit.  We do not keep secrets.  If we find something that is critical, we will always tell the senior officer in the place that we have been in order that he or she is made aware of it.</p> <p>  People also contact us.  The public and garda&iacute; ring us and send e-mails.  We do not turn people away.   If they want to come to see us, we are more than happy to meet them.  We are particularly interested if it is a process issue.  If it is a criminal matter or if it is an internal matter or related to corruption, we refer them to the appropriate body, such as GSOC, Transparency International Ireland and to their own organisation but we want to retain the confidence of the person who has come to us.  We meet people and we try to make sure we provide appropriate support and advice.  Most people who ring us tell us they agree with something in the report.  After we published Changing Policing in Ireland, people contacted us because they could see something in the report that they felt they had contributed to.  Many people rang us to thank us for putting this in the report in the hope that it would make a difference to their daily lives in policing.</p></speech>

We treat all our interactions with members of the force, Garda staff and our stakeholders with the highest confidentiality.  If an issue is raised about policy or it is an issue that rightly that needs further attention, we would never use identifying factors to name the individual, unit or whatever.  Any identifying factors are stripped away and, therefore, the issue is raised in a way that maintains the confidence of the person.  That is important to the inspectorate because of the confidentiality of the work we do.</p></speech>

However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>The subject matter of the meeting is &quot;A Vision for Public Transport in Ireland&quot;, which includes the level of State subvention required.  I am conscious that we have a number of representatives of trade unions with us.  It would be remiss of me, as Chairman, not to point out that the committee has no role, nor can it, in industrial relations matters, particularly when such matters are before the Workplace Relations Commission.  I ask delegates and members to bear this in mind when making their remarks.  </p><p>Opening presentations should not be longer than five minutes.  I will start with Professor Reynolds-Feighan who I understand needs to leave before 10 a.m.  After hearing the opening statement of each representative, I ask committee members to direct their initial questions to Professor Reynolds-Feighan.</p></speech>

The work it is doing will have important implications for the future development of the country as transport is a core and vital contributor to the economic and social fabric of the island.  I am a professor of transport economics at UCD and have worked on various aspects of transport economics in Irish, European and North American contexts.  I teach courses in transport economics, urban and regional economics and aviation economics.  My research has focused principally on air and road transport and gives particular attention to the role of networks and the measurement of transport accessibility for communities and regions.  </p> <p>  The set of documents published by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for the strategic framework for investment in land transport offers an excellent review of the state of Irish transport and rehearses the main issues facing policy makers.  I am encouraged by the long-term strategic approach being advocated in this framework.  A long-term perspective, integrated land use and transportation planning and evidence-based decision-making are essential ingredients in designing and implementing sound policies.  I will mention a small number of issues that seem to be at the core of how a vision for public transport for Ireland should be shaped and developed.  </p> <p>  Ireland has a low population density by international standards - 67 persons per square kilometre compared to the EU average of 117.  The transport solutions to moving people and goods when population density is generally low and the population is dispersed are necessarily road based.  Households, firms, public and private transport service providers, passenger, freight and emergency services all share the road space in undertaking activities and meeting their mobility needs.  Irish transport is overwhelmingly road based.</p><p>Practically all freight is carried by road.  Passenger travel is also predominantly road based, with 75% public transport being bus transport.  Road-based public transport solutions make sense given the geographic and demographic characteristics.</p><p> There are a limited number of high-density corridors that justify rail solutions in interurban or intra-urban contexts.  With the completion of the interurban motorway network, rail has suffered stiff competition from bus operators in supplying interurban travel options.  There is limited potential for development of the rail network because of these characteristics.   I very much support the development of bus rapid transit routes in Dublin as a vital short-term measure to contribute to the development of the public transit system and offer potential network economies to improve the financial viability of the urban public transport system.</p><p> Historically, Irish infrastructure investment has tended to be pro-cyclical.  Investment by Government in surface transport infrastructure peaked during the boom years between 2004 and 2008 and has fallen sharply since then.  Expenditure by Government has consistently fallen far short of the revenue generated by the sector.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport reports that spending has averaged 49% of revenue between 2001 and 2014.  In my view, a commitment to consistent and sustained investment in infrastructure needs to be made by Government so that better management of the maintenance and development of the transport networks and other key infrastructure can be embedded in the various agencies charged with these duties.  Transport infrastructure will generate growth as well as revenue for the State, but a stepped increase in investment is required if this recovery is to be sustained.  We cannot afford to continue using the transport sector as a revenue generator without regularising investments in its maintenance and development.</p><p> The development of hub and spoke networks to optimise ridership and feed passengers to public transport routes requires locally-based initiatives such as the rural transport scheme.  Real-time information is crucial to facilitate the development of such initiatives.  More generally, gaps in transport service provision can be identified if good quality and timely information is at hand.  As a priority all transport services providers and support agencies should make information available to the public, and in a timely manner.</p><p> I support the focused use of public service obligations and competitive tendering in the provision of public transport services.  Sluggish responsiveness of public transport supply to the growing demand of users results in rapid increases in car ownership and car usage.  It can be a slow process to win market share once car dependence has been established.  The use of PSOs is an efficient competitive tendering process for ensuring provision of required services and for containing costs.</p><p> The benefits of the transport system have been narrowly measured in traditional studies and evaluation procedures.  The wider economic benefits need to be quantified and incorporated into the analysis so that appropriate budgets and expenditure plans can be determined.  This relates to both the provision of transport infrastructure and transport services.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has advocated a broader transport appraisal framework and I fully support this approach.  Bespoke Irish research and the broader development of expertise in transportation economics are essential for the planning, management and delivery of good quality transportation systems.</p><p> I again thank the committee for the opportunity to present my views.</p></speech>

It is they along with fellow ordinary decent workers who keep the wheels of the economy turning.<br/><br/>As the foremost front-line trade union in CIE with the largest membership across the public bus transport sector we make no apologies about having prosecuted a dispute at Dublin Bus in furtherance of a long overdue and well deserved pay rise after eight years of austerity.  We now find ourselves facing into a doomsday scenario that Bus &Eacute;ireann may attempt to impose unilateral changes to terms and conditions of its own staff, a situation which has been brought to bear by a policy driven at Department level and implemented, it would appear, with zest by the NTA.<br/><br/>This situation if allowed to develop unchecked will inevitably lead to industrial action, potentially across the public transport sector.  The notion that unionised workers in the CIE group of companies would stand idly by and allow one of those companies to ride roughshod over fellow workers' terms and conditions is simply untenable.  Those politicians who are minded to, as it were, mind their business or wash their hands of the problems at Bus &Eacute;ireann would be well advised to think again.  Rural Ireland has a habit of making the dog bark; it is called election time.<br/><br/>As the recession hit and revenue declined due to falling passenger numbers the three CIE companies engaged in impactful rationalisation plans which streamlined services, eliminated some terms and conditions and subjected staff to pay cuts.  In the case of Dublin Bus it is worth noting that the 2015 subvention level should have been &euro;60 million but &euro;2 million was deducted because the NTA deemed that profits made from public service obligation business were unreasonable.  The formula used by the NTA to calculate reasonable profit is an anachronism in the modern financial world in that the NTA uses return on equity and not turnover as is common practice.  The more salient point here is that there would have been no unreasonable profit if workers were not enduring pay cuts at the time.<br/><br/>As members may be aware, the previous administration initiated the tender process to privatise 10% of Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The tender documents which surfaced this summer have a criterion of 65% cost.  The only variable in bus transport is labour costs.  The NBRU had to resort to initiating a High Court challenge against the previous Minister and the Department as a vital component of our anti-privatisation campaign in 2015.  With the support of trade union colleagues we were relatively successful in our challenge to this anti-worker policy by having the principle of social clauses, namely an REA and SEO, agreed as part of the LRC-brokered settlement proposals.<br/><br/>We await publication of the legislative changes promised by Government in response to flaws in the current Act which the NBRU highlighted.  However, it appears that those in Government are determined to pursue a policy which will inevitably lead to conflict.  The trouble at Bus &Eacute;ireann's Expressway can be directly linked to the Department-led and NTA-implemented policy of issuing and amending licences in the commercial bus market.<br/><br/>The NTA will, of course, contend that the customer has more choice and greater options.  However, it will not admit that it has increased seat capacity on the Dublin-Limerick route by 111%, the Dublin-Cork route by 128% and the Dublin-Waterford route by 55%.  Oversupply of seat availability does not equate to market demand.  Saturating the market to unsustainable levels with a plethora of operators is not a visionary transport policy; all it achieves is the eventual demise of some of those operators, ending up with either a monopoly or at best a duopoly.<br/><br/>I earlier mentioned barking dogs.  Rural Ireland can be unforgiving when it comes removing or threatening its vital social and economic service providers - rural post offices, bank and Garda station closures being a case in point.  Here is another stark reality.  Under pressure from this oversupply in capacity and in order to attempt to compete, Bus &Eacute;ireann has now come stopped serving 200 towns and villages.  The NTA is now placing an extra burden on the taxpayer by introducing additional PSO services into some of these areas.  The most recent example of this is an &euro;880,000 contract to M&amp;amp;A Coaches in June this year to areas once served by Bus &Eacute;ireann.<br/><br/>The NTA, aside from being the authority is also the transport regulator.  This is a function that is not being carried out regarding commercial bus licences.  According to the 2009 Act, the NTA has the following obligation when awarding commercial licences: </p><blockquote>10.- (1) In considering an application for the grant of a licence the Authority, having regard to the general objectives established under section 10 of the Act of 2008- <blockquote><blockquote>(<i>a</i>) shall take account of the demand or potential demand that exists for the public bus passenger services to which the application refers having regard to the needs of consumers and any existing public bus passenger services on or in the vicinity of the route to be served by the proposed public bus passenger services, and </blockquote></blockquote></blockquote> <p>I will skip the next section, if members do not mind.<br/><br/>For years Bus &Eacute;ireann has cross-subsidised the underfunded PSO services with profits from its commercial operation by more than &euro;40 million.  I have provided members with a table outlining that in detail.  However, this option is now longer available to Bus &Eacute;ireann because of the non-regulation of the commercial bus market.  As a result the transport network built up by decades of hard work is fragmenting before our eyes leaving the less densely populated portions of rural Ireland without public transport.  The subvention levels at Bus &Eacute;ireann have decreased from &euro;49.4 million in 2009 to &euro;33 in 2015.  I will skip the section about Irish Rail; members may ask me questions about it if they want.<br/><br/>Yet another myth that needs to be challenged is the notion often peddled by the privateers that Transdev, as a private company, is a shining example of how a public transport system can be operated.  Here are some startling facts.  Transdev is actually owned by the Deposits and Consignment Fund, the French equivalent of our NTMA.</p><p>Transdev Ireland Limited, a holding company, returns a dividend to the French state every year paid for by the Irish taxpayer.  Interestingly, the previous CEO of the NTA, Mr. Gerry Murphy, told the Oireachtas transport committee in January 2013 that public transport was underfunded.</p></speech>

Incidentally, the modest defined benefit pension of most bus workers - &euro;125 per week after 40 years' service and contributing nearly &euro;40,000 - is under grave threat due to funding cuts and Government rules on bond allocation.  My presentation outlines some of the spend of the NTA or, as we like to call it, the HSE on wheels.  That money would be better directed towards passenger services.</p> <p>  Furthermore, the NTA views itself as a replica of Transport for London, which has led to soaring costs for the British taxpayer to the tune of a 5,108% increase in subsidies.  At the same time, the subvention to the CIE group has reduced from &euro;321 million to &euro;188 million.  That is a 41% decrease.</p></speech>

We will focus on two issues: the subvention to Dublin Bus and the underfunding of CIE to cover the costs of the free travel scheme.  This lays the basis on which we can support a new vision of public transport.</p> <p>  By European comparison, Ireland devotes relatively low levels of subvention support to public transport.  As the committee can imagine, this results in poorer services and higher fares, which drive up traffic congestion, and creates an unnecessary burden on households, businesses, the environment and quality of life for people in this city.  Members will be aware of the reductions in the Dublin Bus subvention since 2008, a cut of &euro;28 million or 32.6%.  This contrasts with a general cut in Government expenditure of a little less than 10%.  Public transport has taken a disproportionate hit since 2008.</p> <p>  We compare poorly with subvention levels in other EU cities.  The data lag, unfortunately, as there is no comprehensive database that covers all of these subventions because they are done at national, regional and local levels.  However, a number of studies show that we fall considerably behind.  Whereas it is usual for a city transport service to have a subvention of approximately 50% of total revenue, our level is approximately 20%.  I will put this into perspective so that we do not get lost in percentages.  If the subvention of Dublin Bus were at the average level of comparable European cities, it would be receiving &euro;175 million more per year.  Some might call this a cost, but we would call it an opportunity.</p> <p>  Regarding the free travel subsidy, it has been contended that CIE and Dublin Bus have not fully recouped the costs of operating the free travel scheme from the Department of Social Protection.  There is evidence to support this contention.  My submission includes a lengthy quote from the Secretary General of the Department of Social Protection, Ms Niamh O'Donoghue, from when she appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts.  I will not read it all, only two or three particular points.  She stated: "the funding provided for the [free travel] scheme was originally based on ridership surveys ... in October 1973".  That was 30 or 40 years ago.  I cannot do the math off the top of my head.</p></speech>

These data are 43 years out of day.  Essentially, Ms O'Donoghue accepted that CIE had not been compensated.  As CIE is not compensated for the free travel scheme, it must externalise the cost.  This is done through higher fares, fewer services for households or depressed wages and working conditions for staff.</p> <p>  We propose three suggestions for the committee to consider.  First, it should undertake a detailed study of the subventions to public transport and public bus services in European cities comparable to Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway.  In Europe, smaller cities and towns have even higher levels of subvention to support their bus services.</p> <p>  Second, the committee should request or even commission a new ridership survey.  1973 was a long time ago and does not form the basis of current travel patterns.  Third, the committee should continue today's work and initiate a consultation process among stakeholders in public transport as to what a fully subsidised modern public transport system would look like.  We commend the committee on starting already, but its consultation should extend beyond employers, employees, Government agencies, experts and academics.  Though valuable as they are, the process should extend to the public itself - community and civil society groups.  Everyone should have a stake in the design and implementation of public transport because it affects everyone in this city.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-19a.274" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Willie Noone" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2016101900002#E02100"><p>On behalf of SIPTU, I thank the committee for the opportunity to outline our union's concerns regarding the future of public transport and the level of State subvention that is required to ensure that public transport is a mode of transport that can be grown and sustained with high standards of safety, reliability and cleanliness and increased access for all consumers, regardless of whether they are urban or rural based or whether they have disabilities.  The workers who provide the service should also have proper and reasonable terms and conditions of employment, as their efforts and endeavours are an integral part of delivering public transport.  There is a direct link between under-resourcing and cutting conditions of employment and the subsequent public services that are available for the public.</p> <p>  SIPTU is Ireland's largest trade union and the only union that organises and represents workers across all categories in Irish Rail, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus in all depots and in all geographical areas within the CIE group as well as representing workers in Transdev, which operates the Luas, and in private bus companies, ports, docks and the aviation sector.  Hence, SIPTU is a key stakeholder in public and private transport provision, seeking to represent the interests of our directly employed members through collective bargaining as well as the interests of our wider membership and the citizens at large, many of whom rely on and require an appropriately run, properly resourced - through revenue and appropriate levels of State subvention - and integrated and sustainable national public transport service.</p> <p>  According to a variety of economic indicators, the economy has started to grow again after years of recession.  A properly funded and resourced public transport system has the potential to be a spur for sustainable economic growth.  However, public transport is at a crossroads, having suffered from chronic underfunding and a decrease in passenger numbers during the period of the economic crash.</p><p>We now need an ambitious yet realistic and viable vision for public transport in Ireland to 2020 and beyond.  We, in SIPTU, which represents thousands of workers who deliver public transport, want to contribute to this debate from the perspective of not only supporting our members who deliver public transport but also for the tens of thousands of citizens, many of them members of our union and other unions, who rely on public transport as an economic and social necessity.<br/><br/>The provision and resourcing of public transport by previous Governments has been good and bad.  The purpose of today's presentation is not to recriminate in terms of who was or was not to blame but rather to expose the facts, outline past and upcoming problems and urge the people whose voices can be heard to influence for the better the manner in which public transport should and could be managed and resourced into the future.<br/><br/>This union is to the forefront in stating that public transport provision is currently under-funded.  The strategy for the future is also at a crossroads as the direction and decisions that Government takes when deciding on expanding the tendering of routes in the bus market, the adoption of measures in the Fourth Railway Package, and the level and mechanisms of funding public transport services into the future will leave either a poor or good legacy on politicians who have the influence to drive the necessary changes now that would leave Ireland with a public transport model that consumers and its providers would want.  Mistakes in deciding the way forward may not only be costly but the consequences of any mistakes may be long term.<br/><br/><b></b>I have provided a detailed report, which I know the Chairman has read, but I will focus on the main facets of that.  A report on Government policy in 2008 dealt with a number of headings such as car usage, population, congestion, pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and public transport users, all of which were to increase.  The strategy at the time was how to deal with that.  In terms of the Government's vision, it was supposed to lead to a shift to public transport, ease of access to public transport, reduce congestion and travel times, cut greenhouse gas emissions etc.  A number of the key elements of that report, which was entitled A Sustainable Transport Future - Smarter Travel, have been highlighted, which I will briefly detail.  One stated: &quot;...we will consider an extension of the existing school transport scheme&quot;.  That was supposed to happen.  It was supposed to consider fiscal measures aimed at reducing car use; introduce competitive tendering for public service obligation, PSO, services over and above those currently provided by Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann; link the PSO subvention to growth in patronage; offer a seven days a week transport service for rural communities and those in smaller urban areas; examine, as part of the review, the current distance eligibility criteria for school transport, in particular, where it is not feasible to provide safe walkways and-or cycle paths; and review the public service obligation with regard to other services such as aviation etc.  What happened, however, was that it did the complete opposite.  The numbers carried under the school transport scheme have decreased<b></b>instead of being expanded.  Fiscal measures have ensured that car usage is still needed.  PSO services that Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus provided at the time were tendered.  The PSO subvention was never linked<b></b>to growth in patronage.  The seven days a week service did not occur.  The only plan that was in operation was to reduce subvention, increase tendering of existing services and drive Expressway, in particular, and Bus &Eacute;ireann into extinction.  The subvention was reviewed, and it was reduced.  My colleague spoke about the subvention levels as outlined in the report, so I will not repeat that.<br/><br/>A particular exercise was done to compare operating costs that arise from fare box versus subvention.  The data is from 2000 but the starkest statistic from that is that if we take the averages in cities like Bologna in Italy, 38% of operating costs come from the fare box and 56% from subvention.  In Amsterdam, 25% comes from fare box and 64% comes from subvention.  When we look at Dublin, however, 96.4% of operating costs come from fare box and 3.6%<b></b>comes from subvention.<br/><br/>SIPTU has outlined a number of visions and a charter.  I will not go through them in detail but will outline the headings.</p></speech>

We should review the legislative remit and performance of the National Transport Authority, and the issues and difficulties we have with that.  We should support a derogation for Ireland and the application of the Fourth Railway Package.  We should review and amend the current legislation on the EU directives, which is flawed.  We should support a sector employment order in both the PSO part of the market and for the commercial bus market.</p> <p>  A number of our workers who are employed in these companies were involved in a number of industrial disputes recently.  It would be remiss of me not to add that this needs to be seriously examined to ensure that the chaos that has prevailed among our membership with regard to conditions of employment and security of employment are addressed.</p></speech>

He will have an opportunity to contribute later.  I am conscious that Professor Reynolds-Feighan has to leave shortly.  Five members are offering, and I ask them to limit to one minute any specific questions to Professor Reynolds-Feighan.  I call Senator Feighan who will be followed by Deputies Munster, Barry, Catherine Murphy and Senator O'Mahony.</p></speech>

First, how do we know the PSOs will improve public transport service provision?  Second, why should we invest more in transport?  I believe in it but that argument has to be made when there is significant under-funding in education and health.  Third, discussion on public transport is focused on Dublin, Cork and urban areas.  What about rural areas?  I believe the NTA is doing great work, but could we consider having a further impact in rural areas such as the one I come from?</p></speech>

My questions are as follows: can she give us a breakdown, in terms of transportation within Ireland, of the percentage that would be bus and rail and the percentage by car?  How does that compare with the European norm and other European countries?  What knock-on effects will that have in terms of congestion and carbon emissions?  I recall that when I was a young fellow Greater London Council had a Fares Fair policy, where it slashed fares on the Tube but actually made money from that because more people used the Tube.  Can Professor Reynolds-Feighan give any indication as to whether that policy has been pursued in other European countries?  Are there any countries that have zero fares as a way of encouraging the use of public transport?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-19a.282" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2016101900002#F00800"><p>Public transport is bus based because of the way our population is dispersed but with regard to heavy rail, if we take Dublin and Cork, for example, Dublin has a much wider footprint.  The three outer counties, and it is four if we include Louth, would benefit from, say, DART underground, which has been described as the game changer.  One of the reasons we got European Union funding for the first round of Luas projects was because of the costs arising from congestion including insurance costs, air emissions, time lost and so on.  Would Professor Reynolds-Feighan agree that as Dublin has the wider footprint in terms of the population of that geographic area, which is approximately one third of the country, investment in that area is key to making a difference in terms of the public attitude to public transport where it would have a wider benefit?</p></speech>

She mentioned the low density population in Ireland.  Coming from the west I would like to know if she is suggesting that in the areas with lower density of population, such as the western seaboard, there should be no investment?  With regard to freight transport, the second largest rail freight producer in the country is my own county of Mayo.</p><p>Where does Professor Reynolds-Feighan see the issue of carbon footprint in the context of balanced regional development?  Where does she see public transport in Ireland?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-19a.286" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Aisling Reynolds-Feighan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2016101900002#G00300"><p>There are a lot of questions.  I will go through some of the points quickly.  On the overall level of investment in transport infrastructure and transport provision, the Department has set out a detailed analysis of the spend on transport over the last decade.  What we see is that the level of investment is low by European standards in both infrastructure and transport service provision.  We had a very significant investment programme but it tended to be cyclical so our investment peaked in the 2004-08 period but we have had capital spending cuts and transport service subvention cuts since then.  Existing budget allocations are insufficient to maintain our infrastructure never mind to try to develop it further.  This has very important implications for our competitiveness.  If we look at the data in the most recent World Economic Forum global competitiveness report, we see that our rank on infrastructure competitiveness increased dramatically after 2011 when investments in the road network and light rail network came on stream.  The rankings for the quality of our roads were in the mid-20s from 2012 onwards compared to a ranking of 70 in 2008-09.  If we look at the ratings for the road network in the most recent period 2014-15 and 2015-16, we see that our ranking has declined, which is quite worrying.  Economic activity has picked up.  Macroeconomic indicators show there is positive growth.  We have seen a pick-up in traffic.  I looked at traffic counts across the national primary network for all classes of vehicles and there was a 4% pick-up in annual average daily traffic between 2014 and 2015 and a 7.5% increase between 2015 and 2016.  Congestion and delays have also picked up.  This points to a need on the part of Government to commit to upping the investment in infrastructure to maintain what we have and also expand the infrastructure and service provision.</p> <p>  Public service obligations and competitive tendering are efficient processes in providing service as well as trying to contain costs.  The PSO mechanisms allow for service reviews, quality performance benchmarks, safety requirements, service innovations and enhancements.  We can improve the quality, cost and responsiveness of service supply using this mechanism.  Public transport use can be increased if it is attractive to users in terms of cost, speed, reliability and if it presents a realistic alternative to private car use by connecting the origin-destination pairs of users.  The problem in the past is that there was a sluggish responsiveness of public transport to the growing needs of users.  Competitive tendering can help to inject cost-effectiveness and cost-competitiveness into the provision of these services.  PSO provision is not necessarily privatisation.  It is a way of trying to contain costs and also be more flexible and responsive in terms of identifying service needs and filling those needs in a cost-effective way.  </p> <p>  On the question about shares, as I mentioned in my preamble, Irish transport is very much road dependent.  That is a function of our demographics and geographic situation.  We have lower than European average rail shares and much higher than average bus shares.  That is a reflection of the fact that we have a dispersed and low density population.  In terms of the densities for rail, Senator O'Mahony asked about population densities.  It is worth comparing Irish cities with US cities because they are quite spread out compared to European cities in terms of population densities.  A number of recent studies, which I mention in the longer paper I submitted, look at density of population and employment per unit area.  Looking at the research that has come out of US analysis, the suggestion is that densities of 3,400 persons per square kilometre are the minimum necessary for light rail systems to be cost-effective.  For heavy rail systems the estimated minimum number of residents and jobs per square kilometre is around 7,000 persons per square kilometre in order for the systems to be commercially viable.  In Ireland, only Dublin and Cork come close to these population density measures.  Residential density alone is insufficient.  We have to take into account employment density because rail users need to have a reason to travel.  What we see is that there is limited scope for heavy rail in this country because of the generally low densities.  Bus rapid transit offers an opportunity in the short to medium term to provide high capacity corridors, which over time, if we can build up densities, will allow for light rail electrification of these systems over time and investment in more appropriate light rail systems.  The strategic planning framework has a very important role here in terms of developing high density corridors.  </p> <p>  In terms of rural transport and the challenge for counties that have low population densities, one thing we need to take into account is the fact that public transport is inherently multi-modal because users have to travel to access the public transport system.  In urban areas we can walk or cycle and that helps to bridge the gap but we have a real problem in rural areas.  It is a real challenge to try to bridge that gap between where people live and accessing public transport systems.  The development of hub-and-spoke networks to try to optimise ridership and passengers on the public service routes requires initiatives like the rural transport scheme.  It is very important in trying to bridge the gap to make public transport more widely accessible to small communities and regions with very low population densities. </p></speech>

It requires not only subvention of fares but the service has to be attractive in terms of its cost and linking origin-destination pairs so it is reliable and responsive to demand.  All of those aspects need to be fine-tuned to make public transport more attractive to the public but fares and the cost of the service is one of the levers we can use to try to stimulate broader use of public transport.</p></speech>

I was not here for it but I read it.  I will ask a number of questions.  One is on rail.  Professor Reynolds-Feighan has said that she does not consider rail transport to be commercially viable.</p><p>Is there anywhere across Europe or in the world where rail is commercially viable?  My understanding is that it must be greatly subvented, regardless of where it is.  Given the huge housing crisis at present, particularly in Dublin where there is a lack of supply, does the witness believe there is an opportunity, with greater public transport rail infrastructure, to start using commuter towns more successfully than we have in the past?</p><p> I note that the witness is very supportive of PSOs.  I agree.  There are many routes that will never be commercially viable and there will continue to be a need for State subvention to maintain a public transport service in many parts of the island.  What are her views on the tendering of bus routes?  How does she believe that will contribute to overall public transport into the future?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-19a.292" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Aisling Reynolds-Feighan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2016101900002#H00200"><p>Rail requires subvention in most European countries.  Mr. Quigley quoted from a study I conducted in 2000 which examined subvention rates.  One the reasons that subvention rates for Irish public transport are relatively low is the fact that it is predominantly road based public transport.  Rail and transit systems in other European cities require a larger level of subvention.  However, we must also bear in mind that these cities have much higher population densities in the rail corridors.  In terms of the investment required, there is very substantial investment in the rail track but also in the vehicles and signalling, while there is a single user, namely, the rail company.  With roads, however, a large number of users share the road space.  In terms of trying to provide for the population generally from an Irish perspective, this is why road based transport solutions are more attractive.  Other than in Dublin and perhaps Cork, it is hard to see a role for rail transport because of the dispersed nature of the population and the low densities generally.</p> <p>  With regard to the commuter towns, users will use public transport.  We conducted studies in UCD examining uptake and the responsiveness of people to public transport.  When reasonable alternatives are presented people use public transport.  It must be reasonable in matching the origin-destination pairs between which people have to travel.  If one looks at the provision of public transport, one of the problems is that it does not match people's needs.  One has to travel indirectly between the origin and destination so the generalised cost of travel by public transport, that is, the time and money costs of travelling between the origin and destination, is very high compared to private transport.  That is the reason the private transport share is so high.  That applies in the Dublin region as well as more generally in the country.</p> <p>  Regarding tendering for bus routes, will the Deputy remind me of his point?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-19a.293" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1250" speakername="Robert Troy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2016101900002#H00300"><p>I am seeking the witness's opinion on the decision to put 10% of the Dublin bus routes to tender.  Does she think it is a wise decision?  Does she think it will be beneficial for the long-term development of public transport in Dublin?  Will it offer a better service that is more competitive and will the end user, the passenger, benefit from it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-19a.294" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Aisling Reynolds-Feighan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2016101900002#H00400"><p>Public service obligations have been successful in a number of contexts both in filling a service requirement and also in introducing greater flexibility in terms of matching service needs.  It will also inject cost competitiveness and cost effectiveness into the provision of public transport services.  I would welcome this.  The National Transport Authority can work with communities in identifying service needs and tendering to fill those needs.  If they require subvention, and many of them do as they are not commercially viable without subsidy, we must be explicit in identifying the services that require subvention rather than having cross-subsidisation on the part of operators.  We therefore identify where there is a public service requirement and pay for it, if that is required.  I believe it will improve the provision of services, inject responsiveness and put a focus on costs and minimising the cost of provision of the service.  That is better for Ireland as a whole because if we can produce more cost effective services across the board it means we can spread the limited budget for transport further.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-19a.295" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1250" speakername="Robert Troy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2016101900002#H00500"><p>When I was travelling here this morning there was a car crash off the M4 on the M50.  The result of that was absolute gridlock.  While the witness says that we predominantly use our roads, those roads are at capacity.  There is also an issue with climate change in terms of CO2 emissions.  I accept the comment about rail and the fact that there is only one user.  However, if there is enough of the single user on the tracks, does the witness not believe it could make a huge impact in removing congestion from the roads, helping with our CO2 emissions and providing a fast, reliable and effective public transport service to the areas it might serve?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-19a.296" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Aisling Reynolds-Feighan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2016101900002#H00600"><p>As I said, rail has a role to play in high density corridors.  However, the densities are limited to the Dublin area and possibly Cork.  If one examines rail services more generally in the country, they require very substantial investments.  If the rail carriages are not full, their environmental footprint is very unattractive.  They are contributing to the carbon emissions and on a per passenger basis, because the ridership is low, that is quite substantial.  The argument for rail as an environmentally friendly mode of transport requires that the rail is heavily used, and that requires that it is deployed in high density corridors.  I believe there are very limited opportunities in an Irish context for deploying heavy rail services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-19a.297" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1333" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2016101900002#H00700"><p>I have a follow-up question.  The witness said that she is supportive of 10% of services going out to tender, that the NTA should engage with communities to identify where there is a service need and that she believed this would cut costs.  What is her opinion of, for example, the 10% going to private tender and the private contractor, after getting the contract, being able to amend the contract?  The contract that was initially given can be amended.  The private contractor can say, "We got the contract and this is the contract we have undertaken but we now find that it is not profitable for us to sustain the provision of services to villages X, Y and Z".  They can amend it, so one is back to square one.  They have the flexibility to amend the contract and cut the service.  That defeats the entire purpose.  What does she think about that?  At least if it is the public transport provider, it is compelled to provide that service.  When the private contractor is able to amend the service the real losers will be the public and the commuter.</p></speech>

One is about the 10%.  How sure is the witness that she is comparing like with like in respect of competitiveness?</p><p>I imagine with the reduction in the subvention that services have been pared back to the minimum.  That is part of the reason there were fare increases and so forth.  When one looks at back-up services, the quality of transport and wage rates, is it a fair comparison?</p><p> On rail, what is being counted in the comparison with the US cities?  Is it increased insurance and congestion costs?  I accept we are quite dispersed and there is a fair comparison.  Are these other elements, however, being counted which will carry costs such as climate obligations and increased insurance costs which have a knock-on effect on doing business and cost of living?</p></speech>

What about the practicalities of the rail services to Galway and Westport?  There is currently road gridlock in Galway city.  The road infrastructure on the western seaboard is not to the same high standard as it is in the east.  Is she saying there should be no further investment or that subvention be run down for rail services outside of the main urban centres?  There would be extreme riots if investment were reduced.  Everyone here agrees there needs to be increased investment in rail and bus services.  What works in theory and in practice, however, can be very different.</p></speech>

We have to be careful in how tenders are managed to ensure the service requirement identified is actually delivered by the service provider.  It is possible to revisit them if there are budgetary constraints or if ridership does not meet forecast levels.</p> <p>  The National Transport Authority and regulators across Europe are getting better at building up their expertise in deploying competitive tendering contracts and managing them.  There has also been recent work by the European Commission looking at the deployment of this kind of tendering contract in public transport in several countries to share and build up expertise to ensure it is deployed as a better instrument.</p> <p>  In an Irish context, we have been using public service obligations for several years.  We have used them successfully in air transport to fill service requirements.  An expertise has been built up in their deployment.  They can be effective in bringing about greater responsiveness and trying to contain costs.  That is important from a national perspective in trying to stretch a limited budget as far as possible for the benefit of the country.</p> <p>  I am not advocating we cease investing in rail services.  We have an extensive rail network in place which provides an alternative for road-based transport along key corridors.  However, we have to look at the best way to deploy our limited resources and invest in infrastructure and services.  We have to make choices which will deliver the best level of service from a national perspective.  There is limited scope for further expanding the rail network for the reasons I already outlined.</p> <p>  We need to look at the overall infrastructure budget.  As the economy has picked up, we need to invest significantly in our transport infrastructure, which is principally roads, to fill additional needs in the economy as it expands.  The planning framework, as well as the new spatial strategy, will have an important role in how we effectively link up all of the regions and deploy the best possible transport system.</p></speech>

For example, people are not prepared to walk more than 2 km on a regular commute.  That limits the extent to which walking as a strategy can be used.  The average distance people will cycle to work is 6 km to 8 km.  Again, it limits the scope to which cycling and cycle paths can be deployed as a mode of transport outside of urban areas.</p> <p>  Hub and spoke systems are about feeding passengers into the public transport services from small towns and locales.  This will build critical mass and increase the density to make the public transport service provision more viable.  One needs to increase frequency of service which effects a positive cycle and draws more people in.  Outside of urban areas, one is talking about motorised transport to link into the public transport corridor.</p></speech>

If they were in the shoes of the Minister of Finance, how would they square the circle to instantly increase the subvention to the level they feel is needed?   We all agree it needs to be increased but everybody wants everything to be restored.  How can a pathway be found in view of the fact that there needs to be an organised and structured way to do this in order that the country will not descend into chaos?</p></speech>

I also commend them on their instrumental contribution in returning the company to profit.  I hope the unions and the workers show the same solidarity with, and backing for, Bus &Eacute;ireann Expressway drivers who seem to be heading in the same direction.  This is our national bus service.  Dublin Bus workers had to stand on the picket line not knowing how long the strike would last.  I tabled a parliamentary question recently about the fees paid by the NTA for consultancy services.  The figures are shocking when one considers that workers had to go out on strike for basic salaries.  The NTA spent more than &euro;14 million on consultancy services over the past five years.  In 2015, it engaged 16 consultants.  I do not know whether those are consultancy firms or individual consultants.  It begs the question: is there no expertise within the authority?  Why was it set up if it has to spend so much of taxpayer's money on consultancy services and travel advisory services?  The most shocking figure related to last year.  The authority spent &euro;4.347 million on these 16 consultants, each of which received more than &euro;279,000, yet Dublin Bus workers were forced to go out on a picket line.</p> <p>  SIPTU mentioned the Government's smarter travel initiative and highlighted that, under action 12, the PSO subvention would be linked to growth in patronage.  Why has this not happened?  Action 14 stated a seven-days-a-week transport service would be provided for rural communities and those in smaller urban towns.  Why has the NTA failed to deliver on that?</p> <p>  The NBRU said that other transport workers would not stand idly by when the pay issue comes up down the road for Bus &Eacute;ireann workers.  Will Mr. O'Leary explain what he means by this?  Will he outline how that would play out practically, given that workers would be in dispute with their employer?  Would they experience the same solidarity, backing and determination?  Could he elaborate on the legislative changes he said were flagged up and inserted in the LRC settlement last year?  Bus &Eacute;ireann has vacated 200 towns and villages.  I mentioned earlier that this is bad enough because of the lack of subvention and cutbacks workers have had to endure.  I say to people if they think it is bad now, they should wait until privatisation kicks in when rural areas will not just be vacated but completely abandoned for profit only.  Mr. O'Leary was also critical of the NTA and its budget.  I hope he will be equally critical of the consultancy fees and the lack of expertise in the authority.  He also said the NTA is empire building and sees itself is a replica of Transport for London.  Could he also elaborate on that?  He said the French state is paid by the Irish taxpayer and he referred to the issue around Transdev.  I would like him to comment further on that.  He mentioned European rail companies tendering for state contracts in other jurisdictions.  What does that mean for us?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-19a.313" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1281" speakername="Mick Barry" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2016101900002#K00300"><p>My first question relates to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  Mr. Noone put before the committee information that is shocking.  It shows that the Irish Rail subvention has been cut from a little over &euro;180 million to &euro;98 million in seven years.  That is a cut of almost 50%.  Mr. O'Leary stated, "The safety of rail is second to none but in future years, we will only avoid catastrophe by blind luck because the State is not investing enough money to maintain rolling stock, vehicles, stations, depots and lines, never mind increasing services".  The chief executive officer of Irish Rail was before the committee two weeks ago and he gave his opinion on the issue of cutbacks and rail safety.  I am interested in the opinions of the NBRU and SIPTU representatives.  How close are we to cutting it fine on rail safety because of cutbacks?  How close is Irish Rail to having to shut down services and lines in order to keep the public safe rather than taking a chance?  I am interested in our guests' perspective on that.</p> <p>  On the issue of pension schemes for bus workers, Mr. O'Leary said the modest defined benefit pension of most bus workers at &euro;125 per week after 40 years service and contributing almost &euro;40,000 is under grave threat due to funding cuts and Government rules on bond allocation.  Could he provide more information on the character of that grave threat?</p> <p>  Mr. Noone referred to sectoral employment orders.  My understanding of the position is that in respect of what the NTA calls "franchising" - but what everybody else who has eyes in their head knows is privatisation - of the 10% of routes, he was given a so-called triple lock guarantee.</p><p>It comprised a registered employment agreement, a sectoral employment order and legislation.  I understand that triple lock guarantee is not yet in place.  Will the witnesses give us some information on the up-to-date position?</p><p> Mr. Taft suggested some projects this committee might consider.  I am not sure if he is in a position to take them all on board but we should consider the first two suggestions, namely, a detailed study of subventions to public transport and public bus services in other European cities compared with those in Dublin, Cork and one other Irish town or city, and the commissioning of a ridership survey, given that the current one is 43 years old.  I would like the committee to consider whether we might take action on one or both of those.</p><p> I am interested in Mr. O'Leary's comment that the CIE companies are fully compliant and stringently observe all aspects of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 and driving regulation.  Unfortunately some - not all - private operators infringe and ignore the rules, giving unfair competitive advantage and potentially putting lives at risk.  Will Mr. O'Leary give some more information on that?  I am cognisant of the fact that we are not getting into all the ins and outs of industrial relations problems at the moment.</p><p> Mr. O'Leary referred to a doomsday scenario that Bus &Eacute;ireann may attempt to impose unilateral changes to terms and conditions.  We have been hearing about this for a while.  The Minister was here two weeks ago and was not particularly interested in commenting on it.  Do we have any information on the detail of that?  This includes the hiving off of the Expressway service from other Bus &Eacute;ireann services and reduced terms and conditions.  I know there is no precise proposal on the table.  What might it be?  Would it be a 1%, 10% or 50% reduction?  Will the witnesses give us a general idea of the scale of the reduction?</p></speech>

They both refer to the lack of capital investment.  We can see it, especially because congestion is a significant issue.  The committee's initiative aims to chart a course for the future of transport and public transport in particular.  The three points about a detailed study are useful.  I asked the Oireachtas Library to do a study, which pretty much confirms what the witnesses say, that there is no comparator and if we are to have an evidence-based approach, we need one.  It is clear from the witnesses' study and the Library's study that we are on the tail end.  That is indisputable.  The level of subvention has been falling.</p> <p>  Only a few things can be done when the subvention is reduced.  One is to increase fares, which has happened.  That drives up the cost of going to work and so on.  There is a knock-on cost in terms of wage demands.  The second is to cut costs, which I suspect the public transport companies have done, or cut services.  The subvention is central to the provision of good quality public services.  The 1973 study was highlighted in the Oireachtas report which confirms the points the witnesses make.  It is central to engage the stakeholders.  They all have a very different experience from the dry academic perspective on what they are willing to pay in subvention.</p> <p>  I note the point in the SIPTU contribution about the conflicts between the regulatory and policy roles.  It refers to the flat refusal to take into account the cost of provision of labour.  If a competitive tendering decision is not being made on absolutely equal grounds, how can it be competitive?  Will the witnesses talk about that because it will be a key factor in whatever policy approach we recommend?</p> <p>  In my area a provider was licensed to provide a service in tandem with Dublin Bus.  There were different bus stops and locations.  When the bus broke down, there was no back-up bus.  The public could not figure out the services.  It would be useful to know about these matters in the context of this area of competitive tendering and how the public might use the services.</p></speech>

When the subvention to Dublin Bus was reduced, it managed to increase passenger numbers and revenue and profit.  It is to be complimented on that.  If, as expected and as the Minister has indicated, there will be an increase in subvention to Dublin Bus, do the witnesses feel that gives it an opportunity to increase capacity further and improve the service, thereby generating a greater turnover and profit?  It would then be a much more sustainable model.</p> <p>  I am amazed at how the National Transport Authority, NTA, sometimes inhibits Bus &Eacute;ireann from providing additional routes.  We contacted Bus &Eacute;ireann recently about a route from Mullingar to Maynooth for students going to college and it said it would be an eight month turnaround.  A private company took up the slack and is running two journeys from Mullingar to Maynooth every morning.  There does not seem to be a level playing field.  I would welcome the witnesses' thoughts on that.  When a licence is issued, what controls or sanctions does the NTA have for a private operator if it does not fulfil the terms and conditions of its licence?</p><p>An example, to be parochial again, would be a route from Mullingar to Dublin which initially serviced Kinnegad and Kilcock but after two or three weeks stopped servicing these towns and became a direct route from Mullingar to Dublin.  This would be most welcome for the passengers using it, and they would not complain because they would get from their original stop to their destination much faster and, perhaps, much more cheaply.  There is inequity in how this is being dealt with and I would welcome the opinion of the witnesses on this.</p><p> The lack of capital investment is a serious worry and is leading to huge congestion in the capital city in particular.  There needs to be capital investment not only in the capital city but throughout the country.  Currently, Dublin is gridlocked not only when people are arriving in the mornings and going home in the evenings but pretty much in any part of the day.  The witnesses have vast experience in public transport.  How would they prioritise the projects which would best help to deal with congestion, improve the efficiency and reliability of public transport and improve the experience of passengers with better times and a reduction in fares?</p><p> This brings me to my next point, which is the increase in fares.  There is no comparison between the level of subvention our public transport gets and that in other European countries.  The difference that has to be made up is being made up through public fares.  Public fares have been increasing over the past six or seven years, but passenger numbers have also been increasing.  Do the witnesses believe the fares prohibit people from using public transport?  Do they feel that if fares were reduced passenger numbers would increase significantly and would compensate for the reduction in fares?  Do they have any empirical evidence that could back this up?</p><p> I must attend another meeting so if I have to leave before they witnesses reply to my questions I will read the transcript or look at it online later.</p></speech>

Further to Deputy Barry raising the matter, what would such a survey entail?  How would it work?  What reference period would be required to get an accurate reading of usage?</p> <p>  Recently, I was approached by an older person who has a travel pass but is living in a rural area and never uses it because no public transport is available.  That person suggested to me there should be compensation of an equivalent average amount to pay for taxis or the provision of private transport.  Is there a subsidy or payment in respect of people who do not use public transport that would need to be factored in?</p></speech>

In its presentation, the NBRU stated that for years Bus &Eacute;ireann has cross-subsidised the underfunded PSO services with profits from its commercial Expressway service.  We are now learning and being advised the Expressway service is not profitable and it is reported that because of this it will be diminished.  Do the witnesses have proof that this has happened?  I have grave concerns that if the leaked proposals were to materialise we could see a situation where many of our towns and smaller communities would be bereft of public transport.  This is certainly something no one on the committee could stand over.</p></speech>

When there was no motorway network, which I will discuss in response to other questions, Bus &Eacute;ireann serviced all of the small towns and communities to which the Deputy referred and to which we referred in our presentation.  We found accounts for almost 11 years, and we found that old funds were used to subsidise PSO services.  New entrants to the transport arena, such as the National Transport Authority, of which I am very critical for obvious reasons from our perspective, choose to forget the past.  While we can leave the past behind us, the information it provides for us should never be forgotten.  We have evidence to support the view.<br/><br/>I will briefly run through some of Deputy Troy's questions.  With regard to a reduction in fares, fares have increased on average 8.2% in the past ten years, at least since 2010.  We have said very publicly that this fare increase, with the reduction in terms and conditions for our members and members of other trade unions across the three CIE companies, have plugged a gap effectively.  I will come back to Senator O'Mahony's questions on subvention.  Of course, without having empirical evidence in front of me, it is anecdotally well known that the more fares are reduced the more people will travel on public transport.  Listening to the questions and contributions from committee members, the problem in the Dublin area is completely opposite to that in rural areas.  There is congestion in Dublin and a lack of services in some parts of rural Ireland, but there is a connection, pardon the pun, between these two debates.<br/><br/>With regard to initiatives to get people away from the car and onto public transport, the very simple one is park and ride.  We know what London does with regard to congestion but London is a far different city of course.  The only initiative we have heard of in recent times is to stop buses travelling around College Green, which is lunacy in the extreme.  If we are going to discourage people from using their cars the last thing that should be done is to stop buses going to where the people want to go.  It is madness.  This morning, when I came across from my office, I saw the garda&iacute; pull in two private cars on College Green.  There would be no buses on College Green, never mind private cars, which would be lunacy in the extreme.<br/><br/>To answer Deputy Troy's question on the Expressway service, I have a lot to say about it.  Deputy Troy touched on some of it, as did other contributors.  The Expressway service is disappearing before our eyes.  Someone called it our national carrier.  This is what it is and what it always was.  The red setter was an iconic brand, but it is disappearing before our eyes.  While welcoming the opportunity the committee has given us to voice our concerns on behalf of our members and the communities they serve, we are very frustrated with regard to the Minister, and I am hopping over to Senator O'Mahony's questions.  The Minister was before the committee several weeks ago, and he mentioned stakeholders three or four times during his contribution.  Not once did he mention some the most vital of stakeholders, which are trade unions.  Perhaps some people in this room think trade unions are only about strikes and disputes.  This is not our remit.  A strike and dispute is a last resort.  Of course our interests start with the workers, because if there are no workers there is no industry and <i>vice versa</i>because they go hand in hand, but in terms of expertise in transport, there is none better than that of the people who work in the system.  It is not about them being paid exorbitant rates of pay, which they are not, by the way.<br/><br/>I am not sure about the other trade unions, but the Minister of the day has not met this trade union.  I have written to him on three occasions.  I gave him a brief in June, which forewarned him of the Bus &Eacute;ireann situation.  He came here and spoke about meeting Bus &Eacute;ireann on 12 September.  We briefed him on 10 June about the problems in Bus &Eacute;ireann, but he chose to ignore it.  I know he was busy off in Brazil doing other things and talking to stakeholders in other organisations, but he has not engaged with us.  This is important from my point of view.<br/><br/>If I have left out anything from Deputy Troy's questions I ask him to remind me.  I missed out the question on the NTA issuing licences and inhibiting Bus &Eacute;ireann.</p><p>That goes to the heart of the problem regarding Bus &Eacute;ireann.  If I am repeating myself, I apologise.</p><p> The motorway network is a recent phenomenon and I believe it was Professor Reynolds-Feighan who said that 2011 was the starting point of Bus &Eacute;ireann's problems.  Its accounts show that to be the case.  The degree of competition on routes from Dublin-Cork, Dublin-Limerick, Dublin-Galway and Dublin-Waterford, which are all on motorways, is oppressive.  I mentioned in my presentation the issue of seat capacity as opposed to market demand.  There is an excess of capacity on those routes.  That is a fact.  Deputy Troy gave the example of the Dublin-Maynooth route.  What has happened in the UK is similar to what will happen here.  I predict, without the benefit of a crystal ball but with the benefit of evidence in the UK, that what will happen here will be similar to what happened UK in areas outside London.  There will be a plethora - this is already the case - of private operators competing with the national State carrier, as we call Bus &Eacute;ireann.  We will end up with Bus &Eacute;ireann talking about not providing services on those routes, other operators no longer providing services on them and a monopoly, not a Bus &Eacute;ireann monopoly, or at best duopoly, and fares that are cheap now on a route from A to B, will go through the roof.  That has been the UK experience.</p><p> To answer Senator O'Mahony's questions, we would love to have level of a subvention of &euro;170 million for Dublin Bus, as mentioned by Professor Reynolds-Feighan.  All we want on the trade union side, and I presume Dublin Bus would want the same, is a return to levels approaching 2008, albeit on an incremental basis.  That would be very beneficial in the context of providing the services.  I am not here to speak on behalf of Dublin Bus but, for obvious reasons, we have a strong relationship with it because the members of our union work there.  It has an excellent service and in respect of the benchmarks and the quality performance Professor Reynolds-Feighan mentioned, Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann are hitting figures of 98% or 99% all the time.  The Senator also mentioned about the stakeholder.  If I am not covering all the Senator's questions, he can come back to me on them.</p><p> I thank Deputy Munster for her comments on the successful resolution of the unfortunate dispute at Dublin Bus.  As she is aware, all the trade unions were involved.  We hope to replicate the solidarity that was shown by the trade unions in Dublin Bus across the CIE group without the necessity, as I said earlier, of having a dispute.</p><p> Regarding a legislative measure introduced last year which the Deputy asked about, we had a joint trade union initiative on foot of a concern that the Irish legislation - not the European legislation - is flawed in that it would, if not changed, compel the NTA to award contracts to private companies or any entities that could adequately provide services, regardless of whether it was Dublin Bus.  The adequacy of the service was the only benchmark and the NTA could have been compelled, under pressure from a private company for example, by threat of court action or whatever may happen, to let Dublin Bus services out to those private operators.  That was a concern.  The settlement proposals from last year, which are mentioned in our submission, indicated that Government would examine the legislation.  The previous Minister, Deputy Donohoe, wrote to us and to all the unions last year and said that Fine Gael was in process of making changes if it got back into government.  I note from a newspaper article some weeks ago and from having had the benefit of talking to him that the current Minister, Deputy Ross, is supporting changes to that legislation.  As to whether that will be satisfactory to the trade unions, I suspect it will not but at least it will be better than what is in place now.</p><p> In our presentation we covered much of the NTA's spend in recent years.  While this debate is helpful, it would be far more prudent if all the stakeholders, including the Minister, could gather in a room like this and engage in an honest and open debate on the various issues affecting all of the people in the context of transport.  Those stakeholders would include the workers we represent, commuters, Members of the Legislature and other interested parties.  That is the type of debate that should be taking place.  However, the NTA had absorbed a great deal of money that would be better spent on front-line transport services.</p><p> The Deputy mentioned some of the consultancy fees.  We state that these relate to vanity projects.  We contend that the NTA replicates and duplicates much of the work CIE does.  The latter begs the question as to whether this a way of getting rid of CIE inch by inch or bit by bit?  That is a concern for us.  This year, a consultancy firm - I am not allowed to name it or I do not believe I am, but if I am, please allow me to do so-----</p></speech>

Said firm is at the top of the list in my presentation.  In saying that, I have not named it.  That type of money is being spent and it would be far better if it were spent on funding transport services.  If I neglected to respond to any of the Deputy's questions, she can indicate that to me.</p> <p> Deputy Barry asked about rail services.  The rail service is quite simple for us.  Even Professor Reynolds-Feighan, with all her knowledge, struggled to name a railway that is making money.  The only railways in the world that are making money, and this is mentioned in our presentation, are those run by state companies in Germany and France - I mentioned Transdev - that step outside their borders and tender on the premise that they are private companies tendering for state contracts.  That is the flaw in the relevant European legislation, Regulation (EC) No. 1371/2007.  The latter allows French companies to heavily subsidise their industry in at home and then tender for contracts here and be paid with Irish taxpayers' money.  Our rail network is underfunded.  I heard that the chief executive officer of Irish Rail appeared before the committee the other day and he gave a good outline of where the shortfall is.  The subvention has dropped by approximately &euro;98 million during the recession.  Line speeds will be reduced.  I do not want to overplay safety concerns or make it sound as if we are scaremongering around safety standards, but there is a fear with respect to the standard Irish Rail has obtained and maintained over the last decade and more in terms of it being accident free, and hopefully that statistic will remain the case, that instead of increasing line speeds, as Mr. Franks spoke about that day, that they will be reduced.  That is a concern.</p> <p>  Deputy Barry also mentioned the issue of pensions.  Again, as covered in our presentation, the amount of &euro;125 a week is a meagre pension after some of our members have spent &euro;40,000 of their money paying towards it.  We have been told that the pension schemes, of which there are two in the CIE group, are in trouble.  I will defer to the Chairman on this one as it is a matter that is before the Workplace Relations Commission.  I will not go into the detail of that but there are problems.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to Bus &Eacute;ireann being fully compliant.  This is also covered in my presentation.  There are two cases that we know of recently - this is on the public record and the court records - and there may be others.  One of those cases arose in Donegal and led to a company being fined by Mayo District Court for a breach of driving regulations.  In other words, the drivers were operating outside the regulated hours and this led to safety concerns.  Only this year, another coach company - I will not name it but this is a matter of public record - found itself in the same position.  It is grand to have regulations, of which we have plenty, but we do not have anybody policing them, apart from the NTA fining private coach companies in Tullamore recently at the National Ploughing Championships; I suppose they are now called the national tractors association.  We would have a concern that people who are supposed to police that side of our regulations are not doing so.  I believe I have covered most, if not all, of the members' questions and my colleagues can help me out in that respect.</p></speech>

Of course, phasing it in would be preferable.  Certainly Unite would not say - I do not know if anybody else would - that if we were to substantially increase a subvention up to European levels, that we would do it in the first year.  That would not be economically feasible for the Government in light of the constraints on resources and in terms of capacity.  When we are talking about rolling out services, there is no sense in a company getting a massive amount of money that it cannot use at present.  Phasing it in over four, five or six years, with a subvention of &euro;35 million a year, is not the issue; the issue is not the number of years over which it would be phased in but rather that it would be done, that a roadmap would be created and that the stakeholders would be involved.  Once that commitment is made, we can then debate how many years it will take in terms of maximising the impact.</p> <p> Deputy Troy asked a number of questions that merged into one on whether increasing capacity with services with an increased subvention would create more money and if that would mean it could be more profitable and more sustainable.  He also asked if passenger numbers would increase if we cut fares and if this would result in the company making more money.  He further inquired as to whether high fares are a disincentive.  To disentangle some of that, the first question is whether high fares are a disincentive.</p><p>High fares are possibly a disincentive but many people do not have a choice.  They may not have a car or it is not feasible to use a car, or it is too far to walk or cycle. In many senses, if fares are raised then a captive audience may be hit.  In many cases, it would be low and average-income earners that would be hit by high fares.  It probably does not create a disincentive in a large section of the community.</p><p> The issue is not whether a profit is made on one line or another because a profit will be made on some lines that are heavily used.  Other lines are not so heavily used.  Public transport, and certainly the rail and bus companies that have public service obligations, will never make a profit.  I know that Mr. O'Leary has said that some of the rail companies do make a profit.  However, that is not the same as what we are talking about here.  They go out and buy and I do not think we should be looking at just a balance-sheet approach.  Professor Reynolds-Feighan made the point that a wider economic analysis is needed of the impact of the investment and the provision for public transport.  I shall give two examples.  There have been a number of claims made by CIE, business groups, chambers of commerce, Deputies and Senators over the years regarding the cost to businesses of traffic congestion in Dublin.  I have never been able to identify the particular study - there are a couple of studies here and there - but they generally estimate the losses to be around &euro;500 million or &euro;600 million.  That was in 2007-2008.  It is costing the economy &euro;500 million or &euro;600 million in Dublin.  If one then increases the subsidy to actually start to tackle that along with a number of other things such as providing services, one needs to take into account the reduction in the cost to businesses of traffic congestion.  That is the wider economic analysis the professor is looking for.  If the fare is reduced by 25%, the money that the passenger saves does not get burned up - it is spent in other businesses.  In other words, the high levels of fare are actually depressing demand and, therefore, reducing cash turnover for businesses.  It is a business-friendly measure to increase subventions, reduce fares and expand service capacity.</p><p> With regard to the Chairman's question, I am sorry but I do not have experience designing surveys.  I will make two points.  Obviously, such a survey would have to be carried out over a period in order that it would not involve capturing a slack season, a summer season or whatever and that the data would be balanced out.  There are statistical patterns that can be used.  It is not just about carrying out a ridership survey to see how much CIE is owed or not owed.  We should be taking regular ridership surveys in respect of all forms of public transport and other transport - covering issues such as age, gender and whether a person is travelling for school, work, shopping or recreation - and using them as statistical tools to find out what is going on with public transport.  Deputy Barry spoke about London fares being substantially cut and how the system there actually made more money.  In  ridership surveys carried out in that city, it was discovered that the main beneficiaries of the measure in question were older people.  This was before older people had travel passes.  They became the main beneficiaries who were then able to visit relatives on the other side of the city.  They could engage and participate in the economy.  They were the major gainers and Ireland should be doing that but we should also be compiling surveys of people who do not use public transport to find out why.  It should not be just a big national survey or a big Dublin survey.  It should go to particular communities, such as those in Tallaght, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Bishopstown or elsewhere.  We could use these surveys, which are really important, to ask if not using public transport is a matter of cost, convenience or accessibility.  We should be using these tools to inform us so we would have an evidence based approach to creating public transport policy.  Do I have time to make another brief point?</p></speech>

The particular study that was commissioned relied on only one academic study on the impact in other countries and cities of franchising out the 10%.  Admittedly that OECD study involved a survey of literature so it relied on other studies.  However, some of the latter dated back to the 1990s.  For example, the Stockholm experience in the 1990s as to what happens when the 10% is franchised out shows a really positive result.  All the numbers - depending on what numbers one looks at - just start turning a lot.  Subsequent studies in Stockholm found that the situation was not so good because there are factors such as quality fade, lack of investment, regulatory capture and a number of other issues that mean the service fades over time and it is not as strong as the one given by the public transport provider.  There are many fixed costs when one looks at what is involved in providing Dublin Bus services.  For example, the cost of fuel is the same type of cost that a private provider would have to pay.  There is only one really big area in which public transport can become competitive - if that is the word we want to use - which is in the depressing of wages and working conditions.  I can provide this information because Unite refers to this and I can send on the information.  I know there is a triple-lock for those CIE workers who transfer over, but that is not for new members.  Just by the very mathematics, there would have to be a sweating of labour.  If it was just about saying that the private sector is more efficient than the public sector, then fine, make that debate.  Then, however, one must also say that everyone is to be treated the same with regard to wages and working conditions and make the competition about quality of service.  That will not happen because the only way cost can be driven down is through depressing of wages and working conditions.  At the time, Unite called on the National Transport Authority to do a shadow exercise - because Dublin Bus would be bidding also - to identify where exactly these savings are to be found.  If we talk about the wider economic analysis, economic vision and social equity, it is none of those things if people's wages and working conditions are driven down.  That is just a race to the bottom.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-19a.336" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Willie Noone" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2016101900002#O00800"><p>I know my colleagues have responded to some of the questions posed so I do not want to repeat what has already been said.  I will, however, deal with some of the specifics.</p> <p>  Deputy Barry asked about the triple-lock that was attained by the trade unions to try to protect our membership against the worst consequences of tendering.  The registered employment agreement has come into being only in the last few weeks.  The reason for that is we had to wait on the legislation to enable it and then there were a number of hurdles for the unions and the companies in getting the agreement up and running.  It is now in place.  No movement has been made with regard to the sectoral employment order and no movement has been made with regard to the legislation.  These are serious weaknesses.</p><p>That leads to what Deputy Catherine Murphy raised regarding conflict between the NTA and the trade unions regarding their roles.  I can give two examples of what that conflict involved.  The NTA has a specific role to regulate and manage transport, particularly in the bus market.  It believes, as we understand it, that conditions of employment are not its area of expertise or not its worry.  In the negotiations we raised the issue of pensions and pensions not coming under the legislation.  There is a conflict there because our role is a double-barrelled one.  We are trying to protect our membership, which is our first priority and we do not apologise for that, but we also have a role in trying to protect the consumer or the general public and ensuring there is a proper system in place for them.  The NTA did not consider pensions not transferring to be under its remit.  When it came to the question that was posed by it seeking to tender out work for periods of time, we were in discussions at that time regarding a number of people who were employed in one of the bus companies.  We said that these people are now permanent, they are going into a pension scheme and they will be paying into it long term.  The response we received was, "Why did these people not just get fixed term contracts, for these are the terms of the contracts of employment?".  That leads back to what my colleague said about driving conditions within the transport sector to the bottom.  That is why we believe the NTA may have a conflict regarding what it believes is a good transport system.</p><p> With regard to Deputy Munster's questions about Nos. 12 and 14, and I will not question the Deputy's reason for selecting those two points, the answer to both, like the answer to many of the action points we said were supposed to happen but did not happen, is simply that the subvention levels were cut.  As a result of that, the Government did not link PSO subvention to growth in patronage, did not introduce a seven day transport service for rural communities and so forth.  I might add with regard to linking the PSO subventions to growth in patronage, this trade union does not agree with that.  If one links PSO subvention to growth, it means that areas where there is no growth will get no increase in subvention.  That does not make sense.  Our learned colleague who had to absent herself has stated that in order to draw people into public transport, one must make it attractive.  Therefore, one must invest and put money in to attract people.  However, if one links patronage to the PSO, one will only drive the system downwards in the long term.</p><p> Senator O'Mahony asked about how to get the subvention levels back to what we believe are appropriate.  There are a number of ways to do it.  One can insert stages and do it incrementally.  One might have an issue about the timing of it and how long it will take to bring it back to what we believe is the optimum level, but the crucial element here is that one commits to that and delivers on it, albeit it might take a longer period of time than the unions might be seeking.  So be it.  One is committing to a service that everybody can buy into and there are no hidden surprises, no cliffs for people to fall off.  We who are looking after people in the transport sector are living from year to year.  One year we get a promise that there will be subvention, and then we do get subvention.  Senator O'Mahony and Deputy Troy asked whether transport provision would be improved if the level of subvention was increased.  Obviously it would.  If it is decreased, it will drive down public transport.  However, increasing subvention alone is not sufficient.  I remind the committee that Dublin Bus was given subvention last year, but what was given with the right hand was taken away with the left hand because subsequently &euro;2 million was taken back because it had made what was believed to be an unreasonable profit.  Increasing it on the one hand and taking it back on the other does not make sense to anybody.</p><p> With regard to the pension issue that is before the WRC at present, that is not subject to debate here.  The issue SIPTU wishes to raise regarding the pension is that circumstances should lead to an equal playing field, which is central to the debate we are having here.  Other operators who are tendering for public transport do not have a legal obligation to pay a pension.  That alone means there is no level playing field.  The other issue, as we included in our submission, is taking the cost of labour out of the tendering process.  Transport companies, by their nature, have high labour costs as a percentage of their overall operating costs.  If one allows contractors tendering for the right to provide services at the minimum rate of pay, which is currently &euro;9.25 per hour, it basically means that established transport employers such as Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann or other private companies in which we have members cannot compete.  They know that every three or five years a contract will be issued again and unless they are paying the minimum wage, they cannot get that contract, because everybody else will be tendering on the minimum wage.  This has not been addressed.  On numerous occasions we have sought a level playing field.  Taking out the cost of labour would at least level the playing field.  The trade unions have always stated publicly that we are not afraid of competition and never have been.  We do not buy into the ideology that competition is good in all circumstances but our members in Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus, Irish Rail and other bus companies have lived with competition all of their lives.  Even within the CIE group, Bus &Eacute;ireann buses are competing against rail services and other private companies.  There always has been competition.  All we have sought is a level playing field.</p><p> There have been allusions during this debate to practices that take place in the real world.  We have stated, and we are not shy about doing so, that one does not have to be an intensive investigator to find out what the practices are.  All people need to do is look at the contracts of employment of the people who are employed by the employers who are tendering for these projects.  The devil is in the detail.  When one reads in the contracts of employment that people will not get paid if there is no bus available, that means that when they go to work and there is a fault with a bus, they have no bus to drive and under the contract they go home and do not get paid.  It means the person is under pressure to drive the bus, because if they do not they will not get paid.  Matters such as these must be highlighted.</p><p> With regard to Deputy Barry's comments on Irish Rail, although there have been cuts in subvention to Irish Rail, it has always had, and continues to have, a very good record on safety.  The only issue I can raise regarding how near we are getting to standards slipping in that regard is that, while everybody in Irish Rail is committed to ensuring that standards remain as high as possible, in circumstances where the rolling stock and the infrastructure do not receive investment on a regular basis, it means that maintenance costs will increase continuously.  The danger of something failing obviously increases as well.  That is standard risk analysis.  There had been huge under-provision of subvention to Irish Rail for a number of years.</p><p>Prior to 2008, investment was made in rail.  While it was not sufficient at the time, it has since been acknowledged that it brought Irish Rail into the 21st century.  The stark figures presented in the submission demonstrate that the level of subvention has fallen off a cliff.  If this trend continues, at some stage, we will only have a proper rail service operating on the Cork and Dublin routes.</p><p> The Government appears to have bought into the theory that it wants to get bang for its buck.  When one is faced with a choice of investing in bus and rail services or the road network, it is difficult for rail to compete.  We must be cognisant that rail can never compete on the basis of getting bang for one's buck.  It competes on the basis that it is a more environmentally friendly option than roads.  If one keeps building roads, more cars will use them and congestion will build up again over time.  This is not the way to develop transport policy.  We must have an integrated policy in which rail, buses and other modes of transport have a place.  I believe I have answered the majority of questions.</p></speech>

I am merely seeking to answer the question I was asked.  A French company owned by the French Government is operating a light rail system in this country and it receives &euro;150 million for doing so under a five-year contract.  Taxpayers' money is being paid to a company owned by the French Government.  The contract will be up for renewal in 2019 and taxpayers' money will go towards the operating costs of that company.</p> <p>  Deputy Munster asked about the National Transport Authority guidelines.  The Act provides that the NTA take account of the demand or potential demand that exists for the public bus passenger services to which the application refers, having regard to the needs of the consumer and any existing public bus passenger service on or in the vicinity of the route to be served by the proposed public bus transport services.  I noted the excessive capacity that has arisen as a result of the NTA ignoring this aspect of its guidelines.</p> <p>  Senator Feighan, who has left the meeting, made a point to which I would like to briefly respond.  Mr. Noone also touched on the issue in his contribution.  The Senator asked how we know increased subvention will improve services.  What we know is that when subvention is reduced, services disimprove.</p> <p>  Senator Feighan also inquired whether transport supports business.  In his appearance before the committee some weeks ago, Mr. Ray Coyne, the CEO of Dublin Bus, stated that Dublin Bus was responsible for providing transport services to those who account for 39% of retail spend in Dublin.  I presume that figure can be extrapolated to other towns and villages.  It is clear, therefore, that transport supports business.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-19a.342" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1431" speakername="P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2016101900002#Q00500"><p>I apologise for my late arrival; I was delayed at another meeting.  I found the presentation and the witnesses' responses to questions very helpful because I have much to learn about this issue.  Public transport is critically important to the economy and society.  I strongly agree with Mr. Taft that we need to consider the wider impact of public transport, which is much more significant than pounds, shillings and pence.  If it is necessary to commission consultants, I would appreciate if they would consider all of the factors involved in public transport.  That point was very well made and I appreciate it.</p> <p>  In 2009 or 2010, an ESRI study found that people spend at least seven hours per week travelling to and from work.  This means that individuals spend more or less a full working day commuting.  Public transport can help significantly to improve the productivity of those who travel to and from work.</p> <p>  My company's income at macro-level is divided into two parts, namely, income from the public service obligation, PSO, and passenger income.  In terms of my company's expenditure, we have very high fixed costs and low variable costs.  The same issue was highlighted in respect of rail.  A certain number of staff must be available.  In that regard, I strongly agree that people should earn a living wage, which means they should be paid an income that allows them to survive and live.  On the other hand, competition is also important and we must ask how we can reinvent ourselves and compete in order that we can perform better.  In aviation, for example, the industry in which I am involved, the entry into the United Kingdom market of Ryanair, a company which is not my greatest friend, resulted in significant price depletion.  One must be careful not to go too far in this regard because, as Mr. Taft noted, a monopolistic scenario can arise.  Nevertheless, Ryanair had a very positive effect on Irish consumers and public transport.</p> <p>  It is vital for private operators and the transport trade unions and their members that a level playing field is in place.  The procurement process needs to be revisited.  Mr. O'Leary made a good point on a French company entering the market.  This trend is not confined to transport and it extends to other sectors.  The reason for this is that Ireland is not operating on a level playing field.  We must review the way in which we deal with procurement.</p> <p>  I was a little bothered by the point the witnesses made about looking at contracts of employment for drivers who work for private companies.  It is not fair to make a general assumption on this issue.  From what I have seen, these contracts of employment are generally very competitive.  While there may be exceptions, for example, one could point the finger at a tractor at the National Ploughing Championships, we would be better off moving from minor matters and looking at the big picture.  I strongly believe public transport has a very important role to play in future.</p></speech>

Ryanair and Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh's company competed for PSO contracts at certain airports over the years, including Farranfore.</p> <p>  To respond to Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh's point on contracts of employment, trade unions are at one on this issue.  I will not refer to any company by name because I am not allowed to do so.  On the wages paid in the commercial Expressway market, one bad operator in this market is primarily, albeit not completely, responsible for Bus &Eacute;ireann's problems.  I refer to only one company, even though five companies are operating in some of the Expressway corridors, including Bus &Eacute;ireann.  One rogue operator can seriously damage another company.  Some entity involved in the regulation of employment, including driving hours, must sit on these types of companies and root out this type of behaviour.</p> <p>  As we pointed out, we are not afraid of competition.  What we want is a level playing pitch.  We want to be told that the meagre pension paid to CIE employees and all the conditions available to our members will also apply across the private sector.  We would then have a level playing pitch.  In such circumstances, we should let the best man win, so to speak.  We would organise in these companies in any event.  Contrary to popular belief, the trade unions do not regard competition as an evil.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses and members for their contributions.  While the forum has been designed to facilitate the most open discussion possible, I regret that we cannot delve into certain areas for various reasons.  I appreciate the witnesses taking time to attend.  The joint committee will do further work on the information they have provided.</p></speech>
