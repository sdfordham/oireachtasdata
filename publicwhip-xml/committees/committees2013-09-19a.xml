It is to be noted.  While this is primarily a matter for the local authority, funding was provided by the Office of Public Works, OPW, to alleviate flooding and it appears from Mr. Mitchell that this funding was wasted because the problem has not been solved.  As public moneys are involved here, the OPW should be satisfied that the co-funding it provided in this case was used to solve the problem.  If it did not, as appears to be the case, it should get answers from the council on what it intends to do.  We will also ask the reply to the OPW&rsquo;s request to be sent to the committee.</p><p>  No. 3C.1, correspondence received 16 September 2013 from Mr Barry O&rsquo;Leary, chief executive officer, IDA Ireland, on briefing paper on matters to be considered at today&rsquo;s meeting.

We have had hearings in respect of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority and must schedule Paul Moloney and Professor Niamh Brennan to come before us.  The clerk is arranging dates to suit those people.  Mr. Moloney lives abroad but Professor Brennan has indicated she will come forward, so as soon as we have dates we can schedule them in our work programme.  We are finalising the bank stabilisation report.  We agreed to hear from NAMA first and then we will complete that report.  It will be circulated to members in the next few weeks and we can then launch the report when it is completed.

That was published before the break and we will resume that matter on 10 October.

Before we begin, I remind members, witnesses and those in the public gallery to turn off their mobile phones.  Interference from mobile phones affects the sound quality and transmission of the meeting.  I advise witnesses that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House, a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 163 to the effect that they should also refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits or objectives of such policies.  I welcome Mr. Barry O'Leary, chief executive officer of IDA Ireland, and ask him to introduce his officials.</p></speech>

Foreign direct investment plays a more important role in this economy than in any other European Union country.  We have a portfolio of approximately 1,050 companies that we have attracted to Ireland over the years.  They have a strong impact, with direct and indirect employment of 270,000 people and exports of &euro;122 billion in goods and services.  That accounts for more than 80% of all exports.  They spend approximately &euro;19 billion in the economy, of which &euro;7.3 billion is by way of payroll.  They are also the largest payers of corporation tax, with almost 70% of all corporation tax, as well as almost 70% of business expenditure on research and development, coming from multinationals.</p><p>  IDA Ireland is global by nature.  We have to travel the world to identify companies and convince them to come to Ireland.  The primary market, or the one that is most productive in terms of foreign direct investment, is the United States where we have six offices.  We have three offices in Europe but in the so-called emerging markets such as China, India and Brazil we have expanded in the last six years from two offices to 11 across a variety of countries and locations.  As part of our strategy, we aim for an exceptionally high market share in the sectors on which we concentrate.  In other words, if we are going after a sector, we want to be sure we have the environment that would attract the leading companies.  Areas of particular strength in Ireland include information technology with names with which members will be familiar such as IBM, HP, Microsoft, Intel and EMC.  In the pharmaceutical sector we have nine of the top ten companies in the world, with multiple locations in Ireland.  These include Pfizer, Merck and Novartis.  In respect of medical devices, we have 17 of the top 25 global players, including Abbot, Covidien and Johnston and Johnson.  In the international financial services sector we have 50% of the leading institutions.  Citibank, BNY Mellon and State Street are the key players in this regard.  In the somewhat newer area of digital and social media we have the top ten companies, including Google, eBay and PayPal.  We target development and manufacturing, research and development and global service in these sectors.</p><p>  In 2012 the multinationals created 12,772 new jobs which resulted in 6,570 net jobs in IDA Ireland's portfolio.  It was the largest increase in net job numbers in more than a decade, as well as the lowest number of job losses.  Our key wins in 2012 included Allergan which will employ 200 people and invest &euro;250 million in its facility in Westport; eBay; PayPal which will employ 1,400 people in Dundalk; Nypro's creation of 200 jobs in Waterford; Fidelity's 200 jobs in Galway and Dublin; SAP in Dublin and Galway; Northern Trust which will employ 400 people in Limerick; Abbot in Sligo; Eli Lily in Cork; and Cisco in Galway.</p><p>  In the past two and a half years we have been targeting a sector in which we were previously not very active, namely, the emerging companies concentrated in the New York area and Silicon Valley in San Francisco.  These are young companies which have gone through one round or two rounds of venture capital funding and are the future Googles or Facebooks.  Since we started that programme we have attracted 55 of these companies.  We are active with the large multinationals, mid-size companies and, increasingly, high growth companies in the technology sector.</p><p>  We have observed increasing competition in the last year or two not only from emerging economies but also some of the most established economies in the world.  The United Kingdom and the Netherlands have made significant changes to their offerings and places such as Luxembourg, Singapore, Switzerland and the eastern states of the United States have also come up with attractive packages that include corporate tax offerings.</p><p>  A large proportion of IDA Ireland's budget is spent on what we describe as the transformation of the existing client base.  We want to make sure the world leaders we have attracted to Ireland continue to invest and transform here.  We offer a wide range of supports, including support for technology uplift, skills uplift, process improvements, research and development and energy efficiency in order to drive efficiency and place these corporations higher in their corporate world and attract new investment to Ireland.  It is fair to say Ireland's value proposition - in other words, what makes Ireland attractive to multinationals - is constantly being enhanced.  There is a constant task in maintaining the most important elements such as the talent base, our strong track record in attracting companies and getting them to reinvest in Ireland, the corporation tax offering and our technology capabilities.  Other areas are also important.  If, for example, we are trying to attract a pharmaceutical investment that could amount to &euro;250 million to &euro;500 million, we must be able to locate sites of 50 to 100 acres with access to 2 million gallons of water and 10 MW of power.</p><p>  I thank my colleagues in IDA Ireland for their enormous commitment, dedication and flexibility in working long hours to secure foreign direct investment for Ireland.  I have often referred to the importance of team Ireland in winning foreign direct investment.  We have worked closely with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and other Ministers in a wide range of Departments and State agencies to achieve substantial FDI benefits for Ireland.</p><p>  This meeting is reviewing our accounts for 2012, but in regard to our outlook, the strong flow of foreign direct investment has continued in 2013.  A number of leading companies have announced investments in new activities or the expansion of existing operations.  However, we face a challenge in that the majority of the foreign direct investment we attract to Ireland is focused on supplying markets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  These markets remain flat, but we are hopeful the European market will improve.  Our efforts are firmly focused on generating a pipeline and converting it.  At any one time we need in excess of 100 investments in play around the world, for which other countries will, of course, be competing.</p></speech>

There is no doubt about the IDA's success in bringing multinational companies into Ireland over a period of years.  It is one of the stars of the semi-State firmament and I congratulate the witnesses on that.  Ireland is proud of what they have done and the extraordinarily large household names they have brought in, and we have prospered thanks to it.  We are not here today to examine that.  Mr. O'Leary said these huge multinationals which have come in and give great employment and spin-off benefits pay &euro;1.9 billion in corporation tax and account for 70% of corporation tax.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Are they so large that they can, if not necessarily gain sweetheart deals, use the international rules to their benefit and use Ireland as a conduit for funds and as a tax reduction mechanism?  Mr. O'Leary would be aware more than anybody of the EU probe which came up in the Financial Times, the US Congress report and the audit of multinational companies which was publicised by <i>The Irish Times</i> and other newspapers in August.  Particularly the companies the IDA brought in are coming under increasing focus.  While they are very good for Ireland, people are asking whether they are pushing us around and exploiting the situation here to an unacceptable extent.  What is Mr. O'Leary's reaction to the fact that three bodies are putting us under scrutiny and are, therefore, presumably destabilising the image of Ireland and its tax regime in America and suggesting that things may have to change which will make Ireland less attractive?</p></speech>

On the question whether they pay enough, we must examine what happens around the globe.  They are paying a substantial amount of corporation tax, &euro;2.7 billion, which equates to &euro;19,000 per year per employee in the multinational base.  That is a high burden.  In the EU, countries get approximately 2.4% of their GDP by way of corporation tax.  Ireland gets 2.6%, so it is higher than average, and the UK gets nearly 3%.  Countries compete for investment in a variety of areas.  Some countries put massive amounts of money into research and development, including some of the most developed economies in the world such as Switzerland, Singapore and the Netherlands.  Multinational companies deciding where to locate examine the transparency of the 12.5%.  Everybody is entitled to it in Ireland.  If one goes into cantons in Switzerland one could negotiate a rate of 3.2% or 1.8%, so it is discriminatory and that is getting even more focus than the Irish standard rate.  A lot of tax is being paid by international comparison.  We would like to get more and some global changes will arise from the current debate, but they will take quite some time because of the complexity of the global footprint of tax arrangements.</p></speech>

When the Apple situation broke in the US Congress, the chief executive made a statement that it had a special corporate tax rate deal with Ireland of 2%.

There was no sweetheart deal for Apple.  That is clear.  It was a mistake.  That comment should never have been made and it was retracted.  The average annual salary in a multinational company is &euro;43,000 compared to &euro;36,000 in an Irish-owned company.  On top of that, the multinationals pay another &euro;19,000 per employee in corporation tax, so they pay a fair bit of tax.</p></speech>

The the tax system is simple.  If tax was the only criterion used to judge an investment, nobody would come near Ireland but would go to Singapore and Switzerland.  One can see the success they have had.  Singapore will give companies 0% for ten to 15 years.  Switzerland will probably give them 2% or 3%.  The Netherlands talks in its published material about achieving a 5% effective rate for the pharmaceutical industry.  In our mind they are discriminatory because one company can get it and another company cannot, whereas the Irish 12.5% is available to everybody.  We have research and development tax credits that will reduce the effective tax rate but that is an important part of attracting research and development into Ireland.</p></speech>

The biggest support from a research and development point of view goes into the existing client base because it is important to help the transformation of the activities they are doing; in other words, moving them continuously to more sophisticated activities.  For instance, in the medical devices or pharmaceutical area, we have put a lot of support into the development function because if Ireland gets the development function, it will get the manufacturing function as well.  That is a productive return to have development and manufacturing co-located on the one site rather than having manufacturing here and research and development in Connecticut or wherever.</p></speech>

There is a lot of money involved in supporting research and development but an awful lot of benefit is got by the country by supporting it as well.  Revenue and the IDA operate to specific guidelines on what constitutes research and development and we have technical assessors to look at and verify that.  There have been reports about Revenue disallowing certain aspects of it but I am not aware that this is a big number in the overall research and development scheme.  Some of the research and development inspections are carried out retrospectively a few years after the credit is claimed but I have not seen it as a large problem.  If 300 companies are involved, a number will be asked for clarification or checked to see whether they fit the guidelines set out in the research and development area.</p></speech>

Is there not a danger that there is room for abuse?  There are accusations of abuse.  If changes are made, it could affect multinational investment in this country because they regard Ireland as a good - it is sometimes referred to in rather pejorative terms - conduit state where they can put the money in, transfer it out and do a few little dodges like transfer pricing which obviously affects their global profits.

If one has huge substance, it naturally gives one an advantage on transfer pricing.  Ireland, going back a number of years, did not really have transfer pricing legislation.  It was introduced a few years ago and is in operation now.  If there are changes in transfer pricing, it depends because we do not know what the new world of global taxation is going to be, but the generation of intellectual property and its commercialisation and investment in bricks and mortar around it are going to be key elements of a competitive global tax offering.  That will determine how transfer pricing works and the new rule.  In other words, if one has a lot of the generation of the IP, the assets and the commercialisation, Ireland could benefit from the new changes around the world.</p></speech>

The big land banks would be the strategic sites.  Merck in Carlow bought our 65 acre strategic site because it could immediately provide the infrastructure for a vaccines facility.  It bought that site maybe four years ago.  Today it has nearly 500 people on site.  One could say the same about Coca-Cola in Wexford.  Of course, we get professional valuers every six months to value in line with market conditions.  Therefore, it is pretty much the case that we are marked to market effectively.  We do not value properties; it is actually done by property valuers.</p></speech>

That was an interesting exchange with Deputy Shane Ross, beginning by outlining his view that it was undeniable that IDA Ireland had been and was very successful and then questioning the reasons for that being the case.  I did not know what to make of it.</p><p>  As someone who worked on the issue of the US Senate finance committee dealing with trade, I am not too bothered about the angst of the members of the US Senate finance committee.  I believe I know the motivation behind those hearings, which comes down to a competitive world in attracting companies to one location as opposed to another.  I think we know that and have been very good at it.  We annoy countries by being so successful in attracting so many companies into Ireland in the past 25 years.  The reason the Netherlands, Singapore and the United Kingdom are changing their tax regimes is that ours has proved to be so successful.  Waffling on about conduits and transfer pricing, etc. is na&iuml;ve when everybody here understands why Ireland has become such an attractive location for such companies, particularly those from the United States.  To pretend otherwise is disingenuous.</p><p>  My concern - I have spoken to Mr. O'Leary about this over the years - is the level of our attractiveness now and how we can make ourselves more attractive considering what the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and others are doing.  It is becoming more of a danger as far as our attractiveness is concerned.  The number of companies that can be attracted to particular locations is tightening.  There is a global downturn.  Considering what other countries are doing with regard to the patent box and lowering their corporation tax rates, how can we become more attractive for inward investment?</p></speech>

He needs to drive on and find other reasons companies locate here.  To consider anything otherwise is naive and, frankly, disingenuous because the public understands the reasons companies locate and remain here.</p><p>  With regard to our technical capability, Mr. O'Leary mentioned Google and other technology companies which are more likely to locate in Ireland now than they were in the past.  Do we have the type of capability required?  Are there any issues with regard to engineering skills or technical expertise?  Are there policy issues?  Are there issues for us as a Parliament which we need to consider?</p></speech>

We have Internet, technology and medical devices businesses and different skill sets are required for different sectors.  There is no doubt with regard to engineering skills in particular.  There is a global shortage of engineering skills and those countries which produce more engineering talent or create the environment where they can bring in talent will win a disproportionately strong part of foreign direct investment.  It is a key area.</p></speech>

The meeting with the Prime Minister was interesting.  He was very clear about where he felt his assets lay with regard to attracting industry.  He underlined technical ability in the young workforce as a huge asset.  It is a very cheap labour source compared to ours and there are very low utility costs.  Where are our danger areas?  Where are we weak and potentially vulnerable with regard to being competitive and attracting industries from abroad?  Are there issues of which we need to be aware outside of tax issues?  There is nothing we can do about the UK lowering its corporate tax rate to 20%.  Where are the areas we need to identify and give more attention?</p></speech>

It is a huge driver of location decision.  Ireland has been very good in general at producing the talent base and we have been pretty good at bringing in talent where we need to do so.  Part of any modern economy today is a mixture of staff from within the country and also people who have been brought in.  It is an important part of the model.  Of course there are needs, and the more thousands of engineers we have the more thousands of jobs we will be able to create.  It is one area where investment needs to continue.  The talent is the most important issue.</p></speech>

New and existing initiatives in Ireland and the European Union, and visas beyond this, are part of the model.</p></speech>

He needs to be careful with regard to how he expresses where we are because it is a competitive environment and I understand this.  I will change my questioning and discuss the regional aid guidelines or incentives.  Approximately nine months ago Mr. O'Leary made a comment which was picked up by a number of people including me.  He stated the incentives were not working and that when it came to areas outside of Dublin and Cork the incentives in place based on unemployment figures were not attracting companies to those locations which received the least amount of foreign direct investment.  The map has been redrawn and there is an extension of six months which, as I understand it, will allow a transition phase while the old incentives continue.  What type of input did the IDA have with the Department and the Commission when it came to redrawing the map for these incentives?</p></speech>

In addition there is a small increase of a couple of percentage points which will allow some new areas to be brought into the regional aid guidelines.  The current footprint will work until the end of June next year and it will be up to the Department and the Government to come up with the new map.

A company locating in Dublin or Cork does not receive the traditional type of grant aid.

It is expected that I will take a bash at the IDA - I will not do that - regarding the reason there is not more foreign direct investment, FDI, into my region.  In the Horizon 2020 document, the IDA expressed the view that 50% of FDI should be outside of Dublin and Cork, the areas that have received most of it.  How will the IDA achieve that target?  A tweaking of the regional aid guidelines will not move companies.  They may only consider it as part of the overall picture.  Some people might doubt that 50% is achievable and simply view it as a governmental document intended to appease the likes of me - that is, people who are quite cynical about expressions of future success and aspirational comments from the Government.  The track record has not been great.</p><p>  I know the constraints on the IDA.  It cannot make up CEOs' minds.  However, it inserted the figure into the Horizon 2020 document.  How will it achieve the target?</p></speech>

We have achieved many of the metrics, including FDI in its total volume for Ireland as a whole, but we are not getting enough regionally and will not do so.  We inserted the figure to drive the ambition to get as much as possible.  The Deputy is correct in that the CEOs make the decisions for their companies.  We can incentivise companies to use a certain location.</p><p>  Dublin, Cork and Galway have received a substantial portion of FDI, but real progress is being made in some regions.  For example, Dundalk and Drogheda in the north east have seen a great deal of investment.  There has been a fair bit of investment in Limerick.  There has not been the same level of investment in Waterford, but the south east - the Waterford-Wexford-Clonmel area - enjoys a healthy pipeline of investments.  There will be a few more in that area in the coming months.  If one tracked planning permission applications in the region, one would be able to find information in that context.</p></speech>

While we may achieve that, the projects are small in scale.  We have put a great deal of effort into trying to win business from those countries.  Practically every country in the world is in those markets and we have a relatively small presence.  We are continuing to invest in their development, but that will take more time.</p><p>  I referred to emerging companies in New York, Silicon Valley and San Francisco.  We enjoyed an almost immediate payback on that initiative.  There was an immediate payback from the transformation agenda.  However, we are not getting an immediate payback of scale from the growth markets.  Strategically, though, we must be in them in the medium to long term.</p></speech>

I do not expect the CEO of the IDA to second-guess the reasons for Ireland's and the IDA's success in attracting industry, particularly from America.  Rather, I expect the CEO to do everything with the people who change the laws in this country to ensure that we are more competitive, notwithstanding Deputy Ross' comments.  If our tax code must be tweaked to make Ireland more attractive to companies, regardless of whether doing so engenders more criticism from members of the US Senate's finance committee, a place of which I have some experience, I would feel better, not worse.  Mr. O'Leary's role is to make us more competitive within the rules and guidelines.  I do not expect him to second-guess the fundamental reasons for the IDA's success.</p></speech>

Has the IDA carried out work to compare the margin between our effective and actual rates with the margins of our competitors?  Ireland offers transparency.  In other countries, the margins are significant.</p><p>  How has the ending of patents affected the pharmaceutical sector?

The standard rate is 12.5%.  One can get write-offs in the form of capital allowances and research, development tax credits and a few other items.  In France, the standard rate is more than 30%, yet companies can have an effective rate of as low as 6%.

There is not the slightest doubt about this.  In comparison with the situation a number of years ago, corporate America now has a positive view of Ireland.</p><p>  The Deputy's second question was on the pharmaceutical industry and the patent cliff.  Patents have been running out.  They are subject to generic competition from generic manufacturers.  Sufficient new products have not been coming on stream.  However, that is changing.  In other words, the bottom has been reached.  If one looks at the pipeline of products, one will see that there is significant change taking place in that while the traditional white powder and tablets sector, the small molecule area, is declining somewhat, the areas of biopharmaceuticals is growing significantly.  Notwithstanding some of the fall-outs we have had, during the past 18 months, since the beginning of 2012, we have secured approximately eight or nine investments in the biopharma area, with more to come.  It is an issue of timing.  These biopharmaceuticals are exceptionally expensive.  The cost of treatment per year ranges from between &euro;3,000 per person to &euro;120,000.  This will feed into the exports area.  Amgen is investing &euro;200 million in its biopharmaceuticals facility on Pottery Road in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, while Lilly is investing &euro;400 million at its facility in Cork.  In Westport Allergan is investing &euro;250 million and will shortly have 500 construction workers on site.  At the same time as we are getting the old going, new investments are coming in.</p></speech>

The general view locally is that the building which was formerly occupied by the manufacturing section of Dell will provide a psychological boost for the area given the number of jobs lost there previously.  Dell has continued its operations in Limerick and is a fantastic employer in employing more than 1,000 people.  It is welcome that Regeneron has made that public disclosure.  In terms of the project advancing, what is its current status and how does Mr. O'Leary, in terms of the timeframe, see it evolving?  Regeneron is a hi-tech drug manufacturing company which will be very welcome in Limerick.  I compliment the company on its work to date.  Perhaps Mr. O'Leary, given that what I have disclosed is in the public domain, might elaborate on the current status of the project?  I have read the company's SEC filing and I am conscious of the commercial sensitivities involved.  However, this is a welcome announcement for the people of Limerick.

As part of its SEC filing, Regeneron issued a statement confirming it was at an advanced stage of negotiations on the acquisition of a building.

Its initial statement was made in the past couple of weeks.  Regeneron is one of a number of next wave biopharma companies and would be a very attractive win.

This project is of enormous significance for Limerick.  As a representative for the area, I would like to assist in any way possible in ensuring it comes to fruition.  I compliment IDA Ireland on its work in Limerick in the past two years which has resulted in more than 1,000 additional jobs in the area.

There is a good stock of buildings but not all of it is immediately useable because it is of a different era.  In other words, the required square footage may be available, but it is not suitable for the technology sector.  We continue to have discussions with NAMA in that context on a national level.  In certain areas there are particular problems which require the system to move in terms of construction.  For example, in terms of the construction of a building of 100,000 sq. ft. in, say, the docklands, design, construction and fit-out would take some time.  We are confident, however, that we will continue to bring in significant foreign direct investment, but we need available space.  It is a work in progress.</p></speech>

Now we have the proof of the three large projects that will hit the news in the not-too-distant future.  That will provide one more piece of ammunition in bringing on that agenda, as people will see some leading corporates take some very significant space.  That is at the big end of the issue but there is a fair demand on space in the 10,000 sq. ft. to 30,000 sq. ft. sector, and there is an active dialogue with NAMA.

We always have a debate about corporation tax being paid by companies and one might think sometimes that companies only exist to pay taxes and serve no other purpose.  I find such an idea frustrating, particularly when we consider how foreign companies are here paying corporation tax and employing thousands of people, who are salaried, pay taxes and spend money in the economy.  The companies also invest much time and money in helping to build ecosystems and infrastructures in certain areas, such as gaming and the technology sector.  Big companies like Google and Facebook also get involved in the local communities through the likes of the silver surfer project and other digital inclusion work.  It is important to say this every time we raise this matter, as the witness did in the opening address and initial exchange.

While America is very important now, in the context of a medium to long-term strategy, we must focus on getting into those countries and competing as best we can.  If we can be a gateway to Europe for America, there is no reason we cannot be a gateway for China, for example.  However, engaging with those countries is resource-intensive because they are all very large and are complex in ways that we are only beginning to understand.  In terms of the current plan for resources, are we going to see more of a shift of people out of the USA and into places like China or Brazil?</p></speech>

We have taken staff from other areas in the organisation.  We have slimmed down some of our regional presence in Ireland on the basis that it is much better to have people out in the market generating leads rather than waiting for site visits here.  On a global scale, our competitors put far more into countries such as China and India than we do.  They put enormous resources into those markets.</p></speech>

These are areas that we strongly believe in but right now we do not actually have additional resources.  For instance, the emerging business area that we spoke about is the most obvious and the one where we get the quickest return on investment.  There are others such areas, including the transformation agenda with the big clients we have here to make sure they re-invest.  If one looks at the corporate level, with some of the big companies we might have to talk to 30 people at any given time.  There is a constant battle to win reinvestment.  Competition for foreign direct investment is intense and has become even more so since the European market, in particular, has flattened out.  More companies are turning to FDI for whatever growth there is.</p></speech>

Ultimately, though, when we are dealing with the senior executives, we have subject matter experts who can talk to companies.  They can talk the talk, which is very important.  If it is a company in the technology sector, for example, we use experts in that field who can hold their own with anybody in the world.  The same applies in the pharmaceutical sector.  Having a representation role is helpful for certain things but at the end of the day, it is dealing with the C-level executives - either CEOs, CIOs or CTOs - which is important.</p></speech>

We have a dinner coming up in the Irish Embassy in London in the first week of October, for example.  We are using the Embassy as a draw to try to attract 25 to 30 clients, with a mixture of existing and potential clients, particularly some whom we have found it difficult to access.  We will do that, but it is not the main stream.  We might organise one or two such dinners per year.</p></speech>

There are a lot of successful Irish companies that are making connections with people all over the world.  The Dublin Web Summit is one example.  It brings a lot of people in and does a really good job of selling Dublin and Ireland a good places to locate and invest in.  What is the IDA's relationship with such companies, and is there a sharing of resources?</p></speech>

We work very closely with Paddy Cosgrave and his team.  It is great how he assembles so many entrepreneurs.  We will have a number of people involved.  Members of our team from around the world who deal with emerging companies are going to come back to Ireland for that event.  We believe it is a great initiative.</p></speech>

I will begin with a number of general questions.  Approximately 152,000 people are employed in IDA-backed companies located in Ireland.  Does Mr. O'Leary have a comparative figure for the numbers employed outside Ireland by Irish companies?  What is the relative balance between the two?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-19a.222" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barry O'Leary" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013091900013#M01900"><p>My understanding is that the figure is approximately 100,000 for Irish companies abroad.  However, one must be careful in terms of comparing like with like.  The business we are in involves companies coming to Ireland to engage in international activities.  A lot of the Irish investment in the United States, for instance, is different.  If one takes Cement Roadstone as an example, it employs 20,000 to 30,000 in the USA, but it is supplying cement to the US market and therefore it has to be located in the country.  Such companies are not necessarily bringing the same degree of additionality in the economy.  There is not much difference between the Mexican cement company and the Irish one, in that sense.  Therefore, one is not comparing like with like.</p></speech>

In the same way, Aldi or Lidl are coming in here to supply the market.  I must be careful in what I say, but there is a finite market there.  Our view is that such a market can be served by Dunnes, Superquinn, SuperValu or Aldi, and it is not of concern to us.</p></speech>

When they look at companies like CEMEX, an international Mexican cement company, they assume that it and other foreign companies are here because of the IDA, but Mr. O'Leary is saying that is not the case.  Does he have any idea how many people are employed in foreign companies operating in Ireland that are not IDA clients?</p></speech>

The figure is quite substantial and could be in the order of 70,000 to 80,000.  Tesco, for example, is a multinational company employing 15,000 people here.  Ulster Bank also employs significant numbers of people.  While such companies are not clients, that is not to say we do not interact with them, but our interaction is in the context of targeting international activities - in other words, things such as making Ireland the base for their international supply chain management, their IT systems, shared services and so forth.    It is not that we do not deal with such companies; rather, we do not deal with them on their Irish market business.</p></speech>

We do it mostly in conjunction with Forf&aacute;s and Enterprise Ireland.  We try to have a combined agency submission on issues we would like to have dealt with.  That happens every year.</p></speech>

I know there was provision for a tax exemption and a lower tax rate for mobile high earning individuals.  I do not think the taxpayer would have paid for school fees, but the executive might have received a tax allowance for the children who were being relocated to Ireland.

Again, the higher the level of activities one is trying to bring in to the economy, the higher is the economic benefit.

The key challenge is what a region will do to make itself more attractive than another region.  It could be related to road infrastructure and access.  Some county managers and their county councils have been very good at promoting a more competitive offering in terms of capital contributions or development levies and infrastructure, as well as education.  We tend to take the view that because of the motorway network, one does not talk about individual counties.  Let me give an example.  On Friday, 6 September I was in Carlow where Merck now employs almost 500 people and Unum now employs 100.  One can locate in areas with facilities within a 45 minute commute; that is part of the reason we have that infrastructure.  While facilities may not be located in an individual county, they are available within a reasonable commute.</p></speech>

IDA Ireland has done very well in bringing the pharmaceutical sector to Ireland, but when it comes to the HSE purchasing pharmaceuticals, it pays three to four times as much as what is paid for these products in Northern Ireland.  A product that one will pay &euro;7 in Northern Ireland will cost &euro;30 in Dublin.  It is my honest belief the Department of Health and IDA Ireland are afraid to tackle the pharmaceutical companies on what they are charging the HSE.  I do not understand how a product can be produced in Ireland and sold to the National Health Service in the United Kingdom for a fraction of the price at which they will sell it to the HSE.  I know IDA Ireland has the job of attracting companies to locate here and that the HSE is charged with negotiating the price of products.  I understand from the proceedings of the Committee of Public Accounts that HSE personnel do not meet directly with company personnel to discuss price but rather meet a committee which represents the industry.  Is there anything Mr. O'Leary can do to ease the burden on taxpayers when attracting pharmaceutical companies to Ireland in order that they charge the same price for their products in Ireland as they charge abroad?  I will never forget an incident a few years ago when I used to wear contact lenses.  Allergan Pharmaceuticals manufactures all of the products used and before the introduction of the euro, I had to pay IR&pound;14.  When I was on holiday in Brazil, I found the same product that had been manufactured in Westport, County Mayo and for which I paid for one quarter of the price.</p></speech>

While we would like to think we had all the pharmaceutical investment in the world in Ireland, a substantial number of companies are not here and the pricing applies equally to them regardless of whether they are in Ireland or not.  The decision we are talking about is a major investment and we want to make sure that our mission is very firm on what we are out to achieve.  Other people have to take on the responsibility for their particular missions.</p></speech>

The total cost of the IDA's land, site development, industrial property and industrial property for accommodation is &euro;463 million, and there is a total impairment of &euro;190 million.  Is that just for a pure reduction in value of that property of over 40%?</p></speech>

The impairments in the years prior to 2012 were actually greater and that was a reflection of the land prices nationally at the time.  It reduced to &euro;15 million in 2012 because the impairments are actually tapering off due to the reductions in value.  The impairment reflects the estimated recoverable value less the net book value.</p></speech>

I have seen first hand the work that his team does hand in hand with the ambassadors, Enterprise Ireland and so on.  If we could have one wish, it would be to have more resources to put more into that particular success.</p><p>  There has been much talk about a talent pool in Ireland, especially in the IT sector and the gaming industry, which is a growing market here.  We are competing worldwide for talent in that area, but we do not have enough of it at home because many people did not get into computer engineering over the last ten years.  Even if they did, some of what they have done is well behind the curve of what is going on across the world.  Is there an issue with the flexibility of the permit system that we need to bring people in who have this talent?  I am very familiar with the permit system, but does it need to be more flexible, especially in respect of IT professionals?</p></speech>

Our system is that when somebody is coming in, we provide a letter of support and it generally gets processed in a reasonable amount of time.  The appropriate number for receiving work permits and visas is something that needs to be kept under review.  It is important to have that flexibility to bring in people.  By bringing in people, we are winning an overall investment and then we have the spin off in the local economy which is where a large number of local jobs come on stream.</p></speech>

It also provides for an increase in numbers through conversion courses, JobBridge and so on.  In particular, there will need to be more initiatives like the cloud computing programme between EMC and CIT in the Deputy's own constituency.  In Athlone, Ericsson is working with 50 graduates on a special dedicated programme.  There is much of that happening and a fair number of other initiatives being undertaken, but obviously there is more to do.</p></speech>

Indonesia has 250 million people and a growing market, but we do not have a footprint there at the moment as it is being worked out of Australia.  The World Bank has spoken about developing countries in Africa and so on, and again we do not have any footprints down there.  I appreciate there are issues with resources, but does Mr. O'Leary think it might be worth considering a joint venture with Enterprise Ireland down there, even though it might be at an early stage of development.  These conversions can take some time, so if we had some footprint down there we would at least be looking at it.  We often talk about our fantastic relationship with America and much of that is down to our own diaspora, but 40% of Australia is of Irish descent and I am sure there is a huge possibility for growth there as well.  What are Mr. O'Leary's thoughts on that?</p></speech>

We visit a number of markets.  People have been to Malaysia, to Israel and South Africa on one-off programmes and we work closely with Enterprise Ireland as well.  We are co-located in a number of places around the world but we are not in some places due to different business reasons.</p></speech>

There is a good deal of talk at the moment about developing manufacturing in Ireland again.  In the engineering sector, particularly steel engineering, Germany seems to be one of the markets that does not have space, and we in Ireland have a good deal of talent in that area.  I wonder if more could be done in that area to bring some of the German companies into Ireland to set up plant here.</p></speech>

Many of them are what are called <i>Mittelstand</i> companies or family-owned companies, which can be sizable in their own right, and a number of them have substantial operations here.  Kostal has approximately 800 people between Mallow and Abbeyfeale, while Liebherr in Killarney has between 500 and 600.  However, it has proved rather tough to get manufacturing in the engineering sector here because of the competitive nature of it.  In particular, much of the business is tied to the automotive industry or capital goods.  A good deal of the German investment in automotive components is going to where the big plants are and many of the big plants are going into Slovakia, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland, etc.  However, it is an area we continue to monitor and I believe Ovens has, thankfully, recovered competitiveness.  There are some opportunities there and we have people working in the German market to try to make the most of them.</p></speech>

I will ask one or two regional questions.  Cork has been mentioned as a place that gets significant investment, and it does.  However, as we all know, Cork is a large county.  I come from north Cork, which does not get the same penetration, and I am keen to discuss that.  We have EMC in Ballincollig and VMware, which is an amazing success story that would not be there otherwise.  I know this because I have a close relationship with those involved down there.  They give great credit to Mr. O'Leary and his team for what is happening down there, and the spin-offs that have resulted for Ballincollig have been incredible.  The company has recently opened a new plant in Mahon.  Macroom has Nutricia, and Millstreet is another success story.  In the 1980s the IDA did a great deal of work there.  It is a small town - the one that I live in - with only approximately 1,500 people.  In the 1980s Apple came to Millstreet.  Then the plant closed down.  IDA Ireland came in and we now have ALPS there, which will celebrate 25 years in business this year.  It employs approximately 600 people as well as some seasonal work.  The spin-off to that area is phenomenal.  It is an example of where a region works really well because of the commitment that exists.  I was a small girl when the company came first and I do not remember all the details but my understanding is that one of our local people built the factory and it was a case of "If you build it, they will come."  I am unsure whether that works all the time, but that was a good example of when it did.  However, Kanturk is a complete black spot.  There has been no investment there for several years.  Our bakeries are gone.  It is a major food and agricultural area and one would have thought that some areas could have been examined in that regard.  I have been in touch with the Cork office about Charleville on many occasions and it is an area that has a good deal of engineering.  One of the things we were asked to do by IDA Ireland was a skills survey.  We have now completed that at a cost to the community of between &euro;20,000 and &euro;25,000 and we are getting support from the locals to figure it out.  What will the next engagement be?  Charleville is between Cork and Limerick.  There are significant numbers of people in Cork and Limerick and therefore it has a good deal of potential given its location.  How do we develop Charleville with an IDA Ireland footprint?  I appreciate that when people come here to set up businesses we do not have a choice and cannot tell them where to set up.  How can we sell some of these regions better?  Now that we have carried out the skills survey, what is the next plan?</p></speech>

We are working at it.  The question is what is the commute and the labour pool.  The tendency is to go for larger population centres.  There may be individual chances based on engineering capability.  How many minutes is it from, say, Kanturk to Cork?</p></speech>

One will never populate each individual town.  The question is can we get investment somewhere that can draw on the 45 minutes?  If one is going from north Dublin to south Dublin it takes 45 minutes alone.  That is not to say there would not be individual projects that we come across, but they tend to be in the more populated centres.</p></speech>

Ba ar an doicim&eacute;ad beag sin a chuir muid amach a t&oacute;gadh an strait&eacute;is ar fad.  De r&eacute;ir na strait&eacute;ise, is &eacute; aidhm pholasa&iacute; an Rialtais "a chinnti&uacute; go mbeidh an Ghaeilge n&iacute;os infheicthe sa tsocha&iacute; againn, mar theanga labhartha ag &aacute;r gcuid saor&aacute;nach mar aon le bheith le feice&aacute;il ar chomhartha&iacute; agus i litr&iacute;ocht".  Go minic, feictear f&iacute;orchro&iacute; an duine sna siombail.  Bh&iacute; an m&eacute;id a luaigh an tUasal de Sp&aacute;inn mar gheall ar "Tacsa&iacute;" agus "Uisce &Eacute;ireann" thar a bheith sp&eacute;isi&uacute;il.  Taispe&aacute;nann an sampla is d&eacute;ana&iacute; de mheon seoin&iacute;neachta an Rialtais nach gceapann said gur fi&uacute; an sean-traidisi&uacute;n Gaelach a choinne&aacute;il beo.  N&iacute; d&oacute;igh leo go bhfuil aon luach leis an rud Gaelach n&oacute; an rud a bhaineann le stair agus le sinsear.  T&aacute; m&eacute; ag caint faoin athr&uacute; polasa&iacute; maidir le b&aacute;id an Chabhlaigh.  Bh&iacute; n&oacute;s ann ainmneacha Gaelacha - ainmneacha baineann, sa chuid is m&oacute;, ach &uacute;s&aacute;ideadh ainmneacha fireann i dh&aacute; ch&aacute;s - a &uacute;s&aacute;id mar ainmneacha ar na b&aacute;id.  Mar is eol don choiste, bh&iacute; b&aacute;id ar n&oacute;s an L&Eacute; Aoife, an L&Eacute; Emer, an L&Eacute; Aisling, an L&Eacute; Niamh agus an L&Eacute; Eithne in &uacute;s&aacute;id ag an gCabhlach ag dul ar fud na cruinne.  Thaispe&aacute;n na hainmneacha sin Gaelachas na t&iacute;re agus l&eacute;irigh siad go bhfuil &aacute;r dteanga f&eacute;in againn.  T&aacute; cinneadh d&eacute;anta ag an Rialtas anois - is cos&uacute;il gurb &eacute; an Aire Cosanta at&aacute; freagrach as - go mbeidh na b&aacute;id nua ainmnithe as Samuel Beckett agus James Joyce.  N&iacute;l tada agam ina n-aghaidh.  T&aacute; go leor ruda&iacute; a bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; a ghlaoch i ndiaidh Beckett agus Joyce.  C&eacute;n f&aacute;th an bhfuil athr&uacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh ar an rud seo, a bh&iacute; chomh saini&uacute;il len&aacute;r n-Arm agus le Fianna na h&Eacute;ireann?  Sa bhliain 1913, chum Eoin Mac N&eacute;ill, a chabhraigh le Conradh na Gaeilge a bhun&uacute;, an t-ainm "&Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann", at&aacute; f&oacute;s le breathn&uacute; ar chaip&iacute;n&iacute; an Airm, chun &iacute;omh&aacute; Gaelach a thabhairt do na h&oacute;glaigh.  Domsa, is iad na h&oacute;glaigh a buna&iacute;odh sa bhliain 1913 an t-Arm c&eacute;anna at&aacute; againne go dt&iacute; an l&aacute; at&aacute; inniu ann, ach t&aacute;imid ag tr&eacute;igean &aacute;r nd&uacute;chas anois.  Ba mhaith liom rud eile a lua sula dtiocfaidh m&eacute; go dt&iacute; na molta&iacute;.</p></speech>

T&aacute; s&eacute; deacair a thuiscint c&eacute;n chaoi a bhf&eacute;adfadh &eacute;inne a bheith ag foghlaim na Gaeilge ar feadh ocht mbliana sa bhunscoil, agus b'fh&eacute;idir dh&aacute; bhliain sa mhe&aacute;nscoil, gan bheith in ann dh&aacute; abairt a chur in &eacute;ineacht lena ch&eacute;ile.

Is l&eacute;ir, d&aacute; bhr&iacute; sin, go bhfuil airgead ag dul am&uacute; sna scoileanna agus go bhfuil teip ioml&aacute;n ar an gcuraclam, ar an gc&oacute;ras agus mar sin de.

It is not good enough to leave them in silent mode because they interfere with the communications equipment.  </p><p>  I welcome to the joint committee two new members, Senator Catherine Noone and Deputy Dara Murphy.  This is their first meeting.  </p><p>  Today's discussion is on the September General Affairs Council, GAC, meeting.  We are delighted to be joined by our new Minister of State with special responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Paschal Donohoe.  Everybody will be aware that he is an ex-member of the committee and was its Vice Chairman.  On a personal note, I must say that while he served as Vice Chairman, he was exemplary in the role, extremely helpful and diligent.  His promotion is very well deserved.  He will bring to his role a unique knowledge of European affairs, having served on the committee and led the sub-committee that examined the issues involved in one of the previous referendums.  While we are saddened that he has left the committee, we are delighted to have someone of his calibre in the position of Minister of State.  He is very welcome.  He will attend the General Affairs Council meeting in Brussels on 30 September when the Council is expected to discuss EU cohesion policy which, as we all know, has a profound impact on Europe's poorer regions.  We would like to hear from him on how he expects the GAC meeting to go.</p></speech>

I am delighted to be with the committee members.  My appearance at the committee is striking for two reasons - at least, it is striking for me - the first being that I spent seven very happy years working with it on matters about which we were concerned.

I wish him well in his role as Minister of State and congratulate him on his assessment of circumstances Europe-wide.  I have a couple of questions that I believe need to be addressed.</p><p>  At the June Council meeting the Heads of State agreed on the issue of youth unemployment and identified certain procedures in that regard.  Will the Minister of State comment on the progress made because it affects us all in each member state?  If possible, I would like to receive an update.</p><p>  The investment plan for Europe reflects SMEs and the mobilisation of European Investment Bank resources.  It has come to my attention recently that citizens are affected in this and other European countries by the fact that many SMEs have had their credit ratings seriously damaged.  As we know, the damage to the credit rating of the country can seriously debilitate its ability to assert itself economically and make progress.  The principal of a company or small business, for example, might have found the company&rsquo;s credit rating damaged and might have had the business referred to the credit bureau, with the consequence that it could not make progress, borrow money or receive any consideration for five years.  For five years the company must remain stagnant.  This should be dealt with at national and European level.  The Minister of State might consider this.</p><p>  I particularly welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s appraisal of the enlargement process and the necessity to keep it on track.  He might indicate the extent of progress on banking union because it was mentioned at the June Council meeting.</p><p>  Ireland has made huge sacrifices in recent years, as the Chairman and every member knows.  There has been considerable progress and improvement in recent years as a result of these sacrifices.  I hope our European colleagues are fully conversant with the sacrifices made and the progress made to date.  An example of progress is the net rate of job creation in the country in the past 12 months or so.  It has been spectacular.</p><p>  The Minister of State has commented on the possible withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union in the aftermath of a referendum.  What would be the consequences of such an outcome for the European Union in general, the special Ireland-UK relationship and the common travel area, etc.?  What is the potential for damage to the very concept of the European Union in the event that one country is seen to withdraw from it?</p></speech>

He is as familiar as anyone with the problem of youth unemployment.  There is a lack of urgency across Europe concerning this matter.  I hope that in his new role the Minister of State will try to tackle that problem urgently.  According to those involved in youth work, both here and abroad, many young people are disengaging.  There are 2,249 people on the live register in my own area of Tallaght.  In the neighbouring constituency, there are 1,223 on the live register in Clondalkin.  However, a significant number of young people are not signing on.  They are outside the system and are disengaging, which will cause difficulties.  I can guarantee that that is happening right across Europe as well.  It is clearly urgent that we deal with this problem.  How does the Minister of State propose to speed up and front-load youth employment initiatives, including the youth guarantee?  How can we instil urgency in dealing with the difficulties involved?  Can the Minister of State outline what the Government will do to speed up and expand such initiatives?</p><p>  The Minister of State referred to social inclusion.  Role models are the key for those who are excluded from society.  From our local authority work we know what can be done about that.  There is no point in local or national government discussing the matter unless they create specific plans.  For instance, South Dublin County Council put Travellers in front-line positions such as customer care.  People with disabilities are also being put in front so that the public meet them.  The Government should come up with novel ideas in this area.</p><p>  One of the areas we examined in trying to deal with youth unemployment was the use of JobBridge interns.  We had the example of 14 Departments employing 228 interns, but not one of them was kept on due to the jobs embargo.  What message does that send out to the rest of society if the Government is not taking a lead?  Whom can we ask to take the lead if the Administration does not do so?</p><p>  The Minister of State talked about cross-Border initiatives and he is familiar with the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.</p></speech>

That initiative is also important for opening up tourism in that region.</p><p>  The European Commission has requested changes to budget 2014 after it has been approved by the Oireachtas in October.  It is a worrying development, particularly given the extent to which the Commission has been driving the troika's austerity programme.  Can the Minister of State outline the timeline for this potential interference in our budgetary process by the Commission?  Can he guarantee that any changes proposed by the Commission will revert to the Oireachtas for discussion?  Can he outline what the procedure would be if there was a disagreement between the Government and the Commission over the proposed budgetary changes demanded by the latter?</p><p>  The Minister of State is right about the language being used, including terms such as "six-pack" and "two-pack".  People just switch off when they hear that.  We do need to engage young people about what happens in Europe but we also need to bring it home to them in their own communities and make it relevant to their lives.</p></speech>

He has a considerable track record and I have no doubt that he will continue his work in a non-partisan manner, demonstrating humility every step of the way.  It has been a hallmark of his time on this committee.  I am being absolutely sincere about it because for seven or eight years I worked on this committee with Deputy Donohoe before he was appointed to his new ministerial portfolio.  We have always had a good working relationship that was based on putting the interests of the country ahead of any self-interest.  That is why I am delighted he was chosen for ministerial office.  He can maintain that non-partisanship which is so important for this country.  We should not divide along standard political lines, which has happened in more recent times, on the issue of Europe.  I have no doubt that the Minister of State will continue with the non-partisan approach.  There are huge challenges, which he has set out today.  They include issues that have arisen at the European Council and elsewhere.  I look forward to seeing the Minister of State's efforts in that regard.</p><p>  The crisis of spiralling unemployment is the big issue that Europe is attempting to resolve.  It is bedevilling not just us but the rest of Europe also.  The Minister of State has identified the necessity of front-loading youth employment initiatives as well as speeding up the implementation of the youth guarantee.  These are hugely important matters.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to suggest more ideas to resolve that problem.</p><p>  He also referred to institutional reform and his work with the European Parliament.  It is important to assist the citizens of this State in having a better understanding of what our participation in Europe can do for us.  We have been good at blaming Europe for so much, but that will not be a feature of the Minister of State's period in office.  I am sure he will explain what we can and cannot expect from Europe.  Anything we can do to focus on job creation is critical.</p><p>  The Minister of State referred to the digital agenda and innovation policy, but we also need to focus on mainstream, blue-collar jobs.  Because the central focus in Europe is the drive for innovation and new technology, we often lose sight of blue-collar jobs which are the bedrock of economic activity across Europe.</p></speech>

I wish Deputy Dara Murphy and Senator Noone, the new members of the committee, the best of luck and hope they enjoy it as much as I did.</p><p>  Yesterday, I read an interesting newspaper article on the UK&rsquo;s Liberal Democrats recent conference.  When delegates get up to speak, a set of traffic lights appear behind them.  If they speak for longer than a minute, it goes red and then after another while the microphone stops.  This applies to all delegates from councillors to Nick Clegg.  This is an interesting insight into how we talk about Europe and the language we use.

I have no doubt during my tenure in office I will get sucked into using the same language.  At the beginning of my opening statement, I spoke about banning the use of the word "institution" and then used it throughout my contribution.  I welcome the fact that many members spoke about outputs and what comes out of Europe.</p><p>  Deputies Durkan and Crowe spoke about the tragedy of youth unemployment.  I agree with Deputy Crowe&rsquo;s point about the impact it has on young people for the rest of their lives.  It changes the options a young person will have as they move through life.  The multi-annual financial framework has set aside moneys for projects, such as the youth guarantee, to tackle youth unemployment.</p><p>  The reason the banking union is so important is that we need to get credit in Europe flowing for businesses and families.  The three elements of the union will be the single supervisory mechanism, which will deal with how banks, particularly those that stretch across many borders, are regulated, the resolution framework to deal with failed banks and the deposit guarantee scheme.  We are expecting the Lithuanian EU Presidency to produce clear proposals on the latter element.  Much work is being done on the supervisory mechanism and the role of the European Central Bank in this.  It is expected to have it up and running at a near and credible date.  We expect further negotiations with the European Parliament to take place on the resolution element.</p><p>  Deputy Durkan made the point about the sacrifice of the Irish people.  I will never miss an opportunity to make that point in Europe.  Along with commentary on Ireland&rsquo;s progress in dealing with its programme, we need to point out the terrible sacrifices our people have made in dealing with the mistakes of the past.  I always offer the example of the changes in our budgets to bridge the gap between taxation and spending.  By the time our commitments are upheld, we will have implemented a total package of adjustment that represents one fifth of our national income.  That is an extraordinary level of change for any country to undergo.  It is at the very top of adjustments any country has made since the Second World War.  I will never miss the opportunity to make clear to European colleagues that whatever progress we have made has been due to the sacrifices our people have made.</p><p>  On Deputy Durkan's point about the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, it is in our and the EU&rsquo;s interest for the United Kingdom to be a positive and significant player in the Union for years to come.  We have to weigh up the UK&rsquo;s expectations alongside our national interests.  We must also recognise that the European Union cannot renegotiate itself from scratch now.  Member states have joined with a knowledge of what it is to be a member along with its commitments and responsibilities.</p></speech>

In respect of the priorities he highlighted, I very much agree with him regarding the understanding of people's views of Europe and what Europe is about.  I am not sure whether this has been adequately done over the years by members of the European Parliament.  In many cases, they are more involved in many local issues than in the European project, which is regrettable.  It might be interesting to see what words come to mind when one mentions the European Parliament to people.  Do they think of austerity, EU directives, regulations or unemployment?  It might be interesting to compare that in terms of generations because people of a different age would look at the EU in terms of stability, growth and what it has done for Ireland and other countries across the region.  It would be interesting to do that survey and see what results one would get.</p><p>  I know the youth guarantee is very important.  There is a pilot project in Ballymun at the moment.  The Minister for Social Protection has stated that the European Parliament and the Commission have yet to reach agreement on the qualifying criteria for funding the youth employment initiative.  This is delaying applications for funding so it is important that this is sorted.  </p><p>  In respect of the Cohesion Fund, we lost out in the last round because we were higher than the 90% average of European funding, which is a positive thing.  Unfortunately, we lost out in that last round so are there any plans to change the criteria in respect of the next round?  Ireland's average figure at that time was &euro;38,970, while the EU average was &euro;33,609 so we were higher than 90% of the European average.  Are there plans for that?</p><p>  In respect of the European Regional Development Fund and European territorial co-operation which is one of the European regional policies and involves cross-border activities and the development of transnational co-operation, we have one trans-European border, which is Northern Ireland as part of the UK.  Do countries with large numbers of EU neighbours like France, Belgium and the Netherlands benefit disproportionately, particularly if we are losing out in respect of the Cohesion Fund?  The Minister of State might have some views on that.</p></speech>

When I was elected to the D&aacute;il, I was allocated the office of Deputy Rabbitte who had to vacate it because he was promoted to Minister.  With the reshuffle coming down the line, am I on a trajectory?  I am a big admirer of the Minister of State and very much value his contribution.</p><p>  I want to follow up some issues he raised this morning.  In respect of language, believe it or not but I do try to read my agendas and the documentation that accompany them before I come here.  I started with the 2012 report on inter-parliamentary relations between the European Parliament and national parliaments under the Treaty of Lisbon.  I got as far as the three-page introduction.  Frankly, for those of us who are supposed to be educated parliamentarians to expect the punter on the road to be able to understand any of the language in it is really pushing it.</p><p>  I will tell the Minister of State why I am concerned about language and I concur with him.  During the last fiscal treaty debate, I was doing tallies.  The boxes at which I was looking were those for Cherry Orchard and Ballyfermot.  The &quot;No&quot; votes in these boxes were between 80% and 90%.  As the boxes were being opened, it seemed that the more one approached the Terenure-Rathgar and Terenure-Rathfarnham end of the constituency, the vote was 80% in favour.  It is very telling that everybody is not an <i>Irish Times</i> reader.  There is a huge segment of our society that is disconnected from national politics but, more clearly, does not know much about European politics.  As public representatives, we are regularly invited to schools to speak to schoolchildren - ostensibly as Deputies. There is an incredible confusion on the part of teaching staff and students as to what a Deputy does in the Parliament and confusion about the role of local government and that of the European Parliament and our role in Europe.</p></speech>

I congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment.  We have worked well together in the past and I agree with Deputy Dooley that he possesses characteristics that will allow him to be an excellent Minister of State.  He is coming into the position at a time of great opportunity for Ireland.  We are in a good place reputationally and he will enjoy legitimacy in arguing his case with other countries facing economic difficulties.</p><p>  I understand Cohesion Funding has been ring-fenced for the Border, midland and western, BMW, region but we do not yet know the exact amount we will get.  It is estimated that we will receive in the region of &euro;1 billion.  What sort of process is envisaged for dealing with the money and what is the Minister of State's position in regard to it?</p><p>  In regard to democratic legitimacy, what is the Minister of State's opinion on directly electing presidents of the institutions?  Citizens feel a lack of connection with these areas and that nut will have to be cracked at some point.</p></speech>

Deputy Kyne suggested an interesting research project that would ask people what they think of when they think about Europe.  The research with which I am familiar includes the Eurobarometer polls conducted across Europe.  These polls clearly demonstrate that people's faith in European institutions declined during the crisis.  However, I would put this in context with two other findings from the same polls.  First, faith and trust in European political institutions are higher in many cases than their faith in national political institutions, although faith in both sets of institutions has fallen dramatically.  Second, when people were asked what they consider the right level of response to the current difficulties, many, and the majority in some cases, think the right level is higher than their own national governments.</p></speech>

Those discussions happened a number of years ago, but for the most part they have come to an end and that is huge progress.  However, we cannot take that progress for granted in future discussions.</p><p> Deputy Dara Murphy asked about the nuts and bolts of how the money will be spent. I will be able to answer those questions in the coming months.  The negotiations will discuss where and how the money will be spent.  For all our justifiable pride about the money we have identified and secured, that money is useless until it is spent.  We are anxious, therefore, for those discussions to come to an end in order that it can be spent in the areas we care about.</p><p>  What was the other question that Deputy Murphy asked me?</p></speech>

A very important part of how we do that is that when things go very well for our country we must acknowledge Ireland's role in making that happen and the role of Europe and its bodies in allowing that to happen.  When things do not go so well we also need to be honest.  The semester process which will start soon for our country in a different way as we plan to exit our bailout programme is a very good way for us to have that discussion.  While some of us, such as Deputy Crowe, might have concerns about how it will operate, at least we need to be honest, as we all would be, about how it will operate.  We must say there are vast areas that are still exclusively areas of national competence, and also new areas of supervision and surveillance which will not apply to Ireland in their implementation if we all do the work well.  However, that supervision provides a safety net for our country to ensure the difficulties we have had in the past will not be repeated.  We are all united in wanting to ensure that does not happen.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-19a.406" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1095" speakername="Liam Twomey" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12013091900002#A00300"><p>The purpose of today's meeting is to consider the Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income and Capital Gains) (Ukraine) Order 2013 and the Exchange of Information Relating to Taxes and Tax Matters (Dominica) Order 2013.  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes, and his officials, to this meeting and thank them for assisting our consideration of the motions.  Briefing notes have been provided by the Department of Finance.</p><p>  If we can adhere to a strict schedule, the Minister of State will address the committee, after which each Opposition spokesperson can respond.  We can then have an open discussion.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I call on the Minister of State to address the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-19a.407" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/958" speakername="Brian Hayes" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12013091900003#B00100"><p>I am pleased to introduce to the committee a draft Government order giving force of law to a new double taxation agreement with Ukraine and a draft Government order giving force of law to a tax information exchange agreement with Dominica.  Double taxation agreements are widely regarded as critical pieces of fiscal infrastructure for developing substantial bilateral trading and investment opportunities by reducing tax impediments that might otherwise deter such cross-border activity.  For a small open economy like Ireland that is so dependent on trade and investment with other countries, continuing to expand our network of international tax agreements is not only necessary but vital.  Double taxation agreements facilitate trade and investment by providing greater certainty to taxpayers regarding their potential liability to tax in the foreign jurisdiction; by allocating taxing rights between the two jurisdictions in order that the taxpayer is not subject to double taxation; by reducing the risk of excessive taxation that may arise because of high withholding taxes; and by ensuring taxpayers are not subject to discriminatory taxation in the foreign jurisdiction.</p><p>  Double taxation agreements provide benefits to both taxpayers and governments by setting out clear rules that will govern tax matters relating to cross-border trade and investment.  Tax treaties ensure predictability and fairness in the tax treatment of taxpayers and spell out clearly defined provisions that facilitate companies investing and doing business overseas.  This is achieved by allocating exclusive taxing rights to one country, or where both countries retain taxing rights, by requiring the country where the taxpayer is resident to grant credit against its tax for the tax paid in the other country.</p><p>  Double taxation agreements cover direct taxes, which in the case of Ireland are income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax.  They are comprehensive in scope, covering both the taxation of companies and individuals and are in the main based on the OECD model tax convention.</p><p>  Apart from relieving double taxation, double taxation agreements also include provisions dealing with non-discrimination in relation to taxation matters.  They also have mutual agreement procedures which allow the tax authorities of both countries to consult each other in taxation matters affecting the agreement and provisions that allow for the exchange of information for the purpose of preventing tax evasion.</p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s tax treaty network compares very favourably with the networks of other larger OECD countries and now includes most of the world&rsquo;s major economies, accounting in aggregate for more than 80% of world GDP.  The Irish treaty network has grown significantly in the past three years.  We have signed comprehensive double taxation agreements with 69 countries, of which 64 are in effect.  Negotiations for a new agreement with Thailand have concluded and should be signed shortly.  The Minister for Finance and I will be ensuring we continue to prioritise the further expansion of our tax treaty network over the coming months as a central element of our integrated strategy for an export-led sustainable economic recovery for Ireland.</p><p>  I assure members that the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners will continue to liaise with business representative bodies in identifying other countries where tax agreements would assist Irish business.  Of course, despite our best efforts, there are some key jurisdictions that we have yet to secure and we will continue all diplomatic efforts to bring these countries to the negotiating table.</p><p>  I will now deal with tax information exchange agreements.  Tax information exchange agreements, while serving a different purpose, are also important international agreements which strengthen the ability of the revenue authorities in both countries to enforce their tax laws and thereby encourage the development of closer economic relations between both countries in the future.  We have concluded tax information exchange agreements with 22 jurisdictions, 17 of which are in effect.  All of these are based on the OECD model TIEA.  The model TIEA grew out of the work undertaken by the OECD to address harmful tax practices globally.  The OECD model TIEA represents the international standard for effective exchange of information in tax matters.  There has been a significant acceleration of the process of signing TIEAs between OECD countries and offshore jurisdictions over the past couple of years, mainly stemming from a threat by the G20 to blacklist jurisdictions that do not conclude at least 12 information exchange agreements.</p><p>  The TIEAs will allow the Revenue Commissioners to directly request from foreign tax authorities information that is relevant to an Irish tax investigation, such as bank account information or company or trust ownership information.  The agreements will greatly assist the Revenue Commissioners in tax investigations involving entities and bank accounts located in these jurisdictions.</p><p>  Today&rsquo;s consideration by the committee of these international agreements is an important step in their ratification process.  Draft Government orders confirming and giving effect in Ireland to the agreements were laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 12 September 2013, in accordance with the provisions of section 826 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  A resolution by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approving the draft orders is required before the Government can make the orders.  The proposal that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approve the draft orders has been referred to this committee for its consideration.  After consideration by the committee the draft orders will be referred back to the D&aacute;il for approval, after which the Government may make the orders and the agreements will then be included in a Schedule to the Tax Acts by means of a section in the forthcoming Finance Bill.  Thereupon, the Irish ratification procedures are completed.  In the case of the bilateral agreements, as soon as both countries have completed their procedures, the agreements will take effect in accordance with their entry into force provisions.</p><p>  I commend these draft orders to the committee and, if required, I will be happy to deal with any questions from members.</p></speech>

He will note there is great interest in this subject.  What has prompted the agreement with Dominica at this time?  I ask the Minister of State to explain the background to this agreement.  It is State policy to have as many double taxation arrangements as possible but I query why this agreement has been arranged now and the events which prompted it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-19a.409" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/958" speakername="Brian Hayes" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12013091900003#B00300"><p>At any given time a number of these agreements are in the pipeline, so to speak.  The key issue is getting them over the line.  Ireland undertakes diplomatic negotiations with other states.  The reason for the agreement being finalised at this time is because Dominica is ready to sign the agreement, as is Ireland.  The agreement must be brought before the D&aacute;il and a relevant section is then included in the Finance Bill.  To achieve effective implementation of these agreements, they must be included in the Finance Bill, which will be brought forward soon.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-19a.410" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/959" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12013091900003#B00400"><p>Which state, Ireland or Dominica, was more eager to achieve this agreement?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-19a.411" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/958" speakername="Brian Hayes" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12013091900003#B00500"><p>Both of us were happy to achieve the agreement at this time.  Dominica does not have the same network of TIEAs in place as has Ireland.  There is now more pressure from the OECD and from world organisations to have these agreements in place.  I suspect the pressure was more from the other side than from us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-19a.412" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/959" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12013091900003#B00600"><p>The committee is dealing with the issue of corporation tax and countries which would have been deemed to be tax havens at one time but are no longer so because of the OECD criteria.  Exchange of information is one of the aspects of efforts to avoid the definition of a tax haven.  It was put to the committee that some of these areas have participated in what would be in reality cosmetic exchanges of information between themselves so that the tax havens are all exchanging information between themselves to fit the criteria.</p><p>  This leads to my second question about the exchange of information.  The type of double taxation agreement, TIEA, is probably the weakest of the three.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-19a.414" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/958" speakername="Brian Hayes" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12013091900004#C00200"><p>There are 69 double taxation treaties in place and 22 TIEAs, which are separate.  The Deputy is right in saying there is a gradation among the three types of agreement, the lowest being the TIEAs.  The latter deal with specific information that is sought from time to time whereas double taxation agreements are more comprehensive.  It is important to note, in light of recent commentary both internationally and at home, that we are beginning to move to a new process of automatic exchange of information, similar to what the United States has been putting in place by way of its Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, FATCA, which I spoke to the finance committee about some months ago.  I had the opportunity to meet the Secretary General of the OECD, Mr. Angel Gurr&iacute;a, in Vilnius last week when he gave a presentation to the ECOFIN meeting.  The direction in which the G20 and OECD are moving on this issue is clear.</p><p>  The main benefit of automatic exchange agreements is that rather than merely an arrangement where either tax authority will respond to a specific query that the other might have, there is instead a direct and automatic exchange of all relevant information between individuals and companies, such as, for example, between the United States Internal Revenue Service and our Revenue Commissioners and <i>vice versa</i>.  However, I accept the Deputy's point that TIEAs are the lowest rung of the ladder when it comes to the exchange of taxation information.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-19a.415" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/959" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12013091900004#C00300"><p>Yes, we all acknowledge that automatic exchange is the best way forward and TIEAs have huge deficiencies.  In the case of the latter, one must ask the right question and specify the correct information.  If we are moving in the direction of automatic information exchange, as the Minister of State indicated, why then is a TIEA with Dominica being brought forward?  Is it the case that we tried for an automatic arrangement with that country and were refused?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-19a.416" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/958" speakername="Brian Hayes" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12013091900004#C00400"><p>In all cases we attempt to obtain a double taxation agreement.  We have 69 such treaties in place, as I said, and have given a commitment to the OECD to ramp that number up significantly.  If securing a DTA is not possible, whether because of concerns on the part of the other country or whatever, a tax information exchange agreement is the next option.</p><p>  We should bear in mind that these are bilateral arrangements which require two parties to come to the table.  It is quite often the case, for instance, that negotiations will commence but not conclude, which is a real problem in the case of our engagement with certain emerging economies.  I have made that point to the finance committee in the past.  There are countries in South America, in particular, with which we would like to secure an agreement but, for all types of reasons, we have not yet managed to bring discussions to a conclusion.  It is not a case of our seeking to secure the most minimal agreement.  On the contrary, we always seek to achieve the most extensive agreement possible, but whether that is possible is effectively a matter for the third country to decide.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-19a.417" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/959" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12013091900004#C00500"><p>It makes sense that the State would generally seek the most extensive agreement possible.  Is it the case then that an automatic exchange agreement with Dominica was sought but was not forthcoming and we have therefore entered into a TIEA, which is weaker but far better than what was there heretofore?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-19a.418" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/958" speakername="Brian Hayes" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12013091900004#C00600"><p>No, that is not really a fair representation of the situation.  It is important to bear in mind that this is the first bilateral tax information agreement of any sort that we have had with Dominica.  It is not a question of that country being unable to agree a DTA with us.  The logical outcome probably would be a DTA, but the reality is that DTAs often come about largely as a consequence of pressure from businesses which are doing substantial business in a third country and wish to avail of the benefits of a double taxation agreement with it.  If there is a market for a DTA, it will be agreed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-19a.419" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/959" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12013091900004#C00700"><p>I am a little confused.  We have established that the TIEA is the weakest rung on the ladder of the three forms of taxation information exchange, the spontaneous arrangement being in the middle and automatic exchange of information being generally the preferred option, including for this State.  The question then naturally arises as to whether the Government sought in its negotiations with Dominica to institute an automatic exchange of information agreement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-19a.420" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/958" speakername="Brian Hayes" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12013091900004#C00800"><p>I am not certain whether that was the case.  I will find out and get back to the Deputy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-19a.421" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/959" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12013091900004#C00900"><p>That is fine.  I recognise that this is a two-way process and a very positive step forward in regard to the exchange of information, limited as the TIEA is in its effect.  I agree that in all such negotiations we should be looking for automatic exchange of information.</p><p>  I have two further questions.  The Minister of State indicated that 69 double taxation agreements have been concluded, five of which are not yet in effect.  Will he name the five countries in question and indicate why our agreements with them are not in effect?</p><p>  Article 7 of the agreement with Dominica refers to the possibility of declining a request.  In fact, it provides a great deal of wriggle room in terms of the broad range of grounds on which a requested party may refuse to provide information.  Is this article a standard provision?  Is it replicated word for word in the other 22 TIEAs?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-19a.422" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/958" speakername="Brian Hayes" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12013091900004#C01000"><p>Yes, that particular provision is standard.</p><p>  The five countries in respect of which a DTA has been agreed but not implemented are Egypt, Kuwait, Qatar, Azerbaijan and Ukraine, the last of which we are dealing with today.  In the case of Kuwait, we completed our ratification procedure on 6 February 2011 but it has not yet done the same.  Such agreements can only come into effect when both parties complete the necessary ratification process.  In the case of Qatar and Egypt, we completed our ratification process in March of this year and are awaiting their corresponding action.  When that is done, these agreements will come into effect.  The parliamentary or administrative procedure in terms of ratifying what is agreed is a matter for each particular country.</p></speech>

I am aware of a review that was done on Ireland in 2010 and reported in 2011.  On that occasion we obtained a compliant standard, which is the highest.  As a consequence of its membership of the forum, Dominica is now open for peer review.  It is not, however, a member of the OECD.</p></speech>

I commend the latter and their colleagues in the Revenue Commissioners on their continuing success in negotiating double taxation agreements and tax information exchange agreements with third-party countries.</p><p>  In regard to DTAs, I understand they are based on the OECD model.  Are they generally of a <i>pro forma</i> nature or are they usually bespoke and tailored to individual countries?  Will the Minister of State comment on the nature of our dealings with countries with which we have not agreed either a DTA or TIEA?  If issues arise, as they can do, in terms of the need for information exchange, what is the procedure in such cases?  Is it done by mutual agreement and can a country simply refuse or stonewall a request by the Irish authorities for information?</p></speech>

As a result, not all agreements are the same.  There is a minimum standard which is set by the OECD and it is then a matter for each country to negotiate around that.  This is obviously one of the reasons it takes longer for us to conclude these negotiations, particularly if other countries are seeking considerations which may not be contained in other agreements.  If we do not have a DTA, a TIEA or a FATCA, what do we have and can we, as the Deputy quite correctly inquired, provide information?  My understanding is that if there is no legal basis, we cannot exchange information.</p></speech>

There is a Council of Europe agreement on this but I do not believe that has been tested in the courts in the context of whether what we are discussing can happen.  Tax authorities and governments in many countries regard this as an important issue.  That said, I understand there is no legal basis for it.  That is one of the reasons the OECD has been, quite rightly, exerting pressure on countries to conclude these agreements.</p><p>  Our trade with Ukraine amounts to &euro;70 million, which is not a colossal amount.  I visited Ukraine to sign the agreement and deal with a number of issues which are the subject of several reports in today's newspapers.  While there, I was struck by the low level of trade between our two countries.  There are enormous opportunities for trade between Ireland and Ukraine.  The latter was part of the old Soviet Union and its economy is rapidly improving.  It is an emerging economy in the eastern part of Europe with which we must have very strong bilateral relations.  During our discussions, Minister Kolobov and I came to the conclusion that we have a great deal in common and that we need to increase trade with each other.  Having a double taxation agreement in place will provide a safety net for our business people who are operating there and <i>vice versa</i>.  The figure for trade with Dominica is &euro;115,000.  There is big room for improvement in this regard.</p><p>  On the Deputy's final question, the countries with which we are prioritising our work in the context of concluding agreements are Tunisia, Jordan and Azerbaijan.  Negotiations with these states are at various stages.  We hope to return to the committee shortly when an agreement is reached with Thailand.  I understand it is planned to initiate negotiations for new agreements with other countries in the latter part of this year and into next year.  This will be done in consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Approaches have also been made to countries in South America, Africa and Asia, including the Far East.</p></speech>

This matter has cropped up to a fair degree during our deliberations on base erosion and profit shifting in the context of UK protectorates such as the British Virgin Islands.</p></speech>

The Vice Chairman will be aware, however, of a very substantial statement issued by the Chancellor of the Exchequer some time ago in which he indicated his intention to seek new agreements with those islands which have a connection with Britain.  The Vice Chairman is right to highlight the practices which exist in those territories.  The British have taken a very strong view on this matter, particularly in terms of their involvement with the G20.  The focus at the G20 meeting in Fermanagh earlier in the year was very strongly on this question, and quite rightly so.  Budgets are tight for all countries, and regardless of whether one's state is inside or outside a programme, we must find a way to arrive at a taxation regime which captures the new reality of the digital economy.  As I stated in Vilnius last week, that will require a new gold standard which must be agreed by the OECD and internationally.  The British are moving on this matter.</p></speech>
