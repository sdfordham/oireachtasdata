I draw to the attention of the witnesses the fact that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br/>The opening statement submitted to the committee will be published on its website after the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Witnesses should turn off their mobile phones completely or switch them to flight or safe mode, as otherwise they interfere with the broadcasting equipment.<br/>Third level education is facing a number of substantial challenges in all states, including the curtailment of public financial resources for the sector, pressure to accommodate an increased number of students and the need for greater specialisation in an increased range of rapidly changing disciplines.  This committee has been investigating what can be done in education at all levels through the Internet and digital literacy.  This meeting is part of our ongoing discussion on these topics.  We are very interested in the emergence of massive open online courses, MOOCs, and we are aware of new developments in this regard by the three colleges whose representatives are appearing before us.  For this reason, I welcome Professor Brian MacCraith, president of Dublin City University, Professor Mark Brown, director of the National Institute for Digital Learning, Mr. John D'Arcy, national director of the Open University,  Professor Timothy Savage, associate dean for online education at Trinity College Dublin, and Mr. John Coman, secretary to that college.  This meeting was originally scheduled for next week but we had to reschedule it as we are required to consider an Estimate next week.  I appreciate that the witnesses were able to attend at short notice.<br/>I invite Professor Mark Brown to make his opening presentation on behalf of DCU.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-03a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Mark Brown" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014120300003#D00300"><p>I welcome the opportunity to share DCU's experiences of and perspectives on studying at university through online learning, including MOOCs.  As Ireland's first professor of digital learning, I arrived in February to lead DCU's strategy and to establish the National Institute for Digital Learning.  I was previously director of the National Centre for Teaching and Learning at Massey University in New Zealand, where I had strategic oversight for the university's multi-campus learning environment comprising 33,000 students, including 16,500 online distance learners.  I also led the country's first enterprise-wide MOOC initiative and played a key role in establishing the Massey University worldwide brand.<br/>In this brief presentation I propose to make three key points but, before doing so, I wish to comment on the hype and hope associated with MOOCs and their disruptive potential.  MOOCs are primarily used for marketing purposes and few, if any, accredited degrees offered from reputable universities are done so in this manner.  Moreover, as the recent Porto declaration on the European use of MOOCs points out, they have low completion rates, attract already well-educated participants and involve significant costs.  While they offer a valuable innovation component or dimension, online learning is not new.  DCU has been providing online learning for more than a decade.  The digital world made possible by the Internet is transforming the way almost all human transactions are taking place, including teaching and learning.  In this respect, the Internet is the disruptive force, not the MOOC <i>per se</i>.<br/>It should also be acknowledged that many Irish universities are taking advantage of the digital world in which we now live.  In DCU's case, our online learning environment has become an essential part of the student learning experience.  Every week, thousands of students are routinely studying online.  In our experience, successful online learning initiatives require vision and strategic leadership aligned with a clear institutional mission and supported by capable teachers who embed digital learning experiences throughout the curriculum.  New technologies should not be simply bolted on to the existing curriculum.  None the less, having the will and the skills to embrace new digital technologies only goes so far because very little can be achieved without access to modern infrastructure.  Ireland urgently needs to invest in this infrastructure if it wants to remain competitive and take advantage of the opportunities presented by the new digital world.<br/>In DCU's case, investing in more flexible models of online learning is a strategic priority in our mission of transforming lives and societies by extending access to higher education.  This mission is not mutually exclusive with the goal of sustainability in generating income.  DCU has a number of strategic partnerships around the world which make extensive use of online learning, including a significant relationship with Arizona State University, the largest in the United States.  Last month we jointly launched an online MSc programme in biomedical diagnostics, and further joint initiatives are planned.  In addition, through the global e-schools initiative, which is headquartered in Nairobi, we deliver blended programmes to masters level to 12 nations in the African Union.  This type of collaborative model, which anchors funding from carefully selected partners, is an important strategy for building and sustaining global online learning initiatives which can generate revenue.<br/>However, current funding models limit our ability to realise the benefits of online learning and flexible learning, particularly for part-time students.  It is notable that fewer than 3% of Irish students currently study by distance learning.  Several higher level reports have recommended a more inclusive funding model.  The Hunt report recommended that: &quot;All students, whether full-time or part-time, on-campus or off-campus, should be equally supported by the funding model used to allocate resources to and within Institutions.&quot;</p> <p> The recent European high level report on the modernisation of higher education also recognised the need to address this fundamental barrier.  It made a strong recommendation for full equality of provision for all students regardless of time, place or mode of study.</p><p> My third key point is as follows.  Ireland needs to adopt a much more proactive rather than reactive strategy.  A greater focus needs to be placed on the long-term horizon.  The current preoccupation with MOOCs is far too narrow.  It focuses our attention on a delivery mode rather than the outcomes and types of learning experience that we seek.  We should think more broadly about the modernisation agenda for our universities.  </p><p> To this end, the National Institute for Digital Learning has appointed an international advisory board of leading experts in the field.  Also, we have commissioned the Horizon report to better understand the challenges, opportunity and future trends facing higher education.  The report will be available in April.</p><p> There are also opportunities to be far more active and proactive in the European sphere.  DCU is currently a member of the OpenupEd MOOC initiative funded by the European Commission. Since the National Institute for Digital Learning was established, we have secured funding from three major European projects.  In March 2015, for example, with European funding, the National Institute for Digital Learning will host a national MOOC symposium.</p><p> In conclusion, Irish educators and policy makers, rather than being prophets of doom and purveyors of dreams, need to shape the digital transformation of higher education.  The salient question that the digital learning roadmap asks is "Where are we going?", but the question should be "Where do we want to go?".  Discussions on the future of online learning need to be framed around the question of what type of higher education system we want to create by 2030.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-03a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John D'Arcy" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014120300004#E00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend today.  We are delighted to be here.<br/>The Open University has always been a distance learning provider.  Open University will celebrate its 45th birthday this year, and throughout that time we have relied on various technological approaches to get to learners in far-flung places  across the UK, Ireland and the globe.  Earlier inceptions were television and radio, and with the development of PCs our world exploded and we moved into online learning.  <br/>Most of our courses are blended learning courses and are not all strictly conducted online.  Learners still want face-to-face tuition at times; they want telephone and e-forum support, which we endeavour to provide.  Increasingly, a lot of our learners use Twitter and Facebook to communicate with their tutors and peers in order to take their studies forward.<br/>Open University is a MOOC provider and established a system called FutureLearn about two years ago.  One of the reasons for doing so, as Professor Brown said in his presentation, is that MOOCs are allegedly a disruptive force in higher education.  We felt that distance learning was something on which we had been a thought leader for a particular period and, therefore, we felt we should try to bring a degree of quality, standards and reputation to the MOOC environment.  FutureLearn has been going for almost two years, with about 30 academic partners located largely across the UK but also on this island, including Trinity College Dublin and Queen's University, Belfast.  <br/>FutureLearn has been phenomenally successful in terms of student uptake.  More than 750 million learners have signed up, and so far they have looked at well over 1 million courses.  I am glad my colleagues from TCD are here today, because its MOOC has been one of the most successful in terms of student numbers, with well over 20,000 learners.  Those learners have stayed with the course.  That is down to the way Trinity has approached the pedagogy.  <br/>MOOCs are a bit unusual.  People may wonder about free learning and wonder whether it is worthwhile.  We have found that the partners we work with and our academics produce very high-quality courses of three hours learning per week for maybe 13 weeks.  The retention figures show that around 22% of learners who start will finish their courses.  That percentage sounds quite low, but in MOOC terms it is quite high, so we are very pleased with the results.<br/>Aside from FutureLearn, which is a collaborative venture that is funded by the Open University, we also have an internal platform called OpenLearn.  Since OpenLearn was set up in 2006, around 33 million unique visitors have used material from it.  A lot of its content consists of previously run undergraduate and postgraduate material, so it is substantial learning.  It is an area we are rapidly taking forward.<br/>Over the next number of months we will introduce yet another acronym into the higher education environment, BOCs, or badged open courses.  It will be a small attempt to put soft assessment into this free, informal and open-access learning option that any citizen in Ireland or across the UK and the globe can pick up.  We will launch a series of ten or so courses between now and March of next year, including courses called Succeed with English, First Steps in HE and Digital Literacy.<br/>One of the reasons we are keen to take forward online learning is that we think we owe it to students at whatever stage they are at.  As educators, we feel it is imperative to get them into a digital lifestyle, because that is the way the world is moving.  We would do a disservice to learners if we did not take them into that environment.<br/>We have done some interesting pilot work on the badged open courses and discovered that students have found the initiative very useful.  They can take the badge to things like LinkedIn.  Some employers are also interested in the initiative because it could be useful for continuous professional development.<br/>In the past year we have also introduced, as part of our online experience, an app that can be accessed by all of our students on registered courses.  It is a mobile virtual learning environment called OU Anywhere, in which we have invested heavily in order to make sure it is as platform-free as possible.  That means that whether one has an Apple iPad, an Android device or a Kindle Fire, one will be able to access material.  Just by entering a student username, one will get all the course materials, which are portable.  That means that if one is in Tralee or Cork or on a train travelling to Dublin one can access learning material.  The app has already won two awards from <i>The Guardian</i>newspaper in the UK.  Last week we were fortunate to be awarded a higher education award by <i>The Times</i>for an initiative called the OpenScience Laboratory.  It is part-funded by the Wilson Foundation and creates an online experience in which people can carry out real-time scientific experiments.<br/>With MOOCs, OpenLearn, OU Anywhere and OpenScience Laboratory, we feel we are addressing the needs of students in a digital age.  We are a very collaborative university and like to work closely with our sister universities on the island.  We have demonstrated that with FutureLearn, which was done in collaboration with Trinity College and Queen's University.We are also keen to talk to other stakeholders on how to take digital learning forward.  <br/>MOOCs are part of a journey and they have gotten a lot of publicity over the past number of years.  We see them as important at this time, but with the way assessment, learning and pedagogy will change over the next number of years, MOOCs are not the end of this particular story.  I endorse what Professor Brown has said - that MOOCs are something that Irish education needs to get a handle on and fully buy into. <br/>Perhaps members would like to experience some of these materials.  Our office is on Holles Street and we would be happy to arrange an open day for members and colleagues if they felt it would be useful.  Sometimes it is only when one touches a refreshingly designed beautiful app that one can see why people get excited about this latest stage of online learning.<br/>I thank members for their time, and we are happy to enter into conversation with colleagues.</p></speech>

We look forward to contributing in any way we can.  I am the associate dean for online education at Trinity College.  I am accompanied by Mr. John Coman, who is the secretary to the College.  The Provost, Dr. Prendergast, who is unable to attend, sends his sincere apologies.  </p><p>  I shall outline my background.  I have been a lecturer and assistant professor in the area of technology and learning at Trinity College since 2002, and was made an associate dean 15 months ago.  That means my post is a relatively new appointment and a new college officership.</p><p>  As Ireland's university on the world stage, Trinity is recognised for academic excellence and a transformative student experience.  Trinity is embracing online education at a strategic level, through both formal accredited courses of study and MOOCs, as my colleagues have mentioned here.  We see online education as a response to the important globalised higher education space.  It also allows us to leverage the potential of these new educational forms and paradigms as part of our vision as a university of global consequence.</p> <p>Specifically, online education allows us to increase access to and participation in higher education through the flexibility that online education offers; access new markets and students, both locally and globally; share and disseminate the excellence in research and teaching of our staff; and enhance and promote innovation in teaching and learning across all of our courses.  This is one of the themes of our presentation.  We do not regard online education as something that can be separated from the day-to-day activities of third level institutions.  In 20 years' time, we will no longer speak of e-learning but simply of learning.  That is a key issue.<br/>I propose to address the specific matter of online education for accredited courses because this is a distinction we make.  Our recently published strategic plan for 2014-19 states that we will increase online learners to 1,000 within five years and promote a diverse student community.  This strategy builds on a pilot initiative that has been running under my leadership since 2013.  Our online students are fully registered Trinity College students who take a fully accredited and wholly online course.  The courses include the development of high quality online materials and a best practice instructional design model.  The students interact with their peers in a vibrant learning community and with the course team via a range of synchronous and asynchronous technologies, including live whole class video conferences.  We are trying to deliver a research-led online learning experience.  As such, we go some way towards enhancing the student experience by keeping class sizes small and having a high level of interaction, discourse and dialogue.  We are successfully extending this model into the online space.<br/>This year, as part of the pilot initiative, we launched a postgraduate diploma in applied social studies and we will launch a further three postgraduate courses in 2015.  These courses are targeted at areas of national and international demand that align with our areas of research-led expertise and strength.  Our online course offerings will focus on the needs of the knowledge economy and lifelong learning by providing a high quality Trinity College educational experience to learners who require additional qualifications for progression in their existing career or to start a new career.  The flexibility of online education allows students to study while maintaining their existing commitments to employment, family or social life.<br/>Trinity College is committed to ensuring the online student experience matches the research-led Trinity College education based on academic rigour and built on the existing culture of scholarship, innovation and creativity, as well as an understanding of global best practice in online teaching and learning.  In brief, quality is paramount in the online learning space.  While brand recognition may allow one to attract learners in the first instance, the nature and form of the Internet means that if one makes low quality offerings, one's reputation will soon take a severe dive in the online global space.  One cannot take short cuts with quality.  To this end, we have established an online education unit and invested in experienced instructional design staff and multimedia developers.  As I indicated, we have a specific instructional design model.<br/><b></b>On massive open online courses or MOOCs, I do not have much more to offer to the comments of my colleagues on this issue.  While MOOCs have been substantially over-hyped, they have a distinctive and crucial role to play.  MOOCs are fundamentally different from formally accredited online courses.  They provide a course of study, delivered free of charge over the Internet, to a large or massive group of learners.  The learners, however, do not register as students of the institution offering the course and no formal accreditation is provided, although statements of participation and completion are commonly available.<br/>Massive open online courses offer an opportunity to universities to disseminate their research and excellence in teaching to a wide global audience.  A high-quality course raises the identity and profile of the institution and the academic staff delivering the course.  It has a positive impact on the adoption of technology enhanced learning within the institution.  MOOCs also have the potential to fulfil diverse learner needs in areas such as informal learning, unaccredited continuing professional development and the investigation of a potential area of study, and to experience the quality of teaching in a particular institution.<br/>As has been noted, Trinity College has delivered its first massive open online course, Irish Lives in War and Revolution: Exploring Ireland's History 1912-1923, on the FutureLearn platform.  Some 20,000 learners registered for the course, which was very well received by learners and generated substantial interest internationally.  From my perspective as associate dean, the course has had a significant impact in the college's school of history.  The academics involved, who may not have been the most up to speed in terms of technology enhanced learning, have not only embraced the course but are working with me on another project to gather archives of technological artefacts and develop a community of learners in Ireland in this area.<br/>Studying at university through online learning is a rapidly changing and dynamic area and we must think globally in this regard.  New players and technologies are constantly emerging.  On the other side of the equation, however, it is important to recognise that learners who come to us in higher education are e-learners before they step through the door.  We need to adapt, therefore, not only in terms of new entrants and online and informal education but also to align existing approaches to technology and learning with the new learners as they come through.  Online education in all its guises will become a normal function of a leading university.  Accordingly, online education in Trinity College is not viewed as a silo activity.  Rather, it will be embedded within the institution to provide a high-quality educational experience to a wide and diverse community of learners while ensuring the adoption of innovative technology teaching and learning across all of our courses.</p></speech>

Online learning is an exciting area.</p><p>  On current Government policy and strategies, what action should the Government take in the next year or two to assist third level institutions in achieving their objectives of developing online learning?  A number of established Irish universities have placed themselves at the cutting edge of online learning.  In what areas will online learning reduce costs for educational institutions?  Does it create challenges in terms of external competition from newer universities or international educational institutions which may have lower overheads than the established universities represented here?  While the latter have strong track records, their starting position is one of providing in-house learning.</p><p>  All the speakers noted that students arriving at university are already online learners.  I do not believe online learning is being captured in the second level education system.  As pioneers of online learning in third level institutions, I am interested in hearing the views of the witnesses on the strengths and weakness of second level education and what needs to be done at second level to make the most of the developing potential of online learning.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-03a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1042" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014120300005#F00300"><p>The witnesses are most welcome.  It is wonderful that a conversation is commencing in Parliament on the learning revolution that is taking place globally, primarily through the use of technology.  It is wonderful to have with us powerful exponents of the learning revolution in the third level sector.</p><p>  Deputy O'Brien spoke a few moments ago about being able to access research that was available on junior certificate reform, learning for assessment and other issues.  The problem, however, is that this research cannot be accessed in this room because the Wi-Fi service in this building is shamefully inadequate.  It is disappointing and challenging for Members of the Oireachtas that while we have a world of knowledge on the Internet supposedly at our fingertips, we cannot access it right now.  It would be helpful to have such access during this conversation.  The problem, which is not confined to this room but extends across the entire building, is indicative of the extreme reticence on the part of somebody in the Oireachtas organisation - I do not know who it is - about allowing Members of the national Parliament access to information in a seamless fashion.  My Wi-Fi access drops repeatedly and more often than not, I end up tethering my iPad to my phone.  I should not have to do that.  It is not rocket science and the gentlemen before us provide such access to the thousands of students who cross their portals every day.  Why can it not be done in the Oireachtas?</p><p>  One of the speakers used the phrase that the future lies somewhere between hope and hype.  I agree wholeheartedly with that view.  Much of the exciting work taking place in all of the institutions represented here can be attributed to our guests' firm belief in the power of technology to develop a whole new opportunity for learners to have a much deeper and more engaging learning experience and reach out to a whole new cohort of learners who may not otherwise have been able to engage with their institutions.</p> <p>They are the two exceptionally powerful opportunities for the future, that is to deepen and have a far more engaging, rewarding and life-long learning experience for people and to allow people who would never have had the opportunity to gain access to have that access.  <br/>Currently in Ireland, we are seeing some exciting developments in that field.  We have had Learnovate, springing out of Trinity College Dublin co-operating with Carlow Institute of Technology and An Cos&aacute;n in Tallaght, doing exceptionally valuable work in creating a virtual, online, community college.  Although it is delivering at this point in time a limited educational opportunity, because it is expensive to develop what they are developing, they have through their work, commitment and passion created a learning platform that is reaching out into seriously disadvantaged communities, not alone in this city but in Limerick, Cork and other locations.  For the first time, this is offering communities that have had no tradition whatsoever of engaging with third-level education an opportunity to learn and acquire a third-level qualification.  There is a serious cultural shift happening in those communities because of that initial engagement and we are only beginning to tap into the power of what is possible in that regard in the future.  I am very interested to hear the witnesses' comments on how we do that. <br/>Professor Mac Craith, Professor Brown and perhaps others are very familiar with the massive open online course provider, MOOC, based in Ireland, <i>alison.com</i>.  Last January, <i>Forbes </i>magazine had an interview with its founder, Mike Feerick, and described ALISON as the world's first MOOC.  It was, technically, the world's first MOOC.  We have had conversations in other fora about how we move forward and what we can learn from the ALISON success story, because it is a success story.  It is based in Ireland.  It has 4,000,000 students and 600 courses online.  It is the largest online educator on the African continent.  There are questions that have been asked not alone of ALISON but of the MOOC substructure on how one can trust the quality of what is being delivered, whether there is an assessment and, if there is, how effective it is and if it can be trusted.  However, we have a significant amount to learn from entities such as ALISON, Coursera and others who are doing this in a slightly different way, which is not the traditional academic model with which we are so familiar.  <br/>It is great to have this conversation beginning in our national Parliament, the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Professor Brown alluded to this earlier on.  However, it needs to extend not alone to third level but to post-primary and all the way down to primary level.  There is a learning revolution going on right now in Irish schools.  It is happening and not because of something we are doing in here; it is happening despite what we are doing in here.  It is happening because we have exceptionally talented and passionate trailblazing teachers who have of their own volition sought out the research and materials and, in many instances, created their own learning content and materials.  They are doing this on a daily basis.  We have to find a way of reaching out to those teachers, embracing them and learning from their experience.  There is so much that can be done.  However, we need to acknowledge that we are not doing enough and we need to develop a road map on how we make this happen, and make it happen quite quickly.  David Puttnam, last May, at an EXCITED learning festival, said we had at most three to four years to get this right or Irish children will be left behind for good. </p></speech>

I have a few questions to pick up, in a little more detail, on some of the issues others have raised.  In the opening presentation, Professor Brown said 3% is the current figure on online earning.  Does he have a breakdown of the number of those which are part-time and which are full-time courses?</p><p>  One of the biggest difficulties with part-time education in general is part-time fees.  The whole education structure is designed around people who have and can afford the time to be in college during the day.  That is a general obstacle in part-time education.  However, I have the impression that most part-time education is in-the-room education.  This cannot be just about the funding model because part-time education is, in the main, paid for by companies or by the students themselves.  There must be something more than State funding influencing this.  State funding pushes people into full-time rather than part-time education at the undergraduate end.  I am wondering what the other obstacles are apart from funding and the State funding model which I agree should be neutral as to the hours of delivery.  It should be more concerned about content and what a person is getting out of a course than the hours.  What are the other obstacles?  What is stopping colleges from providing more part-time courses online?  </p><p>  The other questions are on the scope for online learning.  I take the point Professor Savage made about not requiring all of our courses to be 100% online or 100% classroom based.  It is about changing the way we deliver education and having courses that are a blend of each.  I wonder if there is a difference in a first time undergraduate experience and a postgraduate experience.  There is something good, from a student's point of view, to being on campus.  I know from my education in Trinity and as a postgraduate student in DCU, doing the first undergraduate course, I learned more from being around the place, taking part in events and societies and things like that and from being in a learning community than from what was on the course.  There is something to having that type of undergraduate experience, particularly in the first instance.  It is different for people who are 40, 50 or 60 years of age and wish to get an educational qualification.  They might not be able to afford to be on campus.  However, I think there is something special for an 18, 19 or 20 year old student to actually be in a physical learning environment.  Is the online option seen as a better one for adult learners and is there an undergraduate-postgraduate distinction?  </p><p>  The presentation on the Open University was interesting.  It was mentioned that 30% of the undergraduates do not meet the typical higher education entry criteria.  This is very interesting because the completion rates are said to be good.  What supports are provided to ensure this is the case?  Some of the universities have expressed concern about students who get on to certain courses with low points and then struggle, for instance in science courses in some colleges.  These students struggle to keep up with the content.  There is a lot of attrition in first year in some colleges because of this.  How does the Open University manage to get students who do not have a Leaving Certificate level of education manage to support them and get them out at the other end?</p></speech>

We joined DCU together.  He rose up the ranks far faster than I to become a very fine president.  I am delighted to see him and a new colleague, Professor Mark Brown, here today.</p><p>  It is not necessary to answer this specifically, but I would like to ask the witnesses how much the universities are in debt and what is the value of their buildings.  The reason I ask this is I would like to find out if the debt in any way influences the rush into online learning development.  "Rush" is probably the wrong word.  However, in America, the debt for students is now at &euro;1 trillion.  It has become a kind of sub-prime mortgage brokerage.  We know in Ireland that AIB closed down many postgraduate fees options and doubled the interest rate on fees when students had finished.  This also happened with Bank of Ireland.  The Government, in some way, has withdrawn from aspects of postgraduate education also and left it to the universities and students to fend for themselves.  There has been a kind of feeding frenzy across the US and somewhat here in Ireland too in respect of outbuilding rivals.  We all outbuild each other physically and in doing so we do not have enough money to educate the students.  Does that have an affect?</p><p>  What are the dangers of outsourcing.  Is it happening?  What are the dangers and what studies have been done which inform how these dangers might be undermined? What are the lessons learned there?  </p><p>  What subjects and disciplines lock more into online learning than others?  Generally speaking, what disciplines of education answer online learning better than others?  Is it a race?  Is it a race to be acknowledged?  Is the Open University in competition with MOOCs?  Is there a tension? Are they in competition with each other?</p> <p>Are MOOCs new to the game?  Will the Open University be obliged to teach those involved in offering them or are the latter looking for it to learn from them?  Do these courses suit graduates or postgraduates?  Has any research been carried out in this regard?  Does online learning suit postgraduates better?  Who benefits most from online learning?  Reference was made to MOOCs being free of charge and providing courses of study to a massive group.  What is the standard of assessment which applies in respect of these courses?  How do the universities maintain qualitative standards of assessment?</p><p> Professor Brown stated that he played a key role in the establishment of the Massey University Worldwide brand.  I did some research into Massey University yesterday and discovered that it is involved in a significant partnership with the World Bank.  When I think of the World Bank, I recall the numerous countries which were obliged to sign over their water rights to it in order to pay for their loans.  Others might do so but I do not readily accept the involvement of the World Bank.  That is just an observation, however.</p><p> I have asked a number of disparate questions but they all relate to major concerns regarding the rush to online learning and whether this is being prompted by financial considerations.</p></speech>

I thank our guests for their excellent presentations.  I am aware that they all have very busy schedules and I appreciate their taking the time to attend this meeting.  I extend a special welcome to Professor Brian Mac Craith, who is a fellow native of Dundalk.  We are always proud of those who come from the town.</p><p>  I wholeheartedly agree with Deputy Cannon regarding WiFi access.  I am glad it is not just me who experiences problems with regard to such access in the Houses.  What has been the impact of the standard of WiFi access throughout the country on MOOCs?  I was still teaching up to three and a half years ago when I was elected to the Seanad and difficulties with WiFi access were a constant source of infuriation for me.  I accept that broadband services continue to be rolled out but up to three years ago, there was no Internet access in the classroom in which I taught.  I returned to college to improve my Internet skills in order that I would not be outdone by my students.  In that context, I was unbelievably restricted in terms of what I could do in the classroom as a result of the lack of WiFi access.  I fought long and hard to get one of the first interactive white boards installed in my classroom but it proved to be of no use.  We can put in place all the facilities we want but if there is no WiFi access, we cannot reach people.  What is the current position with regard to such access?  Are there hotspots throughout the country where it is possible for students to fully pursue online courses?</p><p>  What is the position with regard to teaching or training lecturers in the context of the delivery of online courses?  Is in-service training provided in order to upskill people and provide them with continuing professional development, CPD?  Our guests referred to a lack of funding.  Will they expand further on what they said in this regard?</p><p>  I understand that the majority of those who participate on MOOCs are already well educated and live in developed countries.  That is significant, particularly in the context of what can be done to reach other to others.  Will our guests comment on the drop-out rate, which, according to the report, remains quite high?  What can be done to reduce this rate?</p><p>  I find it fascinating that DCU is providing a graduate business degree in partnership with Princess Nora Bint Abdul Rahman University in Saudi Arabia.  Will Professor MacCraith expand on what the relevant course involves?  I am also interested in the proposed partnership with the Khan Academy with a view to enhancing first-year student success in the area of mathematics.  I was involved in launching an excellent report on mathematics in DCU and I am of the view that the proposed partnership could be very good for students.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-03a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1196" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014120300007#H00300"><p>I also thank our guests for attending.  I am the product of a distance learning programme but, unfortunately, we did not have access to ICT when I was pursuing my studies.  I engaged with WebCT in 1998 and moved on to Moodle in more recent years.</p><p>  There are two issues in which I am interested.  Reference was made to blended learning.  I am of the view that e-learning and online learning are no substitutes for blended learning.  In the context of the postgraduate versus undergraduate debate, it has been my experience - from attending various conferences - that the e-learning model fits very well into the postgraduate scenario.  With regard to undergraduates, I refer to a study undertaken at a certain institute of technology - its location is of no real importance - whereby a lecturer embraced online learning to the ultimate.  Whether it was video, audio or PowerPoint, you name it and he had it on his system.  He ran two trials.  The first was the placebo, so to speak, whereby the students involved had no access to the online learning programme and the second involved students having full access.  The trials ran over two years and the lecturer noticed that the curves relating to both groups were exactly the same.  He called in those from the group exposed to e-learning who had performed very badly and asked them to explain how this had happened in light of the level of resources available to them.  Their reply was that they knew the information was available online and, therefore, they did not see the need to attend lectures.  They then put off engaging with the programme.  This fits with the scenario relating to attrition rates, a matter which is of some concern to me.</p><p>  How do our guests measure and assure quality?  I am also interested in how they deal with the issue of intellectual property rights in the context of their ICT developers.  I am not sure how the august institutions represented here deal with such developers but it has generally been my experience that e-learning and other forms of ICT-based learning have come into being as a result of the goodwill and good work of the academic staff involved.  These types of learning have developed organically and, as a result, no clear plan has been put in place.  We are now in a position whereby lecturers are devoting significant time to developing online content.  How are the institutions funding this?  Do they have teams in place to develop and maintain the relevant software?  I agree with what has already been stated in respect of CPD.</p><p>  I understand that there has been something of a cooling off in the US with regard to MOOCs.  Professor Brown indicated that online learning is not a panacea, that we are undergoing an evolution in the context of teaching and learning and that when we emerge from this process, ICT will be just another aspect of the overall picture.</p><p>  I become disturbed when people refer to the markets in the context of discussions relating to education.  Are we looking at the development of online content and the delivery of overseas programmes as a sort of "try-it-and-see" approach to attracting funding from abroad?  It is clear that the London School of Economics and the Open University have tremendous track records in delivering programmes across the globe and I am sure they have made quite a lot of money from doing so.  I do not intend this as a criticism and third level institutions should, by all means, be in a position to make money.  Does that which we are discussing represent an opportunity for Ireland?  I am not being critical, I just want to establish whether such an opportunity exists.</p></speech>

Does Professor Savage wish to commence the process of providing answers to them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-03a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Timothy Savage" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014120300007#H00500"><p>I thank members for the range of very sharp questions they have put to us.  I am not really too sure where to start but I suppose I will do so by referring to some of the more specific operational aspects.  Reference was made to the undergraduate versus postgraduate aspect and Senator Craughwell asked about how the model develops.</p> <p>We in Trinity College made a clear strategic decision.  The answer that I will give encompasses a great deal of what we do.  In order that our internal standards ensure the quality of the online education that we provide, we had to take the strategic decision that it would be handled by a centralised unit.  We have developed a strong instructional design mode, employing instructional designers and multimedia developers to ensure that it has been done to the highest possible quality.  It is not just a question of the content, but also of the design of the interaction, activities, support and training as part of continuing professional development, CPD, and working with lecturers to ensure that they know how to run video conferences, moderate online discussions effectively and interact in an online space, which is fundamentally different from face-to-face teaching.</p><p> We have developed a range of teaching courses through which our lecturers are required to go.  We find that this approach also means that lecturers are working with our instructional design teams.  We are taking their expertise and translating it into an online paradigm.  We are not making them re-invent the wheel.  It is a focused, strategic approach that is primarily concerned with supporting the academics in making the transition, training them and ensuring quality and standards.</p><p> The issue of quality and standards arose in a number of other questions.  There are no recognised qualities and standards for online education.  All of our formal courses go through the standard course approval process within Trinity College.  We have adapted it slightly, but they still go through the graduate studies committee, the university council and external review.  They hit exactly the same quality bars as our internal courses.  This is important.  We are determining how to develop quality standards.  Getting the quality right addresses issues of retention and damaging the brand.  One of the first things I was told in my post was to do no harm.  We put ourselves out on the global stage when we leave the campus.  This is how we deal with quality internally.</p><p> The question on undergraduate versus postgraduate links into the questions on funding.  For the next five years, we will focus primarily on postgraduate and CPD courses.  There is a range of rationales for this decision, one of the most important being the global context.  An Information Age society requires the constant upskilling of professionals who can leverage the opportunity that online education provides.  They cannot afford a year out to do advance degrees.  We have a specific target market - postgraduates in their 30s or 40s who have multiple commitments, are highly motivated and do not necessarily need the undergraduate experience, which can be seen as more formative, as Senator Power alluded.</p><p> In the medium to long-term, though, we view this as a broader transition towards flexible or hybridised and blended learning pathways.  An undergraduate degree student might start doing one year on campus before taking some time off to do online courses.  We are entering that space at postgraduate level, but we expect it all to start merging in the medium term to allow for these progression pathways for learners regardless of their levels and backgrounds and to focus on their needs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-03a.26" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Brian MacCraith" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014120300008#J00200"><p>I thank colleagues for all their good wishes.  I will address the issues as they were raised.  Deputy McConalogue asked what we would recommend.  First, there is still no national strategy for digital learning.  Whatever way one views it, it is one of the largest evolutions in education globally, as every major country recognises.  A digital schools strategy is in preparation.  We must await its outcome, but the fact that it is digital schools only tells one that it does not consider the full continuum.  Given the nature of Irish society, our commitment to education and the presence in this country of all of the world's major digital players, Ireland has a unique opportunity to do something special in this regard.</p><p>  Second, the Deputy correctly raised the issue of the teacher.  In this new digital learning world, the nature of the educator has changed dramatically.  We must examine this matter across the education continuum.  It is different at primary, secondary and third levels, although there are common issues.  We must assist teachers to move into the new digital world, where the motivation is not finance, but enhancing the learning experience.  The majority of DCU's new students are so-called digital natives or the Google generation.  No student who entered first year this year has ever known a life without Google.  It changes the way one accesses information, assesses its quality and distils it.  All of the qualities one tries to impart to students changes in that world.  As such, we are adjusting how we educate to recognise the new reality of younger people and the world in which they live.  We must assist the teachers in this regard.  DCU has been running programmes to educate our teachers to teach and assess in this new world.  There has been a large voluntary take-up of the programmes.  The prize is student engagement.  It means that what happens in the classroom becomes a much richer engagement.  To address Senator Craughwell's comment, if what happens in the classroom is the repetition of the content that students can already get online, they will vote with their feet, and correctly so.  However, what is actually happening is the concept of the flipped classroom.  What happens in the classroom or lecture hall at any level can be much richer because a great deal of information transfer can happen on digital platforms.  This is important.</p><p>  CPD for teachers at all levels - early childhood, primary, secondary and tertiary - is crucial for the enhancement of our education system.  Members may know that DCU is working with St. Patrick's College in Drumcondra, the Mater Dei Institute of Education and the Church of Ireland College of Education to create a major new institute of education that will, for the first time, educate teachers at all levels in one location.  An essential part of this will be the National Institute for Digital Learning so that all teachers can get exposure to the cutting edge of knowledge in this space and, therefore, transform the system.</p><p>  Some questions were asked about costs.  The notion that online learning in the mainstream system would be cost reducing is a fallacy.  Doing this properly actually takes a significant investment.  The prize is enhancement of the student learning experience and engagement.</p><p>  Deputy Cannon referred to some of the affordances that go with digital learning, for example, flexible access and skills transfer.  Mike Feerick's ALISON has been a major success worldwide, but it is not really about higher education.  Rather, it is primarily about upskilling, reskilling, flexible access to learning and the democratisation of learning.  While one cannot achieve in a blended situation the quality of a face-to-face education that one might want, one can still deliver high-quality education through online platforms.  This is happening in sub-Saharan Africa and India.  It is important where the growth in population is faster than the time it takes to build schools and universities.  The affordability that one exploits or uses will vary from situation to situation, but it remains important.</p><p>  I have many more answers, but I will let my colleagues address some of the other questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-03a.27" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John D'Arcy" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014120300008#J00300"><p>I thank members for their questions, which were focused and sharp.  I will address Senator Power's issue on open access.  Open University has always been an open access provider.  That was its mandate when it was set up by Harold Wilson's Labour Government in the late 1960s.  One of the reasons we are comfortable with this is that our higher education entrant differs from Professor MacCraith and others'.  The average age of an Open University student in Ireland is approximately 30 years.  These students want to enter higher education for a particular reason.  They are motivated to learn.  We also have excellent staff at Holles Street who will advise on people's suitability for specific courses.  If we believe that someone needs additional help before starting a higher level course, we will refer him or her to other providers or some of our free learning.  I liked Senator Craughwell's phrase "try it and see".  We find that approach to be helpful for people who want to get a sense of whether they are ready for higher education with Open University.  Quite often, we recommend one of our OpenLearn programmes or massive open online courses, MOOCs, so that people can get a feel for what might be expected of them on a learning journey with us.</p><p>  Our success rate with Republic of Ireland students is our highest globally.  One of the reasons is that they pay high fees.  We do not have the level of teaching grant support in the Republic that we have in Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales.  England has a different system for funding part-time higher education, under which our students take out loans.  That is a barrier in itself.</p> <p>The people coming through our doors to sign up for a course are highly motivated and have invested in a university course.  It is one of the reasons they are the highest performing across our demographic.  </p><p> The figure of 22% is for FutureLearn courses.  The success and completion rates for traditional degree programmes are much higher.  </p><p> Some members asked how we encouraged secondary learners and others into higher education through the use of open resources.  We take a multichannel approach, a lot of which is based on our formative experience with the BBC.  We use the BBC for programmes such as "Life Story" with Sir David Attenborourgh, which encourages people to think about science.  At the end of the programme there is always a call to action, which could be through a free poster or free learning, that will make a percentage of viewers sit forward on their sofas and think about taking a course.  </p><p> "Frozen Planet" delivered 600 new undergraduate students across the United Kingdom and Ireland to us.  In EU terms, 600 students is a not a large figure, but it is a significant number to enrol for a science course.  We use such programmes to entice people in and in the past few years we have used resources such as YouTube.  Ours is the largest European university channel on YouTube.  Professor Mac Craith referred to the "Google generation"; there is also the "YouTube generation".  The most frequent searches on YouTube involve requests on how to do something.  People are learning how to fit plugs and do scientific things.  We are using it as a wraparound.</p><p> For engagement, we use Twitter and Facebook.  When we get people through to OpenLearn, which is free, about 12% of those taking such courses will click through to our mainstream site.  It is a very high figure in terms of those who are thinking about taking a particular course.  A lot of this is tied with our mission.  Ours is a charitable university; therefore, whatever we gain we plough back into our learning materials.  That is why we can afford to share so much free material.  We have a lot of material on Google Play and iTunes University is very populated - we have had 64 million downloads since it started.</p><p> It is not all motherhood and apple pie; we do things for a reason.  We want to get people into higher education, which is part of the mission for which we were set up.  Our mission is to empower people who would not normally have a chance to engage in higher education.  </p><p> We do not have comments on the funding system because we are not funded by the State.  We have done some work with Springboard and do some work within the prison sector, but we operate in the private college sector.  Having said that, 2,500 citizens choose to come our way and we think that is because of the support we give.  In Northern Ireland a national student survey has shown that ours has been the most popular university in terms of student satisfaction for ten years on the trot.  In England I understand it is the fifth most popular choice.  We are generally in the same position as Oxford and Cambridge universities.</p><p> As my colleagues said, online learning is not about pressing buttons; rather, it is about the people behind it who provide support.  We have a fantastic body of associate lecturers across the island, from County Kerry to County Derry, who are available to help people to reach their study goals.</p></speech>

We own FutureLearn, into which we moved because the Open University was a disruptive force in 1969 in terms of how we approached higher education.  The MOOC caused disruption.  I agree with Mr. Brown that the Internet is a disruptive force.  We considered we needed to be part of it, but we also believed we could bring to the space the quality and learning experience we had developed over 40 or 45 years in the distance learning sector.  A lot of the other MOOC providers are not necessarily involved in that sector.  It is a very different experience for learners and tutors.  We are very supportive of the MOOC because it works for us, but I am not so sure it will be in existence in five years time.  There will be a different form of online learning and if we are not there, we will do our communities a disservice.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-03a.32" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Mark Brown" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014120300009#K00500"><p>There has been a comprehensive range of questions and it will be difficult to cover all of them.  I will start with an issue we all believe to be important, namely, quality.  </p><p>  New Zealand developed national guidelines for the quality of online delivery, something we do not have under way at this point.  I chair the international council for open and distance learning, the peak professional body.  I chair a group which is reviewing international quality standards, frameworks and guidelines and it is to be hoped something will come out of this work which will be published within the next two months.</p><p>  On the question of data and the percentage of students officially studying at a distance or on a part-time basis, it is a murky one to which to give a clear answer.  The data are not particularly trustworthy.  The network I established in Ireland knows of a number of programmes being delivered in flexible ways which I would classify as distance learning, but I am sure they are not being captured at this time.</p><p>  To try to break down some of the figures, of those students who are studying part-time in Ireland, in the third level sector at large, the level is around 16%.  Of these, 95% are considered to be mature learners.  The figures tell us a little about who is being attracted to more flexible forms of study.  By contrast, in New Zealand over 50% are part-time learners.  The funding model has something do with this, but the issue is complex.  The ability of part-time, flexible, mature learners to fund their study is an issue and there are contrasts in the ways in which Ireland and New Zealand have approached the issue.  </p><p>  A question was asked about costs.  In our assessment of the MOOC initiatives we are working within the European framework because there is some funding available to assist us.  We must also consider opportunity costs.  We are operating in a very tight financial environment and have to be very strategic about where we place our efforts.  At this point, we are focusing our efforts on collaborative programmes which offer genuine benefits that link with our mission in transforming lives and societies such as biomedical diagnostics and working in Africa.</p><p>  Ultimately, the question is who benefits, in respect of which I see the cost and the other side.  Ireland, as a nation, benefits.  There are public and private benefits for higher education and they are conclusive in terms of the research conducted.  We have to understand the people who are studying in Trinity College Dublin or through the Open University on a part-time basis, in particular, those undertaking postgraduate programmes, are usually pursuing on-the-job professional development.  It has an impact on productivity, whether the work is paid or unpaid, and has the ability to contribute to society.  We also know that well educated people contribute more actively to society, have fewer health issues and cost society less.  This is an investment and funding is crucial.</p><p>  I have to return to the point on completions because it is one of the elephants in the room in regard to online learning.  Completion rates are not good internationally and the MOOC quotes some of the figures.  If we are celebrating a completion rate of 20% or 22%, we are not close to the targets.  Completion rates for those in formal programmes are another problem.  Through the efforts of the national forum for the enhancement of teaching and learning and in terms of the first round fund for building digital capacity, this year we have a project to the tune of approximately &euro;250,000 to develop a flexible readiness toolbox to help to address the retention problem.  </p><p>  My opening comments were not anti-MOOC, but the data for completion rates in the MOOC are unclear.  Clicking on a website is one thing but taking the next step is different.  I shared figures from the University of London, which is involved in Coursera.  There are four courses offered through the MOOC and of 212,000 students, 35 have continued.  It may be an effective marketing strategy per student, but it is not be what we would do.  There are better ways to use our funding.</p> <p> On the question of what do we do, ultimately for me, that is the most important question which has been asked today and the value of this forum.  There is a need for a more equitable fee model to enable all students to have the opportunity to benefit from higher education.  We need also to address the issue, based on my experience down under, of what is termed infrastructure that in many cases is not "up to it".  The challenge in this room was mentioned by way of example.  In the university sector the only place in which I have real confidence is Dublin City University, DCU.  We need infrastructure to meet our ambitions.  It is extremely challenging to do what we are tying to do without that infrastructure.  </p><p> To be really proactive, as I said, we will need to play a key role on the national stage in the area of online digital learning.  Ireland, similar to new Zealand, actually plays a role as a very good global citizen in contributing to the deep-seated issues the world faces in that it is able to offer a unique Irish perspective to places that desperately need higher education services.  We should not go about playing that role by dumping a western curriculum on the developing world; rather, similar to what is being done in Saudi Arabia, we should put in place a fund to support that international development relationship work around online learning.  </p><p> I will end by reiterating my opening point.  There would be a benefit for us in having some common guidelines and language to help us to understand what quality looks like in this space.</p></speech>

Is the cost of doing so absorbed into the general costs of the college or is it an additional cost?  My understanding is that a fee applies to certification of Massive Open Online Courses, MOOC.  Does this generate much income?</p><p>  On Professor Brown's point about changing the funding model, I am concerned that changing the funding model in the way described would result in the loss of money to undergraduates.  A large proportion of those who engage in online education courses are already educated to undergraduate level.  As such, they will have received their subsidy from the State.  It would not be very fair to take money from such individuals if it meant undergraduates would also lose out.  I am concerned about the implications of the change proposed.  </p><p>  Is there any collaboration with the organisations represented today and the institutes of technology in this area?  I have a further question about the funding model.  Professor Savage has said postgraduates form a large part of those who engage in online education programmes.  What will online education do for people who, say, have not even completed second level education?</p></speech>

We had to prioritise this issue because it was about enhancing the learning experience for students.  </p><p>  In terms of the infrastructure needed, we have had to take out a loan for what is called the "digital campus" project.  We are completely replacing the IT infrastructure of the university across two campuses, making it fit for purpose, not only for a modern organisation but, most importantly, also in an environment of learning which will be increasingly blended.</p><p>  On the issue of fees, under the current funding model for undergraduates, a student only receives funding once.  This does not apply to those undertaking an online programme.  That is the difference to which Professor Brown was referring.  In other words, where a person decides to take an undergraduate degree programme online, there is no fee payment in that regard.</p></speech>

If a decision was made to provide money for online undergraduate programmes, would it result in money being taken from other undergraduates?  My question is that in changing the funding model to provide for those taking online education courses would we be taking funding from somewhere else?</p></speech>

It would have to be additional funding.  There would be equity in making it additional, recognising the changing nature of society and the need for flexible access to education.  The ultimate issue concerns blended learning.</p><p>  On Senator Averil Power's question, "blended" means a customised combination of face-to-face and online education.  It is not a one size fits all option.  For the undergraduate, the learning experience has to be predominantly on campus.  However, as one moves along the experience and, frequently, the age spectrum but not exclusively so, the nature of blended learning changes.  One will find many individuals, particularly in the case of CPD, choosing to engage fully online.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-03a.38" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Timothy Savage" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014120300010#L00600"><p>I would also like to comment on the same issues.  </p><p>  On funding the initiative within Trinity College Dublin, we are coming to the end of our two year pilot programme, for which we had to find the money internally.  This reverts to questions raised by Deputies and Senators about cost.  This is not a cheap option.  Done properly, with interaction and high quality content to provide a good educational experience for online or blended learners, it will not save anyone money; rather, it will be costly.  We are not looking to make a profit; rather, we are striving to be viable, grow our postgraduate numbers and access new students, to whom we can provide for good participation in this type of education programme at postgraduate level.  However, it must be viable for us to do so.  We put the money up-front to cover the cost of production.</p><p>  In regard to MOOC costs, we have received a small amount from the statements on participation and completion.  However, we still have not received our moneys from the Open University, but we do not expect them to be substantial.  </p><p>  On foundation courses and access for those who have not had an undergraduate education, we see this very much as a broad initiative, both on campus and working closely with the Trinity access programme and the postgraduate certificate process in STEM education which is being run in conjunction with the Bridge21 initiative in Trinity College Dublin.  We are trying to develop new models of technology enhanced learning in STEM subjects with secondary and primary school teachers through the school sector, as well as providing clear pathways.</p><p>  I have had discussions about the potential of online education programmes to provide pre-foundation and foundation courses for those who want to attend Trinity College Dublin.  It is an issue on my agenda, although a little down the line.  In the first instance, we have to get up and running.  We need to get our models in place before looking at where the additional opportunities lie.</p></speech>

This compared with a figure of 56% for those who were accessing our website earlier.  This was being pushed down somewhat because they were obtaining a degree of accreditation from us.  There is a sense that this can be marketed to those who do not have a university education.  The Futurelearn figures are much higher.  Those concerned are generally well educated.  We are getting to some of these learners in our social missions through the new badged open courses, but there is work still to be done in that regard.  Interestingly - this was a surprising figure - 31% of those accessing the badged open courses had a disability, which is a much higher percentage than for those taking some of our additional routes.  As stated by Professor Savage, the revenue coming through in terms of certificates of participation and assessment is very low, particular in the case of Futurelearn.  Some of the other providers have probably being doing it for a year or so.  A certificate of participation will bring in revenue in the case of Futurelearn of approximately &pound;29 sterling per person, which is not huge.  The number going down that route is not very extensive.  Revenue is not in a specific space.</p></speech>

The model requires funding be front-loaded because the content must be completed before a student registers.  This means that one has to start at least one year in advance and invest funds up-front before any income is received.</p> <p>One needs to prime the pump for all the courses.  One cannot just leave the existing courses online.  They have a certain lifespan and some course content must be renewed while demand for other courses will peter out.  Trinity College is discussing developing three or four new courses every year over the next five years.  There is constant re-investment.  Any funds generated from student fees will be ploughed back in.</p></speech>

With our colleagues in Dundalk Institute of Technology and NUI Maynooth, we have particularly focused on investing in technology in lecture rooms whereby one can capture and broadcast lectures in real time or store them and pass them on.  This allows us to avoid duplication and get more efficiency from the system.  Students in one location can take lecture courses in real time from many other locations in the cluster, and this is an important development.</p><p>  An important point that was not made is the vast array of open educational resources, OERs, particularly the Khan Academy, which is being piloted in Ireland.  One of the major challenge for students, especially regarding retention, is mathematics.  This is applicable at primary, secondary and third level, as Deputy Cannon is very aware.  It comprises freely available, ten-minute videos dealing with all the concepts of mathematics from 1+1 up to complex calculus.  We are mapping those resources onto the primary school and junior cycle curricula as a resource for teachers, parents and students, and because it is a social enterprise, it is all free.  The space of open educational resources, properly mediated to teachers across all levels, will be a major advantage in this broader digital learning space.</p></speech>

I am delighted we have not got computers in front of us here because we can pay attention with our ears and meet people who are passionate about what they are doing.  It is very important that computers do not take over completely and that we are not always looking at them and tapping away.  I am a great believer in the human voice and ear and human interaction, and it is important the witnesses are here.  My background is in the arts and literature.  Which subjects are more conducive to online learning?  Is there more take up of post-graduate online learning in certain areas in the experience of the witnesses?</p></speech>

Arts is a very high performing area for us in Ireland.  One of the first e-books we had on the Apple iTunes store was about Schubert's Lieder.  It brought the high musical art to life because students could flick a page and click on an audio file, and the music jumped out at them.  Because students could follow the score, it was almost like karaoke.</p></speech>

While much investment is done at the beginning to generate our books, they can really excite learners.  Tablet devices are becoming much cheaper.  We had a lot of content on Apple iTunes, but realised there was a barrier because students had to buy an iPad.  We have transferred all the material to Google Play, making it very accessible.</p></speech>

Does he see this as something the academic world should work on or which the Government should lay down?  He also mentioned the infrastructure around the country.  During my time with the London School of Economics, we delivered programmes in places such as Cavan and north Mayo by holding weekend top ups.  Recently, a television programme featured a progressive young farmer who wanted to study animal husbandry over the Internet, but the broadband was not good enough to support it.  Is the infrastructure in the country limiting the scope of developing online learning platforms?</p><p>  I have worked with some development programmes in Trinity College over the years and I know the system is very good.  However, I return to the core content, the academic staff and their time.  Developing the programme and putting the core content online is one thing; supporting the learners is another.  In my own time, I remember learners raising questions with me on Christmas Day.  God help them, they had little to do.  Could Professor Savage comment on this?</p><p>  Professor MacCraith mentioned the clusters, and I have a major interest in this, given the development of technological universities and academic clusters or centres of excellence.  Professor MacCraith mentioned co-operation with DkIT and NUI Maynooth, and that it will be possible to deliver a lecture in DCU and transmit it to both those centres.  This raises the fact that the lecturer is delivering three lectures for the price of one, while the colleges are charging for three.  I am not sure how it is costed and funded, not that I would dream of bringing my trade union credentials in here.</p></speech>

The importance of building the capabilities and capacities of our teachers has already been acknowledged.  This needs to be driven from within the profession.  It is a common framework or language we can use in a constructive, positive way and the process is probably just as important as the outcome.  Given that the field of online learning is very dynamic, we must be very careful not to lock ourselves in in a rigid way.</p><p>  I have made a very strong case on infrastructure, drawing from experience in a small country very similar to Ireland which I thought was lacking in infrastructure.  We are being filmed today.  It is a challenge at DCU to scale that up on an enterprise-wide basis for our entire campuses.  We aspire to provide our students with rich media learning, not lecture capture, as some have done, because that is just taking an old technology and using it to continue old-fashioned ways.  Our investment aims to have all our staff easily able to record brief videos at their desktops to add a personal touch for students, whether campus based or distance.  The literature tells us that teacher presence is crucial and in the online world we can feel very connected.  DCU has introduced the brand DCU Connected to describe our flexible offerings and we see it as a metaphor.</p><p>  The last kilometre or mile is an issue because much of the argument to invest in this is to serve those who are not accessing universities.  Whether they are undergraduate or postgraduate students, and putting the fee issue to one side, part of the reason for this is to give people in the regions the opportunity to take advantage of being connected.  This is a worldwide problem.  Small regions in the western world are suffering.</p></speech>

What is happening here is that the same number of staff is delivering the same number of modules, but it just means the menu of offerings for a student in any given location becomes broader.  It is about the range of electives.  This is one of the affordances of digital technology.  The cost model is not very different - it is the same number of students and so on - but all of this must be focused on the student learning experience.  Having an expert in College X and student in University Y and being able to access that is very significant and one of the benefits of this technology.</p></speech>

The strength of digital technology is discipline-agnostic.  It comes down to the creativity of the educator and the learner.  If I could promote a university that is not represented here, just to show our ecumenical approach, UCD developed an outstanding model last year around James Joyce's "The Dead", which captured spoken voice, music, video, archives and one just saw on an app the strength of digital technologies to impart something so exciting.  We are developing a new module for secondary schools around the contested histories from 1910 to 1922, the North and South perspectives, right through to 1916.  It is remarkable what one can draw on for that to engage students.  It is a completely new learning experience.  It straddles the arts and the humanities, right across all the disciplines.</p></speech>

He is the principal of a national school in the south east where all the children from day 1, junior infants, use iPads.  About a week before they began to study the Irish Famine, he told them they were about to study an area they had never studied before.  He asked them to make a three minute video on the Irish Famine for the next week and put it up on Youtube.  These third class pupils had the skills to do this and he saw all the videos and the various interpretations the following week.  They had all gone and researched this - they had pulled content from Youtube, Wikipedia and other locations, and created their own three minute film on the Irish Famine.  The engagement, discussion and debate those third class children had about the Famine was so much enhanced and enriched by their own research preceding that intervention.  At the end of that class, the teacher said, it dawned upon him that he was no longer teaching history, he was developing historians.  That is the subtlety and power of what is possible when one uses technology properly in a classroom.  Following on from the resources Professor Mac Craith and others are making available, that is what is possible if we get this right in the future.</p></speech>

As I outlined earlier, when I was talking about the design process, and as the committee is hopefully getting from our shared view, it is about interactions and quality of the experience.  Only about half of that is content.  We train the lecturing staff in online interaction - how to moderate discussion boards and work with online interactions in a whole-class video conference.  In every one of our courses, every week, there is a whole-class video conference.  This is not for the delivery of a lecture - that is already done with media-rich content - but to run a seminar-style engagement.  This is where the students interact with their peers and with the teaching staff.  Not only that, but we must provide technical support staff for those live sessions.  If there is a student whose technology is not working, they contact, through a back channel, our technical support person, rather than having to disrupt the lecturer and rather than the lecturer having to become an IT support person as well.  There is, therefore, training beforehand, support during that, and we are also developing reflection afterwards, where the staff start to develop their own practice.  This is very important to us because this is a cascade model.  We have started to see these academics going back to other courses - traditional on-campus courses - and starting, for example, to use the online discussion boards for development of critical thinking as they now know how to moderate them.  It is very much part of blending in the online aspect to enhance all of our educational experience in college.</p></speech>

I have seen people become so engrossed in it that it has almost led to divorce or the breakdown of relationships - "Go away, dear, I've got to actually engage with my students here."</p></speech>

I have had a phone call on a Saturday evening about web design a few years ago from two of my students.</p></speech>

We provide a quality contract with the online students, because it is different from face-to-face.  If they submit an email, the lecturer commits to replying to it within four working days, whereas one would not normally get those guarantees on the face-to-face campus, and the same is true of the number of views on the discussion boards.  It is a very different paradigm, there are very different needs and we train and support staff to fulfil those.</p></speech>

It must be a rich learning experience and, to take Senator Craughwell's point, it puts much greater pressure on the educator in every sense.  That must be recognised and that is why continuing professional development, CPD, is so important.</p></speech>

What was the reaction to that?  Did lecturers embrace that change and the additional time they had to spend?  Did the witnesses find there was a great willingness to do that?</p></speech>

Part of my job is engagement across the whole college about online education and I was expecting there to be a great deal of pushback, but I found - surprisingly, according to the literature that states that faculty will not like this approach - that there is a general recognition that to be a global university they must do this. They might not know how, so they want me and others to come and tell them how, but they know it needs to be done.  On a micro level, we did brief the people I work with who are currently delivering.  We told them it would take a bit more time.  Through the first three or four weeks of delivering their first course, they found it very overwhelming and we gave them a great deal of support, but now we are finding we can fade from the support role because it is now becoming a normal part of the practice.  I know there are many educators on this committee.  If they remember the first few times they were in front of a class, it took a great deal of time and energy, but after a while one develops one's practice and it smooths over.  Support is certainly crucial in that.</p></speech>

The old model where we would be preaching to the converted and the same old people would come along to sessions, will not get us to where we need to go.  A much more strategic approach is to couple professional learning with the developments we are making at a programme level, so that as we are choosing key programmes we want to take, whether it be with Arizona State or something for a more blended delivery, we are working with the whole group of staff, not individuals.  It is also important that there is a collective whole which is driven by the graduate profiles - what we say about the students we want to produce - and that we map back down there to each of the individual models, so that we have a comprehensive whole for them.  Simply working with individual modules and teachers will not get us where we need to go.</p></speech>

We earn roughly &euro;1 billion a year from international students coming to study, work and live with us.</p> <p>Both Trinity College and DCU have been exceptionally successful in marketing Ireland abroad as a wonderful destination for education.</p><p> Yesterday, Estonia allowed international businesses to base themselves on a cloud basis in Estonia.  They could become e-residents of Estonia in a matter of 24 hours and essentially have a base in the cloud that is aligned with Estonia as a state.  What it is doing is very innovative and creative.  Is there any opportunity in the future for us to create an Ireland MOOC or e-learning platform where all of the witnesses, given the exciting things they are doing, could plug their provision into that single portal?  Therefore, if I am a student in Malaysia, Singapore or wherever, I will know that this is where I can go to access high quality online learning, because it is coming from Ireland and is perhaps marked under the education in Ireland brand through Enterprise Ireland.  Perhaps a student might do their first two or three years through this portal and finally arrive in Ireland for the last year or even their postgraduate education.  Is there an opportunity for that type of collaboration to happen in the future?  Do the witnesses believe we should we do it, and how might we go about it?</p></speech>

There are three things happening in this space already.  Uversity has been set up.  It is a common platform looking at education in the arts, particularly the performing arts, and creativity.  It is a collective to which all universities, North and South, have signed up, as well as almost all of the institutes of technology and a number of other colleges.  That concept is there already and people have bought into it.  Brand Ireland is the thing.</p><p>  Second, the Deputy might have seen a report in the newspapers, which was not described or reported very accurately, that Tata Consultancy Services, one of the world's global companies, visited us last week and talked to the universities and other colleges about this concept.  It is not fully defined yet, but there might well be a market there.  That is in play.</p><p>  Third, Lord David Puttnam has said to us a number of times that one could use almost a taster set of modules for Irish universities and colleges in the international space, so that when a student in China, India, Indonesia or Malaysia is making a decision perhaps the first year could be an engagement online.  We would get a sense of the student and the student gets a sense of Ireland.  That could be an important dimension, which is a type of hybrid approach to this.  A number of us are exploring that option at present.</p></speech>

I am not resistant to it.  It is highly creative and imaginative and it is something we must do.  I agree with everything Deputy Cannon and all the participants said about this.  However, in doing this we must always uphold the arts within it.  We have decimated them in primary and secondary schools and at third level.  They are integrated subjects, not independent subjects.  We give points for mathematics but not for music.  They are equally important.  The development of online learning must consider the arts to be paramount in how they progress as well.  It does not only apply to subjects such as physics, mathematics and biotechnology.  That would be my wish.  It is also my wish that the arts be reinstated for what they are on secondary and primary school curricula.  It happens in the universities anyway because there are student societies.  They also have music, drama and dance departments.  However, somehow in the secondary schools they have ceased to be the most important educators, which I believe they are, along with all the other learning.  The marrying of that is terribly important for the future.</p></speech>

That is a huge issue.  When the leaving certificate examination in music changed in 1999 music technology was introduced.  Music was one of the first subjects in which we could use technology for the leaving certificate.  Basically, it must be said that the music technology on the leaving certificate curriculum at present is just copy and paste.  It has no bearing on music at all.  I studied it in conjunction with what is happening in the North.  There are nine miles between Dundalk and Newry but there is a difference in the music education there.  It allows pupils the scope to do exactly what we want to do with education, which is to give them the opportunity to be able to develop their minds and produce what they want, rather than the regurgitated rote learning here.  That is an area where we are talking about digital learning, promoting Schubert's lieder and so forth, which is brilliant.  However, let us bring that back down even into second level schooling and do it there.  There is huge scope.  The students are actually far more capable of doing it than adults are, and some of the music based digital programmes that are available are fantastic.</p></speech>

My perspective is still quite fresh, so my apologies if I am not quite accurate in the interpretation of what I am seeing.  Hopefully, my accent has not been difficult to follow.  A little known fact about New Zealand, and it is distasteful for me to use these words, is that export education is the third largest income earner for the country.  It is a huge, multi-billion dollar activity.  It must be done with real purpose and mission.  Hopefully, the sense of mission has come through from what DCU is involved in.  There are distinct and definite opportunities for us.  The challenge will be how we do it as a sector working collaboratively.  In DCU's case, we have activities under way with global partners, so it is quite complex to be able to uncouple those and sometimes they might get in the way.  However, there are certainly more opportunities for working collaboratively to present the brand Ireland.</p></speech>

Online learning is here and it is not going away.  I suspect that 15 years hence we will not use the term "e-learning" anymore, it will just be learning.  Similarly, we no longer talk about projector-based learning or chalk board based learning.  What we must do, however, is have a strategic approach.  We must be cautious and reasoned, and we must focus on the quality of the higher education.  It is one of the things for which Ireland is known and we must protect that, but we must engage for the sake of our learners.</p></speech>

The Bill will address concerns surrounding the continued applicability of the Central Bank's codes and access for borrowers to the Financial Services Ombudsman after loan books are sold to unregulated entities.  The proposed legislation provides that borrowers will have the same protections under the Central Bank codes, such as the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA, as they had before their loan was sold.</p><p>  Where the purchaser of a loan book is not a regulated entity in Ireland, the purchaser may voluntarily apply the Central Bank codes when managing loan books.  Voluntary compliance is not enforceable and the Government committed in March 2014 to ensuring the same protections would be made available for all consumers whose loans have been sold.  The mission of the Government in bringing forward this legislation is straightforward, namely, to ensure that borrowers whose loans are sold by a regulated entity to a currently unregulated entity maintain the same regulatory protections as they had prior to the sale, including under various Central Bank codes.  To achieve this objective it is apparent that certain changes to the existing legislative and regulatory regime are required.</p><p>  Unregulated financial institutions are not bound by any of the Central Bank codes.  While customers of unregulated financial institutions have access to the courts, they do not have access to the Financial Services Ombudsman.  It is generally accepted that consumers need protection when they are taking out credit, during the course of holding credit and when they are repaying credit.  It is not equitable that some of these protections can be avoided due to the regulatory position of the entity which owns the credit.  For this reason, consumers should maintain the protections they had before their loan was sold.  This is what the proposed legislation seeks to achieve. </p><p>  In July and August last, the Department of Finance ran a public consultation seeking views on this proposed legislation.  Nineteen submissions were received from a range of respondents, including the financial services industry, consumer groups, public representatives, individuals and other stakeholders.  We subsequently met some stakeholders to clarify submissions and the technicalities of how the credit servicing industry operates.  We also discussed the issue with the authorities in the United Kingdom as they had faced similar policy challenges in recent times.  Officials in the Department of Finance have carefully considered the submissions and have been working intensively with the Central Bank and Office of the Attorney General to progress this legislation.  The Minster has stated in replies to parliamentary questions that the Bill is expected to be published by the end of this year.</p><p>  Before explaining the heads of the Bill, I will briefly explain that our approach has altered somewhat from that which was proposed in the public consultation in July 2014.  At that time, we proposed to regulate the ownership of credit to continue the protections enjoyed by consumers prior to the loan book sale.  As a result, owners of loan books would have been required to become authorised as a retail credit firm where they engaged in loan book servicing activities.  The public consultation process highlighted an issue with a passive special purpose vehicle, SPV, which we had not intended to intend regulate, outsourcing servicing to a firm that would not be regulated.  It became clear from the consultation process that credit servicing, as the customer-facing activity, was the appropriate activity to regulate and this legislation achieves this. </p><p>  Once we had taken the step to regulate credit servicing rather than ownership, we examined whether it was still appropriate to regulate ownership.  While the owner may make decisions on a credit agreement, it is the credit servicer who will communicate these decisions to the borrower.  After considerable and detailed examination, it is now accepted that the best way of ensuring the borrower is protected and retains access to the Financial Services Ombudsman is to regulate credit servicing and ensure borrowers can complain to the Financial Services Ombudsman about any actions affecting the borrower.  Our intention is to allow access to the Financial Services Ombudsman for borrowers who are unhappy about any actions which affect them.  Our intention, subject to the advice of the Office of the Attorney General, is that, if the regulated credit servicer claims it is not responsible and passes responsibility to the owner, the legislation will allow the Financial Services Ombudsman to make the owner a party to the complaint, even if the owner is not regulated. </p><p>  On the provisions of the legislation, the Bill is being renamed the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Bill 2014.  This change follows consultation with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and reflects the approach now being adopted to protect consumers.</p><p>  The proposed legislation will amend the Central Bank Act 1942, Central Bank Act 1997 and Consumer Credit Act 1995 and provide for related matters.  It is proposed to amend section 28 of the Central Bank Act 1997 by inserting definitions of the terms "credit agreement", "credit servicing", "credit servicing firm" and "relevant borrowers".  The term "credit servicing" is being tightly defined in order that any firm which communicates with borrowers will require authorisation.  We will also require owners which do not outsource credit servicing to anyone to be regulated, in other words, some regulated entity will be responsible for all credit agreements. </p><p>  The effect of the amendments to section 28 of the Central Bank Act 1997 is to regulate the activity of credit servicing and the credit servicing firms engaged in such activity in order that the borrowers retain the protections they have before the loan book was sold.  All consumer and small and medium enterprise, SME, loans are covered by these amendments and retain the protections they currently have in the following ways.  First, on the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, customers of regulated financial institutions must be dealt with in accordance with the mortgage arrears resolution process, which sets out the steps to be followed on communication, gathering financial information, assessing the circumstances of the borrowers and proposing a resolution.  Complaints and appeals procedures are also provided. </p><p>  Second, on the consumer protection code, customers of regulated financial institutions also have the protection of the Central Bank's consumer protection code regarding limits on communications, personal visits and other contacts, complaint resolution processes, error handling, compliance of outsourced activity with the code and post-sale information provisions, including warnings on switching from a tracker mortgage to a variable interest rate mortgage.</p><p>  Third, on the code of conduct for business lending to small and medium enterprises, SME customers of regulated financial institutions have the protection of the business lending code regarding arrears handling, complaint resolution, etc. </p> <p>Breaches of the Central Bank codes can lead to sanctions on the regulated entity.  No sanctions can be imposed on an unregulated entity.  As credit servicing firms will become regulated financial services providers under the new legislative regime, all appropriate supervisory powers of the Central Bank will be applicable to them as regulated financial service providers including the administrative sanctions procedures regime.  Technically, all Central Bank codes will apply to credit servicing firms when they become regulated entities but certain aspects will not be applicable.  For example, there is no need for the requirements in relation to issuing credit where credit servicing firms act only as credit servicing firms and do not issue credit.</p><p> Customers of regulated financial institutions have access to the Financial Services Ombudsman, FSO, whose role is to investigate, mediate and adjudicate complaints about the conduct of regulated financial service providers.  Therefore, we also propose to amend Part VIIB of the Central Bank Act 1942 in relation to the powers of the Financial Services Ombudsman.  The aim of this amendment is to enable borrowers to make a complaint against an unregulated owner of a loan book where that owner makes a decision about the borrower&rsquo;s loan that the borrower disagrees with and where the regulated credit servicer is not involved in the decision of the owner.</p><p> Finally, with regard to credit union credit, we must ensure that where credit union loan books are sold, those borrowers are also afforded the same protections as other borrowers.  This was raised by the Financial Services Ombudsman, FSO, in the consultation process.  Credit union credit which is sold outside the credit union movement should be regulated so an amendment to the Consumer Credit Act 1995 is needed.  Therefore, the relevant codes will apply to credit which is initially advanced by a credit union but is subsequently sold to an unregulated entity.  I should say that we are not aware of circumstances where this has arisen but feel that it is prudent from a consumer protection perspective to provide for this.</p><p> The Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Bill 2014 ensures that borrowers retain all the protections of the Central Bank codes including the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA, and their right of access to the Financial Services Ombudsman.</p><p>My team and I are happy to take questions. </p></speech>

Before we begin, I propose that we adhere to the same rules that applied at our recent meeting.  This is to ensure that everybody has the opportunity to ask questions.  I propose that the lead speaker from each group will have ten minutes and that a committee member from each group will have five minutes.  Anybody else who wishes to ask questions will have five minutes.  I will advise members when there is one minute remaining of their allocated time to give them an opportunity to wrap up their contribution within the time limit.

Has he any concerns about the retrospective nature of the legislation?  A number of Oireachtas Members were anxious that the Government would have addressed the issue prior to the transfer of the assets and were always concerned about the hazard of attempting to do something retrospectively and the extent to which legislation might be relevant.

If we were to attempt in the legislation to regulate and impose the regulatory requirements on actions that had been taken prior to now, that would have been a difficulty from a constitutional perspective.  That is not what we are doing.  We are saying that from this moment forward, any person who has acquired or who does acquire loan books will be bound by these rules and regulations and they must behave in a manner that is restricted by those regulations.  The regulations will apply from this point onwards, but they will apply in respect of people who purchase loan books in the future or who have already purchased loan books and who own loan books.</p></speech>

From a commercial point of view, it would not have made a great deal of sense for a purchaser of the loan books to start acting in an egregious way towards customers.  Had they done so and tried to enforce the loans against those customers, the courts have made it very clear that they would not look kindly on that sort of behaviour and they would not be disposed towards granting enforcement reliefs to people who had behaved in that way.  Our understanding is that in general there has not been a very widespread pattern of people misbehaving in that way.  In any case, however, once the regulations are in place, people will be entitled to all of the protections.  Even if somebody had been attempting to do that in the past, the regulations will kick in at this stage and customers will be entitled to the benefit of them.</p></speech>

It is worth bearing in mind that in any case the provisions of the unfair terms and conditions in consumer contract legislation already would apply to contracts between consumers and these purchasers even before this legislation intervenes.  The difference after the enactment of this legislation is that the Central Bank will now be in a position to intervene.  Although the Central Bank has had some access to intervention already, the reality is that it is now in the position that it is monitoring this on the part of regulated firms rather than unregulated firms to a large extent.  However, even before that, if an owner were to have unilaterally changed the terms and conditions of the contract in a manner that was unreasonable or without valid cause, legislation already in place would effectively make that term and condition unenforceable against the consumer.</p></speech>

Not trying to be smart but was this consultation process advertised well?  Did the Department get any submissions from any of the mortgage holders who expressed their concerns about the sale of the IBRC loan book at the time?

That is still our intention.  What we needed to do from the outset was to assess the playing field and understand the implications of particular decisions we might take in terms of the legislative provisions we bring forward.  It was important for us, given the public interest in the sale of these loan books, that we would have a period of consultation.  We took the decision to do that through the course of July and August of this year.  Following the feedback we got on the consultation, it was also incumbent on us to understand if the initial framing we had done in terms of how we thought the legislation might be prepared, drafted and enacted was consistent with ensuring that protections were there for the borrowers.  The consultation period gave us some pause for thought and led us to the conclusion that we needed to alter the approach we wanted to take.  As I said in my opening statement, we engaged with a number of stakeholders on that.  We also engaged with some authorities in the UK.<br/>We often look at other jurisdictions, although sometimes the background and circumstances are not necessarily equally aligned.  We took soundings from UK authorities as to the approach adopted there.  We have been engaged, it is fair to say, very intensively over the last number of months with the Central Bank and the Attorney General's office on the drafting and articulation of the policy approach that we want to achieve through the legislation which we expect to publish by the end of the year.  On this particular Bill, we are very anxious to get it right.  We see it as important and the Minister has identified it as such.  He also indicated, in order to manage expectations as much as possible, that it would be published by the end of the year in order to give us sufficient time to engage in various consultations and work with the Attorney General's office and to prepare the legislation to achieve our objective which is, effectively, to put those people who were in a certain position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>their lenders in the same position after the loan books were sold</p></speech>

When I saw them in the heads of the Bill, I submitted a parliamentary question to the Department.  In his response, the Minister drew my attention to a link to the ECBH website because I asked him for a list of all of the SSPVs as I wanted to know who would be exempt.  The link to the website listed financial vehicle corporations which I presume are different; perhaps the witnesses will clarify if they are the same.  There were 20,000 of them based in Dublin, many of them at the same address.  There are thousands at 5 Harbourmaster Place in Dublin.  Some of the names appearing on the list to which the Minister drew my attention include Mars Capital and Atlas and are well known.  I ask the witnesses to speak in more detail on that portion of the Bill.  I also ask them to deal with the issue raised by the Oireachtas Library and Information Service regarding SSPVs that would not be engaged in loan servicing activities through contracting that work out to other third parties.  Would they be exempt as a result?  I ask the witnesses to clarify that too.</p></speech>

Rather than targeting this legislation at the SPVs or the SSPVs, we are targeting it at the servicer.  That may well be the owner of the loan but in most cases it will be another company that interacts with the borrower.  The list of exemptions which Deputy Doherty raised in his question is less relevant now because the exemptions do not really apply.  It is the servicing entity which interacts with the customer which will now be regulated under this current proposal.</p></speech>

I understand that.  Does the servicer face the same legal obligation as the owner?  I refer to circumstances in which the servicer is contracting out in terms of engagement with the customer, but the owner still has legal ownership of the loan.  Under the existing rules, are penalties imposed by the Financial Services Ombudsman and similar bodies on the servicer or on the owner?  Who takes legal action in such cases?  Does that stack up in terms of the contract between the owner and the servicer?</p></speech>

I can tell the Deputy where we are aiming at getting and where I think we are going to arrive.  Our intention is that a complaint will be made against either the servicer or, in circumstances I will clarify, the owner.  If a servicer seeks to dissociate himself or herself from a complaint - if he or she says that the owner, rather than him or her, was involved - the owner will be drawn into the complaint.  In such circumstances, it will be possible for an award to be made against the owner rather than the servicer.  We anticipate that for practical reasons, this is not likely to happen.  In many cases, the owners will be special purpose vehicles that will not have any employees and will not really be in a position to engage in that sort of process.  The meat of the interaction will always be with the servicer.  If somebody tries to avoid responsibility by saying "it was not me, it was the owner", our intention is that the owner will be brought into a complaint before the Financial Services Ombudsman and an award can be made against him or her in such circumstances.</p></speech>

I want to tease that last point out by using the example of a case in which AIB serviced its loan book out to Certus.  I am speaking hypothetically.  As things stand, if I have an issue with AIB - I do not even have a bank account with AIB - I can go to the Financial Services Ombudsman and take a case against AIB.  Under this legislation, would I now be taking a case against Certus?</p></speech>

There would be no need to get into whether Certus or AIB was at fault.  The consumer would make a complaint against AIB and it would be adjudicated against AIB.  If Certus had done something that caused it to have some sort of liability against the consumer, AIB could sort it out with Certus afterwards.  Similarly, after this legislation is enacted somebody who is being dealt with by a servicer will not have to look behind that to see which institution owns the book, whether a special purpose vehicle is behind it or whether that vehicle had some hand or part in the matter about which he or she is seeking to complain.  That person will make the complaint against the servicer.  If the servicer seeks to try to abdicate responsibility for something by saying "no, that was the owner" - we do not think this is likely to happen - then the owner will be drawn into the complaint and any award will be made against the owner.  We are trying to ensure there will be some kind of continuity there, so that the consumer will not really have to get into the ins and outs of who is at fault.  It should not be the consumer's problem.</p></speech>

I just wanted to establish that as a basis.  It is not ground-breaking in any huge shape or form.  My question relates more to interest rates than anything else.  If a bank has sold on a book, and if that book is part of a larger portfolio which has a cost of funds that is blended from different currencies, etc., and if it needs to increase in order to break even, what level of control would a new purchaser of a loan book have over the implementation of interest rates on borrowers here?</p></speech>

Is there anything in this to prevent that from happening?</p></speech>

The contractual provisions of, say, the mortgage still apply with respect to the interest rate.  The customers still have the benefit of the unfair terms in consumer contracts legislation in respect of that loan and the intention of this legislation is to make sure they still have access to the Financial Services Ombudsman for any complaints around unfair movements in interest rates.</p></speech>

I suggest that Mr. Reid should reconsider how the Department will safeguard people from extortionate variable rates, whether that be trying to get the financial institutions to underpin that the variable rate cannot go above and beyond what it is in the institution that originated the loan or a mechanism whereby it is set in stone that it should be X or Y above the mean variable rate for mortgages in the country.  Mr. Reid would be doing a good day's work if he were to put in such a safety measure to protect the mortgage holders.</p></speech>

Also, if a situation arises, and we alluded to it earlier, whereby a particular decision which was detrimental to the borrower was taken by the owner, there is an opportunity to make that application of appeal to the Financial Services Ombudsman, and that is being drafted currently in terms of the legislation.</p></speech>

Why would they appeal?  If someone enters into a variable rate contract and the owner of the loan decides they want to increase the variable rate, what is the appeal one can make?</p></speech>

There is the unfair contracts legislation which Mr. Reid can refer to if he has the particular provision, but also the rapid movement of the interest rates as alluded to by the Deputy would be seen as being detrimental to the borrower and it would be on that basis that an appeal would be made.</p></speech>

It is a level of protection afforded across the European Union at this stage but if a dispute was brought to the Financial Services Ombudsman, FSO, there is no valid reason for the movement in this variable rate or the standard variable rate, SVR, on this mortgage.  If the FSO deemed that to be the case, that move would be essentially expunged.</p></speech>

The Deputy's argument is about moving into the territory of justifying a certain financial return for the buyer of that loan, which I do not know if the SFO would favour, as opposed to protecting the consumer in that case.  On balance, a justification that I need to earn profit on my purchase of this book would not outweigh a concern around an unfair movement in interest rates.</p></speech>

In responses to parliamentary questions, the Minister has been keen to emphasise that it is the intention of the legislation and that he will reset the situation to what it was before the loan was transferred.</p></speech>

The original intention was to go for a model of ownership with some exclusions of securitisation special purchase vehicles, SSPVs.  The Department changed that on the basis of consultation with stakeholders.  I understand the reason is to regulate servicers.  That makes sense, but why not do both?  Why not get servicers and owners, as happens currently?  In terms of Deputy Doherty's hypothetical loan from the AIB, they are covered.  Why do not do the same in terms of both ownership and servicing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-03a.234" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Hogan" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014120300008#J02000"><p>As I alluded to at the outset, it was highlighted to us in the public consultation process that a passive SPV, for example, who was holding ownership could outsource the servicing to a firm which would not be regulated.  The danger was that we would find a situation where nobody was regulated in terms of what was taking place so we have moved to concentrate our emphasis in the legislation on the regulation of the credit servicers.  That will be consistent with situations such as those we would see in other jurisdictions like the United Kingdom and in other cases across Europe.  Does Mr. Fee or Mr. Mac Donncha want to add anything to that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-03a.235" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Fee" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014120300008#J02100"><p>We were keen that there would be one regulated entity facing the consumer in each case so as Deputy Doherty pointed out, with AIB outsourcing, as things currently stand AIB takes responsibility for the actions its credit servicer may take.  It appeared to us that there was a possible gap if a passive SPV acting as an owner, which we did not intend to regulate, outsourced to a credit servicer that we were not going to regulate because the consumer would have lost out on certain protections.  However, because the credit servicer is the entity that the consumer is dealing with, it seemed to make the most sense that they are the entity that will be regulated but we are setting it up in such a way that if the owner does not outsource to a regulated credit servicer, the owner will be deemed to need to be regulated.  Generally speaking, there will be one entity as the regulated entity for each consumer.</p></speech>

I am not implying anything untoward but their basic representation is that it would make more sense to have a model along the lines of that in Britain of servicing administrators, etc., and the witnesses were convinced by that argument.</p></speech>

As I said, we looked to other jurisdictions to see how it was managed in those to ensure that we were not moving too far away from what might be seen as international practice.  Does Mr. Reid want to add to that?</p></speech>

Not only did the owners say they may not be the appropriate jurisdiction for legislation and regulation, but the servicers said they were because they had the infrastructure, the systems and the controls.</p> <p>They said that they were the ones working the books of loans and interfacing with customers and, therefore, were the appropriate venue for those controls to be put in place.</p></speech>

Who would lose if SPVs were regulated?  To the extent that they engage in any of these activities, they would be subject to the regulations.  If they do not engage in these activities, the regulations would not arise.</p></speech>

To the extent that they participate in what we have defined as servicing activities, that is, interacting with the customer directly, they will be covered.  Where they do not and instead delegate that role to the servicers, it will be the servicers that are covered.  Our definition of a servicer is anyone who interacts, be it the owner or a third party.</p></speech>

We are regulating the activity rather than the legal ownership because the former is where protection is required.  One of the most convincing arguments that was raised in the consultation made us reconsider our approach.  It was pointed out to us that, if we just focused on the ownership, there was a possibility of having an owner who did nothing and was entirely passive.  No regulation would apply, as the owner would be able to slip under the radar by not doing anything that was regulated.  Therefore, the regulatory requirements would not be breached.  The activity could be outsourced to a servicer that would have a freer hand because it would not be regulated.  By moving from the ownership to the activity, we intend to avoid that lacuna.  Every loan will be captured now because either the owner or the servicer will be captured.  Even if a loan is not outsourced and there is a passive owner, that situation will be captured in the legislation.</p></speech>

Consumers have no interaction with the owner.  I do not know to what extent they will have an awareness of the shell company.  Members heard about the number of such companies.  It is not practical to try to identify and target which vehicle has acquired a consumer's loan.  We have focused on the person who interacts with the consumer and actively services the loan.</p></speech>

Many of us believe that the code of conduct is inadequate and not rigorously enforced.  This legislation brings others under the Central Bank's code of conduct, which is for the Central Bank to enforce.

I welcome Ms Noeline Blackwell, director, and Mr. Paul Joyce, senior policy researcher, FLAC.  I also welcome Ms Niamh Murphy, head of consumer banking and Mr. Maurice Crowley, retail director, of the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland which, in case anybody is confused, used to be the Irish Banking Federation.<br/>The format of the meeting is that Mr. Joyce and Mr. Crowley will make opening remarks.  I remind members, witnesses and those present in the Visitors Gallery that all mobile telephones must be switched off because they interfere with the broadcasting equipment. <br/>I draw witnesses' attention to the fact that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/>I invite Mr. Joyce to commence his opening statement.</p></speech>

We made our original submission in August in response to the Department's consultation paper.  Today we have an updated submission which has been circulated to members and I will summarise its points.<br/>As we understand it, the purpose of the draft Bill is to do two things.  First, it is to bring the buyers of debt or credit agreements into the realm of retail vetted firms so that the code of conduct on mortgage arrears and-or the consumer protection and Central Bank codes will apply to such entities.  Second, it is to ensure that customers of these providers or entitles will have access to the complaints mechanism of the Financial Services Ombudsman.<br/>There are two issues to consider.  First, is the means chosen to achieve this in the Bill adequate?  Second, the issue of much more concern to us, is this particular approach adequate in terms of consumer protection, in the first place, both for existing providers and any buyers of debt?<br/>Let me deal with the first issue of whether the means chosen are adequate.  We looked at the submission of Mars Capital and noted some concerns about the mechanisms chosen.  There is an exemption in the Bill for so-called securitisation specified purpose vehicles.  Mars Capital made the point that the acquirers of loan portfolios in this country are, by and large, almost all SSPVs as they are called.  It suggests that if this approach were continued with, it would exclude most acquirers of debt portfolios from the ambit of the scheme. <br/>Mars Capital also made a second observation, which it thinks is important, that the entity of a retail credit firm, as we were called, was first introduced back in 2008 to cover the sub-prime lenders that were involved in mortgage lending, by and large.  Mars Capital made the point that retail credit firm, as a category, would not be relevant to the acquirers of credit agreements because they do not, by and large, tend to engage in further lending activities.  Those are two important points that the Department needs to look at and they might be of interest to the committee in terms of the mechanics of the Bill, as announced in the consultation paper.<br/>Assuming the Bill attains the objectives of applying the CCMA or consumer protection code and the FSO scheme to the acquirers of loan portfolios, we wondered whether this will be adequate protection for the customers of these institutions.  As the committee will probably know, FLAC addressed that point in a report this year called Redressing the Imbalance.  The report examined the inadequacy, as we would see it, of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears to protect borrowers in arrears under their mortgages, whether the mortgage is with the original creditor or the debt has been sold to an acquirer of loans.<br/>We looked recently at 12 months of statistics on mortgage arrears on restructures and repossessions.  We would be of the view that it was a worrying time in terms of the number of repossession applications that were made and the slow progress tackling proper reschedules.<br/>Recently the Governor of the Central Bank addressed a MABS conference, as mentioned on page 2 of the submission.  He suggested:<blockquote>The process of tackling the unresolved arrears cases has been that lenders have not been allowed to neglect or long-finger the numerous cases of non-cooperating borrowers.  This has had the undesirable side-effect of crystallising into legal proceedings cases of non-cooperation for which a negotiated cure could have been arrived at.</blockquote>His comment could be interpreted as suggesting that non-co-operation is the principal reason for legal proceedings and if only borrowers had co-operated, a solution would have been found to their arrears difficulty.  That is not our experience right now.  There are some non-co-operating borrowers.  We have seen a number of instances where borrowers have co-operated with the mortgage arrears resolution process for some years but have found since the revision of the code in 2013 that a demand for greater payment has been made.  Equally, there are lenders who are not complying with the MARP.  There are also lenders who  adjudicate borrowers in arrears as non-co-operating on the flimsiest of grounds, in our view, and in some cases to short-circuit the MARP.<br/>We understand from the Governor that the Central Bank is planning to undertake inspections of lenders in order to monitor compliance with the CCMA in the second half of the year.</p> <p>However, this process does not appear to have started.</p><p> The Governor of the Central Bank, in his recent speech, stated the Central Bank could not to attempt to oversee each case, although the bank would, he said, shortly embark on a further probe and continue to hold regulated lenders to account for any deficiencies.  However, in a reply to a parliamentary question from Deputy Michael McGrath in July last, the Minister for Finance confirmed that no sanctions had been imposed on any lender for failure to comply with the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA.</p><p> We are also seriously concerned that provision has not been made for any recognisable appeal to an external third party in the case of adverse decisions by lenders under the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  Such decisions could relate to declining to offer a borrower an alternative repayment arrangement, offering the borrower an unsuitable repayment arrangement or declaring that the borrower is not co-operating.  There is a right of reference to the Financial Services Ombudsman but that office has made abundantly clear that, while it will consider complaints related to issues of process, it does not believe it is in a position to overturn the substantive decisions of lenders.  It is clear that a number of lenders have come to understand this to mean that provided they comply with the processes and abide by the rules, they have little to fear.  Many borrowers have been left facing repossession proceedings in the Circuit Court as a result.  Some 10,000 new repossession cases have been taken in the past 12 months.  We are awaiting Central Bank figures on the third quarter.  The point we are making in this regard is that even if the Bill is introduced and the acquirers of loan portfolios become retail credit firms or equivalent and the CCMA and other codes apply to them, borrowers will still not be properly protected in the circumstances I have outlined. </p><p> On access to the Financial Services Ombudsman, FSO, which is the second object of the Bill, people will have a right to make a complaint to the FSO if they are unhappy with the conduct of a regulated financial service provider.  This will clearly include the acquirers of loan portfolios.  A significant number of the customers of the credit acquisition companies are fearful that, in time, the terms and conditions of their loan agreements may be varied to their detriment.  Our submission refers to a recent decision of the Financial Services Ombudsman in the case of Millar and the Financial Services Ombudsman.  Time does not permit me to discuss the case in detail, other than to note that it involved a couple with a number of mortgages, all of which were on a variable rate.  The lender, Danske Bank, which had taken over the business of National Irish Bank, increased the variable rate of the mortgage loan.  The couple argued that this increase was not tied to any change in European Central Bank interest rates and, therefore, was not justifiable.  The FSO rejected the couple's complaint on the ground that a clause in the mortgage agreement allowed for alterations in the rate of interest in response to market conditions, rather than in line with general market interest rates.  Interestingly, the High Court recently overturned this decision.  We understand, however, that the FSO may appeal the High Court's decision. </p><p> Holders of variable rate mortgages are particularly vulnerable to future changes in their terms and conditions and the rates of interest applied to their loans.  There is an obvious concern that loans which have been sold on to the acquirers of loan portfolios will be sold on again to other companies in a complex web of transactions that may in some way mirror what happened when sub-prime mortgages were packaged up as investments.  This practice led in many instances to the deep personal debt arrears crisis we are experiencing.  The further a loan travels down the road as a packaged entity, the greater the danger that the borrower or consumer will find the terms of the loan being varied to their detriment.  What is required, therefore, is not only legally binding legislation about the status of credit acquisition companies, but also a regulatory regime and Financial Services Ombudsman service that will vigilantly monitor the companies in question and deal with complaints in a decisive fashion.  </p><p> A further issue that is not mentioned in the Bill or consultation paper is that certain sections of the Consumer Credit Act are relevant to the rights of borrowers as against creditors who have sold on the debt to an acquiring company.  Without discussing this issue in great detail, we have asked whether section 40 of the Consumer Credit Act and a parallel regulation - regulation 20 in the European (Consumer Credit Agreements) Regulations of 2010 - will apply to the acquirers of loan portfolios.  Essentially, this section provides that where a credit owner's rights are assigned to a third person, the consumer is entitled to plead against that person any defence available against the original creditor.  We suggest that this provision be pointed out to the acquirers of loan portfolios to ensure they are aware that there are existing consumer protection measures in place to which they should be obliged to adhere and that they simply cannot step into the original creditor's shoes and attempt to vary or manipulate the terms and conditions of an existing contract.</p><p> We are concerned as to what is the status of an alternative repayment arrangement put in place under the CCMA by a mortgage lender which subsequently sells the mortgage debt on to an acquirer of loan portfolios.  Will the new entity be bound by the alternative repayment arrangement which the original lender has put in place?  Again, this question is not addressed in the consultation paper.  </p><p> The submission provides some detail on an issue that is particularly dear to our hearts, namely, the regulation of hire purchase.  We have seen that the Central Bank can reasonably quickly draft a Bill that will correctly put regulatory status on the acquirers of credit agreements, both secured and unsecured.  However, it remains the case that hire purchase companies are not regulated by the Central Bank.  The agreements provided by these companies are regulated by the Consumer Credit Act, under which the borrower is entitled to a written agreement.  The entities are not regulated, however, and an explanation is provided in the submission as to why we believe this is the case.  This Bill, which accords retail credit status or equivalent to acquirers of loan portfolios, is a perfect opportunity to regulate hire purchase companies.  After all, these companies provide credit to vulnerable borrowers, in many instances at high levels of credit and using hire purchase agreements that are technical, detailed and have certain features that would require particular levels of consumer protection.</p></speech>

The federation and its member banks support in every guise the objective of seeking to ensure consumers are protected.  In this regard, our members have implemented or are signatory to a range of consumer protection protocols, including the consumer protection code, code of conduct on mortgage arrears, the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service operational protocol and the protocol on multi-banked small and medium enterprise debt, which we issued earlier this year.</p><p>  In the context of the proposed Bill, which is being prepared and drafted by the Department of Finance, certain issues require careful consideration.  For the purposes of this meeting, we will briefly draw attention to one or two of these issues.  A ongoing process of de-leveraging in the banking sector involves bolstering banks' capital and strengthening their balance sheets to make them more fit for purpose and allow them to continue to lending into the economy.  We are cautious to ensure that new legislation does not adversely impact on these efforts, while achieving the appropriate balance of protection for consumers.  We are concerned that the legislation, as drafted, may deter potential purchasers of or investors in the loan portfolios that are being made for sale and present a risk that such investors may turn their attention to other European markets. </p> <p>We feel very keenly that a balance is needed in the legislation between not deterring the deleveraging and sale process and ensuring that appropriate consumer protections are maintained irrespective of the owner of the portfolios.  We have concerns about potential unintentional consequences from the legislation, which we outlined briefly in our submission.</p><p> We share Mr. Joyce's concerns that the way in which SPVs and SSPVs are pulled together may undermine the protections this Bill proposes to offer.  We are of the view that where a purchaser of a loan portfolio outsources the servicing of that portfolio to a third party which is itself a regulated entity, the purchaser should be exempted from the legislation.  A number of well-run loan services now operate in this country and they provide considerable employment.  We believe they are a more appropriate focus for this legislation.  The Bill refers to purchasers having a physical presence in Ireland.  At present under Central Bank regulations there is no requirement on physical presence.  They focus on the ability to supervise and regulate these entities.  The reality, as Mr. Joyce noted, is that many SPVs and SSPVs will not have a physical presence in this country and, therefore, the focus should be on those who service the loan books.  We are aware, based on earlier discussions with this committee, that the Department of Finance is planning to introduce amendments to alter the focus from purchasing entities to those entities who take responsibility for servicing and managing loan portfolios.  Given our previous submission in August, we would welcome that approach because it would deal with the issues we outlined.  It would recognise the primacy of protecting consumers and borrowers under the CCMA and the consumer protection code but it would also address the other commercial issues to which I alluded in the context of banks seeking to deleverage and strengthen their balance sheets.</p></speech>

I am not sure if they followed the earlier presentation from departmental officials who indicated there would be significant changes to the draft heads which have given rise to concern.  The Bill is relatively short and FLAC has raised certain issues that probably should be addressed.  The officials have indicated that the exemption for SPVs will not exist in the Bill and that provision will be made for providers of services.  Mr. Joyce expressed concern in this regard.  Given that SPVs will no longer be provided for in the same way, does he think that the Bill is sufficient in terms of the protections that existed heretofore for consumers?  We have been assured that the Bill will wind back the clock to the point when the loans were sold and that the protections existing at that point will be available in the future.</p><p>  If the servicer is to be legally accountable under the regulations, what happens if the contract between the owner and servicer of the loan denies responsibility, and would there be recourse to the Financial Services Ombudsman?  They are saying they will deal with the issue but it is difficult to discuss it when it is not included in the heads of the Bill.  They indicated that they would seek to find a way of revising the process so that where the servicer of a loan claims it is only servicing the loan and is not responsible for it, the owner of the loan is pulled into it.  This would only apply to non-regulated entities.  I asked this question in the context of AIB outsourcing the servicing of its loan book to Certus.  What recourse would I have if I wanted to make a complaint about the way in which AIB managed my loan?  The point is that it would apply only to unregulated entities.  Do the witnesses think the Bill is robust enough to deal with Government's intention, which is to go no further than the provisions that already exist?</p></speech>

Over recent years in Ireland we have seen a number of unregulated entities operating in the collection and management of debt, and it has taken us a long time to impose a regulatory status on them.  Much depends on the meat of the legislation and its provisions, but we would be wary for consumers where third parties are involved.  We have come across a number of cases in which borrowers in arrears are not even sure who they are supposed to be paying because a debt collection company is involved, on the one hand, and the borrower continues to liaise with the lender, on the other.  Telephone calls may be transferred to an office in Leeds, London or Dublin.  In some cases, multiple debt collectors have been involved on the same account.  There does not even appear to be an express provision that obliges a lender to declare immediately to a borrower when a loan has been sold or handed over to a debt management company.  I would think more detail is needed in the Bill simply to declare that, if there is a legal relationship between the debt owner and servicing agency, the agency would in some way take responsibility for servicing the loan.  It appears to us that regulatory rules for the agency managing or collecting the debt would be a good idea.</p></speech>

Names we have mentioned already, such as Pepper, Certus and Capita, are already regulated by the Central Bank.  That is the type of entity we propose should be included in the category of loan servicer.  They are administering the loans on behalf of the owner and in accordance with consumer protection legislation.  This is not just a question of mortgage debt because a variety of sales can happen.  Under European regulations, for example, Bank of Ireland was obliged to sell part of its debate.  There is an ongoing need to ensure that any agency that deals with the consumer is licensed and regulated by the Central Bank.</p></speech>

Our intention, subject to the advice of the Office of the Attorney General, is that, if the regulated credit servicer claims it is not responsible and passes responsibility to the owner, the legislation will allow the Financial Services Ombudsman to make the owner a party to the complaint, even if the owner is not regulated.</blockquote>I raise this issue because members have been waiting for this legislation for a year and it is quite frustrating.  There has been public consultation and the legislation as printed does not appear to be what will be published.  It appears to me as though this could be a quite convoluted and long drawn-out process.  Were I the person with a complaint for the Financial Services Ombudsman, I would be obliged to go through a system in which it is not really clear as to who was responsible for my complaint.  In addition, it is also clear that at this point it is subject to the advice of the Attorney General and, therefore, the Department has not got this across the line yet.</p></speech>

We are talking about what could potentially be dealt with from a legal challenge perspective.  Certainly, however, our members, be they full firms that currently are the owners of this debt and which are not planning to change that or those who are servicing the debt, they are already dealing with the ombudsman.  I believe they would be happy to continue to so do because that is how they operate.  They set up all their processes and procedures to do that and are comfortable with that process.  As an example, we bring representatives of the ombudsman's office to talk to our members to make sure they are focused on issues that are emerging.  The likes of the firms the Deputy mentioned, namely, the debt management firms, will also be part of that process.  In addition, one could consider the type of entities that might buy in whereas today we are focused on the likes of private equity firms or whatever that are buying.  In the longer term, we envisage - again in the interests of the economy - that there will be a substantial turnaround in who or what potentially could be a third party, that is, an owner of a debt in the Irish market.  One could be looking at a pension fund and that was the basis of our original submission.  It could be difficult for the Central Bank to have oversight over those types of entities, which is why we proposed that the servicers should be the ones who manage the responsibility for the whole process on a day-to-day basis and should be the ones being monitored and managed by the Central Bank.</p></speech>

I will understand if they cannot give an opinion on it because it is taking them down a line that is not clear in respect of the legislation or its intention.  In the context of how the application of this proposal would mean it would be the responsibility of the servicers, the Central Bank has just adjudicated on the Provident moneylending scandal and in my view its adjudication was not appropriate.  I was involved with the whistleblowers who provided the dossier to the Central Bank more than 18 months ago.  One point of interest relevant to this legislation is that each of those people who service the debt and who make credit available to individuals are self-employed.  They are not employed by Provident and are not employed by moneylenders.  Therefore, a question arises in respect of credit servicers with this legislation.  They are unregulated.  While the statement by the Central Bank states the Central Bank found against Provident in respect of 105 loans, the self-employed people would tell one there were thousands of them.  The Central Bank found against Provident not because it happened but because it did not have the rules and practices in place to identify it.  The individuals who carried it out were self-employed, not employed by Provident and consequently were third parties.  This relates to the question FLAC raised with regard to those who service credit in respect of hire purchase.  Do the witnesses perceive an issue whereby this Bill should be expanded to deal with those areas?  Alternatively, should it simply try to do what it says on the tin, that is, to deal with the loans that have been sold on and then to deal with consumer protection on a wider scale at a later stage?</p></speech>

I must be honest and state I am not that familiar with the Provident case.  However, on listening to the Deputy, I would draw a clear distinction between what Provident and its employees appear to have been doing and what the loan servicers about whom we are talking do.  These are highly professional firms, which are mostly foreign, such as Capita, Pepper, Certus, etc. but they are focused on servicing the loan.  They are not lending money.  These firms are not lending money to borrowers.  They are taking existing portfolios of loans and are servicing and administering them on behalf of existing regulated entities, as the Deputy described earlier, or in terms of the new purchasers.  Consequently, we would draw a clear distinction between them in circumstances in which these firms have the policies and procedures in place to make sure the consumer protection code, the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, and all the other codes are dealt with.</p></speech>

I assume all moneylenders operate the same case.  It is the moneylender, in this case Provident, which lends money and which takes in the money.  It is the agents who service it, who go to the house and collect the fee.  It is the agents who collect payment.  Is this not dealing with the exact same thing albeit on a more micro level whereby it is proposed to regulate third-party entities for servicing loans but to forget about the moneylenders and those they are servicing?  The reason I believe this structure exists is for moneylenders to do some of the things they have done in the past.</p></speech>

We are very comfortable with the quality, appropriateness and professionalism of the loan services firms we suggest here should be the regulated entities.  I draw a clear distinction between the activities of moneylenders and what is happening here, which is the transferring of existing borrowings and existing borrowers as part of a portfolio to what I agree is another purchaser.  To respond to Mr. Joyce's point, a purchaser might lack a great deal of physical substance in Ireland, which is why we would focus on the servicing entities, which have a physical presence and which have in place the processes and procedures to service appropriately these loans in accordance with all the codes and legislation.  That is our focus and we hold no candle for the moneylending side.</p></speech>

The reality is that while these servicers have a job to do, they act as agents of a body which owns the money and which owns the debt.  They can make any contract they wish.  It is not just a question of the Financial Services Ombudsman either because there are issues that may need to go before the courts and if only the agent is liable and is caught for proper behaviour or regulated behaviour, there is a real worry that a contract could be structured in such a way as to let the entity behind, that is, the owner of the debt, off the hook.  With the change of emphasis to the servicer away from the owner of the debt, there is a risk that the terms of the agreement will be structured in such a way to ensure maximum flexibility or least culpability for the owner of the debt in behind.  Moreover, the servicers often are behaving to a routine in a way that is not acceptable or satisfactory as far as FLAC is concerned.  It is good to know they are regulated, as they need to be, but so too should anybody who is buying that debt.  Issues such as existing arrangements with regard to the debt and so on will be very important.</p></speech>

The Bill as currently constituted is attempting to deal with an entity that buys a debt and therefore, the original creditor moves out of the picture and one has a new creditor.  In such a situation, the legislation should ensure that all existing consumer protection measures that are in place for the borrower whose debt has been factored on are maintained, including the codes, the consumer credit legislation and so on.  Then there is a situation where an existing creditor might instruct a debt collection company to collect a debt that is in arrears but the debt still belongs to the original creditor.  Then there is a third situation where the bank may be foreign-based and gets another entity to service the debt in its entirety on the bank's behalf.  For example, this may be a mortgage that is not in arrears at all.  It would appear sensible that the legislation would cover all those eventualities and unless I am mistaken, it is fair to state that debt collection and debt management firms and services have only become regulated recently under the Central Bank supervision and enforcement legislation.  It took quite some time for that to be put in place and I am unsure whether the extent of that regulation is as robust as perhaps it should be.</p><p>  I refer to the moneylending issue and the Provident case.</p> <p>It is true that licensed moneylenders operate through local agents who act on their behalf.  Although I am not saying it happened in this case, sometimes the agent goes on a solo run.  This case involved top-up loans, which were being extended to people who had not paid off the original loan they had taken out.  This is a clear and flagrant breach of section 99 of the Consumer Credit Act.  Why is a fine imposed when the Central Bank's notice specifically drew attention to a legislative breach?  If this is the type of regulation we have, whereby original creditors or companies to whom debt is factored on have breached legislative requirements but the penalty is a settlement, it calls into question how vigorous consumer protection is.</p></speech>

I hope the case is not over because other areas need to be delved into.  Where a servicer which has a contract with a financial institution to service loans, whether in arrears or not, is penalised or found to be in breach of regulations, one can imagine the servicer might say it has nothing to do with it, that it does not own the loan but has a specific contract, which none of us will see.  What kind of system should be put in place to protect consumers?  BPFI has made a particular submission saying it should be the service provider, which is what the legislation anticipates.  However, in a case where a service provider will not take responsibility for issues, how does BPFI believe the owner should be made a party to the complaint?  I look at it from the consumer's point of view and I anticipate a long, drawn-out legal process between the servicer and the owner.  If an entity is regulated, I go to the Financial Services Ombudsman.  In this case, the service provider will be regulated, but not the owner.  The Department is trying not to regulate the owner but to go half way there.  Where the regulated service provider fails to stand up to an issue, we will have to draw the unregulated entity in, and it could be a minefield.</p></speech>

This is what makes the most sense to me.  While I am not sure how it would work legally, it would have a lot of merit.  We have tended to shift the focus of servicing regulations around substance on the ground.  Because the special purpose vehicle, SPV, which is what most of the companies use, has a legal substance but no physical or personal substance on the ground, it always seemed to make more sense to start with the servicer.  However, we would have no difficulty with the owner being brought to account through the ombudsman's process.  Some of it already happens for banks in this country in that if customers or borrowers are unhappy with a bank or appeals process, they always have the option of the Financial Services Ombudsman.  If the Department is planning to mirror the process with the unregulated owners of the books, it would have a lot of merit.</p></speech>

Using the example of AIB, although it is regulated, say AIB sold its loan book to Certus for a five-year period and Certus was dealing with me, as an AIB customer.  After the contract ran out, say AIB engaged a different servicing company.  In this example, the legislation allows AIB to be unregulated.  Two servicing companies could be dealing with the same customer and loan while the owner remains unregulated.  Would that not cause a major problem with the recourse to consumer protection?</p></speech>

Any regulated entity would have a very clear set of service level agreements and expectations with the initial servicer.  If that contract ends, either at the end of the specified period or during it if the servicer were not meeting the key performance indicators for service levels, there would be a relatively simple shift of responsibility from the first to the second servicer, although it would probably not be as simple as it sounds.  I am assuming the second servicer is also a regulated entity, so the same approach and provisions would apply.  As regulated entities, banks will outsource only in circumstances in which they are absolutely happy with the service provided and that the processes and procedures comply with the codes.  If the bank has a problem with a servicer, it will shift to another servicer only if it is absolutely comfortable that the same compliance applies.  Our members are very keen that the services be regulated because it gives them an extra lever over the servicer to which they have outsourced.</p></speech>

I will pick up on the issue Deputy Pearse Doherty was teasing out.  My instinct is that drawing a distinction between the service provider and the owner of a loan creates many issues and has the potential to dilute the thrust of the legislation.  The Department of Finance's statement makes it clear that it has concluded that it would be better to insist that the credit servicer be regulated rather than the owner of the loan.  I take the simple view that the original relationship is between the borrower and the lender, and that the lender, whether the original lender or somebody who steps into the shoes of the original lender, should be regulated and accountable to the State authorities for the application of the various statutory protections.  Creating another layer through the service provider raises many issues, which could be cumbersome and bureaucratic in their application.</p><p>  Inevitably, the relationship between the new owner of a loan - inevitably a private equity firm - and the service provider is a commercial relationship with a contract in place.  If the Central Bank identifies a compliance issue with the CCMA which it wants to pursue, it can do so only under the legislation as proposed with the service provider.  The service provider's relationship with the new mortgage owner could come to an end contractually.  Although Mr. Crowley said there would be a seamless transition to a new service provider, why introduce the complexity?  He asked why the owners of the loans should be regulated.  If they want to own Irish mortgages, they should be regulated in Ireland.  It would introduce a lot of complexity and it would appear that the industry has won the argument privately with the Department of Finance.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-03a.285" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Maurice Crowley" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014120300015#T00100"><p>Not that we would ever admit to banks' winning an argument such as that.  I take the Deputy's point on the borrower-lender relationship because that is where it all starts.  On one level, we are not here to protect the purchasers of those loan books.  We do have a concern, as we said at the start, that if a level of regulation is imposed on the purchasers of these books they may be deterred from purchasing these books going forward and that would have practical and commercial implications for regulated banks which are trying to deleverage and strengthen their capital bases.  In the context of purchasers of loan books, our concern is from the point of view of not deterring them, it is not necessarily from protecting them from regulation.  The concern is twofold, if there is regulation on the new purchasers it may deter them from making a purchase in the first instance.  Our other concern is more practical.  I revert to something I said earlier.  In drafting the original legislation the Department sought to draw a distinction between securitisation special purpose vehicles, SSPVs, because many of them are used by banks in this country to sell covered bonds and securitise their mortgage in order to bring more liquidity to their balance sheets, and SPV, which we would welcome.  The danger and the practical concern we would have for the borrower is that if the focus of the regulation is on the SPV, it is a legal entity here but it is no substance, what is one actually regulating?  What recourse does one have against that SPV which is just the holder of a loan book?  I do not know but I am not sure there is much else on the balance sheet of that SPV.</p><p>  I would worry about the substance of that SPV in terms of regulation and the ability to pursue and to sanction.  For us, the focus on the loan servicer was intended to be a more effective way of focusing in on a group of entities that could clearly be regulated and have significant substance in this country.  All of these loan servicers - I draw a distinction between the provident services - have a substantial presence in this country in terms of employment.  They also have substantial reputation concerns.  These are significant companies.  Certus is Irish based but Pepper, Capital and HML are worldwide companies and will not put their reputation at risk.  For those reasons, they are quite comfortable with the notion of being regulated because they have a reputation to protect both in this market and elsewhere.</p></speech>

What would govern the relationship between the service provider and the owner of the loan in respect of those issues?

Mr. Joyce mentioned that he was not aware of any inspections which were planned.  They have actually commenced.  Our members have received letters from the Central Bank.  They have completed a type of factfinding process last month and on-site visits have taken place.  Those visits take place in the large banks but also in the service providers who are acting, in some cases, on behalf of UK based companies that have exited this market, so they are certainly in scope.</p><p>  As Mr. Crowley mentioned they are concerned about their reputation and making sure they comply with all aspects of the regulation and actively pursue that.  It is in their interest to ensure that if this is a growing market in the Irish economy in terms of new contracts coming on stream that they are best placed to bid for those if they can show through their previous practices that they comply with the regulations in place.  A new round of additional consumer protection regulations was put in place in the past couple of weeks by the Central Bank.  It consulted twice on those.  In recent months we certainly contributed to both consultations and other stakeholders and interest parties were eligible to do so also.  On that basis the Central Bank has reinforced consumer protection in the debt management firms category.  There has been much activity in that area and the firms we are talking about have been through the oversight process.  In terms of individual contracts between the firms and the purchasers, we would not be privy to those.  The documents are not publicly available so that would be something in terms of competition that we would-----</p></speech>

The new owners of the loans will not take any risk of possible non-compliance by the service provider.  They will make sure contractually that they are covered and indemnified on that issue.  Is that the road we want to go down where the actual owner of the mortgage is effectively exempt from compliance because he or she has no skin in the game as such whereas the service provider does in terms of reputation and commercially?  If it comes to the possible new restructuring of a loan are all decisions made by the service provider?</p></speech>

We understand that more than 10,000 mortgages have been sold to unregulated entities.  Is there a pattern of trouble?  Has a pattern of alleged non-compliance with the codes emerged?  The new owners, generally private equity firms, have signed up to voluntary compliance.  Is that happening?  I appreciate it is difficult to gauge because the mortgage holders do not have anywhere to go.  There is no policeman to ensure compliance.  Has FLAC any evidence that the equity firms have abused the privilege of not being regulated?</p></speech>

For the most part, people are doing these on their own.</p> <p>It is very difficult to know.  Many of the restructures that were done in the past year are already being restructured.  We have a real concern - including in respect to the inspection being carried out by the Central Bank - to the effect that unless consumers are asked about this matter, we will never discover how right or wrong are these restructures.  All one hears are people's perceptions at the end of the process.</p></speech>

It is now December 2014 and the first proper inspections of lenders in the context of their compliance with what was quite a lender-friendly revision are only beginning to take place.  The Central Bank does not appear to publish any statistics on compliance with the CCMA and there is very little consumer research in the context of talking to borrowers who are in arrears regarding their experience under the code.  There is a limited amount of information available.  We do have some information to the effect that certain of the debt-servicing companies are extremely difficult to communicate with and that they are very hardline in their negotiations and in the context of the kind of arrangements they are offering on behalf of the entities they represent.</p><p>  To return to the issue of who should be responsible for the debt, we have just heard that the Department of Finance is suggesting that the owner of the agreement should exit stage left - from a legal and regulatory point of view - where a credit servicer has been engaged to service the loan.  That seems extraordinary.  Section 40 of the Consumer Credit Act, details of which are set out in the submission we made to the committee, and the parallel provision in regulation 30 of the consumer credit regulations specifically state where a borrower's debt is sold on or where the rights relating to that debt are assigned to a third party, then that third party steps into the original creditor's shoes from a legal perspective.  The borrower is also entitled to plead against the purchaser of the debt any defence he or she had against the original creditor.  The suggestion - if indeed such a suggestion is being made - that a lender who engages a debt-servicing company can abdicate responsibility for honouring the terms and conditions of a loan seems quite absurd.  If that is the case then section 40 will have to be removed from the Statute Book.</p><p>  In the context of what Deputy Pearse Doherty stated earlier, it seems that in terms of access to the Financial Services Ombudsman's scheme, both the creditor - who is still legally responsible for the loan and in whose name the loan remains - and the credit-servicing company should both potentially be the subject of a complaint.  Equally, the CCMA should apply to both entities.  There have been difficulties in this area in the past.  Returning to the issue of hire purchase, garages have tried to claim that loans are with finance companies and that they are not responsible for them.  In turn, finance companies have stated that credit intermediaries are responsible for lining up hire purchase agreements and that they are not responsible for what those intermediaries do.  One should be able to make a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman against both the original creditor, who still has ownership of the loan, and anybody that creditor brings in to service the loan, regardless of whether it is an existing lending company or a lending company with a seat outside the State.</p></speech>

If it is only to be allowed to be drawn in to the Financial Services Ombudsman and not to any other avenue of redress which might be open to the consumer, then, as matters stand, that is about as complicated a legal structure as I have ever had the privilege to see.</p></speech>

On the sale of a loan book, they feel that the most merit is to be had in regulating the loan-servicing entity.  That is where it is happening and, as stated earlier, that is where the substance is to be found.  The substance is not there in the SPV that would have been set up.  As part of that - and in reference to comments which have just been made - it is not just the loan that is being sold, the contract is also being sold.  The lender is not abdicating responsibility, as has been suggested, in respect of the loan's terms and conditions.  The latter transfer across with the loan and the borrower to the servicing company and remain intact.  I would, therefore, refute the suggestion that the financial institution selling the loan has responsibility.</p></speech>

Before I was elected to the House, I was involved in putting together loan portfolios for the purposes of securitising them.  My experience is that one would choose loans attracting the very lowest risk and with the cleanest of files attaching because otherwise one could not sell them on the market.  The very best loans have to be selected.  We are talking here about loans which might not be in the very best state.  We also find ourselves in a situation where the providers of the services were the originators of the loans and where a back-office deal was done to sell a securitised block of loans.  This provided liquidity for the relevant banks and allowed them to kick on.  In my estimation, what is involved here is completely different.  As Mr. Crowley intimated, the reputation of the financial institution which originated the loan is not at stake.  An SPV or an SSPV might have been set up and the lender in question might have its origins in Malta but it might be regulated here.  As we have seen with the insurance corporations, this can prove problematic when it emerges that the parent company has no assets other than its portfolio.  In the event that this portfolio has exposure to loans which are not performing fantastically well, can the lender decide - as a result of the fact that it has taken a hit in respect of some loans and that other loans are in arrears and there is non-compliance in respect of them - that the best way to deal with its losses is to increase its variable rates?  This would mean that the segment of the portfolio to which I refer would be carrying the remainder of it.</p><p>  Are lenders of the type to which I refer in a position to make a claim to the Central Bank to the effect that they can justify increasing variable rates on foot of the fact that certain loans are not performing as well as they might?  If representatives from one of the main financial institutions were present, they would refer to their mortgage and commercial loan books, the blended rate relating to their cost of funds, interest rates and other specific matters.  Where an SPV is involved, it can legitimise the increase in variable rates solely on foot of the fact that some of the loans are not performing.  If Mr. Crowley is in a position to allay my concerns in this regard, I would be somewhat more satisfied with what is proposed.</p></speech>

I would certainly draw a distinction between securitisation special purpose vehicles, SSPVs, and the SPVs that are now being used by those who are purchasing loan books from banks.  The SSPVs are set up to take sets of quality mortgage assets - as the Deputy suggested - SME loans, credit card loans or whatever and sell them to a very wide base of investors throughout Europe and across the globe.  The emphasis in this regard is very much on quality.  I do not know all the ins and outs but I think there are provisions within those securitisation vehicles to ensure that the quality is maintained.  If a lot of the loans involved go sour, they are backed out and better loans are put in.  I cannot be sure of this but I have some sense of what is involved.  As a result, these entities are very different animals from the SPVs we have been discussing.  There is a general lack of substance around those SPVs.</p><p>  The question posed by the Deputy is a difficult one.</p> <p>The loan contract with the borrower transfers across.  In the end, whatever rights that loan contract confers in variation of rates and so forth, also transfer.  How the new purchaser plans to apply those to terms and conditions within that contract is up to them.  I refute the suggestion that existing banks would look for an increase in variable rates to cover losses on other mortgage loans.</p></speech>

However, potentially, a proposal legitimatising an increase in a portfolio bought through a SPV, special purpose vehicle, which has difficulties with some of its loans, could be put to the Central Bank.  The SPV is isolated in its entity.  A great many conditions exist between the originator of the loan and the equity from whoever bought it.  The equity firm cannot make onerous demands of the provider and the originator of the loans as it could damage their reputation.  Will a provision be introduced where the originator of a loan cannot hike up interest rates and they are kept at an average?  I am concerned that an argument could be made to the Central Bank that a SPV is not making money and interest rates on the loans within it need to be hiked up.</p></speech>

According to public documentation available, they have sold these portfolios at a very deep discount.  Accordingly, they have already bought a mix of performing and non-performing loans, be they mortgages or SME loans.  Based on international practice, we would expect some of these firms or funds to then sell on those loans.  What they are looking to do is to maintain the loans for a period and then, once conditions improve, sell them on.  The Central Bank has used the term &ldquo;stickiness&rdquo; to describe the resolutions that have been put in place.  The committee has heard from some of our member banks about the level of stickiness of the resolutions that have been put in place.  There may be anecdotal evidence, to which FLAC, the Free Legal Advice Centres, alluded that not every resolution will remain in place and there will be changes.</p></speech>

If the bank still has skin in the game or has some risk exposure to those loans, then it does not get that deleveraging effect or capital benefit.</p><p>  On one level we cannot be confident there will not be an increase in the rates of the loans in question.  The individual bank selling the loan portfolio is in a position to regulate the interest rate that will be charged by the purchaser, although evidence to date would suggest none of the purchasers have sought to increase interest rates.  Their focus has been on curing or improving the status of the debt they have.  They bought it at a deep discount and have gone about improving its status and performance through restructuring, etc.  My sense of it is that their interests are in curing the debt so they can sell the portfolio on at a profit.  It would not be to their benefit to raise the loans&rsquo; interest rates to cover losses in the portfolio.</p></speech>

It unilaterally raised the rates on seven variable interest rate mortgages belonging to a couple, one mortgage on their principal residence and six on their buy-to-let properties.  The couple complained to the Financial Services Ombudsman that this increase did not refer to any increase in the European Central Bank rate which is at an all-time low.  The ombudsman upheld the bank&rsquo;s right to change the interest rate according to market conditions.  That was extremely vague to say the least.<br/>Most consumers with mortgages or other loan agreements do not read the small print.  Anyone who has read the terms and conditions of a mortgage agreement will know it is extraordinary the amount of latitude credit institutions give themselves.  It is scary in the extreme.  If some of these purported rights that the creditor reserves for itself were exercised, the borrower could find a loan called in for the most spurious of circumstances.</p></speech>

That is very strong language for public servants to use.<br/>I believe we should enforce the contracts lock, stock and barrel, as Mr. Paul Joyce said.  So what if a bank sold a tracker mortgage to, say, someone who bought a petrol station which was bypassed by a motorway.  <i>Caveat emptor</i>should apply to the purchasers of these loans.  They should not be allowed entertain any hope that they can change the contracts.  When we discussed this with the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, in the Seanad, he was keen those borrowers with such loans should be protected in these situations.  Firms must exercise due diligence and have a better idea of risk than those who drew up the original agreements.</p> <p>That is what they bought.  The contract is the contract.  The property rights of the other parties remain absolute.  The property rights of the other parties remain absolute.  The terms of the agreement stand.  In the end, there is a change on the name of the cheque or the name of the direct debit.  I do not want to form any relationship with whoever now runs the mortgage.  I am fulfilling my part of the deal.  It is about time some aspects of financial services in Ireland grew up and accepted that, rather than attempting to renegotiate deals with individuals after they have bought packages from one of the failed banks.  I think that is what the Department is trying to do.  I hope the negotiations in that regard go well.</p><p> I believe the property rights of people must be protected in the legislation.  I refer not only to the people we are discussing, but also to others, including the tenants if a buy-to-let landlord is bankrupt.  The former Minister, Deputy Shatter, was particularly interested in the protection of tenants in such circumstances.  Similarly, if the bank has gone bankrupt - not the person who holds the mortgage - it should be made quite clear to the purchasers that this is what counts.  Reference has been made to the institutions we own.  I think that is irrelevant.  If it were relevant, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, would come under all sorts of pressure because we own shares in banks.  The public interest has been expressed.  I remember the example was used of pressure being put on the post office to reduce interest rates on savings and thereby help the institutions we own.  They have done all the damage.  I do not think we have any further obligations after the &euro;64 billion to do anything else for them.  That should be made clear to anybody who wants to buy loan books from Irish banks.</p></speech>

I am beginning to struggle to understand what is the problem with keeping these vehicles or shelf companies.  Given that they all seem to be so nebulous and small, etc., what harm is done by keeping them?  Of course the person servicing the loan and doing the negotiation must be held to account.  What is the problem with also recognising the need to keep the owner in the frame when it comes to redress for the consumer?  Our colleagues in Banking and Payments Federation Ireland have made the point that we should hold the servicers to account because they have extensive reputations and assets.  In that context, it is even more worrying if we are selling on these loan books to entities that have neither reputations nor assets and are out of the frame entirely.  I am no longer seeing the logic of what this change is about   We will be taking it back to the Department of Finance if this is the continued proposal.</p></speech>

A number of them were asked by Deputy Spring earlier.  I first came across securitisation some time around the early to mid-1990s.  My understanding of securitisation at the time was that if a person had a loan with Bank of Ireland and it securitised part of his or her loan, he or she continued to deal with that bank and that was grand.  As far as that person was concerned, there was no difference in what was happening.  As Mr. Joyce has set out, we are now dealing with three very different situations.</p><p>  I am aware that there are people watching this programme on Oireachtas TV whose loans have been sold as part of a package to an unregulated entity, or who fear that their loans will be sold on in that way.  They are wondering how such sales change their positions.  We have covered some of that ground.  As we have said, there is uncertainty about loans that are sold before any legislation is enacted.  Is that correct?  I think that is correct.  Officials from the Department of Finance have told this committee that most of the loan books that have been sold to date have been sold to entities that have voluntarily said they will comply with the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  As a solicitor, I question how robust that would be as a security to me if I was tossing and turning in bed at night and worrying about my debts.</p><p>  We have covered the question of whether the terms of the original contract with the lender will continue to hold water as we go forward.  Deputy Spring mentioned the issue of interest rates in this context.  When that came up last week, the Governor of the Central Bank made it clear that the Central Bank has no role in setting interest rates.  Is it not the case, therefore, that there appears to be no protection in terms of interest rates?  An entity that buys a loan book might decide, for whatever reason, to vary the terms of interest on some of the better-performing loans to beef up the return on the books.  There does not seem to be any prohibition on doing that, in spite of Miller, which is under appeal.  That is my first question.</p><p>  My second question is one that many people ask.  Why would a bank want to sell a performing loan book?  I think the answer is that many of these loans are not performing.  Therefore, there has to be another agenda.  That is what people are afraid of.  In the current improving property market, there is a fear that those who buy loan books, particularly those who might want to maximise on them, are not effectively prohibited from acting in an aggressive fashion, refusing to engage in forbearance and going to sale as quickly as possible.  My reading of this is that there is no effective prohibition.  My engagement with the code of conduct on mortgage arrears leads me to believe it is so easy for a borrower to be in breach of the code that a lender, or indeed somebody managing the loan book on behalf of its owner, can simply decide to step in at any number of points during the process.</p><p>  Mr. Joyce made the point that approximately 10,000 cases have gone into the courts in the last short period of time.  Questions have to be asked about aggressive behaviour.  How can we protect consumers?  Obviously, we can beef up the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  Problems arise when those who buy loan books that are not necessarily in the most robust condition decide they want to cash in on rising property values.  Mr. Crowley made a point about reputation in this context.  That is fine when it comes to existing institutions, as there is still a great deal of trust in the market between some of the traditional lenders and customers.  Many of those who have sold on loan books no longer have skin in the game, as somebody said.  They do not really give much thought to their reputations.  Reputation will not save anybody.  As we know from other types of credit and the activities of some credit collectors, for want of a better word - some of them would be closer to the sheriff's office, or wherever it happens to be - the behaviour of the people who are administering loans can vary substantially.  The behaviour of one person who is acting to enforce a loan can be very different from the behaviour of another person who is seeking to do so.</p><p>  I will put my overall question.  Will what is being proposed here protect people whose loan books have already been sold?  I think the answer we have been given to that question is "No".  I believe the code of conduct on mortgage arrears is still way too weak and too easy.</p> <p>In the case of joint borrowers, for the sake of argument, where there is one non-co-operating borrower, it is easy to abandon the code of conduct on mortgage arrears at any point in time.  In spite of the legislation and the Government's stated desire to protect people, is there any real, effective protection in the legislation for vulnerable borrowers in the face of someone who buys a loan book and is only interested in maximising its value?</p></speech>

I agree completely with the Vice Chairman's point that declarations of non-co-operation are made by lenders in relation to borrowers whose standard financial statements seem to never have arrived at the lenders' offices.  We have seen it.  Declarations are made where bits and pieces of information have gone missing and where there is a couple who have separated and one of the borrowers fills out the standard financial statement but the other borrower does not wish to do so.  There is a multifaceted definition of non-co-operation in the code of conduct on mortgage arrears and we do not even have figures from the Central Bank as to how many cases of non-co-operation lenders have declared since the code was amended in July 2013.</p><p>  Furthermore, there is an expanded suite of so-called "alternative repayment arrangements" set out in the legislation.  However, the lender is only obliged to pursue those repayment arrangements which it chooses itself to offer and has no obligation to offer any alternative repayment arrangement.  It seems to me that if I was the acquirer of a loan portfolio, I would not be too worried about the code of conduct on mortgage arrears and would be putting in place the processes required to tick the boxes under it knowing that there was no right of appeal.  If one looks at the website of the Financial Services Ombudsman, that office has made it abundantly clear that it will only deal with complaints related to abuse of process under the code and will not review the three crucial decisions that can adversely affect borrowers under it.  Those are a declaration of non-co-operation, a refusal to offer an alternative repayment arrangement and, therefore, to declare the mortgage unsustainable, or to offer such a restrictive alternative repayment arrangement that the borrower refuses it and is then adjudicated to be outside the process.  When one finds oneself in that position, the MARP no longer applies and legal proceedings can be brought against one within three months of the lender informing one that one is outside the code.  To put the tin hat on it, there is no legal aid available for defendant borrowers who find themselves on the receiving end of proceedings.</p><p>  We have set out in the submission the recent comment of the Governor of the Central Bank that he believed - or seemed to suggest - that many defendants in legal proceedings for repossession were non-co-operators.  While some are not co-operating, many borrowers who have co-operated right through the process are now in the Circuit Court facing repossession proceedings.  It is one thing to put in place the same protections for borrowers of all creditors, but are the protections themselves adequate in the first place?  We are at a very critical juncture where we await the Central Bank's quarter 3 figures, but we know that in the first six months of the year there have been over 6,000 repossession applications.  The numbers have mushroomed.</p><p>  Simultaneously, the restructuring arrangements under the mortgage arrears resolution target set out by the Central Bank are quite slow.  If one looks at the statistics, progress is quite slow.  The number of arrears cases have declined, but we are not even sure whether there is double counting going on.  There is a lot of capitalising of arrears going on, which is bizarre as it would appear to involve a higher instalment being paid by a borrower who was already in financial difficulty.  While some people's situations have improved, it is not the 25,000 odd who have been offered arrears capitalisation.  Whether it is the original lender or the purchaser of debt, consumers are very vulnerable and nothing seems to have changed.</p></speech>

At an overall level, data is provided in detail to the Central Bank by our members, in particular every quarter, as they are obliged to do.  The Central Bank has also requested that each of our members provide it with details of the solutions they have in place.  There is a long list of alternative repayment arrangements that are available to borrowers.  It depends on each individual circumstance which is why the Central Bank introduced the standard financial statement which requires the borrower to go into each aspect of his or her financial situation in a great deal of detail.  It is a very difficult experience for many people and we agree absolutely that it is very challenging for them.  It is why in many of the longer term solutions proposed the banks will pay for independent advice, which the borrowers can achieve themselves.  In many cases of long-term arrangements, the banks will pay towards legal advice.  That is the case.</p><p>  The Vice Chairman referred earlier to banks selling their books.  The majority of the sales which have taken place to date are from banks that are either winding down their operations in Ireland or have been forced into making the sales.  We do not see a lot of existing lenders who want to stay operating in Ireland selling on their books.  If one looks at some of the banks based in the UK who had a substantial mortgage business in Ireland and have parcelled off the loans, there is a mix of good and bad in there.  Based on the information we have and the experiences we have seen, in the majority of cases where there is a mix, they are trying, as Mr. Crowley said earlier, to get the flow and to get the loan cured if at all possible.  That is where they will make their money back when they decide to move the asset on.  That is the nature of those types of company and the way they invest.  They buy the asset at a reduced price and look at the improvement in the economy.  They would not be here buying these books unless they saw that there was a benefit to them in the way the economic circumstances are changing.  That leads then to an increased level of cure.</p></speech>

They buy the asset, as Ms Murphy puts it, with a view to moving it on when the economic circumstances improve.  Like I say, the market is improving so house prices are rising.  The difficulty here is that the asset is my home.  Their profit lies in turning over my home which boils down to getting it out of my possession and onto the market.</p></speech>

Their interest, as Ms Murphy has explained, is in curing the loan.  It is not about forcing people out and repossessing their homes.  It is absolutely not that.  It is very much that if they can cure the loan and make it more cash-flow positive, they can then sell that portfolio of assets to another investor.  It is the world we live in and I am not saying it is a particularly nice process, but these people are not buying these loans to go through a repossession process to force people out of their homes.  There is no question about that.  There is also no question of them coming in here with a view to using the contracts that are in place to force up variable rates.  There is no evidence of that.</p><p>  The other thing I would say at the risk of repeating myself as it keeps coming around is that the existing contract between the borrower and the lender and the rights it confers on both parties are transferred, in the phrase someone used, lock, stock and barrel to the purchaser.  It does not put the purchaser in a position to vary the underlying terms of that contract.  It gives them a right to exercise the existing terms and conditions of those contracts.  It does not give them the right to renegotiate or vary the terms.  I am not a lawyer but I am comfortable on that one.</p></speech>

To set the scene for my contribution, I am always last.  Even though one might see me first, I must be the last to contribute even though we have a very good Vice Chairman.  That is because I am not a member of this committee because I was removed from it on 3 July 2013 and I am not allowed to be a member of any committee because of a conscience vote.</p><p>  This is an area in which I have a lot of experience.  I am interested to hear that the law does not improve the scene when the ownership of a loan moves from the original owner or lender to a new owner.  However, as the Vice Chairman and Mr. Joyce said, the actual small print terms and conditions, which become magnified when things go wrong, show that it was a very unclear position at the start and that everything is massively weighted in favour of the lender.</p><p>  Let us think about the lender.  The lender was part of a class called the banking or financial services sector, which is becoming the financial self-services sector.  This sector allowed its balance sheets and the financial engineering of the domestic banking economy to become absolutely dangerous over a period of about seven years through a credit pyramid system, effectively a Ponzi scheme.  The sector is now trying to repair that financial engineering on balance sheets which involves the sale of loan books by those institutions that remain, some of whom want to get out, as Mr. Joyce mentioned, and some of whom see that there may be some point in staying as interest rates change and they manage the interest rates differentials of what assets they have created and whether they are on fixed or variable and so on.  </p><p>  I remember back in the 1990s when there was some sort of good behaviour in banking that many of the banks with the exception of ICC Bank where I worked did not even define what the interest rate base was.  They talked about the prevailing average cost of funds but that could be anything.  If banks had stupid boards of directors, that could work out at 20% or 30% if they were paying too much for their funds.  Their cost of funds is whatever they pay.  It was not even related to what one could call objectively defined rates.  Sometimes it did.  It was the Dublin interbank offered rate, Dibor, or the Euro interbank offered rate, Euribor.  As we have learned, they were then manipulated and fraudulently changed by the biggest banks in the world which cumulatively are paying fines of &euro;140 billion for their reckless breaking of the law.  I am afraid that I think the little people are again put in very vulnerable situations.  It is up to us to correct this.  </p><p>  I will tell the witnesses a short story in 50 words.  Ernest Hemingway wrote a short story in six words.  It read "For sale: Baby shoes, never worn."  Mine is 50 words.  W. Ross Jnr. made a profit of &euro;500 million on an investment of &euro;290 million in Bank of Ireland shares.  He was the largest single shareholder in the bank apart from the State.  He was the most influential director on the board for the two years and ten months he held that investment.  Having sold it for a &euro;500 million profit and having been the most influential director on the board forming the policy of the bank which we know is not to have any principal write-down on any loan even in loan restructurings, which is absurd to me as a financial person but that is what it is stating is its policy, this man took his &euro;500 million profit and went back to the US.  He has no investment or interest in or directorship of the bank.  That is a short story.  That is the reality - &euro;500 million.  It is stark as the death of poor Jonathan Corrie on the steps outside the D&aacute;il 48 hours ago.  This is the modern Ireland in which we live and it is not right.</p></speech>

What do those letters stand for?  They stand for "out of operational control".  That is my experience.  Mr. Joyce has given very good case evidence and I congratulate Ms Blackwell on her contribution to "The Pat Kenny Show" this morning which discussed how after five years as a tenant and having been fully up-to-date on her rent, a lady called Svetlana found herself, her son and her husband locked out because a bank acted without giving any information to her or her family as to why it was locking them out.  That is another true story that is about 30 words.  We really need to wake up in Ireland.  The Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland appeared before the committee last week and I would say he was doing his best but the best is in a fog - a labyrinthine fog that has been left behind that nobody has had the guts to clear up honestly.</p><p>  The banking losses were not the figure of &euro;64 billion in the domestic banks that we all talk about and that one can see and tot up on balance sheets.  If one includes the banks that operated here that were not owned in Ireland like KBC, Danske Bank, Rabobank and Bank of Scotland (Ireland), one can see that the domestic banking sector's losses in Ireland were &euro;135 billion, not &euro;64 billion.  That is nearly 70% of our GDP.  That is mind-blowing compared to anywhere else on earth in the past 20 or 30 years.  </p></speech>

We really must wake up and be honest and banks have to stop faffing around and get real.  I know that they are not actually responding meaningfully, to use their own terms, to people.  I know this because I am dealing with about five cases at the moment.  I know that their boards of directors are refusing to meet professional representatives in cases where those representatives based on the evidence and the facts of the case have a far more sustainable resolution for the cases in hand.  They refuse to meet them.  How dare they?  They mandate to people who are given orders that there shall be no principal loan write-downs in the restructurings.  How dare they do that when it is measurably calculable how culpable they were in creating the credit Ponzi scheme?  Both AIB and Bank of Ireland measurably on their balance sheets are culpable in the creation of the credit pyramid at a level of 70% of the credit bubble.  Why?  It is because their loans to deposit ratios, which are the proper funding for the assets they create, were out of control at 160% of deposits, which is the mainstay funding for their balance sheet asset creation.  This is very wrong.  They are trying to correct those balance sheets by selling these loan books and letting people take the consequences, which is wrong.</p></speech>

I am asking one question that relates to agreements that have been reached relating to distressed loans where the loan book has been sold on.</p> <p>Given that the situation has been evolving in recent years and that the actual agreements <i>per se</i>may vary in terms of their robustness, is there enough protection for agreements that have been reached between lenders that are selling on loan books and customers?

They are all subject though, by and large, to periodic reviews.  Even where an arrangement is put in place by one lender who subsequently sells on its loan book, I do not see anything in the code of conduct on mortgage arrears that would stop the incoming purchaser from changing the goal posts at a financial review.</p><p>  We do also have to remember the code of conduct on mortgage arrears is precisely that; it is a regulatory code.  Its admissibility in legal proceedings is certainly open to question.  It does not form any part of the corpus of secondary or primary legislation in the State.  I would tend to say &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Once there are in-built reviews, even if the incoming purchaser were to honour the arrangement until the review, I do not see how they could be prevented from altering it after that.</p></speech>

If an agreement is in place with a borrower when the portfolio is sold to another purchaser, whoever that might be, our belief is that it should remain intact.  Presumably that applies when a bank holds a portfolio, and excepting if the circumstances of a borrower change the contract or agreement between a borrower and existing lender or new lender should remain in place as far as we are concerned.</p></speech>

The same thing applies to life assurance companies.  I have personal experience of the situation.  They now advise customers who hold a convertible life policy that they are obliged by the Central Bank to advise in the interests of customers that the policy could be sold or transferred to a third party in a secondary market.  I looked at the original policy I took out in 1980, which I converted in 1989.  The policy was written by Norwich Union but is now controlled by Aviva.  Nowhere in the original policy was there even a hint that it might be sold or transferred to another company.  I would not take out an insurance policy with a new owner if the original policy was sold.  That is fundamental.  The same applies with lenders and borrowers.  It is a relationship, it is not just an asset.</p><p>  Ms Murphy spoke about the details submitted to the Central Bank by the banks.  I would hold that in the past ten years the information and details from any of the banks in this country submitted to the Central Bank are hugely unreliable, starting with the loans that were listed for the purpose of transferring to NAMA.  It was a joke.  The provisions were a joke.</p></speech>

Her impressive CV speaks for itself.  Members will be aware of the work she has undertaken in her home country and her international reputation.  At one stage she was regarded as one of the most powerful women in the world.  That is a very good CV to have.  It is important to highlight how much she has done in her country.  In her term as Attorney General the level of crime fell.  Obviously there were other issues as well.  As her country still suffers from poverty and corruption, it must be very difficult for her as a lecturer in Georgetown University to see what is happening in her country at the moment.  We can see what can be done when a person such as her gets that job and does her job.  Unfortunately, she was sacked for doing her job, which is very difficult for us to comprehend.  We are delighted to have her here this afternoon.  I am sure she will be able to address the committee first and then answer questions from the committee members.<br/>I ask members and those in the public gallery to ensure that their mobile phones are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting as, even in silent mode, they cause interference with the recording equipment in the committee rooms.<br/>I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses, or any official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br/>Dr. Bailey is very welcome.  She is a lawyer, academic, human rights defender, social activist and former Attorney General of Guatemala.  It is a great CV to have.  We are delighted and privileged to have her appear before the committee this afternoon.  I thank Tr&oacute;caire for organising this visit.  I ask Dr. Bailey to make her presentation.</p></speech>

I thank all the members for attending to hear about our work in Guatemala.  As members may know, Guatemala had a conflict that lasted for more than three decades.  We signed peace accords in 1996 and we have some of the worst gross human rights violations.  The truth commission documented more than 200,000 killings, and torture, rape and genocide.  Even in the peace accords there was a commitment against impunity by the government and by the guerrilla forces.  Ten years after the signing of the peace accords the situation in the country about security, justice and violence was really bad.  We have a really bad situation regarding homicides and gender violence as in Honduras and El Salvador - the three countries called the "Northern Triangle" in Central America.</p><p>  The answer of the state to all this violence really was impunity.</p> <p>Because of this crisis and insecurity, and because we understood that organised crime has infiltrated the institutions in the justice system, the Guatemalan Government asked the United Nations for help and in 2007 a commission against impunity was established in the country.  This is a unique commission because it has the power to investigate crimes and to present charges.  With the commission in place changes began to take place.  We have new authorities in the Supreme Court, new authorities in the police and a new general prosecutor.  We started working as a team with the other institutions in the judicial system and changes began to appear.  We were able to investigate, arrest and sanction drug traffickers.  We were able also to investigate gangs - there is a problem also in Honduras and Guatemala - involved in murder and extortion.  We were able to give a better response to gender violence.  For the first time we were able to bring to justice a former Head of State who has been charged for crimes against humanity and genocide.  We have a sentence, a conviction, the first one in Latin America, in a national court for genocide and crimes against humanity.  The sentence lasted only ten years.<b></b>It was then annulled by the constitutional court.  The trial and the conviction were really important for the expansion of the rule of law in the country because it sent out a message that this type of crime should not happen and that the voice of the victims is heard by the justice system.  Given that we have these advances there are some challenges because we have new authorities, a new general prosecutor, and a new magistrate to the supreme court.  We need to ensure there are no setbacks in what we have achieved.  I will leave it there.  I do not know if Ms Blanco wishes to add anything.</p></speech>

This year alone 799 human rights defenders have received threats or been attacked, an increased from previous years.  The people who are mostly attacked are human rights defenders who work on truth and justice, so this is a backlash from the genocide trial.  Environmentalists are also attacked.  Although Guatemala is a signatory of the ILO Convention on the right of indigenous peoples to be consulted about any extractive industry or any enterprise to be set up in their territory, there is no legal framework in Guatemalan law to implement it.  Therefore, the efforts on consultations have mainly taken place on behalf of civil society.  As Dr. Claudia Paz y Paz Bailey mentioned, Guatemala is one of the most violent countries that is not currently in a conflict situation, particularly in respect of violence against women.  On average, two women are killed every day.</p></speech>

I have read the detailed documentation provided.  It would make the hair on one's head stand on edge, especially if one is a woman in that society, or one of the indigenous people.  It is horrendous.  I congratulate the witnesses on their work.  Obviously, without the rule of law any society is destined to be a failed state.  The United Nations is playing a role.  I note it was happy that the former head of the prison service was arrested and sentenced to 88 years in jail.  With the political interference that the witnesses allege is happening in the composition of the Judiciary, does the United Nations play a role in trying to counteract that?</p></speech>

That is why it is so important that its mandate is renewed.  It may end in September but the Government could ask the United Nations if it could continue for two further years.  Ireland has supported this.  That is one of the most important things because it has proved to be an independent body that could investigate corruption, organised crime and the infiltration of organised crime into the Judiciary.  That is one of its most important roles.  The international community also has an important role in monitoring the advances not only in ordinary justice but also given that there may be another trial in January against Efra&iacute;n R&iacute;os Montt, the former Head of State.  The possibility that this person could be sanctioned again would be strengthened if there is an observer process in place from the international community.</p></speech>

I visited Colombia. We are always reading about the horrors of Mexico and the problems of indigenous people in Guatemala.  We have a letter from the Ambassador of Colombia dealing with the problems of mob law in the port city of Buenaventura.  Is there something that we in the West do not understand about the region?  There is a level of violence, not just against women but internal violence.</p><p>  Our trade links are very weak.  Only for Tr&oacute;caire we might not hear a great deal except what we hear about Guatemala in the national media.</p><p>  It strikes me as strange for a right wing government to recognise Taiwan, state its opposition to the US embargo on Cuba and recognise the Palestinian state.  How does one square those three facts with a right wing interpretation of world politics?</p></speech>

Even if we have a stranger in the institution, it is still weak.  Murders take place in border areas where the drugs go from Honduras to Guatemala through the north and the money and armaments come back.  It is drug related because organised crime has the power to pay so that they can kill with impunity.  The prosecutors, police officers or judges are faced with this choice, that is why an independent institution is so important.  I would not say the Government is on the left or the right, I think what is important is to see what is happening inside Guatemala.  There is the issue of debt.</p></speech>

There is no political will to introduce tax reform measures in the country so that revenue cannot be reinvested in strengthening education and-or health.</p></speech>

It would be important to hear that.  I know that Tr&oacute;caire's regional director for Latin America, Sally O'Neill, who is based in Honduras, is a trojan worker for Tr&oacute;caire and has done great work.  She rang me to tell me Mr. O'Keeffe was coming before the joint committee.  I thank her for the work she is doing on behalf of Tr&oacute;caire.  It is great for an NGO such as Tr&oacute;caire to be working in the Latin American region.</p></speech>

It is similar to other countries, where we have been working on human rights issues, such as Rwanda, and the past few years in Kenya and Palestine.  Human rights issues and engaging in supporting local activists, human rights defenders, is an important part of what we do.  My colleague, Ms Blanco, can speak about our programme in detail.</p></speech>

The transitional justice work would be a comprehensive approach to justice not only in terms of legal access for victims of the conflict but also psychosocial support, for example, with regard to exhumations.  The exhumations help people to bring the grieving cycle to a close but are also helpful as a testimony for the trial on genocide and other trials that have taken place.  We work with women who were sexually assaulted during the conflict providing psychosocial and legal supports.</p><p>  In terms of human rights defenders we are working with some international bodies, such as Peace Brigade International and some national organisations that provide training on security and help design security measures for organisations.</p><p>  Deputy Byrne made the point about the weak trade links between Ireland and Guatemala.  There is a signed EU association agreement with Central America.  The commercial pillar has already been rolled out in Guatemala but one of our requests is that the democratic clauses which have not been implemented yet, would be put in place.  That would be our way of being able to monitor human rights abuses.  We would encourage the European Union to move that forward.</p></speech>

My questions reflect the questions that have already been asked.  The figures for gender-based violence are appalling.  I was aware that there was a high level of violence against women in Guatemala because my daughter spent some time there and found it a beautiful country with beautiful people.  I was quite happy when she left because I was aware of the violence, but I was not aware that it was so appalling.  One only sees that level of gender violence in war situations where there is conflict.</p><p>  It states that 97% of crimes go completely unpunished.  That can happen only when there is political support for that to happen.  Does the Government lack the will or the ability to enforce the law?  Is the Government that weak?  Does the Government accept it?  Is it a legacy of the war that violence just becomes acceptable?  Is there anything we can do as a country or as a member of the European Community to help the women in particular?</p></speech>

A few years ago, violence against women was not a crime in Guatemala.  It was sanctioned in 2008.  We did not have the specialisation to address the issue.  The steps are now in place and are working in certain areas but not throughout the country.  They need to be applied throughout the country.  Deputy Mitchell asked if it was a matter of political will.  I think the political will is there to address these issues, not just gender based violence, but to strengthen the judicial system and to give access to justice to all the population.</p> <p>What should be observed is whether there is enough respect for the independence of all of the powers in the republic and enough support for judges, prosecutors and human rights defenders to do their job.  The European Union has a role to play, as does Ireland, in supporting the job done by human rights defenders and the International Commission against Impunity, and in asking our government whether it is doing enough to address gender violence.</p></speech>

Were serious threats made to her life, particularly from drug barons and other groups in Guatemala?</p></speech>

What happened to me, victims, human rights defenders and judges working on genocide cases was a dirty campaign against us whereby it was stated we were not pursuing justice but committing acts of revenge.  This was difficult because it made the discussion about something it was not.  We had a duty to investigate crime, and if someone has committed a crime he or she should be sanctioned.</p></speech>

Will she expand on this?  I am surprised the European Union is not more assertive in exposing what is happening or influencing the situation.  The human rights situation in Guatemala does not have a high profile in Europe.</p></speech>

Perhaps I did not emphasise the role of the European Union, which has been very supportive.  It has provided &euro;20 million to strengthen the judicial system, and I ask for this to continue.  I also ask the European Union to monitor abuses of human rights defenders, to monitor the independence of the judiciary, and to support politically and financially the International Commission against Impunity.</p></speech>

Dr. Paz y Paz Bailey spoke about 700 women per year being killed.  Is this the figure for this year?  What was the level of deaths of women prior to the peace accord?  The documentation we received states the Guatemalan president campaigned on a policy of zero tolerance in his election campaign in 2011.  Is he likely to be returned?  What is the position of opposition parties, or the alternative government, on the level of crime in the country?  Would a change of government improve the situation?  In the event of a change of government, does Dr. Paz y Paz Bailey sees herself returning as attorney general, given the good work she did prior to removal in May 2014?</p></speech>

We have new authorities in the judiciary system and a new general prosecutor, and we shall see whether they continue in this way or whether they take a step back.  We should wait and see.  I have been in the United States and I hope to return to Guatemala soon, perhaps not as general prosecutor but as a professor, which was my previous job.</p></speech>

After the signing of the peace accords the amount of violence increased again.  We have higher levels of violence now than we did when the peace agreement was signed.  This is linked to organised crime, gender violence and trafficking.</p></speech>

Deputy Byrne referred to Colombia, where recently matters have improved very much as a result of the commitment by the president to give rights to the people.</p> <p>Is there any opposition leader who stands out in Guatemala who can give leadership and persuade the people he will get rid of the violence and corruption under a new government?  How strong are the opposition parties?  There is now an opportunity for the Guatemalan people to decide their future, and particularly who they will vote for in the forthcoming elections.  Have the elections been fair or corrupt?  Has there been vote-rigging?  Have the elections been monitored by international bodies?</p></speech>

However, what I can say is that they are very weak.  They live for one election and after that they change, dissolve or form another party.  The whole system of political parties is weak.  For example, the two parties that signed the peace accords now have only one representative out of 150.  One of our biggest worries is that along the borders, organised criminals linked to narcotics trafficking have a lot of money and they influence and finance the campaigns.  That is another part of the problem.</p></speech>

I apologise for not having heard the contributions but I will have a chance to read the written record of these proceedings.</p><p>  The Chairman asked about the level of corruption.  Obviously, the prevalence of violence has to be a source of concern to the international community.  According to one of the documents I read, greater visibility is required in respect of the relationship between the European Union and Guatemala.  I refer in particular to highlighting the difficulties that face human rights defenders and those concerned with the administration of justice and judicial independence.  Apart from raising this with our Government and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, what effective measures can we implement through the European Union to help in dealing with those very serious issues?</p></speech>

One is the implementation of the human rights clause on the association agreement between the European Union and Central America.  Dr. Pas y Paz Bailey did not mention that there will be a summit next June in Brussels, the EU-CLAC summit.  The Heads of State from Latin America should be taking part in that.  It will be a way of entering into dialogue.  The European Union Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders have been in place for the past ten years but Dr. Paz y Paz Bailey encourages the European Union to continue monitoring and implementing the recommendations in the guidelines in Guatemala in terms of socialisation.  The European Union should continue offering political and financial support to the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala, which is a United Nations body.</p></speech>

I presume they will include the President of the Commission, representatives of whatever country holds the Presidency and the European Commissioner for External Relations.  I presume this committee could ask our Minister to seek, in advance of the summit, that these issues be discussed at an EU Foreign Affairs Council meeting.  I presume each member state will not be participating at the summit, but if our Minister raised the relevant issues at a meeting of the Council of Ministers in advance, it might be of some help.</p></speech>

Some 18 countries in Europe have ratified them.  I understand the European Union has an ambassador in Colombia.  Does the European Union have an ambassador in Guatemala?  Having one would help us put pressure on our Minister, who is to attend the Council of Ministers meeting on the agreements.  There was a commitment to have a debate here on the Colombian ambassador.  Is there an ambassador in Guatemala?  If so, we are in a more powerful position to use this committee to impress upon the Minister the need to highlight at his next Council of Ministers meeting all these issues, not only those pertaining to Guatemala.

We will take note of the delegates' comments today and contact the Minister and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to highlight the very serious issues facing Guatemala.</p> <p>It is important that the EU takes an interest.  The ambassador in Guatemala is well aware of these issues.  We will ask our Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to highlight this issue at the highest level.</p><p> In this committee's capacity as the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, we intend to highlight this issue at our meetings with our colleagues from the 28 member states who serve on foreign affairs committees.  Yesterday, a member of this committee attended a meeting on my behalf - I was unable to attend - to discuss the Balkans.  It is hoped that the new high representative and the EU committee would hold a meeting to discuss human rights issues in Latin America.  </p><p> I thank the delegates most sincerely for their attendance today.  I thank Niall O'Keeffe who is in charge of human rights issues with Tr&oacute;caire and Ms Blanca Blanco, Tr&oacute;caire country director for Guatemala.  We appreciate very much the work of Tr&oacute;caire in Colombia which I saw for myself when I visited that country a number of years ago with our now President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins, who was a member of the committee at the time.  That meeting was organised by Sally O'Neill and she travelled with us to Colombia.  It was a very valuable visit because as a result we are still dealing with issues relating to Colombia because the members who travelled there were well aware of the human rights situation.  I am pleased to report that the situation has improved in Colombia and we would like a similar situation to come about in Guatemala where there is a real issue with human rights.  It is up to us as parliamentarians and to the Government to highlight these issues and to ensure that the people of Guatemala are not subject to killings and other punishments which they are forced to endure as a consequence of corruption and the drugs trade.  </p><p> I thank our special witness, Dr. Claudia Paz y Paz Bailey for coming before the committee and highlighting this issue for  us.  I thank her for her work when she was the Attorney General of Guatemala.  I wish her well in her career as a lecturer in Georgetown University and I hope she will make a return visit to this country very soon.  I thank her for the written submission and presentation.

It would make sense that it be brought in as soon as possible to try to assist in the evening out of the market in terms of the distortion that currently exists therein.  Perhaps the Minister would outline the reason for its introduction on 1 May.</p></speech>

The idea is to abolish the step effect whereby when a person reaches 21, the cost of health insurance increases substantially, the result being that very often the person does not continue to pay for it or, if his or her parents are paying for it, they discontinue doing so.  The date of 1 May was chosen for two reasons.  First, we were told during consultations with the industry that administratively it would take some time to amend their computer systems and get everything in place.</p> <p>Second, the lifetime community rating loading comes into effect on 1 May.  As such, we believed it made more sense to pick the same date to make both changes instead of requiring the industry to change its computer and administrative systems and pricings twice in the space of five months.  Aside from being administratively complicated, it would have caused confusion.</p></speech>

There has been consultation with the industry, which is something for which I have always called.  Is it not in the industry's interest to try to delay the deadline for as long as possible?  If the industry had its say, this would be delayed for even longer.</p></speech>

This is discretionary and the industry is not required to do it.  If it was mandatory, I would agree with the Deputy, but it is not.  That said, this would make everything more straightforward.  We will run a large campaign, led by the Health Insurance Authority, HIA, explaining the new changes to people in the early part of next year.  It is much easier to explain why things will change on one day than on two different dates.</p></speech>

We need to incentivise young people into the private health insurance market to stabilise it and ensure an important component that has become a buzzword phrase for us, namely, intergenerational solidarity.  Anything that encourages younger people into the market is good.<br/>If a 44 year old enters the health insurance market under the proposed legislation, he or she could carry a penalty for a long number of years.  We believe that once a person has a policy for ten years or more, he or she no longer needs to carry the loaded penalty for entering the market at a late stage.  We have always called for a penalty so as to ensure balance in the market, incentivise membership at an early age and subsidise older people, but carrying the loaded penalty for a long number of years seems too penal.  We suggest that the time be limited to a maximum of ten years.  The amendment is self-explanatory and probably worth consideration.  While we want to incentivise young people into the market, we do not want to disincentivise entry at a later stage.  If entry becomes too onerous, people will not enter.<br/>This reverts to the issue of universal health insurance.  If there is to be no universal health insurance, this penalty is necessary.  If there is, however, then this penalty is superficial.  It will stabilise the market for a number of years, after which we will have mandatory health insurance.  That is the proposal.  The more I look at it and read between the lines, or even read some of the lines, the indication is that this will underpin the insurance market for a number of years.  We should try to get it right so that young people are incentivised to join and older people who take out health insurance, be it because they used to have insurance but could no longer afford it for a number of years because of the downturn in the economy or for some other reason, are not penalised.  Should there not be a withering of the penalty?</p></speech>

This section clarifies that the obligation on insurers to impose lifetime community rating loadings, as provided for in regulations signed into law on 7 July 2014, is mandatory.  The proposed amendment will be considered as part of the review of the scheme provided for in the regulations, which will be carried out by the HIA in April 2017 after the scheme has been in operation for a time.</p><p>  Deputy Kelleher referred to penalties, but I prefer to view them as back contributions for the lengths of time during which people did not make health insurance contributions.  What he has proposed seems similar to what is done in Australia where, if one does not have health insurance until one is 40 years of age, one only pays the loading for ten years.  This seems like a good idea, as people would not have to pay loading for the rest of their lives but, rather, only for eight, ten, 11 or 12 years, whichever is appropriate.  This would not require primary legislation; it could be done by way of regulation.  I am open to doing so, but I do not believe it needs to be done now.  The issue does not arise now, as the measure has only just been introduced.  In principle, though, it is a good idea and I would like to give it proper consideration in the context of the review in one or two years' time when the system is up and running.</p></speech>

It can be done by way of regulation.  As the Deputy stated, the objective is to encourage people to enter the health insurance market before they reach 35 years of age.  It may transpire that they will not bother taking out health insurance because they do not want to pay the loading for the rest of their lives.  Even if that is not the case, paying a loading for ten years may be enough.</p></speech>

Many people want to have private health insurance but cannot afford it.  Their circumstances may change but, by that time, they may be over 35 years of age.  Even though they want to become involved, they will be penalised.  The Minister called it a "back contribution", but it will cost them money either way.  If it is just the case that regulation can change this measure, though, I will accept that.</p></speech>

A decision on it has not been taken yet.</p><p>  As the Minister and Deputy Kelleher would know, this is an area for which I do not have any great passion, but the Deputy makes a compelling case.  I can understand the logic of the case he makes.  I would not buy the Minister's view that this is either retrospective, arrears or back payments.  People did not have a benefit when they did not have insurance.  One cannot retrospectively apply entitlement.  If one were to view it in the way that the Minister describes, should we then be able to claim for hospital costs that we incurred over the period of years that we did not have the cover?</p><p>  I agree that, for people joining late, it would be a disincentive if the penalty were to apply for life.  That simply would not be tenable.  While it is Deputy Kelleher's call as to how he proposes to proceed with his amendment, there is no certainty in what the Minister says about looking at this issue in a review in the time to come.  There is no guarantee that whoever may be looking at it will take a particular view.  I would hope that common sense would apply if that were to be the approach and that the full evaluation would recognise that this would indeed be a disincentive to people joining late.  So, I would like to support the case made by my colleague, Deputy Kelleher.</p></speech>

Someone who has health insurance at the age of 60 years gets the full benefits.</p> <p>One can commence health insurance at 55 years, draw down the benefits if one gets ill at the age of 60 yet still get the same benefits as somebody who has paid into the scheme since he or she was 25 years of age.  That is quite unfair and undermines the health insurance system and health insurance.  The whole idea is that people should pay in, generally speaking, when they are young and healthy so that we can all get the benefits as we get older and unwell.  I see it a bit like pensions.  Nobody would expect to start paying into a pension at 55 years and get the same pension benefit when they retire at 65 years as someone who has paid in for 40 years.  That is the way I see it but I understand the point that has been made.  The scheme is provided for in regulations.  Therefore, an amendment would not be to the primary legislation but to the regulations.</p></speech>

There should not be a long-term penalty for a person because of circumstances.  Very often, it may not be because a person does not want to take out private health insurance.  It may be that a person cannot afford to take it out.  Then when circumstances change people may want to lighten the burden on the public health system by providing cover for themselves but they are penalised.</p><p>  I wish to return to the original point.  I would say we are talking about an indefinite penalty but the Minister has called it a contribution.  Either way, it will be indefinite as this legislation is presently worded.  In view of the fact that this Government's primary objective is to have universal health insurance, I would like to know when will this legislation fall.  Will we have a situation when universal health insurance is introduced that people, who are already in the system, will be penalised even further by virtue of the fact that they have taken out insurance?  Will they incur a penalty or have to make a contribution?  What will happen if somebody decides "Why bother as I am going to be forced to have compulsory health insurance at some stage in the future?"  The legislation gives mixed messages.  It is a broader political point but is relevant to this legislation.</p></speech>

I wish to advise members that Deputy Corcoran Kennedy has been discharged from the committee.  Deputy Gabrielle McFadden is her replacement and I am sure she will join me in thanking Deputy Corcoran Kennedy for her service to the committee, in particular her work on compiling an important report on sexual and domestic violence.  I welcome Deputy McFadden here today and look forward to working with her for the next while.<br/>The purpose of this meeting is to have an engagement with representatives from the Licensed Vintners Association and other groups on the topic of aggressive begging on the streets.  I understand a briefing has been circulated to members.  I welcome Ms Deirdre Devitt, the Licensed Vintners Association, Mr. Richard Guiney, DublinTown, Mr. David Brennan, Dublin City Business Association, Mr. Tim Fenn, Irish Hotels Federation, Mr. Adrian Cummins, Restaurants Association of Ireland and Mr. Martin Harte, Temple Bar Company.<br/>I will invite witnesses to make opening remarks of approximately five minutes which will be followed by a question-and-answer session with members.  We will have a follow-up meeting on this topic with other organisations in the new year.  As this is the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality we are interested in public order but are anxious not to stray into other areas such as health and housing which are under the remit of other committees. <br/>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act, 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members should also be aware that under salient rules of the Chair they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/>I call on Ms Devitt to make her opening remarks.  </p></speech>

Our group consists of the CEOs of six business associations which are as follows: Richard Guiney, DublinTown; David Brennan, Dublin City Business Association; Tim Fenn, Irish Hotels Federation; Adrian Cummins, the Restaurants Association of Ireland; Martin Harte, Temple Bar Company and myself, a representative of the Licensed Vintners Association.</p> <p>From the outset we wish to make clear that the business sectors we collectively represent recognise the complexity of the societal issues involved in the interrelated areas of aggressive begging, homelessness and alcohol and drug addiction, that we fully support Government investment via the HSE, the Departments of Social Protection and the Environment, Community and Local Government and Dublin City Council in treatment services and social housing programmes, and that people in these very difficult circumstances must be treated with compassion and dignity.  There is a clear responsibility on the State to assist its citizens in need and we strongly support that.  The importance of co-ordinated action in that regard has been underlined by the tragic death this week of Jonathan Corrie on our city streets.  This was a terrible tragedy and as a group we extend our sympathy to Mr. Corrie's family and friends.  We understand a forum on homelessness is taking place tomorrow and we hope the forum will produce a plan of action to tackle homelessness in the city.  This is a very sensitive issue but it is important to state that it is a separate issue to that which is the agenda of today's meeting.<br/>For the purposes of today&rsquo;s meeting we want to focus our comments on the issue of aggressive begging and the serious implications that has on citizens living and doing business in the city as well as on people visiting the city.  We are here today to provide the committee with a first-hand perspective from city centre businesses that encounter this issue on a daily basis.  Aggressive begging has intensified over the past 12 months and is now at an unacceptable level.  We believe the general public deserves the right to frequent our city centre without harassment or intimidation and our research indicates they are concerned about aggressive begging in this regard.  Whether they are involved in the day or night-time economy, across retail, hospitality or offices, the business community in Dublin is united in its view that the current level of repeated, aggressive begging is negatively impacting on Dublin&rsquo;s citizens and visitors with serious knock-on implications for local businesses.  We will now set out a framework and context to consider this issue.<br/>As the capital city, and by sheer weight of numbers, Dublin is the most important socio-economic urban area in the country.  Some context can be gleaned from following statistics.  Dublin city and county have a population of 1.27 million people.  Economic activity in the Dublin region accounts for 47% of national GDP.  A total of 840,000 people work in the Dublin region, representing over 40% of total employment in the State.  Dublin attracted 3.9 million overseas visitors last year, generating &euro;1.4 billion in revenue.<br/>Our group commissioned the research agency, Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes, to carry out a survey of Dubliners&rsquo; views on the aggressive begging issue in Dublin city centre.  The survey&rsquo;s objective was to determine the level of concern people feel about aggressive begging in town and to measure its impact on visit likelihood and frequency.  Some 524 adults over the age of 18 were surveyed online in the last week of October 2014.  The key findings were as follows.  Nine out of ten, 98%, would categorise aggressive begging as having a substantially negative impact on the attractiveness of the city.  A total of 58% of people feel intimated by people who look for money and beg on the street.  Some 60% feel that aggressive begging has some effect on them visiting town in general.  Two in five people agree that it affects their likelihood of shopping during the day in town, and over half claim that it affects their likelihood of socialising in town at night.  A total of 87% feel there could be greater levels of visible policing in town and the vast majority would like an increased Garda presence.  Up to 70% feel the Garda should be tasked with preventing aggressive begging.  More than two thirds agree that they do not see enough garda&iacute; patrolling the streets of Dublin city centre.<br/>We recognise the critical role played by the Garda in making Dublin an attractive place in which to live, work and visit and we want to acknowledge its outstanding performance in that regard.  All the business organisations represented today have very positive relationships with the Garda and recognise its substantial contribution to the ongoing development of Dublin.  We also recognise the pressure on public finances and the pressure for severe reduction in Government expenditure in recent years.  However, we believe there is now an overwhelming case for substantial additional resources to be made available to the Garda for policing in Dublin, and in Dublin city centre in particular.<br/>According to the annual report of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the total number of garda&iacute; has fallen from 14,835 in 2009 to 13,093 in 2013, a drop of 1,742 garda&iacute;, or 12%, in three years.  Dublin city centre is the public face of the Dublin region and this area has suffered significantly from a reduction in Garda numbers.  In the south inner city alone, one Garda division has seen its numbers drop by over 160 garda&iacute;.  In addition to this reduction in numbers, the overtime budget for the same division station has been cut by 61% since 2008.  This means that not only are numbers down but existing numbers cannot be maximised because there simply is not enough overtime budget available.  This issue is further compounded by the introduction of the new Garda roster which in effect means that Garda resources will be targeted at times of peak demand, namely, Friday and Saturday nights.  However, it also means that there are fewer garda&iacute; available at other times.  This system may in theory be effective in other parts of the State, but a major urban centre like Dublin city operates on a 24-hour basis and demand for on-the-ground policing is required on a daily basis, not just at the weekend.<br/>The attractiveness of Dublin as a city in which to live, do business, or visit would be directly boosted by virtue of higher profile policing presence across both the day and night-time economies.  While the Garda performs exceptionally well with limited resources, there is no doubt the force would benefit from extra resources in Dublin.  We are calling for a three-year strategy, with the required resources, to boost Garda numbers in Dublin back to 2009 levels.  Consideration must be given to deploying the majority of new Garda recruits in Dublin and, as an immediate step, to boosting the overtime budget to facilitate additional on-street policing.  In addition, we believe that a specific, resourced strategy to deal with the aggressive begging issue in the city centre must be developed.  Specific targets should be in place, and increased visibility of Garda patrols across the night-time economy from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m.  There is no doubt that both the public and the business community would like to see a greater Garda presence on our city centre streets.  As the population of Dublin grows and the economic recovery takes hold, there is a pressing need for additional Garda resources to be devoted to Dublin city.<br/>The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act of 2011 was introduced after the High Court found that section 3 of the Vagrancy (Ireland) Act 1847 was unconstitutional due to its vagueness and lack of certainty.  It was also held to represent a disproportionate interference with the Constitution&rsquo;s provisions on freedom of expression and freedom to communicate.  The Constitution guarantees that one has a right to liberty and freedom, except in accordance with the law.  This means that, in general, one is entitled to one's own personal freedom but legislation may provide for one's arrest and detention in certain circumstances like aggressive begging.<br/>While the Vagrancy (Ireland) Act was found to be unconstitutional, the judgment did note that it is undoubtedly so that the right to communicate and the right to freedom of expression can be limited in the interests of common good.  Nothing in this judgment should be construed as preventing the Oireachtas from making laws prohibiting aggressive and intimidating begging.  The 2011 Act provided new statutory measures to deal with begging.  It is fair to say that this 2011 Act never functioned properly in terms of dealing with the begging issue.  The High Court found that the Garda was obliged to establish a <i>prima facie</i>case that the begging took place without legal authorisation.  While the law does provide that a person guilty of the offence of aggressive, intimidating or aggressive begging could be fined or jailed, the Minister of Justice and Equality has observed that convicting people engaged in begging is not a readily workable solution to the problem.<br/>We note the Garda has the power to direct people away from certain places where they are causing a nuisance but that requires a significant, ongoing Garda presence on our streets to provide an effective solution.  As I previously stated, the issue of aggressive begging has greatly intensified in Dublin over the past 12 months and is now at an unacceptable level.  We are calling for a review of begging legislation in light of recent experience, to draw on the views of business sectors, voluntary bodies and the public and to redraft legislation to deal with this issue more effectively.<br/>There are clear concerns among the public and business community about the level and nature of aggressive begging in Dublin.  The solution to this complex issue involves high levels of State support services, an effective legislative framework and increased resources for the Garda.  We trust the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality recognises our concerns and will support our calls for greater legal clarity and increased Garda resources for our capital city.  I thank members for their attention.</p></speech>

She made two main points, one was a call for an increased number of garda&iacute; on the streets and the other is a legislative response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-03a.492" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1017" speakername="Finian McGrath" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014120300003#B00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for their submission to the committee.</p> <p>It was acknowledged in the opening statements that the issue of begging is a complex one.  Given that acknowledgement, why the focus on a policing solution to it?  The term "aggressive begging", was mentioned.  Most of the people we see begging on the streets are sitting passively in a sleeping bag with a cup in their hands.  Perhaps the delegates would define what is considered to be aggressive begging.  It is acknowledged that begging is a complex problem and that those who beg often have issues around alcohol and mental health, yet a policing solution is called for.  Is there not a contradiction in that?</p></speech>

As there are other committees that focus on health and social protection issues we have been asked not to stray into those areas too much.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-03a.495" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1017" speakername="Finian McGrath" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014120300004#C00300"><p>I take the point but I am interested in the organisations' overall analysis of the problem.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-03a.496" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Adrian Cummins" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014120300004#C00400"><p>Where a business owner provides a seating area outside his or her premises where people can sit and have a drink or food and those people are approached every 15 to 20 minutes by a person with a cup looking for money, that in my opinion is aggressive begging.  If as described by Deputy McGrath a person is sitting begging with a cup on front of him or her, that is passive begging.  In a particular geographical location within the city centre in Dublin, there are people continually approaching people asking for money.  If these people do not get money they act in an aggressive manner.  That is my definition of aggressive begging.  Others may define it differently.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-03a.497" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1017" speakername="Finian McGrath" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014120300004#C00500"><p>That is fair enough.  I pose the question because earlier this morning I heard an interview on radio with a gentleman who said that two weeks ago he had offered support to Jonathan Corrie, the man who died across the road from the D&aacute;il, but that he had turned it down and wanted only to talk to him.  He also said he was not in any way aggressive.  The point I am making is that the perception is that most homeless people are aggressive.  Many of the homeless people on our streets are afraid to go into the hostels because they are afraid of being attacked or of having any money they have taken.  The type of begging to which Mr. Cummins referred is harassment, which is a different ball game.</p></speech>

Does Deputy McGrath have another question?</p></speech>

Why was the survey conducted online and why was it not much broader than that?  In my opinion this issue requires a greater focus than those who have access to the Internet.  As a backbencher I know that this issue is regularly highlighted by people who have pubs and restaurants.  Why was the base narrowed?</p></speech>

Dublin City Council conducted a survey in 2012, entitled Your Dublin, Your Voice.  In that survey 36% of people said that these types of issues were the least attractive part of Dublin city centre.  We have conducted our own research.  It was a face-to-face survey carried out in conjunction with another research company and involved 1,028 people.  In that survey, 30% of the respondents said that they choose not to come to Dublin city centre because of a fear factor.  In preparation for this meeting we felt it was necessary to conduct similar research and to make known the results in that regard.  The results of that survey are very much in line with previous surveys.  There have been many surveys of public opinion on this issue.  The responses are what is said to our staff on the street.  Fear and intimidation is a factor in people not coming to Dublin city centre.  This is what we are discussing today.  The feedback from people who live in Dublin to the many surveys conducted has been fairly consistent in terms of the fear factor that exists.  There is a perception that Dublin is not as safe as it should be.</p></speech>

The current complement is in the region of 13,000 and as announced last week by the Minister a further 200 garda&iacute; are due to come on stream.  The delegates have called for an increase in the number of garda&iacute; on the beat implementing current legislation.</p></speech>

On the way to the hotel where I stay when I am in Dublin on D&aacute;il duty, I come across a plethora of people who are begging, some of whom are aggressive and others who are passive.  Every now and again I feel obliged to help because that is what a person would want for their brother or sister if in that situation.  At other times my thinking is that if a person were to give to every begging person, they could quickly become homeless themselves.  That is the scale of the problem on our streets.  Everything that has been said by the delegates resonates with my own experience of this issue.  It is a complex and troubling issue but it is also not unique to Ireland.  As this is obviously an issue in other cities, have the organisations researched international experience in this area?</p></speech>

We have looked at models in other countries and in this regard have been in regular contact with the City of Westminster in London where begging is also a significant issue.  It is actively considering the use of ASBOs in addressing particularly aggressive behaviour in this area.  It has commissioned a range of studies on the issue over the past ten or 15 years and tried a whole range of initiatives, including diverted giving and so on.  The belief is that it has worked to some degree and discussions on re-introducing it next year are ongoing.  We are working closely with the City of Westminster, its associations and police around the introduction here of the use of ASBOs in relation to those persistently involved in aggressive begging, which is a behaviour.</p></speech>

It is a difficult issue to which the response must by its nature take a multi-agency approach.  Policing obviously is one aspect of it, but consideration also must be given to social services, housing services and all of that.  In addition, one must be realistic in this regard.  I would argue that some of those who are involved in begging, albeit in a minority of cases, are engaged in a criminal enterprise and that warrants a policing response, not a social response.  Some of the begging I have witnessed has been criminal behaviour.  I have seen women being pursued up Grafton Street aggressively and intimidation would be a gentle description of some of those scenes.  I must state such incidents are in a minority, as the majority of begging involves people with a cup, which I always find really disturbing.  The witnesses have appeared before this committee today, the ambit of which includes policing and legislation.  I commend the witnesses on their good and constructive presentation.  Are they willing to work with the different agencies?  Would they be willing to be part of a task force to consider how this matter might be addressed?  This issue has been neglected for far too long and must be addressed.  It is not fair to the majority of people who find themselves in that position and is unfair to citizens who are faced with this difficult challenge to their conscience.  People are decent and experience a terrible feeling that they have failed someone when they walk past him or her without giving something.</p></speech>

As for working with other groups, in 2012 we were part of a group looking at perceptions of Dublin that consisted of ourselves, the Garda, Dublin City Council and homeless and drug charities.  It is important to note that much of the time, one is talking about perceptions.  Dublin is a very safe city, its crime rates are good relative to other cities but yet there is this fear factor.  To put it in context, in the Your Dublin, Your Voice survey of 2012 to which I referred, 74% of people indicated they felt safe in Dublin by day, while 35% stated they felt safe in Dublin by night.  I attended a meeting with colleagues in Liverpool who told me their statistics showed that 99% of people there felt safe by day and 70% by night, and this is the kind of range into which we must get.</p><p>  I believe all the business groups would be happy to work with people in homeless charities and with those who are providing drug services because there should be a holistic approach to this issue.  Mr. Martin Harte has mentioned ASBOs and, in general, that is how this issue is dealt with in the United Kingdom, particularly the aggressive type of begging about which the Deputy spoke.  Some interesting research was conducted by a lady called Dr. Susan Fitzgerald, who is with the University of York, on people who had been served with ASBOs.  She found that in the majority of cases in which people were in genuine need such as, for example, people who had been engaging in certain anti-social behaviour on foot of addiction difficulties or whatever, they were very well served when, on being served with an ASBO, they were put in touch with social services.  Such people got a caseworker who would meet them and note how they found themselves in such difficult circumstances.  The caseworker would outline the services available to them and could help to organise them, fix the appointments and so on.  Dr. Fitzgerald found that in a significant majority of cases, this was highly beneficial for the individual concerned.  In addition, as an ASBO is not a criminal sanction, one is not giving people a criminal sanction when in fact they have social issues with which they must deal.  There certainly is great scope for considering all those issues together.</p></speech>

Do they have statistics or data available on the issue of on-street begging they could provide to members that would break down the percentage of those who are begging and genuinely are so doing to survive and those who engage in begging as part of a criminal racket?  It is known that some quantity of begging arises from people being forced onto the streets.  Do the witnesses have information in this regard?</p></speech>

A point I wished to make was that where we have seen an increase in Garda deployment for a limited time, whereby the Garda may put in place a number of additional garda&iacute; on a street over a short space of time, one will see those involved in aggressive begging moving to another area.  Consequently, one is moving them on to another area.  When the Garda conducts an operation in a certain part of the city, one will see movement of aggressive begging to another part of the city.  However, the gist of our call is that greater visibility of garda&iacute; on the streets will lead to a decrease in such activity.  Moreover, if that is coupled with giving the Garda additional powers to tackle aggressive begging, then the problem will be sorted out.</p><p>  In response to Deputy Mac Lochlainn's point about businesses getting involved, we would be delighted to so do but there must be actions on this issue within a fairly brief timescale as we cannot be here in three years' time talking about the same issue.</p></speech>

It is indicated or alleged to members, either anecdotally or factually, that there is an issue with methadone treatment centres for these people in or near the city centre.  Is this the view of the witnesses?  In addition, how would the witnesses deal with such an issue?  What is their view on the location of treatment centres for people with such addictions?</p></speech>

One point that is coming out clearly in this discussion is the need for a proper assessment of the needs of people who are involved.  I refer in particular to aggressive begging and repeat that this is not a begging issue but concerns aggressive begging, which is a behavioural piece.  We have no evidence and while there may be anecdotal views on certain things, it is not evidence.  Consequently, I would not like to draw a link between one and the other, for clarity.</p></speech>

As public representatives, we receive many complaints from business people regarding the amounts they must pay in rates and on what they receive in return from local authorities.  Are the witnesses satisfied with the service they are getting from their local authorities?  Are they satisfied that the local authorities also recognise the issues they are raising today are part of a wider issue with which they must become involved?  I could link that question back to the homeless situation, for example.</p></speech>

We are on the same wavelength that it is a complex problem between a social and a judicial issue.  We have a business forum at which we meet the city officials and the Garda to discuss a range of issues, of which this is one.  As that has just been initiated, we must find out how it will progress.  Ratepayers across the city would like to see a more fast-tracked solution to the issues by which they are affected.  It is one of the top items on the agendas of ratepayers.  In my association and perhaps also in the other associations, this is an issue they want to have resolved.</p></speech>

There are complex issues in this regard.  We cannot really define who and what are involved in this aggressive begging but we must have a structure to deal with it.  People should not be obliged to deal with aggressive, menacing and fear-creating behaviour.</p> <p>When people go about their business in the streets, they should be able to enjoy facilities in the same way as everybody else.</p></speech>

The fact that Oireachtas Members know many of the witnesses means that they are effective in lobbying.  I am glad that they defined aggressive begging because I wondered what it was.  It is a phenomenon in most cities, but it is difficult to find best practice in dealing with it.  I suggest the best way of dealing with it is a summit similar to what is being proposed tomorrow to deal with homelessness.  This has to be dealt with head on.  It is not good for the city and is certainly not good for those who are begging.  If such a summit or task force, to which Deputy Mac Lochlainn referred, were established, it should include representatives of the groups appearing here today, together with NGOs, local authorities and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That would push this matter forward.</p><p>  Although technically it may not be considered begging, I would also include people constantly selling lines with buckets.  They can be extremely aggressive.  Would the witnesses consider that to be aggressive begging, albeit by well-dressed people?</p></speech>

I agree with the Senator that it can be a menace, but the issue we are here to talk about is aggressive begging.</p></speech>

On two occasions, somebody came in to the outside area of the restaurant selling lines to people who were having a meal.  I see Ms Devitt's point but one cannot really divide the two.  In my view, it really is aggressive begging.</p></speech>

In the Senator's perspective, it was aggressive.  There have been debates here before about introducing a protocol for charities with buckets on the street.  To answer the question, if somebody is upsetting or annoying patrons in a restaurant, it is not on.</p></speech>

The business owners tend not to have the same control outside for whatever reason.  However, I would like Mr. Cummins to factor it into his future deliberations.</p></speech>

I have no problem with passive begging, although it bothers my conscience and I feel bad for the people.  My worry about aggressive begging comes from my constituency - I presume it is the same in Dublin - where people are transported into the area in an organised fashion by a group or by the "boss".  They are dropped off, left to beg and are then collected in the evening.  They must collect a certain amount of money by the time they return.  Quite often in those situations, women carrying young children are used.  It is often alleged that the children are given something to keep them passive and sleeping during the day so that the parents can beg.  Do the organisations represented here today have any experience of this or is it a prevalent issue for them?</p></speech>

I am very concerned about it.  However, a full study needs to be done into the whole area because that is more than likely part of it.  It is absolutely horrendous that children would be treated in that manner.  We do not have any proof but I have seen it on our premises.  I have had to ask people to leave where my customers are at risk.  It is part and parcel of it but it all needs to be explored as to how much aggressive begging is going on, as the Deputy has described.</p></speech>

In our own jobs, we continually deal with our members who are dealing with the general public.  I am quite happy to speak for all of my colleagues.  We are engaging but we are happy to engage even more.  As regards the question, however, we do not have facts.  This is one of the reasons we are here before the committee.  It has been suggested by two members of the committee that a forum should be set up and empirical research undertaken.</p><p>  As businesses dealing with clients, we know there are views that our city has deteriorated in the past year and, hence, we are appearing before the committee today.  Deputy McFadden and Deputy Finian McGrath have asked for fact-based evidence and we would like to see this brought forward.  We would all assist in that.  It would be marvellous if this subject were to be taken out and aired.  That is why we are here today.</p></speech>

I agree with the opening statement that the issue is inter-related with homelessness, as well as alcohol and drug addiction.  Before 2011, I was a member of Dublin City Council's city development board.  I remember this issue being discussed and some of the witnesses here might have been at those meetings.  The question of begging in the city centre was discussed then.  We invited the chief superintendent from Store Street Garda station to that meeting because we felt the problem was not being dealt with.  I recall the chief superintendent saying that garda&iacute; were reluctant to bring these cases to court because the courts themselves were reluctant to deal with them.  That may have concerned the Vagrancy Act, but since then we have seen the Public Order Act 2011, although the witnesses say that has not made much difference either.  This is not a new problem.</p><p>  Have any of the witnesses met senior members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at Store Street or Pearse Street?  If so, what result did they get from them?</p></speech>

There are four of us sitting here who attend meetings together and we deal with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on an ongoing basis.

That is a criticism of the fact that many of these centres should be out in the suburbs where people could get the services they require in their communities rather than having to come to the centre of the city to congregate.  Often they are begging in order to get their bus fare home.  Do the witnesses have a view on that?</p></speech>

This issue has arisen a number of times in my constituency, particularly in Malahide and Swords.  The witnesses all have a great deal of experience of the issue based on their submission that I have just flicked through.  I missed the contributions from some of my colleagues.  However, based on the references made, there is a clear need for an evidence-based approach to this.  Perhaps at tomorrow's forum we will see some empirical data placed into the public domain and hopefully this committee will get an opportunity to weigh in on the matter.  We can talk about providing housing all we like, but at the end of the day a number of individuals will be involved in progressive begging, including a number in my constituency.</p><p>  I am a keen observer of people; given the career path I have chosen it is a fairly obvious trait of a politician.  One of the attributes of progressive begging I have observed in the city centre is the organised nature of it.  Travelling home or into this building in the morning it is fairly obvious when I see a spotter standing off in the distance with a group of other individuals approaching people in a forthright fashion.  I would not necessarily determine that it would be aggressive, because in my experience that tends to happen when the streets are quieter, perhaps at night when there is less footfall and when a person is isolated, chased and hounded for cash.  It has happened to me and I have had reports from other people.</p><p>  The submission refers to the need for legal clarity regarding the 2011 Act.  This committee is always looking at legislation that might need to be rethought, reformed or created if there is a gap.  Deputy Kenny spoke about the reluctance of the courts to proceed with cases.  I firmly believe it is the law of the land and therefore they are obliged.  However, I understand the Garda's issue with providing the necessary evidence.  What is the witnesses' view of the 2011 Act?  What parts of that Act require clarity?  The courts have suggested it so I wonder if the witnesses have a view.</p></speech>

That matter is dealt with in section 5 of 2011 Act.  I understand the Garda prepared what it considered to be a very detailed file for the DPP, but the DPP did not proceed with it.  I understand there is vagueness around that section and there is a view that it would be almost impossible to get a conviction under section 5, and it needs to be looked at.</p><p>  Deputy McFadden spoke about children.  Section 247 of the Children Act 2001 is used extensively to deal with children brought into the begging equation and that has been quite successful.</p><p>  On general begging, as some of my colleagues have mentioned, there is vagueness on the implementation of that and whether the garda&iacute; need to verify that someone has a permit to collect money, perhaps involving asking questions in languages other than English.  There are certainly aspects of the legislation that need to be clarified.</p></speech>

On the organisation of it, there is no hierarchy with, for example, one person organising four or five from a business perspective.  However, from an organisational point of view an aggressive beggar might have his own patch.  So he is going from one business to another, doing his route.  These businesses have a density of customers or visitors outside their premises.  They go in and 20 minutes later another person will come around to the same patch again.  That is the organisational level of it.  If we give the Garda the powers to stop that activity, we will solve the problem.</p></speech>

Over the past almost four years I have had perhaps half a dozen complaints specific to my constituency - I have had others over the operation of what are commonly known as "chuggers".  The aggressive element I came across on Mountjoy Square in August 2011 was a particularly difficult set of circumstances, involving a young woman with a child and an individual - I referred to him as a spotter - who was organising and harassing people, including me, walking down the street.  It was after rush hour but before nightfall.  That experience left its mark on me.  I can imagine how upsetting and off-putting that would be for a tourist.  That is why it is necessary to have the data that have been mentioned.</p><p>  My last question is on the lack of enforcement of legislation.  I thank Mr. Guiney for bringing to my attention section 5, which I will certainly look at.  My major issue is with the number of garda&iacute; available.  Clearly when there is an increased presence the problem tends to go elsewhere.  Even if they are not aggressively begging, if garda&iacute; are going to question them, they may not show up in the same location, which may undo the sort of area Mr. Cummins mentioned.</p><p>  If the opportunity was presented to the various organisations represented here to weigh in on a discussion on the 2011 Act, I presume they would participate in that-----</p></speech>

As part of any alteration to existing legislation, would the witnesses propose any additional items not contained in the 2011 Act which could be introduced to assist businesses, particularly pubs and restaurants, which at the end of the day, are the ones suffering most?</p></speech>

We have come across examples of a woman and a child outside premises.  As that is a social care issue, the advice to the business-owner is to inform social care straightaway that this is happening because they cannot have patrons coming in the door of their premises constantly being asked.  However, when children are involved, it is automatically a social care issue and that is the first port of call.  We would be delighted to get involved in any further discussion on improving the legislation.</p><p>  What was the other question?</p></speech>

I have two questions.  If there was only begging and not aggressive begging, would that be considered a solution?</p></speech>

It has existed for a very long period of time and, unfortunately, it will continue to exist for a very long period to come.  Aggressive begging is a behavioural issue.  People feel menaced, intimidated and threatened.  It is that behavioural element we wish to tackle and not begging itself.</p></speech>

In light of the various comments about a task force or a forum, is it the case that there is no evidence or research which could be of assistance in terms of the problem of aggressive begging?  If that is the case, does responsibility for that lie with Government, business, civil society groups or elsewhere?  When we review legislation, which is one of the key calls made to us, different groups provide evidence but research is often available that assists the review process and makes it more effective.</p></speech>

However, there is a line item on the Garda PULSE system to record instances of aggressive begging which the garda&iacute; come across or which are reported to them.  It is a specific category.  That is one way to assimilate relevant data.  Currently, there does not appear to be any research or data which we can hand to someone to say these are the facts and figures relating to specific aggressive begging incidences in the city; that is how many people are engaged in it and the frequency of it in the capital city.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-03a.557" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/978" speakername="David Stanton" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014120300008#G00900"><p>A number of issues have been raised.  One is the need for quantitative and qualitative research in the area.  Another concerns legislation and the need to strengthen and take the vagueness out of the Act.  I invite the group, if it wishes, to revert to us on what it would like changed and how, for example, to specify sections which should be removed or inserted in the Act or how they should be worded.  The committee can then engage with the two Houses to have it done, urgently and quickly if necessary.  This is something we could do and we could include the amendments in a criminal law Bill, if necessary, in some shape or form.  If the group wished to do that, it would be very helpful.  The other issue concerns the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, as Deputy McGrath has pointed out, there are extra garda&iacute; coming on the scene as we speak and hopefully many more in the not too distant future.</p><p>  I wish to draw the witnesses' attention to some work we did ourselves some time ago.  Mr. Guiney mentioned anti-social behaviour orders, ASBOs, and quite insightfully pointed out the fact that, as part of the ASBO regime, there are other supports which are given to people who may have personal and other problems.  We did some work earlier in the year on community courts.  An integral part of this is the support structure that would be in place.  Dublin City Business Association was involved in that at the time also.  In cities such as New York, the community courts appear to have worked extremely well, effectively and quickly with the support structures that were tied to them.  The committee proposed that one would be established in Dublin on a pilot basis.  It might be another way of dealing with the issue.  They work by having the person who caused the offence before the court almost the next day and he or she is almost invariably asked to do some community service.  However, the person is also supported in other ways, such as socially, psychologically and sometimes financially.  I note the penal reform report recently issued by the Department is in agreement with the committee on this issue and states it is something that should be done.  That is hopefully being worked on as we speak.</p></speech>

I know it has already been made here today, but I wish to reiterate it.  It is on the issue of policing resources.  Garda&iacute; have been getting substantial press currently, and over the last year or so.  I have been working with them for 15 years and, from my perspective, they do a tremendous job.  I wish to reiterate that.  They take abuse not only from the media and ourselves, but from people on the streets.  That has to be recognised.  They do a very good job and we fully support them.</p><p>  The issue of resources is key.  The south inner city has had 161 garda&iacute; since 2009.  I appreciate the significant economic constraints over the last number of years, but the additional police, while it will increase the numbers, will not deal with the issue of resources.  As part of our submission, we are seeking additional attention to be given to Dublin city.  We would say that because we are based in Dublin city, but it is important.  Issues such as rostering, which can be dealt with in a non-resource way, could also be examined.  From our conversations with the police, we believe that could assist in freeing up resources to deal with other issues.  I wish to put that on the record.</p></speech>

This is part of the problem.  Therefore, we need someone who will deal with this particular issue.  The community courts would be a part of the solution.</p></speech>

In truth, unlike most other Supplementary Estimates, as the committee will see in a few minutes, this is not the Department of Defence asking for more money.  Essentially, this is about facilitating the movement of money within the Defence Forces to deal with an issue with Army pensions.  Also, within the Defence Vote, this is about facilitating the purchase of a new ship because there was an opportunity to buy one at good value.  We will have an opportunity to discuss the matter.</p><p>  I thank the committee for the opportunity to present, for its consideration, the 2014 Supplementary Estimates on Votes 35 and 36.  Vote 35 is the Army Pensions Vote and Vote 36 is the Defence Vote.  They are two separate Estimates.  I shall commence with a short statement setting out the background to these Supplementary Estimates.</p><p>  For 2014, a Supplementary Estimate is required to address a net shortfall of &euro;4.8 million arising on the Army Pensions Vote, while a technical Supplementary Estimate is required within the Defence Vote to facilitate payments under the naval vessel replacement programme.  At the outset, I should explain that the Supplementary Estimates sought are on an Exchequer neutral basis and all additional funding requirements will be achieved from within the overall Defence sector envelope for 2014.</p><p>  I will start with the Army Pensions Vote which makes provision for retired pay, pensions, allowances and gratuities payable to or in respect of members of the Defence Forces.  The 2014 Estimate provides a net sum of &euro;215.4 million for the Army Pensions Vote.  However, the net outturn this year is expected to be &euro;220.2 million, leaving a net shortfall of &euro;4.8 million.  This amount will be funded by savings on the Defence Vote.</p><p>  Subhead A.2 is the largest subhead of the Army Pensions Vote.  It covers expenditure on all superannuation benefits for former members of the Permanent Defence Force and their dependants.  It accounts for over 95% of all military pensions expenditure, including gratuities, and is primarily demand-driven and non-discretionary.  The original provision of some &euro;210.6 million for this subhead will not be sufficient to meet all requirements for the year.  A shortfall on this subhead of the Vote is estimated at &euro;6.12 million. </p><p>  The principal reasons for the shortfall in this subhead are the continued underlying increase in the numbers of retirement pensioners being paid from the Vote and the ongoing impact on pension payments of the exceptionally high numbers of retirements on pension in previous years.  In addition, many retirees continue to be in the long service category and are, therefore, entitled to maximum retirement benefits which contributes to the increased costs.</p> <p>The numbers of Defence Forces pensioners has continued to rise during the past year, and, currently, there are some 12,000 military pensioners of all categories paid by the Department of Defence, a net increase of some 1,000 since 2007.  Some 1,770 military personnel have retired on pension between January 2010 and the end of last year and it is anticipated that another 240 will have retired on pension by the end of this year.<br/>The increasing number of retirements has resulted in a reduction in the number of serving personnel; however, in line with the Government&rsquo;s objective of maintaining the strength of the permanent defence forces, I am happy to inform the committee that a targeted recruitment campaign has so far seen the enlistment of 385 permanent defence force recruits, 37 cadets and 15 aircraft apprentices in 2014.  Three medical officers have also been appointed.<br/>The overall supplementary requirement on Subhead A.2 will be offset by expected savings of &euro;1.42 million on Subheads A3, A4, A5 and A6 of the Army Pensions Vote.  A shortfall of &euro;100,000 is now expected in receipts, and it is intended to meet this from surplus receipts on the Defence Vote.  When all issues are taken into account, the net shortfall on the Army Pensions Vote is &euro;4.8 million.<br/>I would now like to turn to the Defence Vote<b></b>where a transfer between subheads within the Vote is required to facilitate payments under the naval vessel replacement programme.  By way of background, earlier this year, An Taoiseach, who was then Minister for Defence, announced<b></b>that an order was to be placed for a third new offshore patrol vessel for the Naval Service.  This was provided for under the existing contract which has already delivered the first vessel, the <i>LE Samuel Beckett</i>earlier this year.  The second vessel, the <i>LE James Joyce</i>, will be delivered in 2015.  By taking up this option under the existing contract, the Department of Defence ensured that the third ship would be bought at 2012 prices and would not be index linked.  The acquisition of these modern new vessels, combined with a continuous process of refurbishment and repair, will ensure that the operational capability of the Naval Service is maintained.<br/>The 2014 Estimate provides a net sum of some &euro;640 million for the Defence Vote.  Payments relating to the purchase of ships are made from the Naval Subhead, A11.  The original 2014 subhead allocation for this subhead was &euro;36.6 million, however, due to increased commitments under the naval vessel replacement programme, the projected outturn on this subhead is &euro;69.4 million.  An adjustment within the Vote of &euro;32.8 million is therefore required.  Offsetting savings will be met from the pay and allowances subheads on Vote 36 as follows: &euro;25.8 million on Subhead A3 permanent defence force pay, &euro;1 million on Subhead A4 permanent defence force allowances, &euro;1 million on A5 reserve defence force pay and &euro;4.999 million on Subhead A7 civilian employees pay to provide for the technical Supplementary Estimate of &euro;1,000.<br/>The purchase of the three vessels will all have been funded directly from savings generated within the Defence Vote &ndash; a considerable achievement when viewed against the economic backdrop of recent years.  This has been made possible through careful monitoring and management of expenditure within the Department and the prioritisation of this essential project while also maintaining a focus on the delivery of other key outputs.  The acquisition of these new vessels, with the latest equipment, will ensure that the Naval Service will be fully equipped to carry out its day-to-day roles in meeting Ireland&rsquo;s obligations in the areas of fishery protection, maritime safety and security.<br/>I take this opportunity to wish all retired Defence Force personnel and those serving in the Defence Force, as well as the reserve Defence Force personnel a happy Christmas.<br/>The Estimates reflect the reality that the pensions bill has increased somewhat but we have accommodated it within our Vote.  We have taken the opportunity this year to make a further acquisition under the fleet replacement programme in the Naval Service.  We are saving the State a considerable amount of money by availing of the offer from the yard in which the third ship will be built.  The careful management of pay and allowances has allowed us to accumulate the money to do that while at the same time the Defence Force will be at its full complement of 9,500 serving personnel at the end of the year.<br/>I will be happy to answer questions.</p></speech>

I apologise for being late but I was at the National Missing Persons Day commemorations at Farmleigh House.  It was a poignant and moving event.  I thank Deputy Farrell for standing in for me.  Our practice is to go through each subhead individually as that gives members the opportunity  to comment on each subhead.</p><p>  We will start with Vote 35 - Army Pensions.  Subhead A1 - Army Pensions Board, this subhead covers the salary of the secretary of the Army Pensions Board and fees and expenses of the civilian members.  There is an additional requirement of &euro;70,000.  Do members have questions?</p><p>  As nobody wishes to comment, I will now deal with Subhead A 2 - Defence Forces (pensions) schemes and payment in respect of transferred service.  This subhead provides for the payment of all superannuation-type benefits by way of pension and gratuity to former members of the permanent defence force and their dependants.  The subhead also provides for payments in respect of transferred service.</p></speech>

Are there lessons to be learned on making projections?</p><p>  We have discussed the issue of Defence Force personnel who must retire at a certain age, although individual members feel they are physically capable of continuing to serve.  Would the Minister consider allowing personnel to remain in the Defence Force?</p></speech>

If the hoped for amendments to those requirements are not reached, would particular provisions need to be made in terms of the Department's pension provision into the future?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-03a.583" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2014120300003#B00600"><p>Let me put things into context.  I was appointed as Minister to this Department half way through the year.  In my role as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine I know every single line of the Estimate because I have been involved in the preparation of the Estimates over a three year period.  The Department of Defence has a really efficient finance team and I have learned a great deal but I have a great deal more to learn.</p><p>  The ongoing funding of Vote 35 remains a considerable challenge for future years and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is well aware of the position and the context.  There are particular difficulties, however, that are unique to the Defence Forces in terms of predicting retirement and turnover patterns.  This can contribute to greater than expected expenditure in a given year.  This is due among other things to the availability of early payment of a person's pension benefits immediately on retirement after relatively short periods of service, regardless of age.  The timing of a person's actual departure is largely set by his or her own choice.</p> <p>Basically, we make an Estimate at the start of each year.  The Vote has been very tight because of the pressure we have been put under by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, as every Department has, so we try to calculate very accurately Vote 35 without any head room.  In the other defence Vote, there are many other expenditure variables that the Defence Forces must factor in, so there is normally a little more head room.  With pensions, we try to make calculations as accurate as we can as want to have some focus.  That is non-discretionary funding but we want to focus as much funding and flexibility as we can on Vote 36, which essentially deals with the financing of our current Defence Forces and the Reserve Defence Force and so on.</p><p> I have provided the explanation, sequence and history of the 21-year rule but I can provide an update.  This was going through the arbitration process within the Defence Forces and there was no final agreement on it.  It has now gone to an independent arbiter to make a recommendation to me.  I have very deliberately made the choice not to get involved with this outcome from a political perspective.  We want a recommendation that is as fair to the Defence Forces personnel as is possible, particularly with regard to flexibility, but which is also good for the broader Defence Forces in terms of age profile, fitness levels, facilitation of new entrants to the Defence Forces and so on.  We should not forget that when most of these personnel started, it would have been on a five-year contract that would have been extended and extended again as contracts drew to a close.  Some Defence Forces personnel are now coming to the end of the 21-year period and, unfortunately, have not been promoted as there was not space or they have not managed to reach that level.  We are trying to achieve an outcome in the best interests of the broader Defence Forces and the fulfilment of obligations in a safe and efficient manner.  We are trying to maintain an age profile appropriate for the Defence Forces while at the same time ensuring that if people have built skill sets over a period, we would try to avoid losing those skills if appropriate.  Other issues, such as fitness levels, would also be taken into account.</p><p> We should have an outcome in this regard relatively soon, and I expect it within a couple of weeks.  I hope the outcome will be politically acceptable and make sense both for the Defence Forces and the personnel involved.  If people are to leave the Defence Forces, we have an obligation to prepare them as best we can.  If a person comes out of a structure, having been part of it for 21 years, the world can seem quite intimidating, even for people as disciplined, fit and sharp as those in the Defence Forces.  There is an obligation to ensure we have prepared people as best we can for the new challenges they face.  These are relatively young people coming into the work force.  Ironically, they would be about my age, in their early 40s.</p><p> The average age of the Permanent Defence Force personnel now is 35 and 68% of them are under 40.  We made strategic decisions some time ago to change the age profile of the Defence Forces and that has been a very successful project.  We now have one of the fittest defence forces and we can be proud of that change.  Nevertheless, I know there is concern within families for people now coming to the end of the 21-year period.  They are concerned about their future income and so on, so we are trying to be as flexible as possible without undermining the reason behind the project, which is to maintain an appropriate age profile for a relatively small but what needs to be a very flexible and fit Defence Forces.  That relates to some of its assignments, particularly abroad.  I am going to southern Lebanon tomorrow and going on to Golan, and I will meet members of the Defence Forces there.  That is where our two biggest contingents abroad are now, and people do not need me to remind them of the dangers in those missions.  This is why we need fit, sharp and flexible young minds, as well as the experienced minds, in our Defence Forces.  I hope the outcome will be acceptable to everybody, or at least as close to that as possible.</p></speech>

This subhead provides for the payment of all superannuation-type benefits by way of pension and gratuity to former members of the Permanent Defence Force and dependants.  The subhead also provides for payments in respect of transference services.  Expenditure under this subhead is demand-driven and non-discretionary.  The amount provided in the original Estimate under subhead 2 for 2014 was insufficient for what transpired.  Between 2007 and 2013, the number of retired Permanent Defence Force members and dependants paid from this subhead rose from 9,962 to 11,406.  The current figure is 11,472.  In 2014, in the period to the end of October, a total of 389 personnel have left the Permanent Defence Force, and this includes people who retired without entitlement to pension benefits.  More people left the Defence Forces than we were expecting and a large percentage were entitled to the pension levels.</p></speech>

The increased Estimate is essentially an extra &euro;6 million, as we have discussed.  There are some savings with some of the other subheads.  The overall increase in the Estimate is &euro;4.8 million.  That is the net increase transferring from one Vote to another.</p></speech>

There is not currently sufficient money in the pensions Vote.  This is an unusual Department as there are two separate Votes.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine essentially has one Vote, although it is split between capital and current spending.  This Department has two separate Votes, with one specifically relating to pensions for former Defence Forces personnel.  The other Vote is essentially for the running of current Defence Forces infrastructure and all the people in it.  As there is a slight shortfall in the pension provision, we are providing &euro;4.8 million from the running costs of the Defence Forces and putting it into the pension pot to make up the difference.  That is what we are asking people to approve.</p></speech>

Is any of the provision of &euro;9.4 million being paid to members who have left the force as a consequence of the use of lariam?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-03a.595" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2014120300005#D00100"><p>The straight answer to that is I do not think there is any connection between the payment and lariam.  We can check the matter and revert to the Deputy.  The note I have states that payments under subhead A3 comprise disability pensions and gratuities granted to former members of the Defence Forces.  Currently, there are 774 recipients.  Currently, 225 allowances are paid to dependants for deceased members.  I will get back to the Deputy with the specific detail.  I have a note on lariam generally in terms of the justification for using it, which is essentially still on medical grounds, but I am not aware that people are being paid an allowance linked to disability or injury because of the use of lariam.  I do not think that is the case but I will check the matter for the Deputy.</p></speech>

When one has demand-led schemes, as in the Department of Health, one essentially makes a guesstimate at the start of each year on the basis of patterns that have emerged in recent years.  In some cases we have got them wrong and the Estimates are either slightly too high or slightly too low.  On the previous subhead we got it wrong in that we were &euro;6 million short and in this case the Estimate was slightly too high.  We were out by &euro;4.8 million with the overall net numbers, which in percentage terms is quite small for demand-led schemes.  It is approximately 2%.</p></speech>

Given that the Defence Forces operate on a 24-7 basis, 365 days a year, could an allowance be provided within the budgetary framework the Minister has put before us today for such appointments to be accommodated on weekends and evenings, for example?</p></speech>

The subhead covers the payment of salaries and allowances for civil servants of the Department.  As I understand it, the savings are of the order of &euro;5 million.  Are the savings due to a reduction in the number of civilians working in the Department or the transfer of duties previously undertaken by civilians to members of the Permanent Defence Force or have the savings been achieved by the ending of previous contractual arrangements?</p></speech>

The provision is for &euro;17.951 million and that is more or less what we are paying.  I do not think any savings are proposed in that regard.  There are significant savings later on pay and allowances but not for civil servants in the Department.</p></speech>

To a certain extent, through the Estimates the Minister has presented to the select committee, he is showing himself and his departmental personnel to be perhaps too good at the job they are doing.  They certainly are too good at their job for the members of the Defence Forces because while worthwhile savings are being effected, it is at a cost to the permanent members of the Defence Forces.  I am particularly concerned by the reports that up to 20% of the membership of the Defence Forces is in receipt of family income supplement.  When one comes to the issue of pay under subhead A3 or that of allowances under subhead A4, these are pertinent matters for serving members of the Defence Forces.  While one appreciates the process through which the select committee is going today, one must also appreciate that in respect of both the pay and the allowances that traditionally were paid to serving members, the end of the road has been reached as to what they can tolerate.  While members of the select committee may state this is an exemplary Department, which in many respects it is, one must realise the achievements being pointed to have been achieved on the backs of the serving members, who are paying for much of the progress that is being achieved.  This must at least be acknowledged.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-03a.631" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2014120300006#E00400"><p>Allow me to answer that because the Deputy has raised some fair questions.  First, like many others paid by the State, the pay levels within the Defence Forces are subject to pay agreements that are in place.  Consequently, I cannot simply decide that the Defence Forces will be paid more overnight without a negotiation to do that with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The savings primarily have been made here because even though the full complement of 9,500 members serving in the Permanent Defence Force will be in place at the end of the year, this has not been the case throughout the full year.  Even though people usually leave the Defence Forces when they so choose or sometimes because a contract is up, recruitment campaigns happen in bursts, whereby large numbers come in at any given time.  Most of that recruitment has taken place in the second half of the year and some savings have been made on pay because the Permanent Defence Force has been below the ceiling figure, before returning to that figure by the end of the year.</p><p>  This has allowed the Department to make savings of &euro;25 million in a year when it was planned to spend &euro;422 million, which is approximately 5%.  This is where the vast majority of the savings have been made and the Department then has put that money back in to the Defence Forces directly by taking the opportunity to buy a new naval vessel.  Consequently, it is not as though the Defence Forces have lost the value of these savings as they are being maintained.  However, my Department has sought and has found savings in this area because it obviously is a major expenditure element and comprises &euro;422 million of the overall net Vote of &euro;640 million.  Savings have been made under this subhead largely because of the timing of the recruitment to get numbers back up to the complement of 9,500 members.  This has allowed the creation of some savings, which then have been transferred into expenditure on essential equipment.  In essence, this is what has happened.  I could talk at greater length about these recruitment campaigns and about those who are being recruited, which in itself is a positive story.  Throughout the year, however, the number of personnel has been less than 9,500 and therefore, some savings have been made on foot of that.  It may not be possible to make the same level of savings next year but that is what happened this year.</p></speech>

There is an ongoing assessment under way with regard to some of the pay and allowances within the Defence Forces.  Its purpose is to assess whether they are at appropriate levels and obviously, when those assessments are finalised, I will make the decisions that are appropriate and consistent with them.  For the moment, however, like so many other sectors of the public sector, pay agreements have been signed up to by which the Defence Forces abide.  This is what determines pay levels within the Defence Forces.</p></speech>

One thing I could not discuss with them in detail was the 21-year rule until a recommendation was actually received.  Decisions should not be made on that subject from a political perspective.  It needs to be that a recommendation is made that is then discussed.  I reiterate I am happy to seek a meeting.

This year, up to 10 November, a total of 111 officers and 174 enlisted personnel have been promoted.  The non-commissioned officer, NCO, competitions have just concluded and it is expected that promotions from the panels formed will commence in the near future on or about 15 December.  It is anticipated that once promotions commence, they will continue into 2015, along with ongoing officer promotions as vacancies arise.  It is true to say that until a year or so ago, there were not as many promotions as there had been in previous years.  However, I believe there now has been a return to recruitment and quite a lot of promotions within the Defence Forces because the numbers of the actual overall force are not being cut.  The Defence Forces have made extraordinary changes over the past five or six years in reconfiguring the way in which the entire Defence Forces infrastructure in Ireland operates and interacts.</p> <p>They have shown a remarkable capacity to be flexible in facilitating that.  The number, which is now 9,500, is not going to be cut any further.  That should facilitate vacancies and promotions as people retire as well as new recruitment, as we are seeing at the moment.</p></speech>

The first concerns promotions from the ranks.  If someone is promoted from the ranks into the officer corps, does the fact that they do not have service within it prior to being promoted affect their prospects for further promotion in the officer corps, or is service in the non-commissioned ranks taken into account?  I am aware of some instances where it is not taken into account which leads to anomalies and unfairness.</p></speech>

If he has specific examples, we will follow through on them.</p></speech>

The presentations were very impressive and compelling.  They expressed very serious concern about the commitment of the Department of Defence to their continued operation.  One has further cause to wonder about that when one sees here that the overall allocation is quite modest, and that within that quite modest provision a saving of &euro;1 million is being achieved.  Perhaps it is more appropriate to give the Minister the opportunity to state his position.  All the members of this committee are most appreciative of what the reserve does and we see the potential the reserve has to make a greater contribution to the State into the future.  Maybe against the background of this saving, the Minister could say something positive to us in that regard.</p></speech>

The value for money review was published in November 2012.  Among the recommendations outlined in it was the retention of an Army reserve and Naval Service reserve with a combined strength of approximately 4,000 personnel.  A major reorganisation of the reserve was initiated, overseen by a joint civilian and military high-level implementation group.  A revised strength ceiling for the reserve of 4,069 personnel - 3,869 for the Army reserve and 200 for the Naval Service reserve - is now in place.  Implementation of the value for money recommendations is ongoing.  Issues arising from the implementation process are being address by a high-level civil and military oversight group.  These issues include recruitment, training, regulatory changes, requirements to underpin usage of the reserve in a voluntary, unpaid capacity for tasks aiding the civil authority, and the agreement of proposals for submissions on the future of the first line reserve.  The value for money review recommended that the implementation of a revised organisational approach and the effectiveness of the reserve be formally reviewed.  It was initially recommended that the review take place within a four-year timeframe.  However the then Minister, Deputy Shatter, revised this to three years.  While the review is not formally scheduled at this time, it is likely to take place in early 2016.</p><p>  As regards recruitment, a Reserve Defence Force competition was launched in March this year.  This represents the first intake of recruits following the reorganisation.  There were a total of 1,857 eligible applicants of whom 147 were inducted up to mid-November.  The attainment of the required training levels was a key recommendation of the value for money review.  Reserve personnel undertake both paid and unpaid training.  The review recommended that a paid training allocation in the order of 41,500 man days was required to provide paid training for a full-strength reserve of 4,069 personnel.</p><p>  In case there is any doubt, we are absolutely committed to a strong, well-trained and properly financed reserve force.  My understanding is that there are currently 2,375 active reservists.  We need to get the strength up to 4,069, so we will be actively recruiting.  One of the concerns expressed to the committee was that resources were not being put into training or that savings were being made by taking money from training.  That is not the case.  The reason savings have been made here is that we do not have the full 4,069 but a little over half that.  We intend to address that issue.</p><p>  A total of 20,324 paid training man days were used to the end of October.  The recommendation I read out was for a total of 41,000 man days for 4,069 personnel.  If we have 20,000 man days up until the end of October, which is nearly half of the recommended rate, and we have just over half of the numbers, and that was done by October and does not include the last few months of the year, then we are not a million miles away from where the recommendation says we should be.</p><p>  I am personally and politically committed to building a strong, well-trained and properly resourced reserve.  There is a really strong role for it and I want to reassure whoever is listening or taking note that we are recruiting with some purpose.  We need to get the right people and make sure they are properly trained, which is exactly what we will do.</p><p>  The savings were made primarily because we do not have the full complement of numbers and therefore could not spend as much as we would otherwise have spent.</p></speech>

Throughout the last period when we were dealing with the value for money report and its implications, we were receiving representations and there would be a concern.  The FCA evolved into the Reserve Defence Force.</p> <p>The individuals involved in these organisations across the State are civic-minded, patriotic people who, in the main, are volunteering their services and often are involved in work with various charities.  They are the face of the Permanent Defence Force in local communities.  We are looking at a substantial reduction in budget here and that is cause for serious concern.  I have listened to what the Minister had to say, but it would be fruitful for him to meet these people and hear their concerns first hand.</p></speech>

The new policy thinking is around the concept of a single force.  This means, in effect, we will see a much tighter relationship in the future between the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force in terms of training and so on.  It is one of the major changes we plan to implement in order that the two organisations can work together in a much more cohesive way.  That is what members of the reserve want.  The more interaction they have with the Permanent Defence Force, the more effective they will be in their own roles.</p></speech>

Has the number of civilian employees reduced, for instance?  Have contracts been cancelled and are members of the Defence Forces undertaking roles previously undertaken by civilian workers?</p><p>  Regarding the engagement of civilian medical practitioners, I read in the notes that the Department had recruited two or three additional doctors.  After submitting a parliamentary question recently, I discovered there were 18 serving Defence Forces doctors plus three or four new members.  I understand the complement of doctors stood at 32 at one stage.  I further understand that the Department has contracts of one sort or another with in excess of 30 GP practices throughout the country.  Defence Forces staff are among the healthiest and fittest in the State and the Minister referred earlier to his commitment to ensuring the people who are retained within the Defence Forces are those who are particularly fit.  In that context, it strikes me as rather strange that for a complement of 9,500 personnel, we would have somewhere between 20 and 30 doctors in the Defence Forces and then need, in addition, contractual arrangements with more than 30 general practitioners throughout the country.  On the other hand, I understand the need for arrangements with consultants, but will the Minister explain those arrangements?  Significant savings are being achieved from civilian staff.</p> <p>Are any savings envisaged in this pretty comprehensive and, I suggest, pretty expensive area of medical provision that is very important but also probably very expensive?</p></speech>

The number has deceased from 536 in 2013 to 511 in 2014.  That is the straight answer.</p><p>  In terms of why we are contracting GP practices, that is mainly for medical assessment.  A good deal of medical assessment takes place in the Defence Forces in terms of new recruits, meeting fitness levels and all the rest of it.  We use GPs from outside the Defence Forces to do that because Defence Forces doctors by and large focus on medical needs within the Defence Forces around everything including injury and so on.  I will give the Deputy more detail on that.  The main medical services organised by the central medical unit are generally primary care services, occupational health, physiotherapy, mental health and dental services.  The locations for care vary from individual barracks at home, across the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps to locations overseas which can, logistically, environmentally, operationally, be challenging.  The doctors and medical personnel within the Defence Forces - of whom we need more and attracting doctors into the Defence Forces is an issue - focus on the services I mentioned and then we use GPs as we need them just as the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, uses veterinary practitioners as it needs them.  We use them primarily for medical assessments, which are standard but time-consuming.  I do know why the Deputy is shaking his head but that is my understanding of how it works.</p></speech>

That strikes me as extraordinary.</p></speech>

GPs would be in for about an hour in the morning to do medical assessments.  It is not a full-time contract.  They come in and out as they are needed.  The other doctors or medical personnel who are permanently employed as Defence Forces doctors are there to do some of the work I outlined.  I have a reasonable understanding of this area because we have looked at the Defence Forces medical provision in the context of offering assistance to fight Ebola in West Africa. One of the issues I encountered when examining what we had the capacity to do was that we do not much spare headroom here in terms of extra doctors and medical staff that we can easily deploy abroad in big numbers.  There is an ongoing review in terms of medical provision but we are talking about a very active, physically demanding lifestyle, both at home and abroad, for nearly 10,000 personnel and we need a good qualified cohort of doctors in appropriate numbers to ensure that they remain fit and strong, both mentally and physically.</p></speech>

When we put it in for its scheduled servicing in the US over the summer, it was clear that it had many other  problems.  I made the decision that we were not going to spend any more money on it because I did not think it could be justified or that it represented value for money.  We essentially stopped any more expenditure on that and I will be bringing a recommendation to Government in the coming weeks on what decisions should be made around air transport for Ministers and for the Taoiseach.  We will be doing that in a way that I can assure the Deputy will be cost effective and will represent value for money.  In the meantime we are operating with the existing Learjet which is the smaller of two and has the shorter range of the two but it is doing a reasonable job in the circumstances in which it is operating.</p></speech>

The straight answer to the Deputy's question is that I do not think there is going to be a significant value in it.  We are seeking to maximise that value but it may be sold for parts as opposed to as an aircraft that will be flying in the future.  This aircraft is quite old and has some fundamental problems with its structure and body.  It was due to have its engines replaced in either 2017 or 2018.  We have had to make sensible choices as to where we should be spending money but I will have a full set of recommendations which I will take to Cabinet.

Has a vessel being identified to be taken out of operation in light of the new vessel that has being ordered at 2012 prices that the Minister mentioned and, if so, which vessel will be it be or has that decision been made?  The Minister said the cost would be based on 2012 prices and at the time of the launch of the Samuel Beckett, which I had the pleasure of attending along with the chairman and others, I did some research and found that the price the Government of the day paid for that vessel was extraordinarily cheap on some comparatives I found for vessels of similar yardage.  Given the age of our fleet, is  there a proposal to have a gradual replacement programme and will that include other vessels as our economic circumstances improve?</p> <p>Has any consideration been given to naming this vessel?  Our literary greats in history are lining up and I am sure that certain names spring to mind.</p></speech>

We have a policy around an eight ship Naval Service and that is the policy for the foreseeable future.  When the next Naval Service ship,<i>LE James Joyce</i>, arrives in a couple of months time, the <i>LE Aoife</i>will be decommissioned and sold.  Some 12 months after that, the next ship will arrive so that we will have the <i>LE Samuel Beckett</i>, <i>LE James Joyce</i>and the soon to be named vessel.  These are more or less identical vessels, a super design.  They are essentially a development on <i>LE Niamh </i>and <i>LE R&oacute;is&iacute;n</i>, slightly longer, sleeker and faster.  They are more stable and more fuel efficient.  These ships have essentially evolved and one of the good things about working with the contractors who are building these ships, is that our Naval Service personnel have been involved in talking to the design team about how we can make incremental improvements on the design of the ships.  From what we have learned in the operation of the<i>LE Samuel Beckett </i>, we have been able to make improvements in the workings of <i>LE James Joyce</i>.  I suspect this will apply to the next ship.  Certainly the yard is building on the designs and the success of the <i>LE Niamh</i>and<i>LE R&oacute;is&iacute;n,</i>which were the previous two ships.  The long-term size and composition of the Naval Service flotilla will be determined in the White Paper.  The current policy is that we will have eight ships.  I would not like to predict what we will be recommending in the White Paper.</p></speech>

If I am not mistaken, one of the Naval Service ships visited Hong Kong some years ago and I remember reading about the limited range and the ship having to make stops on the way.  I presume the new vessels will have a much greater range.  The Minister mentioned fuel efficiency.  I assume the range has been increased.</p></speech>

It is capable of operations for 21 days or three weeks.  It will provide strong operational capability for up to 40 years service.  The current fleet has a recommendation of about 30 years.  The<i>LE Aoife</i>was commissioned in 1979 and the <i>LE Aisling i</i>n 1980.  They have gone beyond the recommended period of service in Irish conditions.  They may well be suitable for the Mediterranean or somewhere else.<br/>We have some of the roughest waters in the world off the west coast and we need ships out in those conditions virtually all of the time.  There are specific design considerations in terms of ballast, stability, depth and hull design that suit Irish waters.  This is the reason we cannot buy other ships from other parts of the world and assume they will be fine in our waters.  That is not the way it works.  The next ships can achieve a top speed of 23 knots, which is about 28 miles per hour.  This is significantly higher than the top speed of 18 knots, which is achievable by other Naval Service vessels.  They are equipped with power taking systems which will enable major fuel savings as engines can be shut down in favour of generator power.  I have been on the <i>LE Samuel Beckett </i>and it is very impressive.  I would encourage members of the committee to see the ship.</p></speech>

This is to facilitate more effective search and rescue missions, black box retrieval and a close review of the ocean environment and habitats.  I can see a time when the Naval Service becomes more involved in data collection at sea, whether it is around fisheries or marine observation and so on.  Defending Ireland is not just about war going capacity, it is also about defending our national assets, some 90% of which are under water, given the size and scale of our oceans.  Many do not realise it, but if one counts our sovereign territory at sea, as well as our land, we would be the third or fourth largest country in the European Union.  We need to be able to manage, protect and to defend those resources as well as ensuring that we undertake the other more conventional defence roles that the Naval Service has to undertake.  </p><p>  We are modernising the fleet, equipping and designing ships to fulfil the challenges they will face both at home and perhaps abroad, if there is a role for our Naval Service in peace operations abroad at some stage in the future, which may well be the case.</p><p>  The value of these ships is roughly &euro;70 million, when fully equipped.  That is what we are budgeting for.</p></speech>

This will be met within existing maintenance budgets.  This is unfortunately time consuming, if not that costly.  It has resulted in ships taking longer to service than they would otherwise have been, which is a frustration.

Are any of them in such a condition that they could be used for the purpose mentioned by Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l regarding short-term housing needs, homeless or sheltered accommodation or similar purposes?

First, I am glad to hear I am not the only one who is a big fan of the Army Equitation School.  I have visited it, walked through it and spent some time there talking to the riders.  I consider it to be a valuable addition to the Irish Defence Forces that will not be undermined and hopefully will be enhanced significantly during my time in office.  Clearly, however, there are budgetary considerations in this regard but no reductions are proposed there.  Some investment is required, as well as some future partnerships in which the Army Equitation School could be involved.  It will get strong support from me and I am glad to hear those sentiments because it is easier for me to do that if I get strong support from other parties, particularly those in opposition.</p><p>  As for homelessness, for some time my Department has been examining how the Defence Forces could be helpful in a practical way.  I spoke to the Minister, Deputy Kelly, this week about the involvement of some Defence Forces infrastructure in the context of providing short-term emergency accommodation through a difficult winter period if that would be helpful.  There are well over 1,000 emergency beds available in Dublin and more are coming on stream for a winter response.  However, I am anxious that the Department of Defence would play its part in being helpful when and where appropriate.  At present, consideration is being given to the St. Bricin's site, that is, a former military hospital that is currently a military clinic.  It has not had any capital investment for a long time.  As a former military hospital, it contains wards and rooms and is located just off Infirmary Road, which is near Heuston Station for those members who are not from Dublin.</p><p>  This is the obvious place to start because there are all sorts of complications if one accommodates people who are homeless in functioning Army barracks.  While the personnel are trained very well, they are not trained to manage a homelessness problem that, as most members are aware, is a great deal more complicated than simply putting a roof over somebody's head in respect of supports, counselling, health care, addiction and so much more.  The reasons people find themselves without a home are often highly complex and what it may be possible to do on a temporary basis is to work in partnership with Dublin City Council or some of the other organisations that provide the complex care needed for people who unfortunately find themselves homeless.  It may be possible to provide some support structures, accommodation or security, that is, the kind of things the Army does well.  To be helpful, the Department will have a representative tomorrow at the forum that is being convened by the Minister, Deputy Kelly, and which is closely supported by the Taoiseach.  Moreover, if asked, the Department will be helpful.</p></speech>

We have had a chance to deliberate on petition No. 17/14, which was deferred from last week, regarding the incorrect allocations of public funds allocated for flood prevention in a specified area, from Mr. Eugene Mitchell.  The petitioner's house flooded in 2009 and he is claiming that Galway County Council received a grant of &euro;15,000 for their minor works scheme to carry out repair work to a stream beside his house.  He claims the council did not spend the funds in the area for which they were intended.  He has also raised this issue with the Public Accounts Committee, PAC, which had obtained a copy of the hydraulic assessment report from Galway County Council and had forwarded this to the petitioner.  I can confirm for members that the Ombudsman has investigated this issue with the council and prepared a report, which was sent to the petitioner.  However, the petitioner disagrees with the information provided by the council and has requested that this be investigated further by the Ombudsman.  At present, his complaint is waiting to be assigned to an investigating officer with the Office of the Ombudsman.  Accordingly, it is agreed that the petition be deemed inadmissable as the Ombudsman is investigating the issue.  We have also agreed to forward a copy of the hydrologist's report, Galway County Council's response, and the OPW response to the PAC to the petitioner.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

I will set out a short factual overview of Government policy in this respect.  I am keen to maximise the time for questions and clarifications and therefore I shall keep my initial comments brief.</p><p> The Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order 1952, made under the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1946, gives the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade primary responsibility for the regulation of activity by foreign military aircraft in Ireland.  The order provides that no foreign military aircraft shall fly over or land in the State without the express invitation or permission of the Minister.  It further provides that aircraft shall comply with such stipulations as the Minister may make.</p><p> Arrangements under which permission is granted for the landing and overflight of all military aircraft are governed by strict conditions.  These include stipulations that the aircraft must be unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition or explosives and must not engage in intelligence gathering as well as that the flights in question must not form part of military exercises or operations.  Ireland's long-standing policy of neutrality, characterised by non-participation in military alliances, provides a context within which requests for overflights and landings are considered by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p><p> Requests for permission are submitted to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade by the embassy of the country in question.  As part of the decision-making process, the Department circulates these requests to relevant Departments and agencies.  I know the committee is particularly focused on the question of landing facilities for US flights at Shannon Airport.  Landing facilities have been made available at Shannon since 1959, a practice which has remained in place continuously under successive Governments.  The vast majority of troops who transit through Shannon Airport do so on commercial charter aircraft.  Primary responsibility for the regulation of civilian aircraft, including chartered flights, lies with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p><p> Under the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order 1973, the carriage of weapons through Shannon Airport on commercial aircraft is prohibited unless an exemption has been obtained in advance from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The carriage of the personal weapons of US military personnel on board chartered aircraft in transit through Shannon Airport is subject to the issuance of an exemption in respect of each flight.  Such requests are considered in the first instance by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has an opportunity to provide input on any foreign policy issues that may arise.</p><p> Questions have been raised about allowing military aircraft to land at Shannon without being subject to routine searches or inspection.  Embassies of the countries requesting permission are required to confirm that aircraft are unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition or explosives and must not engage in intelligence gathering and, furthermore, that the flights in question must not form part of military exercises or operations.</p><p> It has been the practice of successive Governments to accept in good faith that details provided by diplomatic missions to all Departments are accurate.  This approach is in accordance with international practice and reflects the principle of sovereign immunity.  Information provided to other states by Irish diplomatic missions seeking diplomatic clearance for flights undertaken by the Air Corps is similarly accepted by those countries to be accurate.  I am happy to take any questions concerning the Department's role in implementing Government policy on overflights and landings.</p></speech>

I was on the delegation that went to Shannon.  We talked to the airport authorities and spoke to the garda&iacute; there.  Basically, they painted a picture for us to the effect that they had no role whatsoever in the issue outlined.  The way they described it these aircraft have diplomatic immunity, they were effectively airborne embassies and could not be encroached upon in any way.  The statement to the committee today seems to concur, given the reference to successive Governments taking that stance.</p><p>  I note the stipulation that aircraft must be unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition or explosives and must not engage in intelligence gathering as well as that the flights in question must not form part of military exercises or operations, and that this is our policy.  This is based on good faith and the word of the visitors coming to us, albeit with diplomatic immunity, when they land at Shannon.  The view is that under no circumstances would they be searched.</p><p>  Is it possible the representatives of Shannonwatch are correct?  They see certain aeroplanes landing at Shannon which, they believe, could well be involved in rendition flights, for example.  They could well be carrying troops or arms on some of the flights but we would never know because those flights would never be checked.  The aircraft are not entered because of sovereign immunity and a system based on the word of one government to another.  Technically, we are saying that Shannonwatch could be correct, but the Government is using the diplomatic card as the reasoning for this position.  Is the premise I am putting to Mr. Burgess correct?</p></speech>

Civilian aircraft come under a different legal framework.  This is the framework of the Chicago convention which was incorporated into Irish law by the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1946.</p><p>  Military aircraft and military landings are regulated in a different way.  They do not come under the Chicago convention.  They are subject to the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order 1952.  Sovereign immunity applies to military aircraft.  I will say a word about sovereign immunity.  Under Article 29 of the Constitution, Ireland accepts the generally recognised principles of international law as our rule of conduct in relations with other states.  Sovereign immunity is a long-standing principle of international law.  We do not grant sovereign immunity, it applies automatically.  In line with this principle a state may not exercise its jurisdiction in respect of another state or its property, including state or military aircraft.  It is a reciprocal principle.  The principle applies to Irish state and Air Corps craft when they are out of the State.</p><p>  Civilian aircraft include chartered aircraft carrying troops, for example, through Shannon.  There are powers of search.  The Air Navigation and Transport Act provides statutory powers of entry and arrest for a Garda officer who knows or reasonably suspects that a person has committed a crime.  However, there is no basis under that legislation for random or routine entry or search of aircraft.</p><p>  The question of sovereign immunity and the wider issue of rendition was raised.  When the issue of rendition first emerged it was raised by the then Taoiseach with President Bush and with the US Secretary of State by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Categoric assurances were given, subsequently confirmed at official level, that no transfers of prisoners subject to extraordinary rendition had taken place through Ireland.  Bilateral relations between friendly nations are founded on the principle of mutual trust.  Both parties have an interest in maintaining that trust and not undermining it.  Therefore, the details supplied to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade by diplomatic missions are accepted in good faith as being accurate.</p></speech>

I appreciate the answer.  Similar answers have been given to many parliamentary questions, etc.  What is the position of sovereign immunity <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>international human rights law?  What if there were someone on an airplane coming from another country who had been tortured or was being brought to a place to be tortured?  Where do the rights of these individuals sit under international law <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>a state's right to sovereign immunity?  Where is our role as a state in policing the international human rights of an individual?</p></speech>

As for the operational measures, the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe, for example, in its report of 2006 referred to serious risks and substantiated claims.  In its report of 2007, the Irish Human Rights Commission did not recommend a requirement that aircraft be searched.  However, with regard to sovereign immunity, there is no means for overriding the principle of sovereign immunity.  It is a principle of international law.</p></speech>

If, out of a fear or worry that this person's rights were being impugned, the cleaner then reported this to the authorities on the ground in Shannon Airport, Mr. Burgess essentially is telling me that even if the Government wished to intervene, it could not do so because of the sovereign immunity on that aeroplane.  I ask this question to be clear.</p></speech>

My information is no exemptions have been sought or obtained at any stage by the American Government.  Like many other people, I do not believe for one second that the 600 military aeroplanes or other aeroplanes that have passed through Shannon Airport have not been carrying some form of weapons, apart from the personal weapons the troops themselves may carry.  Were that the case, why would the American Government have a problem with having examined some of the aeroplanes either by independent examiners or members of the Irish Government?  Mr. Burgess referred to good faith and so on.  Given the very nature of the Central Intelligence Agency, CIA, would he believe what it would tell him to the effect there are no arms or munitions on any of the aeroplanes?  The problem that troubles me is the possibility that if by some chance there were arms or munitions on those aeroplanes, they could be sent on missions of destruction to destroy human beings or property in places such as Iraq, Afghanistan or wherever.  That would be very troubling.  Like many people, I simply do not believe that of all the aeroplanes that have passed through Shannon Airport, none has been carrying some form of munitions or arms.  Were that the case, I believe that all American military personnel would travel on normal flights.  Why would they travel on a military flight and why would they not allow the aeroplane to be boarded and checked?</p><p>  Does Ireland not have an obligation to check that a military flight coming into our country is not carrying munitions to bring devastation upon people's lives, regardless of whether we agree with the armed intervention?  What sums this up for me is that, quite simply, even within the United States itself, some former military personnel have admitted that aeroplanes flying from all countries are carrying arms and munitions and have been involved in rendition.  There is an onus and a responsibility on Ireland as a neutral country to be able to check any military flight coming into this country from wherever - this is not anti-American - to ensure it is not carrying munitions or arms with which to engage in a conflict, wherever that conflict might be.  I repeat that it simply does not wash with me and it would be naive to think that simply because the CIA would say there are no munitions or arms on an aeroplane, it is to be believed.  I must state that I find it shameful that Ireland allows this to happen.  If they are carrying munitions or arms, indirectly the Government could be responsible for the deaths of innocent people in other countries without even being in a position to intervene, on our own territory, to ascertain whether munitions or arms are being carried on any of the aeroplanes.  I consider that to be quite astonishing.</p></speech>

Again, if I could distinguish between civilian aircraft and military aircraft, most military personnel who transit through Shannon Airport do so in chartered civilian aircraft.  The Garda has powers to search civilian aircraft where it has strong reason to believe that a crime has been committed.  To land at Shannon Airport, under the regulation, the carriage of all weapons is prohibited unless an exemption is sought.  That exemption is only granted for the carriage of weapons if personal weapons are stored in the hold and are not accessible by the military personnel who are coming through.  We received something like 700 requests for exemption at Shannon Airport last year, 85% of which related to the carriage of personal weapons.  However, the US authorities were required to confirm beforehand that those personal weapons were out of access and were in the hold of the flight.</p></speech>

The procedure for dealing with those goods that are being carried on civilian aircraft is that an application is made to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Support for an exemption to carry the items.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport consults a number of Departments, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, with regard to those goods.  The category of goods covers a broad range of items from explosives to nitrogen to gas canisters.  In other words, it covers anything that the International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO, classifies as being dangerous.</p></speech>

The latter is okay while the former is not.  That is what it boils down to and that is what we allow.  The chartered flights that the Department approves are the ones with guns in the hold with soldiers on board.  Presumably they are going to a place where they may engage their weapons.</p></speech>

Is that in line with previous years?  Perhaps there are spikes or peaks over the years.  Sometimes, that tells us something.  I would be grateful for that information.</p><p>  I will not go back and argue the case about the military coming under Article 29 through the international law and the immunity that applies automatically.  I understand it is a constitutional matter although other members and members of the public may have a problem with it.</p><p>  We have some capacity to offer some change on the charter flights.  Mr. Burgess specifies, as did the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when we were in Shannon, that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must have cause to search and cannot undertake random searches.  That is something we could change.  The proposition exists for a change to the law where, on chartered flights, which do not fall under the agreement on world immunity in Article 29, we could say random searches could be agreed.  We know the purpose of some of the aircraft.  What else are they apart from carrying military?  What is the view of Mr. Burgess on whether this possible?</p></speech>

It is also determined under international legislation, under the Chicago convention.

The order provides that no foreign military aircraft shall fly over or land in the State without the express invitation or permission of the Minister.  Is that something that is done on a roll-over basis?  Does any country state in advance it will have seven flights next year, there will be one in January, March, April and May, etc., and do they receive a blanket agreement, or is it done case by case basis?  Mr. Burgess might flesh out how that works.  I very much appreciate that he has been kind enough not to fill out the whole presentation and to give us the opportunity to question.</p></speech>

The number we received last year was slightly in excess of 700.  That was less than in 2012, and less again than in 2011.  The number has been going down steadily since 2011.   The figures we have so far for this year indicate that the number will probably be lower again this year.</p><p>  On the arrangements for both overflights and landings for military flights, the arrangements vary according to the state of origin.  Approximately 30 countries have blanket clearance.  That is given usually on a reciprocal basis.  Generally, those countries send in their notification in advance of the flight overflying or landing, and they would be notified in return only where permission to land is refused, and generally that would be in circumstances where the flight is carrying dangerous goods.  They are required to give specific information.  Even military flights are regulated.  They are required to supply specific information before landing or overflying.</p><p>  There are specific arrangements in place with the United States.  US overflights and landings are handled under arrangements which were set out under an exchange of letters between the then Minister for Foreign Affairs and the US ambassador in 1959.  That arrangement permits overflights without prior notification on the basis that the aircraft are unarmed, they carry only cargo and passengers, and they comply with any relevant navigational requirements.</p></speech>

In the correspondence sent to the committee - there was correspondence from the Minister but also from the Department - the Department specified that, in terms of the military aircraft, it has assurances that no weaponry would be carried on board when they land.  That is the assurance.  It is a matter of trust between states and on that basis, the Department would grant it.</p><p>  What the Department did not outline to the committee in that correspondence is that almost all of the estimated 2.3 million marines who have come through Shannon during the various wars that have taken place over the past decade would have been carrying at least a side arm, not on their person but in the storage.  They probably would have had an issued rifle and other weaponry on board on the way to the theatre of war.  That was not made clear to the committee in that correspondence.  The Department did point to the assurances it has around military aircraft but it did not point to the fact that, in terms of the charter flights, it would have access to data on the numbers of flights of marines per year.  I want to know why that was not made clear to the committee and we had to discover that in Shannon.</p></speech>

It is just that in the correspondence to this committee it is not acknowledged.  You speak about 50,000 in one year, 2013, but in terms of the scale over the period of time that would be a concern.  Do you think the fact that two Departments and Government permit such a huge number of members of the US army, marines or whatever, to come through Shannon Airport on the way to the theatre of war, as they were doing in the vast majority of cases, is commensurate with a policy of neutrality?</p></speech>

I am talking about the implementation of Government policy and a long-standing Government policy.  We are talking about US flights but the great majority of landings at Shannon Airport and overflights in Irish airspace are by states with which Ireland has very close and constructive relations.  We set out in one of the letters to the committee, I am not sure whether it was last year or this year, the fact that Ireland's military neutrality has to be also seen in a context where we have friendly relations with many states as well.</p></speech>

If I am travelling as a civilian on a civilian aircraft I come with my bags and I could tell the airport staff that I do not have aerosols or anything in my bag but they check it.  Do we take for granted that the only items in the hold are the hand guns and the rifles that have been stipulated or is there a checking procedure to ensure that only the items for which permission has been given are on the list?  The witnesses may not wish to comment on this but it is uncanny that this week we passed a law allowing for random blood tests and drug tests where a Garda stops a car.  It is strange that we do not have the power to allow the Garda go on an aeroplane to check that everything is above board on that aeroplane.  That we do not allow those types of random searches is strange.  If we were sending the Irish military abroad, as we do from time to time, are there more checks in other countries?  Does the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have to jump through more hoops if we are sending our troops abroad?  If they are travelling on a civilian aircraft to, say, Lebanon and stop off somewhere in between, are there more checks and balances of our military in other jurisdictions and sovereign states than here in Ireland?</p></speech>

I do not believe the flights would otherwise be searched on a routine basis.  As I have stated, regulation of these issues is a matter for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport under the Air Navigation and Transport Act.  Under these regulations civilian aircraft are specifically prohibited from carrying weapons or munitions over Ireland or into Irish airports unless the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport gives them an exemption under specific named conditions.</p></speech>

People who would not be happy with US foreign policy would certainly see a plane with 200 military personnel and handguns as a military flight for all intents and purposes.  From our perspective, a neutrality point of view and our defence perspective, certain organisations on the planet might view Shannon Airport and the flight as a legitimate target, to put it in such terms, and there are concerns about the security of Shannon Airport and the fact that it might be attacked.  Has this issue been discussed in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade?  Are there concerns that allowing flights such as these, even civilian flights with guns and ammunition in the hold, to travel through creates a danger for us as a country and makes Shannon Airport a legitimate target?  Is it an issue of concern?</p></speech>

The practice of passage through Shannon Airport is part of the normal conduct of international relations between states which enjoy friendly relations, and many such states use the overflight and landing facility at Shannon Airport.</p><p>  No one would see military personnel carrying weapons because they are not authorised to carry weapons outside the plane and uniformed personnel are allowed into the transit areas but require specific authorisation to leave them.</p></speech>

They could take issue with the fact that we call ourselves a neutral country but allow these flights to come through.  I find it strange that it would never have come up<i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>our neutrality.

To elaborate a little on this, it is set in a very clear context and this needs to be borne in mind.  It is set against Ireland's belief that primary responsibility for international peace and security rests with the UN Security Council.  We support actions of the UN Security Council in accordance with the UN charter.  We believe in a much broader active international engagement, which involves participation in peacekeeping, peace building activities, conflict resolution, support for disarmament, human rights and development.  This broader context within which the policy of neutrality is implemented and developed is important.</p></speech>

If two families in my housing estate were at war or in conflict with one another and members of one of the families came into my house, which was in the middle, and told me they were going over to attack the other family, and asked for a cup of tea and whether I would mind if they stayed for a couple of minutes - although they were carrying weapons - and then went to attack the house, I would not be neutral.</p><p>  How can we be defined as neutral if we allow a flight with personal weapons?  The Chairman is correct that it would mean hundreds of thousands of personal weapons have gone through, and there is an inevitability that some have been used in conflicts in Iraq or Afghanistan.  Essentially we are not neutral, in my opinion, and based on a broad definition many people would say the same, if we allow flights carrying weapons to stop on their way to a conflict and to attack another country.</p><p>  I do not agree with al-Qaeda, but we do not allow it to fly a plane into Ireland, tell us it has nothing on it, and then fly on to the United States.  However, we allow the United States to attack who they perceive to be their enemies.  Essentially we are not neutral if we allow the military craft of one country on their way to attack another country to land in our jurisdiction with arms.  We now admit some of them do carry arms and we are not sure about 15%.  Under the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order 1973, the carriage of weapons through Shannon Airport on commercial aircraft is prohibited unless an exemption has been obtained.   Mr. Burgess has told us how many requests have been made and were granted, but we need to know what requests were made.</p></speech>

Our sense of it is that the management of the airport operates within the law and allows flights, subject to the licence from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport or the diplomatic note from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  That is very clear and straightforward.  If the Garda suspect an offence, if somebody has reported a crime is taking place aboard a plane, it would have to seek a warrant.

We do a lot of close work with the US State Department on childhood nutrition in the developing world.

In the third paragraph of the correspondence from December of 2013 the Private Secretary, writing on behalf of the Minister, states:<blockquote><br />The Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order 1952 gives the Minister for Foreign Affairs primary responsibility for the regulation of activity by foreign military aircraft in Ireland.  Permission to land at Irish airports is subject to the condition that the aircraft are unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition or explosives, do not engage in intelligence gathering, and that the flights in question do not form any part of military exercises or operations.</blockquote>That is clear and gives the impression that we have a rock solid approach.  He went on to refer to 50,000 troops in 2013, the fact that there is the exemption and the prior approval but the presentation of the Government's approach in these sets of correspondence is not frank in terms of the scale of this.  One could come to the conclusion reading the correspondence that we do not allow any arms or ammunition to pass through.  A layperson reading it could reach the conclusion that we have a policy that these flights coming through must not carry arms or explosives.  However, we have established from our visit to Shannon and from Mr. Burgess's evidence today that huge numbers, and that is accepted, of men and women of the United States forces, marines and so on, came through the airport with weapons on board planes with the permission of the Irish Government over an extended period while <i>en route</i>to a theatre of war.  In terms of one of those theatres of war, the war in Iraq, it was not endorsed by the United Nations Security Council.  The war in Afghanistan was endorsed by the UN Security Council but the war in Iraq was not.  If Mr. Burgess was looking at the objective of the 1952 order to which he referred, it must be undermined by the fact that the actual practice, certainly in the past decade, has been to allow huge amounts of weaponry to come through.  Mr. Burgess might deal with that question first.</p></speech>

If I could speak about the military aircraft, the compliance with regulations, with the Government's requirements, when military aircraft land at Shannon Airport is affirmed by the US authorities when they notify in advance that the plane is going to land.  Government policy in regard to this was set out in a number of different periods, and the Private Secretary's letter mentions it.  In advance of the US military action in Iraq in 2003, the Government decided to maintain the arrangements for overflight and landing in Ireland of US military and civilian aircraft, and that decision was endorsed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in 2003.  There have been a number of specific statements of Government policy, and the interpretation of the regulations in light of Government policy, over a number of years.</p><p>  Regarding the landings of civilian aircraft, as the Chairman said, one could interpret what is being said here in a certain way.  That certainly was not the intention.  That letter does set out separately from the military flights the fact that the carriage of weapons on commercial aircraft is dealt with in a different way.  If figures were not given it is probably because we do not carry the final authority relating to the-----</p></speech>

I would go further and say we have an umbilical relationship with the United States.  Some 70 million citizens there claim Irish heritage.  I must declare that I would regard myself as an Americanophile.  I am fascinated by United States history and its people.  It is a friendly state for all the reasons Mr. Burgess pointed out but the difficulty is that we declare ourselves to be a neutral state, and that puts us in a position to advocate for conflict resolution and human rights in terms of the UN Human Rights Council.  The difficulty for us is that the petitioner has asserted that what is happening in Shannon over a period of time has undermined our neutrality.  We need to establish if it is commensurate.  We have more work to do as a committee, and there will be more hearings in the new year.<br/>I appreciate the Secretary General is not here to account for Government policy and that he can only talk about the implementation of Government policy as it happens.  We acknowledge the points he made about our close, symbiotic relationship with the United States but our dilemma is that we declare ourselves to be a neutral state and we have facilitated large amounts of weaponry to come through Shannon on the way to a theatre of war.  In one instance that was not given <i>carte blanche</i>by a UN Security Council Resolution.  Where does that leave us?  Mr. Burgess may not want to comment any further than he has already.  If he does not that is fine because, in fairness, he is not here to account for Government policy and at some point we may have to bring in the Minister who is accountable for Government policy.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

Is that always the case or are there cases of weaponry being carried without the personnel they relate to being on the flight also?  We presumed that if there are 200 marines on a flight that there are 200 hand guns, rifles or whatever that belong to the marines on that flight.  Are there cases where that is not the case in that military weaponry has been carried and the correlating foot soldiers, to put it mildly, are not on the flight?  We are also assuming it is always military personnel who are on the flight.  Is it the case that former military who might be hired by a private company could possibly be travelling through Shannon with weaponry?  Is it possible that other individuals coming from the US and travelling to other countries might want to pass through Shannon with weaponry?  Would the permissions be similar?  How would that work?</p></speech>

I do not have specific figures that would correlate those with the personnel on the aircraft but it is categorised as personal weapons and as my colleague stated, where dangerous goods are listed which have an indiscriminate character we would invariably recommend to our colleagues in the Department of Transport that the exemption not be granted.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, while we have invited both the Consumers' Association of Ireland and Insurance Ireland, due to previous commitments their representatives were unable to attend today and we will meet with them at a future date.<br/>On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Gerard Moran and Mr. Niall Butler from the Revenue Commissioners.  I wish to draw their attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>i</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they will be entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also wish to advise them that any submission or opening statements they have made to the committee will be published on the committee website after the meeting.<br/>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or persons outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/>I now call on Mr. Gerard Moran to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

As the members will see, my opening statement is a little broader in focus than simply petrol stretching.  I hope this might be helpful in providing a little context for the main focus.</p><p>  Firstly, I want to thank the members of the committee for the opportunity to contribute to this discussion.  Fuel fraud has been a very significant challenge for Revenue over the past three to four years and we have worked very hard to tackle the problem.  To start the discussion, it might be helpful if I outline briefly the steps we have taken to tackle fuel fraud, and to brief the committee on our response to the recent reports of damage to petrol engines.  </p><p>  In recent years diesel laundering has been the principal, if not exclusive, focus of the organised crime groups involved in fuel fraud.  The price differential between road diesel and marked diesel - at well over &euro;0.50 per litre - and the low cost of removing the marker from marked diesel, made laundering a very profitable crime.  From 2011, Revenue responded very aggressively and has re-engineered the regulatory regime for the fuel sector.  Our aim has been to put in place a number of supply chain control measures designed to make it much more difficult to source marked fuel for laundering and to get laundered fuel onto the market.  On the back of this strategy, Revenue has closed over 130 filling stations and seized 3 million litres of fuel since 2011, and all the available indicators point to a very positive impact on behaviour in the sector.  Industry sources indicate a much-reduced incidence of laundered fuel on the market, and road diesel consumption and tax revenues are up by about 13% compared with a couple of years ago.</p> <p>Obviously, other economic factors have contributed to this growth, but reduced fraud is also an important factor.  However, there is no room for complacency or slippage; diesel laundering has not been eliminated, so we need to continue to police the supply chain and tackle the criminal elements involved in this activity.  The introduction of a new more effective marker here and in the UK from the end of March next will be a further important step in eliminating this fraud.</p><p> Turning to the recent cases of damage to petrol engines and the suggestions of a petrol stretching problem, Revenue&rsquo;s stance is to investigate fully to establish if there is any evidence of tax fraud.  With the progress that has been made in squeezing diesel laundering operations, we are very alert to the possibility that organised crime groups may diversify their operations further into other types of fraud in the fuel sector and elsewhere.  Petrol stretching is a risk, but the potential revenues for criminals are very modest compared to diesel laundering.  Petrol stretching would normally involve the illegal addition of methanol, but it can only be added in relatively small quantities, typically less than 10%, before problems arise and the fraud becomes self-defeating.  Assuming that methanol costs 59 cent per litre and could be added up to a threshold of 10%, the potential return from the fraud is less than 9 cent per litre and adding 5% methanol would generate a return of little more than 4 cent per litre.  While the incentive for petrol stretching is relatively modest, there is always some level of risk.</p><p> Where contamination or adulteration of petrol or any other fuel takes place, the explanation may be fraud or it may be a handling accident.  Accidental cross-contamination occurs occasionally, for example, where diesel is delivered into the wrong storage tank.  Where this occurs, the contaminated fuel is recovered and taken off the market and the duty on the recovered fuel is repaid.  In this case, no trader has come forward and claimed or admitted accidental contamination, so Revenue is continuing to investigate to establish if there is evidence of fraud.  So far we have not reached any conclusions, but we are pursuing our inquiries back through the supply chain from the retailers involved.</p><p> From the complaints received to date, the problem seems to be concentrated largely in the west, predominantly in Mayo and Roscommon, with another concentration centred on Meath.  It also seems to relate to fuel supplied in July or earlier; ongoing sampling has not found evidence that current petrol supplies are contaminated, and it seems that more recently reported cases of damage to engines may be attributable to a time lag between getting contaminated fuel and subsequent engine damage.</p><p> Petrol samples have been taken from each retailer identified by complainants as the source of contaminated fuel and samples have also been obtained from some of the damaged cars.  Analysis of the samples by the State Laboratory is still ongoing but, to date, they do not point conclusively to the source of the problem.  However, it may be the case that the time lag between the cause of the problem and the taking of samples meant that the contaminated fuel had already been "washed" through the system before the samples were taken.  Kerosene was detected in petrol samples taken from one filling station and that petrol was seized and a prosecution case is being prepared.  We also found very small traces of diesel in a number of samples and we are trying to establish if this is due to the way the two products are handled by some distributors or if it is a residue of an earlier more significant cross-contamination.</p><p> Given that we have not arrived at a satisfactory explanation of what has happened, we are continuing our investigations, and in particular we want to establish if there is any evidence of tax fraud.  This matter will not be closed until we have completed a thorough investigation of the supply chain for evidence of fraud or breaches of excise law or licensing conditions.  I hope this brief outline of our approach to tackling fuel fraud is helpful for the committee.  I am happy to clarify or elaborate on any points and of course I am happy to answer any questions.</p></speech>

In his statement he said that, to date, the Revenue Commissioners have not reached any conclusions.  That is frustrating for people who have been affected.  Mr. Moran indicated the problem is regional in the sense that Mayo and Roscommon are significantly affected, as are the midlands, Meath and Westmeath.  I am sure many members could supply the witnesses with details of individual devastation where people have had to buy cheap second-hand cars to get to work.  We are being told the investigations have run into the sand, or that nothing is happening, as such.  Mr. Moran outlined what is going on, which is important.</p><p>  Is it the case that the number of complaints is tapering off?  Has the problem occurred in other jurisdictions and how has it been addressed?  Have fuel stations been closed down following prosecutions?  Is there evidence of petrol stretching or is it the case that other substances are being mixed in with petrol?</p><p>  Anecdotally, the suggestion is that the incidents of petrol stretching occurred in June or July 2014.  What tests were carried out between January and May 2013 on forecourts for petrol stretching or fuel contamination?  Were tests carried out in advance of when the incidents were alleged to have started happening?  How long does it take the State Laboratory to test samples sent to it?  What is the average time the Revenue Commissioners must wait for results?</p><p>  Do the Revenue Commissioners have sufficient resources to deal with the problem or are more resources required?  I acknowledge fuel laundering has been reduced as a result of the actions taken by the Revenue Commissioners.  If the Revenue Commissioners go to a fuel station, there is an obligation on it to supply them with information on the source of its diesel.  The same is the case with suppliers of fuel.  Does the same requirement not apply to petrol?  If that is the case, could Mr. Moran explain why that is so?</p></speech>

I trust you will come back to me, Chairman, if you require more information on any of the questions.  We understand the frustration on the issue and we are eager to get to the bottom of it.  When an issue arises about petrol quality, the alarm bells go for us and we are concerned.  There may be another explanation but it is certainly an indicator that there is potentially a fraud being perpetrated in terms of petrol.  We are eager to get to the bottom of it.</p> <p>As soon as we receive complaints, we visit every filling station that has been complained about and take samples.  To date, over 180 samples have been taken and referred to the State Laboratory since the inception of this problem.  The testing conducted by the State Laboratory is time consuming and quite complex because it tests for the presence of a whole range of different potential stretching agents or fuel abnormalities.  That means testing takes time plus there is a great deal of samples and I am afraid I cannot give an average or fixed time.  We are dealing with a spike in the volume of samples submitted and the nature of questions that must be asked. </p><p> Let me give a little background.  We tend not to encounter petrol stretching very frequently.  I have checked the situation in the past couple of days and the only case of petrol stretching anyone could recall was in Donegal, four or five years ago, where methanol was used.  Petrol stretching is a rare enough occurrence and, as far as I am aware, it is not a prevalent practice in other jurisdictions.  I am aware of newspaper reports of a particular incident in Bournemouth.  It was discovered that a Tesco filling station had contaminated fuel but I do not know what type and up to 100 cars were damaged.  I am unaware of a similar phenomenon to ours happening recently in another jurisdiction.</p></speech>

There is speculation that the problem was caused by a water leak but the owners have never said what the problem was and the cause remains unclear.  The issue cropped up in only one filling station.</p><p>  Let me respond to the other questions.  I was asked how many samples were taken and the answer is 180 samples.  I was asked how many tests were undertaken before June.  I do not have the figure but I guess it would be exceptionally low if any samples were taken.  With all of our work we operate on the basis of risk.  Therefore, interventions and checks are undertaken in proportion to the level of risk.  As the committee will be aware, most of the risk has been in other areas of fuel fraud and not petrol stretching.</p></speech>

As Mr. Moran has said, resources are deployed based on potential risk and, in particular, the scale of that risk.  </p><p>  Petrol stretching is different from other fraudulent activities because it has two victims.  In the first instance, the State is a victim due to a loss of revenue.  In many cases of other fraud activity the State is the only victim.  In petrol stretching, the consumer is a significant victim.  I have spoken to many people and families who have been destroyed by the effects of petrol stretching.  Sometimes two or three cars belonging to a household are affected because of loyalty to a particular petrol station where they purchase fuel.  I am aware of a myriad of cases.  In one case both cars were destroyed by petrol stretching, the husband and wife must repay car loans for both cars but the bank will not provide finance to repair the cars.  That means the couple must avail of public transport to get to work, yet pay for cars parked on the forecourt of a garage that require between &euro;10,000 and &euro;12,000 for repairs.  That couple do not have the money for the repairs.  </p><p>  I am concerned by what was said about the risk involved.  Effectively, there is no arm of State looking to protect such consumers or to resolve their issues.  In the case I mentioned the insurance company has turned its back on the couple and has refused to provide support.  In some cases insurance companies have paid compensation because they deemed petrol stretching as an insurable risk.</p><p>  The Government has not made a coherent response to petrol stretching.  I do not want to be overly critical of the Revenue Commissioners but they are just part of the arm of the State.  Over the next couple of weeks the committee will bring together all the stakeholders involved to see if we can design a mechanism for redress.  Is there legislation that the Revenue Commissioners do not have in their toolbox?  Is there anything additional that we can provide through legislative support that would assist them to better address this matter?  Is there a method by which we can make petrol stations more responsible for the fuel they sell?  </p><p>  I have dealt with some cases where only one filling station was involved.  The people concerned purchased their fuel from the same location for the previous five years so there is no other potential supplier.  Should we increase the fines and prison terms for the crime?  Is there anything we can do that will make it easier for Revenue and the Garda to do their job?</p></speech>

When this issue emerged it took a short time for the scale of it to become apparent.  We are not blind to the situation and have been very exercised about the problem.  We have responded quickly to every complaint.  We test and are continuing to test filling stations.  We are examining the supply chain returns made by all of the filling stations and are working our way back through the supply chain.  We are working intensively on the problem.  We are not blind to the pain that has been inflicted on the public by petrol stretching.  Obviously the individuals affected must pursue other remedies.</p><p>  Insurance companies are paying out but compensation needs to become more widespread.  Just like the Deputy, I am aware that some insurance companies are paying out for some claims.</p><p>  The Deputy asked whether we need further legislation.  As I pointed out, our overall strategy to deal with fuel fraud is to drive a much tighter and sounder supply chain.  A key element, when we identify traders in the supply chain, is our ability to withdraw their licence if we cannot force them to become compliant.  We have encountered some push-back on the matter but have pursued it very aggressively.</p> <p>We have closed down a very large number of filling stations during the past several years.  We have encountered some difficulty on that front in the past year and in the current Finance Bill, which I understand is before the Seanad, we are strengthening the legislative provisions in primary law that will clarify explicitly the grounds we may consider when examining an application for a licence or considering whether it is appropriate to revoke it. </p><p> The Deputy and the Chairman mentioned the issue of traceability and whether there is a difference in how we trace petrol and diesel through the supply chain.  I apologise to the Chairman for not responding to that point earlier.  As it creates a much greater risk and the issue in terms of diesel is of a completely different order, particularly the diversion of marked diesel into the raw diesel supply chain, we have much tighter reporting requirements in regard to those commodities in our monthly supply chain returns that traders make.  For those commodities, they must return each single transaction when they make their monthly return.  In regard to petrol, to date we have allowed traders to make an aggregate return where they produce the aggregate of their transactions with each trading partner during that month.  That was driven by our perception of where the greater risk lay and where the risk was of a lower order.  We are always conscious of the administrative burden we put on the trade when we introduce reporting requirements like this.  However, in light of what has happened, we gave an undertaking during discussions on the Finance Bill that we will certainly review whether the differential we have at present is appropriate.  </p><p> We need to bear in mind that we may not be looking at a petrol stretching problem here.  We have not concluded that is the case.  It may have been an accidental contamination at some point and that could be the problem but we will review it.  We also need to review it because methanol will be introduced in the UK, including in Northern Ireland, at some stage from next year as a motor fuel and, therefore, there will be potentially greater availability potentially of methanol on the market on the island.  In that context, we will review the differential.  We will consult the industry on this and we will take a view on it.  It is a question that has been raised and it is fair one.  We will consider whether we need to have more detailed reporting for petrol in light of this and other risks that are emerging.</p></speech>

I have questions written out and I will ask them without including any additions.  How often is there collaboration between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue Commissioners in regard to detecting and subsequently prosecuting issues of petrol stretching and the wider issues around that, for example, fuel laundering?  Are there any subversive groups involved in petrol stretching?  Is there a commonality of criminality between those who are involved in fuel laundering and petrol stretching?  How resourced is Revenue to deal with the issue?  That is a vague way of asking Mr. Moran if Revenue has sufficient resources to deal with that.  Are there any cross-links with the fuel launderers and the petrol stretchers?  What is the estimated loss to the Exchequer?</p><p>  In terms of aggrieved motorists, when one's finances are stretched and one has a car loan and finds one's car is no longer operable because of this criminality, is the only recourse one has through the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act?  If the answer is "No", which I suspect it is, is there a role here for the insurance companies to consider providing cover to those misfortunates who are trapped in this very regrettable situation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-03a.982" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerard Moran" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014120300006#J00800"><p>In terms of co-operation to tackle fuel fraud, we have extensive co-operation.  There is a cross-Border fuel fraud group on which the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Police Service of Northern Ireland and HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs, HMRC, are represented.  That group works very effectively and has been very effective in helping us and HMRC in Northern Ireland to identify fuel laundries.  There is excellent co-operation involving all the law enforcement agencies.  At a local level, I am aware that in Mayo and possibly in Roscommon also there is very close co-operation on the ground involving local Revenue officials and the Garda.  I understand that is working very effectively.</p><p>  The Deputy asked if subversive groups are involved.  There are organised crime groups and it is my understanding that some of them have their roots in long-standing criminality with a political character to it.  There is always a suggestion of dissident involvement.  Much of the fuel fraud seems to be centred in the north east of the island in an area spanning the Border.  Much of the sludge that has been dumped has tended to be in counties Louth and Monaghan and across the Border in Armagh and County Down.</p><p>  On the involvement of the fuel fraud groups in petrol stretching, I cannot comment on that yet.  As I said earlier, we have not established in fact that this has been a deliberate tax fraud rather than some other kind of contamination, so I would not say it but that is always the risk.  As I said at the outset, there is an incentive to engage in some petrol stretching here.  What I was pointing out is that it is of a different order to the kind of incentive that applied with regard to diesel laundering.</p><p>  The Deputy asked about resources and I have touched on that already.  We operate within the framework of the resources that are made available to us but we are satisfied that we are able to deal with the risks we face.  I gave the example earlier that with the fuel laundering problem we were able to deploy the resources to tackle that and on this occasion we have engaged intensively with this investigation and done a great deal of sampling, and are now investigating through the supply chain and following the paper trail on this.</p><p>  In terms of a loss to the Exchequer, we do not have that information.  Generally, it is very difficult to establish a tax gap in any particular sector because by its nature there is no data.  It is all happening in the shadows.  Those things are fraught with difficulty so we do not have an estimated cost of petrol stretching, if petrol stretching is occurring</p><p>  The Deputy mentioned the remedies available to motorists.  As regards consumers and citizens, I would have thought of assistance through the Consumers' Association of Ireland or through some civil remedy.  I know that groups of motorists affected by this problem have joined together.  That might be a helpful way for them to finance this and take a test case or whatever.  I am a Revenue official so this is way beyond my sphere of competence, but I understand that is probably what is happening.  </p> <p>Groups like this, of people who have been affected, probably understand the huge impact this has on the individuals and families concerned.  By acting collectively, they will have a great deal more power, whether it is in relation to suppliers or insurance companies or whatever.  I do not think there is much more I can say on the remedies that are available to them.</p></speech>

Most of this activity seems to be concentrated in specific areas in the west, and counties Roscommon and Meath.  It does not seem to occur so much in the south.  Is there a particular reason those areas are mainly targeted?  There might be a bit in Dublin but it does not seem to hit the radar as much.  There is obviously co-operation from certain people in those areas that is aiding and abetting the activity.  Is it also a phenomenon that, where there are borders, whether in Europe or otherwise, there tends to be a lot of smuggling operations?  I have read in the past about other borders in Europe where there tends to be activities relating to various kinds of smuggling.  Could the witnesses elaborate on that?</p><p>  Mr. Moran also said fuel fraud was not a new phenomenon.  Is he referring to petrol stretching or the doctoring of diesel?  Now that petrol prices have dropped so much, would that have an effect?  Mr. Moran said that the revenues seem to be coming up and this is probably related to the drop in fuel prices.   I am not too sure but maybe he could tell me.</p><p>  The witness said there was a new diesel marker coming on-stream in March.  We have been talking about combating the whole diesel issue for years.  Is the new marker to apply across Europe or between the UK and here?  I know there are different standards in different areas.  I do not know whether we can get a cost to the Exchequer as to how much this is but the witnesses are saying revenues seem to be going up so there is obviously an impact in terms of how much of it is taking place at the moment.</p><p>  Does Revenue have a role if a person is making a claim against an insurance company?  Is Revenue asked for information regarding a particular station in terms of a case where someone is looking for insurance?  I am curious about whether that happens.</p><p>  Is there any way stretched fuel can show up or be detected in an NCT test?  They seem to look at fumes and such.  Is stretched fuel even listed on the tests?  Is there a manual test?  I know it is very dangerous to tell someone to check their fuel tank, and there is some prohibition on accessing the tank or getting into it.  I would not be advising anyone to do it, but is there such a thing as a manual test?</p><p>  There are also other ways in which petrol could be used, such as in machinery of various sorts.  Is there any evidence of problems in that area?  Besides cars, are there other areas that could be affected?</p><p>  Mr. Moran mentioned that 130 filling stations have been dealt with since 2011.  Have any of them been closed down, have they been reopened, or is it a case that penalties have been imposed on them by way of either closure or serious fines?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-03a.985" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerard Moran" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014120300007#K00300"><p>To answer the Deputy's first question about why it is so regionally concentrated, and whether borders are a problem, we do not know at the moment why it is concentrated in a couple of regions.  It is clearly to do with the supply chain and distribution system.  This was not just one or two filling stations, it was a much larger number and it was obvious they were being supplied.  That is what we are examining at the moment.  We have not found evidence of any systemic problem outside of the areas of significant concentration.  There have been some but it has tended to be in the car-hire sector or similar, where the driver may have bought contaminated petrol in one of the focus areas.  Borders can be a problem in that they provide arbitrage possibilities for criminal gangs if they can move goods from one place to another.  That often provides an economic base for them to get up and running and provides the resources on the back of which they can develop wider and more extensive criminal activities.  It is always very important to look at price differentials here versus the North to try to minimise the possibilities for that kind of arbitrage as much as we can.</p><p>  The Deputy asked about petrol stretching not being a new phenomenon.  It is not, but what I want to make clear is that it is actually relatively rare and we do not encounter it much.  We had to go back quite some time to find the last occurrence of it when we were looking for an example for the committee.  I am not aware that it is a common occurrence at all, but it is always on the radar and occasionally there will be reports of it happening somewhere to a small degree and probably at a very low point in a distribution chain.  I am not aware of anything of a similarly systemic nature occurring elsewhere any time recently.</p><p>  The new marker will apply in Ireland and the UK only and it follows a joint initiative we undertook with Her Majesty's Revenue &amp;amp; Customs to get a more effective marker given the vulnerability of the existing one.  There is a Europe-wide marker and the new one is a further marker the authorities in Ireland and the UK will apply, and it will come into place from the end of March next year.</p><p>  We would not really have a role in respect of individual claims except where we have tested somebody's car.  If we have the results of tests, we would be able to provide them to the owner of the car.  We would not be able to advise them about filling stations.  As a tax administration, we have to operate on the basis of taxpayer confidentiality so we are not in a position to provide information about any taxpayer, whether it is a filling station or anybody else, to a third party.  In the context of litigation, if we were asked for evidence we would have to get legal advice in circumstances like that as to what we could or could not provide as evidence.  </p><p>  On testing of engines and petrol, I have seen suggestions on some blogs and boards advising people to take samples of petrol.  I must say that people should be careful of the risks of messing around with petrol.  It is a highly flammable commodity so I would think nobody would want to encourage people to do that.  I do not know whether it is possible for the NCT to test for stretched fuel but I suspect not.</p> <p>My understanding is that a person who wants to see whether damage has been done to an engine basically has to go to a garage to have it disassembled.  It is at that point that one can see whether corrosive material has built up where it should not be.  This would be evidence of the problem.</p><p> I was also asked about other areas where this might have an impact.  We are not aware of such areas.  The only instances we have heard of relate to cars.  There seems to be some variability in how it affects different types of cars, such as newer or older cars or those with different engine sizes.  That is why some people experienced fairly catastrophic problems with their cars very quickly after filling them with contaminated petrol, whereas in other instances these problems did not manifest themselves for quite some time.  It depends on people's driving patterns and on how much fuel was in the tank when the adulterated petrol was put in.  Many such variables mean that the pattern in which these problems are manifesting themselves is not uniform.</p><p> I will conclude by returning to an earlier question that I might not have answered.  All the indicators suggest that these problems are related to fuel that was bought at a point in time during the summer.  That is why problems which had not manifested themselves before now are still manifesting themselves occasionally.  It is probably for reasons like that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-03a.987" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1180" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014120300008#L00200"><p>I will be brief.  I think Mr. Moran has answered many of the questions I asked.  I thank him for making his presentation to the joint committee.  It has been mentioned that County Meath has had problems with fuel laundering in the past.  It appears that we currently have problems with fuel stretching as well.  Mr. Moran mentioned counties Cavan and Monaghan.  I would extend that to County Meath, to be honest.  As I have said, we have had a problem.</p><p>  It is often felt that people on the ground seem to know what is going on before anybody else is aware of it.  I spoke to a gentleman not too long ago who said he would be able to bet his house on a particular petrol tank pulling up in a particular village on a particular day, only for someone to follow it five minutes later as it goes off to a particular area.  Mr. Moran has said that Revenue has quite good contact with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Does it work directly with the public?  Is there a direct line that people can use to contact Revenue to say they have a feeling that something is going on?  Many people who know something is going on want to know why nothing is being done.</p><p>  I would like to ask another question.  Maybe Mr. Moran will not be able to answer it.  He mentioned that Revenue has a couple of cases coming up.  When it is looking at a prosecution, what exactly does it need in order to be able to prosecute?  It seems the petrol stations are being prosecuted.  I feel the criminal gangs that are adulterating this fuel need to be chased.  We sometimes meet owners who say they did not feel they had a choice other than to take what was brought to them.  That does not happen in all instances.  Where exactly is the focus?  Is it on the petrol station or on the criminal gangs?</p><p>  The Irish Petrol Retailers Association, which is an industry body representing over 500 independent petrol stations, is holding a series of events throughout Ireland to promote petrol stations that adhere to Government specifications.  I intend to attend one of its events next Monday.  The association has suggested that independent sampling or testing should be carried out.  Has Revenue been working with the association?  Is its suggestion something that Revenue would look at?  How often is testing carried out at the moment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-03a.988" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerard Moran" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014120300008#L00300"><p>I note what the Deputy has said about the geographical distribution of this problem.  We are tracking it.  I mentioned that it is centred on, or concentrated in, counties Mayo and Roscommon.  Obviously, it spreads out a bit further than that.  The other sort of geographical concentration seems to be centred on the Meath area.  That extends beyond Meath as well.  We are tracking every instance of a complaint being made about a filling station, and the number of complaints made about it.</p><p>  The Deputy also asked about reporting to us.  We are always eager to get any information about any irregular activity.  People can access us through our website or by contacting their local Revenue office.  We are really eager to get reports of odd-looking deliveries like that alluded to by the Deputy.  If an unmarked or odd-looking vehicle pulls into a filling station, we can cross-check that kind of activity against the supply chain returns that traders are required to make on a monthly basis.  We are eager to receive any reports like that.  If such reports are made at public meetings attended by Deputy McEntee or any other member of the committee, we would be grateful if they could encourage people to contact us.  We have a freefone number that people can contact us on.</p><p>  The Deputy asked what we need to take prosecutions.  If a forecourt retailer is selling stretched petrol, or green diesel in road diesel, it is an offence.  When we are looking for sufficient evidence on which to prosecute them, our initial efforts focus on testing the samples.  We will seek to prosecute any retailer who has adulterated fuel.  It is a cut and dried prosecution as far as we are concerned.  We will seek to do that.  I think that really puts an onus on retailers to exercise care about where they source their fuel from.  We examine these cases on a case-by case basis.  If we find a supplier with contaminated fuel as we work our way back up the supply chain, our policy is to prosecute him or her.  That is what we will do.  If we do not find what we are looking for at that stage - part of the difficulty of investigating this is that the fuel might have disappeared - we look for evidence of how the supplier has conducted his or her business.  If we can establish evidence of fraudulent activity on the basis of documentation - the bank records and all the other records of the business - we can prosecute on that basis.  As the committee will appreciate, we have to come up with evidence before we can do that.  Ultimately, the Director of Public Prosecutions will determine whether our investigation has produced sufficient evidence to sustain a prosecution.</p><p>  The Deputy's question about Revenue's relationship with the Irish Petrol Retailers Association gives me an opportunity to emphasise that we have had great co-operation from the industry, including the association in question, throughout the process of tackling the broader problem of fuel fraud we have been experiencing over several years.  We would be delighted to meet representatives of the association to discuss its plans for further measures to assure the integrity of its members' operations and the quality of the supply chain in general.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-03a.989" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1198" speakername="Michael Fitzmaurice" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014120300008#L00400"><p>I thank Mr. Moran for coming in.  It is widely known by those who have attended petrol-stretching meetings around the country that contaminated fuel was delivered to 14 or 15 filling stations in England a few months ago.  All of it had to be taken out again.  I know Revenue is aware of this.  Has that fuel been traced to see where it went?  Is there a risk that any of it came to Ireland?  Perhaps it was basically dumped on this country.</p><p>  I know a small bit about the nuts and bolts of this issue.  When one gets fuel - petrol or diesel - at the ports in Dublin, dye or bioethanol is added to it.  Is the calibration of those machines checked regularly?  I understand that Revenue does not sample each lorry going out to make sure things are done properly.  If each lorry going out was sampled to make sure the mix was right, and if there was an obligation for a similar sample to be taken where the fuel is delivered to, I suggest that much of what is going on at the moment could be cut down.  When kerosene was allegedly mixed with green diesel, those of us involved in the machinery business had to put in a pint of engine oil to make sure it did not damage the pump.  That was the only way to solve the problem.  Has any investigation been done to save someone who has not yet had this problem but is in danger of it developing?  Maybe something could be put into the fuel to prevent this from happening.</p> <p> There has been a lot of confusion about this around the country.  Revenue is good at putting out plenty of advertisements on the television and in newspapers when it is looking for money.  Procedures need to be implemented.  The situation needs to be explained to people throughout the country.  The figures were totally wrong on what was being delivered.  The figure of eight was given for Roscommon at one stage.  People need to be informed to go to the Garda to make a complaint and to go to Revenue also.  An advertising campaign on this is required. </p><p> Let us call a spade a spade.  The Department of Finance gets most of the money out of a litre of petrol.  There is, therefore, an obligation on Revenue and suppliers to resolve this problem.  There is an obligation on insurance companies also.  There are many people who cannot afford to fix their cars.  The Department of Finance can tell insurance companies what they can and cannot do.  Joined-up thinking is required because many families face decimation over this.  </p><p> It was mentioned earlier that this issue does not concern cars alone.  There are several ride-on lawn mowers throughout the country which have been damaged as a result of this.  It may affect other things such as consaws, although a two stroke mix is used in them.  However, this is a widespread problem.</p></speech>

There would be a handful of cases every year where the fuel is put into the wrong tank.  As soon as this is identified, it is recovered and taken back for reprocessing.  I said in my opening statement that we repay the duty on it.  Such an occurrence is a normal feature of the industry.  If diesel is contaminated with marked diesel, it cannot be sold as road diesel from a filling station. It will be recovered, brought back in, marked and recycled out as marked diesel.  The duty paid on it will be adjusted as appropriate.  If petrol is contaminated by the addition of diesel, the contaminated petrol will be recovered.  It will have to be brought back in for refining and it will go back onto the market after it has been refined.  Those are the procedures and protocols that the companies involved have in place.  The Revenue authorities are familiar with these issues and cater for them here, and in the UK.</p><p>  In terms of checks at ports, in major distribution centres we have staff control officers permanently assigned to carry out appropriate checks to ensure fuel is being correctly classified, volumes are correct and that we are getting the correct tax on it.  We are very satisfied with the controls we have in place.</p></speech>

I need to check it but I do not believe we take a sample.  We are interested in the volume.  Another agency is responsible for the biofuel content.  The companies do this in the warehouses.  The Deputy asked if we could sample every truck leaving the warehouse.  We could but it would cost a great deal to do so.  However, that would not prevent someone from contaminating the fuel at a later point in the supply chain.  For example, with diesel laundering, it was not being laundered in the warehouse, it was happening further down the distribution chain.</p></speech>

We need to start a process of elimination on who is being tarnished.  I spoke with a person who works on the docks in Dublin.  This person has been working on this for years.  He leads me to believe that when the mix is done, it is a machine that comes out over the lorry and puts in the dye, and that there is no sampling from thereon, out of the docks.  That is fine.  I am not saying they are doing anything wrong.  However, let us start the elimination where the problem lies.  Does Mr. Moran agree?</p></speech>

However, I will bear in mind the point raised by the Deputy and I will inquire into the precise nature of the checks we do at that point.  There is no real incentive for the distributors, at that point, not to comply with the regulations.  We have control staff checking the right proportions of dye are used.  I am guessing that does not extend to checking every single truck going out but they are there to ensure marked fuel is marked and that all the fuels that go out are accounted for and the tax is paid on them.  We undertake a programme of checks to ensure that happens.</p><p>  On the issue of an advertising campaign, I hope the message is sufficiently out there now.  We have had over 500 complaints.  Some of them were received directly, while others were received via the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with which we have liaised in order to get a handle on all of the complaints.  This is a well-established problem.  There have been public meetings, and people are contacting us.  I wish to repeat something.  To provide some assurance to the Deputy and other members of the committee, we have done a great deal of testing, with numbers running at about 100 samples of petrol a month.  From our current testing and the testing we have been carrying out for some time now, we have not been finding any evidence of any contamination.</p></speech>

We are talking about fuel fraud.  The emphasis is on petrol stretching because engines breakdown.  However, diesel fraud and diesel laundering is a much bigger problem.  The biggest victim in all of this is the taxpayer, given the amount of lost revenue.  Has any figure been put on the estimated loss of revenue arising from fuel fraud in general, for last year or the year before?  It was also stated that 3,000,000 gallons of laundered fuel was seized.  Were there successful prosecutions arising from this and, if so, what penalties were imposed?  Was it imprisonment or fines?</p><p>  It was also mentioned that a criminal network is involved in the fuel fraud and fuel laundering business, that it is a cross-Border fraud and that the agencies on both sides of the Border are trying to tackle it.  It was said that some of the criminal elements involved were people with a political involvement.  There have been some high profile cases involving the discovery of laundered fuel.  I have a question on the role of the Garda and Revenue's co-operation with the Garda on how to deal with the issue, given the nature of some of the criminal elements involved, which may have a paramilitary background.  I also wish to know if the Criminal Assets Bureau is involved.</p> <p>Some journalists who have investigated fuel laundering give figures such as &euro;40 million worth of fraud.  Has the Criminal Assets Bureau been involved and has it made any seizures as a result of work done by the Revenue Commissioners?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-03a.1003" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1083" speakername="Michael Colreavy" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014120300010#N00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for coming here today.  Diesel laundering is a crime because it is the same as taking money out of someone&rsquo;s pocket because the revenue does not go to the State.  It goes to crooks.  Petrol stretching has caught the public imagination because it is a particularly nasty crime.  We learned this morning that the profit margin is small but it puts considerable cost and inconvenience onto the public.  It is quite obvious that these people do not care about that.</p><p>  The only way I can put myself into the shoes of a forecourt manager is when I think about the central heating oil at home.  I deal with one supplier, one distributor with the same driver for the past several years and I trust that chain.  It has never let me down.  Something in the chain has broken until the customer puts the hose into the tank.  Do we need to consider registration, licensing conditions, the checks and balances from supplier to distributor to the forecourt?  Are they tight enough?  There seem to be weaknesses there.</p><p>  I was surprised to hear that 130 stations have closed.  How many of those closed because of diesel or petrol contamination?  Does that figure include people who could not pay their taxes because they did not have enough income?  What is the breakdown of those numbers?  If some were people who were proved to have contaminated diesel or petrol were they convicted?  Did any of them go to jail?  Can they open up another filling station or the same one again?  What are the sanctions for those people?</p><p>  There was a programme about this on radio two or three weeks ago.  A spokesperson for the Revenue Commissioners gave the impression that their job is to ensure the income for the State and engine damage is not their business.  It was not a well thought out message.  That made people very angry.  Whenever a spokesperson for the Revenue Commissioners speaks on this he or she should also speak about the avenues open to the people whose engines are damaged.</p><p>  Does the committee need to talk to an insurance regulator or financial services ombudsman?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-03a.1005" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1070" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014120300010#N00400"><p>I welcome the officials from the Revenue Commissioners.  This issue is plaguing my constituency, Mayo.  By virtue of that I am aware of other cases around the country.  Most citizens think of the Revenue Commissioners as a State organisation that knows how to get a job done, is effective, does an excellent job but their investigation of contaminated petrol has been a disaster.</p><p>  Investigations and complaints have been received since last June.  The forecourt filling stations give monthly returns of oil movements showing where they get petrol and so on.  We can assume that the Revenue Commissioners have tracked down the chain of supply.  Mr. Moran has told us that the State Laboratory carries out 100 tests a month but that for the most part this is inconclusive.  Hundreds of people&rsquo;s vehicles have been damaged or written off and some cannot afford to have them fixed.  The vigorous and proactive approach taken to dealing with diesel laundering needs to be taken in this case.  There is evidence that it was not.</p><p>  I know from replies to parliamentary questions that I have tabled since the end of September, the Garda was investigating 86 cases of petrol stretching in County Mayo but the Revenue Commissioners were dealing with eleven or 12.  That clearly indicated that they were not working together but I believe that they are now.  Is the State Laboratory not predominantly looking for markers in fuel and is it unable to identify some contaminants if they exist?  A feature of petrol stretching is that carbon is left on the pistons which causes the car to break down and is evidence that there was something wrong with the fuel but the Revenue Commissioners cannot attribute the source of the carbon.  No test has been developed to identify it.  Mr. Moran has said that as an official of the Revenue Commissioners consumer rights are not his area.  Consumers would like to hear after this meeting that a test case would be taken and there might be a breakthrough.  Would Mr. Moran comment on the serious problem in the chain of evidence?  There are time-lags as he has said in finding the contaminated fuel.  The individual has to show that he or she bought it and when, and prove that it was the problem fuel not a later fill.  When these cases come to court they will not have any success, apart from a small minority.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; system is wrong.  They talk about a risk-based approach and has tackled guys involved in diesel laundering.  They might look to the area that is not so well scrutinised.  They will not have any success because what they are doing is historic.  They deal with it only after the problem has happened.  There is a big gap between the problem and the evidence when the cars break down.  They will go nowhere.  The truth needs to be told, if people&rsquo;s expectations are raised about this.</p><p>  There are suggestions that insurance companies ought to do this that and the other.  Insurance companies are bound by contracts.  If they are not obliged to cover this they will not do so.  I am not saying there are not exceptional cases but there are some exclusion clauses in insurance contracts for petrol stretching.  The people who have gone through enough do not want to hear any sort of vagueness.  I have tabled numerous parliamentary questions on this and that is why I am delighted to be able to speak to Mr. Moran.</p><p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice spoke about contaminated petrol that was supposed to go to Bournemouth but was withdrawn from the UK market and sent over here.  We are wide open here because the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; system does not test tankers or filling stations before now.</p> <p> Mr. Moran cannot and did not confirm that any petrol tanks in filling stations or any fuel tanks of trucks were tested prior to June of this year.  What he said in that respect was that he did not know.  I understand that it was not done and I have formed that view from talking to people in business and those in petrol forecourts.  A proactive approach is not being taken to tackle this problem but such an approach is needed.  In terms of what is alleged to have happened in regard to Bournemouth, we are not testing fuel that is coming into this country.  I imagine the people engaged in this activity will not be operating under the nose of Revenue.  There is less likely to be a mixing of fuel and the putting in place of bad fuel.  However, such fuel will be brought in but Revenue is not testing fuel here.  Anybody with a batch of bad fuel they want to get rid of could move it to Ireland.  </p><p> What we need, and I ask that this be explored, is for consideration to be given to the introduction of a system of quality control to be funded by the distributors.  Those are the people making money out of it.  There should also be a mobile laboratory.  Mr. Moran mentioned there was a case in the east coast where it was suspected that kerosene has been blended with petrol which has caused a problem.  Revenue had to go through the process of taking a sample, sending it to a laboratory and how many weeks elapsed before it got a certificate of analysis?  I ask Mr. Moran and Mr. Butler how many vehicles will have been destroyed in the meantime?  That is too long to wait.  Those people's operations should be shut down.  I ask the delegates that a quality control system be introduced where petrol is tested to ensure that we know that quality petrol is for sale on the market.  There is a crisis of consumer confidence in this market.  I do not believe that Revenue will have any problem in getting co-operation from legitimate forecourt traders.  I ask that such a system be implemented in order that consumers purchasing petrol and paying tax on it know that what they are getting is the real McCoy.</p><p> On the cross-Border element, Mr. Moran spoke about shutting down 130 filling stations and mentioned a prosecution.  Has the Criminal Assets Bureau been involved or what confiscations have taken place?  Is such action being taken in the North?  Are they viewing the problem with the same severity that it is being viewed with here?  How many filling stations, fuel laundering and petrol stretching operations have been shut down?  Is intimidation a factor there?  All the evidence, and anecdotal evidence, is that subversive paramilitary style operations are in operation here.  Is it a case that they are too much trouble to tackle?  We can talk about the Border, but the petrol that has been stretched did not come from Mayo up to north of the Border.  It is not happening in that way and I wonder how much of the contaminated fuel is going from the South to the North as opposed from the North to the South?  What confiscations are taking place?  What action is being taken by the Assets Recovery Agency in the North of Ireland?</p></speech>

There is a problem with the system and if that is not going to be addressed, motorists will be lame ducks and the people whose vehicles have been damaged will be lame ducks again.  Something needs to be done.  The idea that we will get a lot of convictions in the future as a result of all the serious work Revenue is doing, which is based on looking at an historical situation, is not going to happen.  What will be done to stop incidents such as that of the contaminated fuel from Bournemouth from being brought into this country?  What tests will be conducted in filling stations?  How will such operations be stamped out?  They need to be stamped out in the same way as Revenue succeeded in stamping out diesel laundering.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-12-03a.1010" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerard Moran" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014120300011#O00500"><p>Deputy Kenny raised the question about the estimated loss of revenue from diesel fraud.  As I said earlier, with any illegal activity, there is a huge difficulty in estimating the cost to the Exchequer.  We are able to make a stab at it in regard to illegal tobacco on the basis of surveys conducted on the packets people have and from where they got them.  Therefore, we are able to come up with a notional loss to the Exchequer in regard to tobacco.  With regard to most other areas where there is a degree of non-compliance or tax fraud, there are not very solid ways of coming up with satisfactory estimates.  I am afraid that I am not able to say that we have got one of what it has cost us over the years.  We are doing some work currently on the basis of the increased legitimate consumption we are seeing and the increased revenues that have flowed from diesel consumption in the past few years.  If that amounts to something, we will publish it, but as things stand we are not able to put an estimate on what the cost is.</p><p>  The Deputy mentioned the organised crime groups with paramilitary connections.  They exist and they are a big part of the problem.  It is for that reason that we have very well developed and solid working relationships with the Garda, Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, the Police Service of Northern Ireland and HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs in Northern Ireland.  As I mentioned earlier, there is a cross-Border fuel fraud group and a cross-Border tobacco fraud group.  Those activities are being tackled.  There are forums for sharing of intelligence in regard to individual targets and all of that work proceeds.  The CAB is very much a key player in targeting the organised crime groups and that happens as a matter of course.  The CAB publishes its annual report every year and the assets it would seize, or the tax assessments it would raise, on figures in organised crime groups will not be attributable to particular areas of activity that they have got.  It pursues them across the spectrum of their activities and goes after whatever assets or income it can find.  To reassure the Deputy, the CAB is a crucial part of the machinery of the State in tackling organised crime groups and it is very successful in doing that.  </p><p>  The question of penalties was raised by a number of Deputies.  In terms of the penalties in place, on a summary conviction, the maximum fine is &euro;5,000 and or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months and on conviction on indictment, the maximum fine is &euro;126,970 and or a custodial sentence not exceeding five years.  In practice we have been securing rather modest court fines because what seems to happen is that when we proceed with an indictable an indictable prosecution, we will either secure a custodial sentence, although it may be suspended in many cases.  Looking at the total, we have had five people sentenced for fuel fraud crimes.  We have had two custodial sentences and three suspended sentences and in those cases I understand there have not been any fines imposed.   What happens if they are giving a custodial sentence, regardless of whether it is suspended, there is not a fine.  The other fines we have got are where there is a summary prosecution.  The average fine they were getting in those cases is about &euro;2,500.</p><p>  In terms of how we proceed, if there is evidence for a prosecution, we will take a prosecution, but much of our activity proceeds on the basis of their compliance first, with the law and second, with the requirement to keep records and comply with licensing conditions.  As I said earlier that is where the business of dealing with the 130 filling stations and our ongoing challenges to traders, whether it is filling stations or suppliers, comes in. </p><p>  Regarding the filling stations that we would close, it would not necessarily be because we have discovered that a prosecutable offence was committed or an offence as such.  What we are discovering is that they are not satisfying the conditions of their licence and, therefore, we withdraw the licence.  If they continue to trade, and that is where many of the seizures of fuel arose, we have gone in and pumped out that filling station or that trader.  We seize the product.</p><p>  As a tool for tackling problems in the sector, licensing is the key.  A number of Deputies drew attention to the significance of that, and that has been our approach also.  We want to have stringent conditions attaching to all the players in the sector.</p> <p>We have to pursue them and where they are not meeting those conditions we are aggressive in seeking to have their licence revoked.  That said, we have had some push-back on this and as a result of that we have had to strengthen the primary legislation.  Where we have had push-back we are appealing to the Supreme Court, but in the meantime we are strengthening the primary legislation to clarify the grounds we have to take on operators that are not meeting the standards prescribed in excise law that are attached to their licences.  </p></speech>

I cannot rule that out but in the main the Deputy can take it that the filling stations were closed for breaches of licensing conditions.  Our strategy has been to put in place a system of controls so that we have integrity in the supply chain, and that is what we do.  In order to have that, all the suppliers in the supply chain and everybody in the industry has to play by the rules.</p><p>  We seek to identify where there is a failure to comply with the rules and where that is happening we withdraw the licence and revoke it.

If somebody could go onto the forecourts to check petrol, one would have an immediate indication as to whether there is a contaminant in the petrol.  One could then proceed accordingly to protect Revenue, the State and the individual citizen in that regard.  Would that not be a sensible way to go?  Mr. Moran would not then be spending many months trying to find evidence of contaminated fuel that he will not find.  Is that not a waste of resources?  One will never find a problem with most of the fuel that is being tested.  That was my initial point.  Mr. Moran needs to be proactive because of the logistics of identifying contaminated petrol.</p></speech>

That has been clear from the judgments we have received concerning licences that have been revoked.  We simply cannot close down a filling station there and then on the basis of a sample that we would draw at a mobile laboratory.  That is not the kind of legal framework that Revenue operates within.  Due process has to be followed in withdrawing a licence.  The Deputy will appreciate that in doing so, one is potentially effectively closing down an operator's livelihood.</p></speech>

Where Mr. Moran has identified that it is contaminated fuel, I believe in due process as well.  However, no more than with other licences - such a liquor licences - where people operate outside the parameters of their business, things can be done quickly to shut down a pub or nightclub that is not operating correctly.  I dare say that it should also be done for a filling station that is not operating correctly.  A lot of time has elapsed between finding evidence of petrol stretching and anything being done about it.  In view of the historical basis of Mr. Moran's investigation, we now know that in most cases nothing will show up whatsoever.  We complain about a lack of resources in the State Laboratory but surely there is also a waste of resources.  We know that Mr. Moran will not find anything because of the way the system is designed.  It is very frustrating to have to explain this to the public.</p></speech>

It is about a balance between the rights of various citizens and operators, as to whether on the basis of some sample a business is to be shut down or whether a legal process has to be completed.  That is a much broader question for legislators.</p></speech>

If there is a need for further legislation this committee can suggest that.  What we have identified, however, is that there may be a gap in the legislation in this instance.  I suppose Mr. Moran is saying that people are innocent until proven guilty, so we have to operate on that basis.  That is frustrating for the person whose car is effectively out of service, however.  That is the difficulty we have here.  The problem has been identified and needs to be addressed in some way.</p></speech>

It is not teed up that way at the moment.</p><p>  I wish to raise one other point of interest as both gentlemen are present.  The cost of a barrel of crude oil is down by one third, yet we have only seen a drop of a few cent per litre at filling stations.  Can Mr. Moran enlighten us why that is the case?  Is there a cartel in fuel distribution?  Part of the problem with people laundering fuel is the cost of fuel.</p></speech>

The excise duty remains constant regardless of the price.  There is a specific tax in respect of the excise duty and the carbon tax.  VAT is a function of the price and consequently as the price level goes down, so too does the VAT yield and, similarly, when the price rises so too does the VAT yield.  I do not have a view on the relationship between prices in Ireland and world prices.  I do not know whether there were some other points I have not picked up from earlier.</p></speech>

If there was a risk, if one was worried about a particular delivery, if somebody tipped one off - as was suggested earlier - and if there seems to be an irregular delivery to a filling station, if we were alerted to something like that, we would go out very quickly to take a sample from that filling station.  While one might look at that sample or whatever, we primarily would rely on the analysis of the State Laboratory and hence the sample would be for the State Laboratory.</p></speech>

We cannot take samples on the roadside for health and safety reasons.  It is a highly flammable product and there is a huge volume of it in a tanker.  Consequently, we take samples at filling stations.  To clarify, we take samples of diesel all right, just not of petrol.  We certainly take roadside samples of diesel but not of petrol, which is what I had in mind.</p><p>  May I repeat something I have stated previously?  Much of our activity is not about physical sampling.  It is about the supply chain and the paper trail right through the supply chain, namely, through the distributors and suppliers down to the forecourts.  This therefore is a focus of our activity and is where our current investigations are focusing.  It is focusing on participants in that supply chain coming back up from the retailers.  We are investigating this intensively at present and that is what we must do.  If we want to prosecute somebody, we must establish evidence that will support the prosecution.  If we do not do that, we will seek evidence of players in the supply chain who are not complying with the standards or the rules that apply to that sector.  Where that happens, one will not get a prosecution.  However, if we have a sufficient basis to withdraw a licence from an operator and that will withstand a court challenge, then that is what we will do.  We have been aggressive in doing this and have been highly successful in so doing.  Suggestions that we have been relaxed or whatever in respect of pursuing fuel fraud in general or in responding to the current problem are unfair.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Moran have an idea as to how much contaminated fuel or laundered fuel is sent from South to North and <i>vice versa</i>?  Based on Mr. Moran's own experience, would it be fair to state that for the most part, the fuel is coming from the North to the South?</p></speech>

Obviously, the criminals are no respecters of borders at all.  I would only be speculating about where is the source of fuel for laundering and where it is distributed but I will go back to a point I neglected to answer and which the Deputy raised earlier about the number of fuel stations that have been closed down north of the Border.  They do not have the same licensing regime we have and I understand therefore that they have been unable to replicate in the North what we have been able to achieve here in terms of tackling the sector.</p><p>  In respect of supply chain controls, they have a registered dealer and controlled oil system for marked fuel.  It is a paper-based system and consequently, they do not really have a supply chain control system.  They introduced that system perhaps ten years before we introduced our system and as a result have more limited supply chain controls.  We have much more extensive supply chain controls here, as well as a tougher regulatory regime, which has allowed us to tackle traders that were not observing the standards we wished them to observe.  I should tell the Deputy that this will be very much a feature of how we proceed with the investigation that is currently under way with regard to all that petrol and the damage to engines that has occurred.</p></speech>

I hope the joint committee has conveyed to them the frustration of the public in this regard.  Moreover, this frustration is increasing rather than decreasing because there do not appear to be solutions on the horizon.  However, Mr. Moran has explained some of the reasons for that.  Arising from the discussion today, it is obvious that this is a major issue.  While the areas may be confined, the issues within those areas are significant and obviously, the joint committee will continue hearings on this matter.  We were disappointed that for various reasons, the insurance federation and the consumer association did not appear before the joint committee today.  However, they will appear before the joint committee in the future in an effort to get all the stakeholders involved to come to a solution.

Certainly, the notifications of damage and the complaints we are hearing have dropped off and, as I stated, I believe they relate to instances in which people got fuel some time ago.  If this was fraud rather than a contamination, it was a self-defeating fraud because people power will be one factor to drive this.  The business of anybody who is associated with contaminated fuel will suffer and consequently, quite apart from our efforts, the reaction of consumers will be hugely influential.</p></speech>
