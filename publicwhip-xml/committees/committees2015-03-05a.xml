Representatives are willing to attend but do not have information.</p></speech>

It did not mean any disrespect to this committee but it does not have any information.  That is the gist of the information they gave me.  The letter they sent says they are not in possession of records with regard to this matter.</p></speech>

That is why the bank attended the Public Accounts Committee in London.</p></speech>

From what the Chairman said, we can take up the offer to attend.  And they willing to come in?</p></speech>

If the individual in London was helpful to the Public Accounts Committee in the UK, surely they can provide information via him that is of interest here.  If it is the wish of members, we can get back to HSBC in Dublin and in the headquarters and suggest they send to the meeting of the PAC someone who has some briefing material.</p></speech>

They will know who has the information and we do not.</p></speech>

Surely HSBC is a single organisation with different branches and structures.  If there were so many Irish HSBC accounts in the Swiss section, surely there is some procedure between the bank's offices here and the bank's offices there.  There must be something about the process under which they operate.  Under any circumstances, we should invite them to come in here even if they say they have no relevant documentation.  There are bound to have useful material about how they operate.</p></speech>

Let us not beat around the bush.  We can ask them questions correctly.  If the representative comes back and says that he does not have the information, we will make our minds up then.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-05a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015030500002#B01400"><p>They may be separate entities within HSBC, but before getting into that, we should write to Mr. Duffy again and to the individual who appeared before the Public Accounts Committee in the UK and ask if someone can be briefed who can assist us with our efforts with the Revenue Commissioners.  That would be helpful.  A representative should be here.</p> <p>  The next item, No. 3A, is correspondence from Accounting Officers or Ministers.  No. 3A.1 is correspondence, dated 4 March 2015, from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is a follow-up from our meeting of 5 February 2015 and is to be noted and published.  This correspondence was received yesterday but, as it relates to issues that may arise at today&rsquo;s meeting, it is included in today&rsquo;s correspondence.  We can use the correspondence to raise the issue in a later session with the Department.</p> <p>  We also have individual correspondence received since the meeting of Thursday, 26 February 2015, the first being correspondence from Mr. William Treacy regarding ongoing issues with Horse Racing Ireland, the second from Mr. Mairtin O&rsquo;Riordain, Gaelscoil Charraig na Siuire, regarding costs of rents, which is to be noted, published and forwarded to the Department of Education and Skills for a note on the matters raised.  We will indicate that to the writer.</p> <p>  No. 3B.3 is correspondence, dated 19 February, received from the Office of the Commissioner for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, regarding St. Paul's Garda Medical Aid Society, to be noted and published.  A copy will be forwarded to Mr. Michael Keane.  It is noted that previous correspondence from Mr. Keane was up on our website.  Having discussed it, and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na having reached its conclusion, we can take it down as a public document.</p> <p>  No. 3B.4 is correspondence received from Mr. Eamonn Howard regarding Howth Fisheries Centre.  This is to be noted and we will include the issue in our upcoming report.  We are awaiting a reply from the Department on the extent of vacant properties, and a reminder should issue to the Department as it is holding up our report.  Given what we saw in Howth and reports from our last committee meeting, we must highlight this and get a response from the Department.  I would have expected greater efficiency in reply from the Department.  We should remind it that it is holding up the work of the Committee of Public Accounts and it is not right that the Department should do so.  We must get the information together.  Otherwise, we can have a further hearing on the matter and members would not mind sitting on a Tuesday to have the hearing.  We will be further delayed by this Department and we should not stand for these delays any longer.</p> <p>  No. 3B.5 is correspondence, dated 23 February 2015, received from Mr. Aidan Horan regarding access to NAMA contracts.  This is to be noted and forwarded to NAMA for a note on the matters raised.  Is this the big briefing document we received from an individual?</p></speech>

We will ask NAMA for a response.  We will deal next with documents relating to today&rsquo;s committee meeting.  Nos. 3C.1 and 3C.7 are the briefing documents and opening statements for today&rsquo;s meeting, to be noted and published.  Of the reports, statements and accounts received since our meeting of 26 February, No. 4.1 concerns the Travellers protection fund and No. 4.2 concerns Ordnance Survey Ireland.  These accounts are to be noted.  The work programme is now on screen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-05a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/953" speakername="Shane Ross" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015030500002#B01700"><p>Perhaps the Comptroller and Auditor General can throw some light on the report yesterday about the HSE.  The Taoiseach referred to it in the D&aacute;il when he said people should pay back the money involved.  The Comptroller and Auditor General produced a draft report, which was leaked to Senators, and it showed a large lack of control in the HSE, overspending on expenses and people being overpaid and the money not being paid back.  These are merely samples of what the Comptroller and Auditor General produced in a draft report.  He sent it back to the HSE and somehow it leaked.  It is something we should interest ourselves in.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-05a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015030500002#B01800"><p>At the end of each audit of a set of financial statements, the staff at my office prepare a report for the management, bring to its attention control issues, control weaknesses and matters we consider management is required to address and where it needs to make changes to the control systems as necessary.</p><p>The procedure in general is that the points raised by us are put to management and we ask it for a response.  We require it to go on record as to what it will do about these issues.  They are incorporated in the management letter and it is then formally sent to the chief executive officer of the HSE, as in this case.  It stands then as a record between us of actions we require.</p><p> In a subsequent financial audit, we would look at the actions it has undertaken to take to see whether it actually made the changes it committed to make.  In the normal way, that document would not be published.  It is not published by us.  If there was a control weakness which we felt was important and it was not addressed in a timely way, I could then reflect on it and consider that a report should be published and action taken.  That is basically the origin of the document.  As I understand it, the material that came into the public domain was a draft being prepared by it to respond to our recommendations.  It is not a complete document from its side.  There is quite a bit of material there and not everything has the same weight or importance but certainly there are issues on which we felt action was required from it and we would expect to see that action undertaken.</p></speech>

It has a column called "rankings" and it is low in a number of very key areas.</p></speech>

It may not have happened yet, but we are trying to draw it to its attention so it can make changes that would avert any losses.  If we find in any of those areas that a loss has actually occurred, we would certainly require it to draw attention to it in its statement of internal financial control and to disclose there has been a loss.  However, in the normal way where it is just a weakness, we bring it to its attention and require it to address it before a loss can occur.</p></speech>

We are talking about extravagance and lack of controls.  We are not necessarily talking about losses.  Are we just talking about controls?</p></speech>

Generally a management letter will focus on controls but controls can include controls which should ward off circumstances where there is extravagance.</p></speech>

If we are looking at travel and subsistence, for example, we look at a sample and may identify problems in the sample.  It could be that we would look at 20 samples and find difficulties with one.  In the greater scheme of things and given the expenditure of the HSE, some overexpenditure in a travel and subsistence area is not that significant in terms of its overall budget but it is something that would have a reputational risk for the HSE.  We try to ensure it is aware of what is expected in terms of using travel and subsistence expenditure in an appropriate manner.</p></speech>

What we do when we prepare the management letter is to create a record of our engagement with the HSE in relation to the 2013 financial statements, as in this case.  The higher level issues or higher priority issues we identify in that letter have already been brought to the attention of the audit committee in the HSE.  When the report is finalised, it will be with the audit committee and we will explain to it our concerns and then it would work with HSE management to ensure that the weaknesses were addressed.</p></speech>

Does the Chairman want to bring it up now or will he wait?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-05a.50" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015030500002#C02800"><p>I will bring it up in the context of this issue.  The documents were released yesterday.  They could have been released in error or for any reason but the history of the HSE and the Committee of Public Accounts has been that we have often had hearings and while people from the HSE have been with us, documents would be released to the newspapers.  There is more than one example of that.  Now that this issue is in the public domain, we need to understand why it happened.  Some Senators and other people had this document yesterday but we still have not been provided with it out of courtesy in order that we would know what is in it.  Luckily enough, we were meeting today and the Comptroller and Auditor General explained it.</p> <p>  I want to tie what has happened into a note members received this morning.  Members received the note this morning simply because a big document was presented to me and I gave it to the clerk, about which I informed the committee a number of weeks ago.  This document shows where contracts were awarded without any tender.  They were awarded to former employees of the HSE who are now acting outside of the HSE in an independent business.  In more than one instance, these contracts were awarded without a competitive tender and in one case at least a report was prepared at a cost of &euro;98,374.23.  That report was reviewed by another company at a cost of &euro;58,216.41 to date.  This is all happening between HSE and companies outside of the HSE which happen to employ former employees of the HSE.</p><p>It is alleged in the document that in one instance the Health Service Executive is recommending former staff to section 39 bodies where investigations are needed, at a cost of &euro;1,000 per day.  In light of the information that emerged in the public domain yesterday and the allegations made in the note circulated by the clerk to the committee, which is a summary of the information in the larger document, we should have representatives of the HSE come before the committee sooner rather than later.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-05a.52" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015030500002#D00200"><p>The most worrying element of this information is the potential conflict of interest that arises.  Having recently dealt with two or three cases involving sexual or physical abuse of people in care, I find it very worrying that someone who may be contracted by the HSE could potentially have a conflict of interest.  One of the tasks of the committee will be to ascertain how widespread is the practice of not tendering contracts and employing former HSE staff to do various jobs and carry out investigations.</p></speech>

Perhaps we need to ask some of our Seanad colleagues to provide us with a copy.  We should also ask the HSE to provide a copy.</p> <p>  I agree that representatives of the HSE should come before the committee.  I note they are scheduled to appear on 2 April, which is four weeks from now and perhaps a little too long a period to wait.  Would it be possible to re-jig the agenda and have the HSE appear sooner?  Will members be given the full dossier?</p></speech>

The first is the unhealthy, cosy insider relationship between entities that are contracting for business, while the second relates to an allegation or allegations of sexual abuse, how these allegations are pursued, the structure of investigations and so forth.  Not having seen the dossier, I am not sure whether I should be more concerned about the issues related to procurement and tendering or the suggestion that there may have been malpractice involved in pursuing complaints of abuse.  The committee will have to consider how we can advance this issue.</p></speech>

As Deputy Deasy stated, we must determine if the practice is widespread.  The other issues have been reported under the whistleblower&rsquo;s legislation as they are matters for the Garda.  That is the position.</p></speech>

Is this an isolated incident or are complaints in respect of vulnerable adults, children and others being investigated in a similar fashion?  Members are at a loss because we do not have access to the information that is available to the media.  The Health Service Executive has a responsibility to ensure that people who approach it are treated with dignity.  The scant information available to us suggests there are serious questions to be asked.</p></speech>

We have provided clarity on next week&rsquo;s meeting.  St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day falls in the following week and we will meet representatives of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority on 26 March.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I will comment briefly on yesterday's meeting with Northern Ireland Public Accounts Committee, which was interesting, productive and worthwhile in cross-Border terms.  It was also good to have the Comptroller and Auditor General from both jurisdictions give a report on a cross-Border project that resulted in a loss of &euro;4.3 million to the authorities North and South.  Many issues arising from this project must be addressed through public hearings of the Committees of Public Accounts, North and South.  One of the issues that stood out was that &euro;1.3 million was spent on equipment valued at &euro;30,000 that was almost obsolete.  This gives a flavour of the extent of the problem with the project in question.  While it was initially to be funded by the European Union, it was ultimately funded by the Governments in both jurisdictions and some substantial payments were made without any paperwork being provided.  The end result of the project was to be a cross-Border fibre optic cable and broadband service.  There is a question as to whether some of the cable was already in the ground.  The company that tendered for the project had a profit of &euro;30,000 on a turnover of &euro;500,000 and one director and other internal entities were trading with each other and drew down money in a highly questionable project.  We agreed yesterday that the two clerks would liaise and set a date for two separate hearings, one in the North on 18 March and a second in this jurisdiction shortly thereafter.  Can the report be circulated?</p></speech>

As with the Health Service Executive, one wonders how many of the regulations and agreements on procurement and spending of taxpayers&rsquo; money are ignored, resulting in the making of these types of payments.

This is a desperate situation for people to find themselves in.  I do not necessarily suggest that we are the people to remedy that, but given the circumstances, we should be saying something that points beyond that the HSE should look at adequacy of services and so on.  That sounds a little pat from the point of view of families of wards of court.  We can bring forward amendments to this, but is there a particular timeframe for dealing with the issue?  When do we propose to complete, agree and launch the report?</p></speech>

We need the committee&rsquo;s help, not just for the companies we represent but for microbusinesses throughout Ireland.  The heart of the problem is that Ireland has a public procurement policy which is not fit for purpose.  Our economy is mainly comprised of microbusinesses which are locked out of the &euro;9 billion public procurement spend.  The current OGP policy is to get the lowest price for goods and services and to use large aggregate contracts to achieve price economies.  These policies exclude microbusinesses in several ways.  While microbusinesses may not offer the cheapest price they do offer value for money.  If the criterion of the most economically advantageous tender were used instead of price, then value for money, after sales service and social value could be assessed.  This approach is encouraged by the EU and would allow microbusinesses to win tenders.  Procurement savings can be made while achieving other Government goals such as boosting job creation, preventing regional imbalances and fostering innovation.  The OGP sees these goals as outside its remit and contrary to EU policy, despite their successful use in other jurisdictions such as Wales.  The narrow price focus has led to the OGP exporting vital business to other countries.  The amount lost is unknown because there are no figures.  When the amount is tallied in the future, probably by the EU, Irish people will demand answers.</p><p> It is a practical impossibility for a group of microbusinesses to win an aggregate contract.  It needs one principal applicant big enough to take responsibility for the entire tender, and if our products become the subject of an aggregate contract, our industry will be wiped out overnight.  Even if groups of small companies overcome the practical difficulties of forming consortia, they cannot win against multinationals with deep pockets such as Office Depot, the winner of the stationery contract, which has an annual turnover of $17 billion.  The OGP has insufficient safeguards against predatory pricing.  Aggregate contracts are not designed to deliver quality or, in some instances, safe products.  They may also have losses on non-core items.  There have been piecemeal attempts to make current procurement policy more SME, not microbusiness, friendly but they have failed to stanch the haemorrhaging of jobs.  Educating SMEs about procurement was one.  Lack of participation is not down to ignorance but to a business decision not to waste money chasing contracts they have no hope of winning.  Circular 10/14 is another.  It encourages SME involvement but is purely aspirational and has no sanctions for non-implementation.  Breaking contracts into lots will not work unless the lots are sufficiently small and limited to one per company.</p><p> Why save microbusinesses?  We would make a costly addition to the live register and microbusinesses put more money back into the localities than large firms, which has a multiplier effect.  We support local supply chains, regional employment and pay rates.  Our profits remain in Ireland and, unlike multinationals, we support our communities.  We maintain competition and, by destroying so many microbusinesses, the OGP may be acting anti-competitively.  We ask the committee to conduct an economic impact study on the effects of current procurement policy and find a new model more suited to the Irish economy, one which utilises the &euro;9 billion spend to achieve value for money, boost employment and support local communities.  The OGP is capable of so much more than merely delivering cheap goods and services.  Why waste it?</p></speech>

Noonan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015030500002#F00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to make a submission and have a discussion on issues regarding public procurement today.  I am joined on our delegation by the Small Firms Association, SFA, director, Patricia Callan, and Ian Martin, who is a member of the SFA national council and the managing director, MD, of his own business, Martin Services.  I too have my own business, Rhonellen Developments.  The SFA is the voice of small business in Ireland and internationally, with 8,000 members and seven affiliated organisations in all sectors and parts of the country.  Our written submission today contains some detailed commentary on the issues our members face with public procurement and some examples of the type of specific feedback we have received from members on the tendering process.</p> <p>  In my brief opening remarks, I would like to highlight a few key points.  In its pursuit of lowest price, the Government is neglecting the fact that this will not deliver either the quality, cost in use savings or service levels it desires, but will result in lost jobs here at home.  Centralised large aggregated contracts make it increasingly difficult for small innovative companies to compete and this means a serious potential loss of business.  These should be broken into lots.  The idea that small companies can simply join together with their competitors and compete for larger contracts is simplistic in the extreme.</p> <p>  In 2013, the published data suggest that 28% of tenders are being awarded to countries outside of Ireland, up from a previous high of 18% recorded.  Ireland frequently tops the list of countries most likely to award to non-national countries, and this trend is increasing all the time.  This is completely unsatisfactory.  We need to put supporting Irish SMEs and microbusinesses at the heart of all Government policy-making.  While some progress has been made over the past year with the publication of circular 10/14, the establishment of the SME working group on public procurement by the OGP, and the development of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission guide to consortium bidding, there has been no tangible improvement in SME access to public procurement over the past year.</p> <p>  What is now needed is removal of the price priority.  Where price accounts for more than 35% of a contract, the whole contract becomes based on price.  We need set targets for SME procurement, as in other jurisdictions, and 75% is reasonable for local communities.  The OGP needs to start thinking value as opposed to price.  We need regionalised contracts, lower thresholds and a change in the provisions around subdividing a contract into lots as currently set out in circular 10/14 because it is easier for procurers to opt out than in.  A full appeals mechanism should also be implemented forthwith, which would include mandatory feedback on all lost tenders, more scrutiny and transparency throughout the system, an internal appeals procedure in each Department and the opportunity to appeal to an ombudsman.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for its time and attention and we look forward to a discussion.</p></speech>

I know their organisations have been very active on this and have advocated strongly.  I commend that work.  They have put forward a very compelling argument and identify quite precisely the flaws in the system.  I am conscious of the necessity for the State to get this right given the level of spend, &euro;9 billion, and the cost if we get it wrong in respect of jobs and innovation for SMEs and particularly for microbusinesses.  The submissions and discussion today can inform from the front line the questions we pursue with the OGP and the Department.</p> <p>  The witnesses have said making price the benchmark is problematic.  Can they say a bit more about that?  They mention predatory pricing.  An alarm goes off in my head when I hear that term.  I would like to hear more about that.  Mr. Noonan mentioned quality being undermined or not considered.  Could he tell us about that?  Both witnesses identify the problem of aggregate contracts.  When we raise this with the system we get a simplistic view that people can club together if they are trained and join forces.  We need to hear the reality check on that.  What is the realistic level for the unbundling of contracts?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-05a.102" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. A.J. Noonan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015030500002#F00500"><p>I will give a good example of quality versus price.  In the past year the Health Service Executive, HSE, awarded a contract for a machine in a hospital.  The unsuccessful bidder was 12.5% below the price.</p><p>I made the point that it was way off the mark and was the same machine.  He said his machine had a life cycle of 20 years, but the machine that was bought has a life cycle of two years and parts would not be available in two years time.  It is a good example of the quality issue.</p><p> One of the major issues in regard to unbundling is that 50% of Irish companies only operate within a 25 km radius.  They will not tender for any business unless it is regionalised and in much smaller lots.  They will not bother tendering for business, because it is outside their comfort zone.  I understand another 40% operate within 100 km.  Many companies do not get a chance to tender because it is outside their comfort zone.  The unbundling, regionalisation and disaggregation of contracts is necessary.  The Minister's predecessor supported that, and I pay tribute to Deputy Perry.</p><p> There is disengagement with the system.  Reference was made to training in SMEs.  The first people who should receive training are those working in procurement.  They have no training in procurement and are awarding contracts willy-nilly.  Many go for the lowest bid and keep things simple.  They will say their job is to get savings for the Exchequer, but they are not doing that.  They are doing the polar opposite.  If the Committee of Public Accounts was so minded, it could do an exercise on some of the contracts that were awarded over the past year or 18 months.  It will find there were no savings.  Ms Fleming will discuss predatory pricing.</p></speech>

We had a long meeting with Mr. Paul Quinn from the Office of Government Procurement and asked him about his predatory pricing policy because when we spoke to the office in the past we were told that the only thing which triggers an investigation of predatory pricing is a price difference between competitors of 10% to 25%.  We explained that was a difficulty because if more than one company is engaged in predatory pricing, that safeguard goes out the window.</p> <p>  When we asked about the stationery contract, the office explained it had investigated predatory pricing at the framework stage.  However, the problem is that the contract is not awarded at the framework stage, but rather at the mini-competition stage.  At that stage, during which anybody participating in it can only go below the initial quoted price, there was no investigation of predatory pricing.</p> <p>  Some of the largest companies in Europe are involved.  I spoke about Office Depot.  It has since merged with Staples and is now a company with a turnover of &euro;34 billion.  One has to remember that Office Depot supplies small companies throughout Ireland.  Through the Office of Government Procurement it has been given the opportunity to take all of its suppliers away and go directly to the Government, cutting out an entire layer of small businesses.</p></speech>

I cannot say for sure whether there was predatory pricing, but there are insufficient safeguards in place.  The more one goes with large contracts, the more incentive there will be for larger companies to use their deep pockets and resources to oust competition in the marketplace.</p></speech>

We recently met other groups - the Minister, Deputy Noonan, was there - that have lost business because their industries have come under contract.  Ours is not under contract yet.</p></speech>

In the absence of a change of policy and approach, if we do not go for a regionalised, unbundled, disaggregated model that does not set price as the be-all and end-all but factors in things like quality, service and so on, is Ms Fleming saying that we are facing inevitable large-scale job losses?</p></speech>

To put this very simply, Ireland has a supply structure which is based on microbusinesses.  The Government has put in place a public purchasing structure with a &euro;9 billion spend which is only accessible to large companies.  There is an imbalance.  There is a supply chain of microbusinesses and a purchasing system which means only large businesses can win.  There has been an attempt to force the current supply model to fit the current purchasing model.  It has not worked.  We have to start again.</p></speech>

The critical element is data.  The absence of data is problematic for all of us.  In particular, it is noticeable that this was one of the major tasks placed upon the Office of Government Procurement when it was established.  We do not know what type of contracts are involved, how much they are worth, who is getting them and so forth.  Until we have all of that information, it is impossible for any of us to give the committee the answers.  In terms of good governance and the public accounts, it is essential that we get those data.</p> <p>  We would go further in terms of the economic assessment of the price piece in saying that we have to work out the consequences.  One of the consequences of eliminating the supply chain is that 1,600 more people will be on the live register at a cost of &euro;20,000 per person.  In terms of the overall economic impact of the decision to save X amount in a contract, the State costs itself money because, in the round, it will end up paying out more money.  This is not just about one office or Department.  There has to be a whole-of-Government approach to assessing the impact on jobs.</p></speech>

The first is the effect of current aggregate contracts.  Previously we were a one-stop-shop for schools.  A small country school could come to us and get everything it needed.  Now those schools must get their paper from one supplier, their cartridges from another supplier and their stationery from a third supplier.  If the janitorial contract goes ahead - which we all hope it will not - this will add a fourth supplier.  There is also the addition of arts and graphic supplies from ourselves.  The result could be that a small country school with a couple of hundred euro to spend must go to six different suppliers.</p></speech>

As more aggregate contracts come along, many principals feel compelled to go ahead with them and, for example, to buy stationery from Office Depot.  There is a core and a non-core problem in that many principals feel they are tied in to the likes of Office Depot for stationery and they feel they must buy all products from one supplier rather than just the core products.  There is a definite perception among principals and it has been an uphill struggle for us.</p></speech>

Their situation is similar to ours and they understand the importance of the spend.  They look at getting the best value for every single Welsh pound.  They look for the most economically advantageous tender referring to the full life cycle of the goods while looking at the economic and social benefits that the contract can have to the locality and the least possible environmental impact.  If we were to take that as a starting point, as the remit for the Office of Government Procurement, it would certainly go a long way towards alleviating much of these problems.  The most economically advantageous tender is extremely broad.  It can include an after-sales service and technical support.  Because schools suppliers give a professional service, 85% of us give good competent after-sales service and we provide information.  This could be taken into account.  Social value is very important because it can take job losses into account.  It can take into account potential job creation.  It can take into account taking people off the live register.  It can take into account community groups.  It can be sufficiently broad to incorporate all Government goals into procurement and give us a world-class procurement service.</p></speech>

We are a small business in the first aid and hygiene business.  We deal with many of the big multinational companies operating in this market place.  Those multinational companies have, perhaps, 20, 30 or 40 people who are also selling their goods, including the multinational companies who are also based here.  From a pricing point of view, the multinationals are in a very awkward position because they may want to charge me &euro;10 for something and charge somebody else &euro;12.  They are then trying to control the pricing in the marketplace.  They are saying to us that they will give us the price we put in for that tender and that they will give us a margin of X%.  That is how they are starting to do pricing which means a fixed price from everyone.  They are trying to get the SME to talk to the larger company, so that the SME name gets on the list.  It is a bit like me going to my larger competitor and saying, "Mr. Competitor, there is a tender out there at the moment.  Would you mind putting my name down on your list as one of the suppliers because we have common goods which we are supplying".  My competitor will not do that, rather he will be trying to buy me out.  That application is not practical.</p> <p>  The aggregation of contracts is happening.  We are specialists in first aid supplies and we have been in the business for about 30 years.  The industry is a specialised industry.  The safety clothing and first aid industries have been put together.  We had a tender last year where we gave some pricing to one of our competitors for the first aid items and we got some pricing for safety clothing.  We partly won the contract on the safety clothing but we are not experts in safety clothing.  We lost the overall contract because we were told we did not sufficient knowledge of the first aid market.  The person who got the contract is a safety company whom we are supplying with first aid and this is all going to the same customer.  The logic does not make sense.  Then they said we had left out one line in the tender - because we did not know what the item was - but we did not quote for it.  That was the reason we lost the contract.</p> <p>  There is currently a very large contract in our industry.  The tender document contains 122 pages of information.  One would need an MBA in a couple of subjects to actually understand the document.  There are 291 lines of product which are to be supplied and they require a price for every line of product.  For example, the multinational company will decide to tender for one of the lines, such as a pen.  That company will decide to tender a price of &euro;1 for the pen.  It will go to the world-wide market and say it has a contract from the Irish Government for 1 million pens and that it needs them for 10 cent each.  They will go to three or four suppliers in the world who will give them a similar pen.  They have the world-wide buying power whereas the SME market does not.  </p> <p>  We have a small business in the North.  We are successful in some of the public tendering business in the North of Ireland because they will award contracts of under &euro;30,000 to the micro-businesses.  That is a nice big order for an SME turning over &euro;100,000 or &euro;150,000 and an SME can cope with that order whereas an SME cannot cope with an order worth &euro;1 million because we do not have the resources.  </p> <p>  An SME going for any reasonably sized contracts here will take on extra people and buy extra vans when the contract may be for two years.  However, if the contract is lost after two years, the SME has a van fleet it does not need and workers have to be let go.  The loss of a contract involves a massive cost.  What they are doing is not practical.</p></speech>

I refer to the question of value for money, quality and business methods.</p><p>What might the Office of Government Procurement do to enhance the opportunity for SMEs to compete?  One must take into account economies of scale and so on.  We are increasingly seeing a centralisation of operations in the grocery sector.  There are no longer delivery vans going to different towns, because it is all about centralised distribution in the retail market.  The whole thing is gone in the direction of automated ordering, with no sales representatives on the road.  That is the shift we are seeing.  While it would be lovely to have more individual small suppliers, the marketplace has shifted dramatically around all of that.  How can we beat this change?</p></speech>

The social element is very important in that.  Notwithstanding Deputy Perry's point about centralised distribution, there are still many opportunities for small businesses in this country.  We have spoken before about examining what local authorities spend in their communities and encouraging them to target expenditure locally.  A target should be set for them in this regard, perhaps something like 75%.  If a school principal, say, has to go to six different suppliers to get six different products, that is pure madness and creates many difficulties.</p> <p>  We have come to the conclusion during our discussions that we are very close to a situation where the Office of Government Procurement is simply not fit for purpose.  We are getting to that stage.  The experience of Ms Gibson, Mr. Martin and people like them is that the office is not doing its job in the way it should be doing it.  It is supposed to be looking after our country by delivering good quality products for the public service.  In my view, it is not doing that.</p></speech>

We would not question what members know in terms of their job and expertise.  In the case of the Office of Government Procurement, it must educate its staff and give them a remit beyond simply price.  If it educated its staff on the ten steps, as has been done in Wales, it would be very hard for them to go outside that.  If that format were followed, it would be very difficult for the money to go outside the community.</p> <p>  On 17 February, the Government announced its decision to put &euro;250 million back into rural areas.  We told it two years ago that companies on the high street would close down.  There is a knock-on or domino effect in that if one business goes, every shop in the high street may go.  Only now is &euro;250 million being given to try to address this.  We could have saved the Government that money if the Office of Government Procurement had listened to us and it could have been spent elsewhere.  That is all we are asking.</p></speech>

Going back to the data aspect, there is plenty of anecdotal evidence that even after these large contracts are awarded, a lot of off-contract buying goes on, which ultimately ends up being more expensive than what was originally projected.  All of that buying must be monitored but, equally, we need to look at the other end of the equation.  Large contracts present particular problems, but we also have a lot of members telling us that some contracts are simply too small.  In our submission, for example, we note that some local enterprise offices, which should know all about micro-businesses, are tendering for a half-day training course.  One of our member companies, TenderScout, which works in this area professionally, has given us data showing that &euro;200 million is being spent by suppliers each year on tender proposals, only some 20% of which will be successful.  In essence, some &euro;150 million is being wasted in our economy by all of these businesses spending time and money on unsuccessful tenders.  I was talking to a business owner yesterday who is in the website business.  This person told me that for one large contract, applicants were given just ten days to respond even though the process was not simply producing a written document but involved a design component and showing what the website might look like.  There are problems at both ends, with large contracts and with small contracts, and too many companies are wasting a great deal of money trying to operate within the system.  It is important to note that in Ireland, approximately double the number of companies would be trying to get into the tendering process as would be the case abroad.  It is a waste of their time.</p></speech>

As we move towards specialised category councils, the idea in the new framework is that the Office of Government Procurement will come to the market and talk to us before producing the tenders in the first place.  It will be about training per contract or per category council, and getting in front of the people who are buying for the specialists in that industry.  It is only by doing this that everybody will up their game.  As I said at the launch of Circular 10/14, unless we make feedback mandatory, we are at nothing.  If a company has not been successful in a tender, there must be information given as to why it was not successful.  That is not happening at the moment because, we are told, it takes too much time, but all these small companies are expected to spend time writing tenders.  One will never learn and improve if one does not get feedback.</p></speech>

Twenty years ago these types of companies would essentially have provided contract cleaners and not much else; these days they provide stationery supplies, security staff and a range of other services.  They are becoming massive conglomerates in the UK.  I am aware of a tender over there worth &euro;20 million for just one facilities management company.  In my industry, we would be talking about a contract worth perhaps &euro;10 million a year.  I have never seen such an amount of documentation required for a tender.  We are dealing with much larger contracts in the UK, and this type of aggregation is going to exclude a lot of the marketplace.</p></speech>

Most of the points have already been covered.  The overriding problem here is the remit of the Office of Government Procurement.  Essentially, if it can come out in a year's time and say it saved X amount, then it can claim to have done its job and that will be the headline.  The difficulties with that approach have been clearly outlined by the witnesses today.  Departmental officials came before the committee last year to discuss these issues, at which time the Secretary General committed to reviewing matters with the Office of Government Procurement.  However, there has been only a figleaf acknowledgement of what we were trying to say.  Mr. Noonan hit the nail on the head when he asked whether the office is really fit for purpose.  The problem is that some of the people in the office will say they were told to do a job, namely, save money, and must do that come hell or high water.</p> <p>  Having had a quick look through the report by the Office of Government Procurement, I did not see the words "jobs" or "employment" mentioned once.  </p></speech>

That sounds good and like everything is going in the right direction but, as the delegates pointed out, we never find out the figures behind it.</p></speech>

The definition used is the EU definition, which includes any company with fewer than 250 employees.  In this country, however, there are only 500 companies employing more than 250 people.  By that definition, many of the multinationals operating here are categorised as SMEs.  We need to see what is happening with micro-enterprises, which make up 84% of all businesses, and small companies, which make up 97%.  That is the level at which we need to see the data.</p></speech>

That office can only implement the policies that are put in front of it.  When he was Minister of State with responsibility for small business, Deputy Perry would have heard us say time and again that the remit for the Office of Government Procurement is too narrow.  The word "savings" can justify anything.  If its remit were along the lines Ms Fleming outlined, it would be a completely different ball game for everybody.</p></speech>

I give a lot of credence to this committee as it was amazing how quickly the circular was reissued and republished after the hearing last year.  It was actually done within four weeks.  The circular in and of itself is good, but the implementation on the ground is not.  What is the point in having a circular if it is guidance not law and, therefore, not mandatory?  I took an approach last year whereby every time somebody brought to my attention a tender that was in breach of the circular, I would email Paul Quinn and say "Tender".  He would reply "I have no power to tell them that they are wrong or to stop and do something different".  He would e-mail them and say "By the way, this is in breach".  Sometimes, they would come back, put their hands up, apologise, rewrite and give people extra time.  Sometimes, they would not.  That is only those which were brought to my attention.  Certainly, it has improved in the last year in the sense that turnover threshold, insurance threshold and all those basic things were changed and that is all good.  However, there are many other things on which we need to make progress.</p></speech>

I had to be elsewhere.  A couple of years ago, I sent a circular letter to all the businesses in my constituency and one of the responses I got was from people the witnesses are trying to defend at the moment.  I made an intervention at the time and spoke to the then Minister of State responsible, who was Brian Hayes.  My timing was probably not good because at that stage the Government was under huge pressure to save money, come hell or high water.  I suspect that was part of the reason I did not make progress.</p></speech>

It recommends feedback but does not say it has to be given.  It tinkered around the edges.  Certainly, we welcome the turnover and insurance changes, which have been significant of themselves.

There was a very good lady in attendance from the Office of Government Procurement.</p><p>Deputy Perry and I soldiered together that day.  It was fractious, if he recalls.  It was small businesses in that region being put out of business, in their eyes, by the Office of Government Procurement, but, by the same token, it is Government policy on the savings.  It is the whole remit.  Deputy Connaughton has got the nub of it that the remit is too narrow.  There was &euro;63.5 million, if that is what they are claiming, in savings.  How many companies have been put out of business?  How many communities have been destroyed by their actions and by them interpreting their remit very narrowly?  That is important.</p><p> Ms Fleming has articulated very well what we believe would be a superb remit for everybody in which business, Government, the taxpayer - everybody - wins.

It is to take on all sourcing activity in scope from Departments and agencies valued above &euro;25,000 for spend falling in eight categories, one of which is marketing and stationery.

Given the volume of State spend and given that one has the latitude under the EU directives, which tie all of this together, to take account of the best overall economic value, it is an inexcusable fault at this stage.  It is not as if the system does not know about this.  They are well aware of it.</p> <p>  I wanted to get back to the issue of data and measurement and analysis.  It is claimed the quantum of savings is &euro;63.5 million.  As against that, I do not believe that takes into account any offsetting consequences.  I refer to the point Ms Callan made earlier in terms of job losses and their cost and burden on the Exchequer.</p></speech>

More interestingly, they have gathered some data.  There is a recent report of &euro;3.791 billion spent, with &euro;2.74 billion being tracked across 35,000 suppliers involving 3.8 million payment transactions from 64 public service bodies, for instance, in health.  All of that sounds impressive, but one has to drill into all of this to see what it means.  What we can know is that it is a partial analysis.  The entire spend has not been captured.</p> <p>  Is there scope or a role for the Comptroller and Auditor General to analyse this area or how we go about doing what these witnesses sensibly suggest?  I am certain that they speak for SMEs and microbusinesses everywhere.  I know that because I have heard it everywhere that I have gone.  They are credible in their position and their ask of us is reasonable.  We need to figure out how we do it.  Is there a role for the Comptroller and Auditor General to cast a fairly forensic eye across a piece of work such as this?</p></speech>

We have reported previously on the mechanisms used by the precursor of the OGP, which was based at that time in the Office of Public Works, on how it calculated savings.  We found that the savings estimates presented at that stage, in 2012, were not reliable.  It is a very tricky process to calculate savings.  What one can be calculating is reductions in expenditure and in some cases, they were being called savings.  The point that was made on the importance of taking the life cycle of an expenditure into account would be an aspect that would need to be examined.</p> <p>  We are always concerned that procurement guidelines are followed.  It is important that any system of guidelines would not have perverse effects because of the way it is structured.  One wants to achieve efficiency and economy, but not at the expense of detrimental effects elsewhere.</p> <p>  A point has been made in a couple of contributions about who is going to come up with the data.  There is an obligation on every public body to demonstrate that it is achieving value for money.  They should be doing that as a routine.  It should not require my office to do the work for them.  They should be reporting on where they have achieved savings and how they have achieved value.  If that was a routine presentation by Departments in their annual reports and so on, it would be amenable to my office examining it.</p> <p>  It is a vast scope of expenditure.  It is interesting that, in a relatively new circular, the feeling from the supply side was that it was not working or, at least, it was not working yet.  There is a concern that if it does not work soon, there will not be anything left to save.  It is probably a fairly urgent matter.</p> <p>  It is also interesting, from what I have heard this morning, the extent to which they do things differently in other jurisdictions and there may be lessons to learn there.  It is probably something the committee can reasonably take up with the OGP, that is, what it has done to look at what happens in other jurisdictions and its reaction to what happens elsewhere that may be helpful.  That is a line of questioning.</p> <p>  I have no difficulty with the suggestion that I would do a piece of work but the urgency that has been expressed this morning and the time it will take to commence a piece of work and to report to the committee may not fit.</p></speech>

I am conscious of that as well but, following today's hearing, I am doubly convinced that one issue is the model upon which the OGP bases its work, that is, price only, versus the most economically advantageous, but another that is important is how the OGP analyses its own target and performance.  If we do not get a piece of work done fairly urgently, this new office, which will not always be new, will take root and establish a rhythm of working, an outlook and a set of precedents to which, unfortunately, it will wed itself and be loyal, and it will be like trying to turn, dare I say it, <i>RMS Titanic</i>if we leave it too late.  I do not know whether we can do it here but we need to figure out what we are doing and what is the tightest timeframe.</p></speech>

After that, the members of the committee can engage with the Comptroller and Auditor General in a discussion in order that we do not simply leave today's contributions from both sides in this room.  Arising from these discussions, I intend to ensure action is taken to assist the sector we heard from this morning.  We will revisit the overall issue after we deal with the Department and the Office of Government Procurement.  That is our intention.</p></speech>

Overall expenditure on the vote for 2013 was down approximately 10% compared to the 2012 outturn.  A significant factor in the reduced level of spending was the transfer of functions from the Department to the human resources shared services centre, with effect from 1 January 2013.  For 2013, those functions are accounted for under Vote 18.</p><p> The committee may wish to note the inclusion in note 7 of an account of the non-statutory contingency fund, which is under the control of the Accounting Officer.  The fund, which totals &euro;1.2 million, is available for use when it would be impractical to seek immediate approval from D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to meet urgent or unforeseen expenditure not covered by ordinary votes.  Previously, this was published as a separate account.  The amount held in the fund is reviewed every five years.</p><p> Vote 12 presents the expenditure in respect of to civil service and prison officer pensions.  Pension payments for other public servants are charged to other votes, including those for education, the HSE, Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Army pensions.  The total spend on the Vote in 2013 amounted to &euro;428 million.  This compares to expenditure of approximately &euro;520 million in 2012.  Appropriations-in-aid in 2013 amounted to &euro;89 million, with little change year on year.  These mainly comprise employee pension contributions.  The Department of Finance administers the pension payments charged to Vote 12 but the associated administration costs are borne on Vote 7 - Office of the Minister for Finance.  Costs of policy formulation in relation to civil and public servants are borne on Vote 11 - Office of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  As a result, no administration costs are reflected in the appropriation account for Vote 12.</p><p> Vote 18 for shared services is a new voted service that was established on 1 January 2013.  The human resources shared services centre, now referred to as PeoplePoint, has taken on certain human resources management functions transferred from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with effect from that date.  The 2013 appropriation account for the Vote for shared services records gross expenditure of &euro;15.7 million.  This comprises &euro;11.8 million spent on activities related to PeoplePoint, and &euro;3.8 million spent on other shared services projects.  Most of this was spent on payroll shared services.  Expenditure in the year on "other" services was significantly less than provided for in the Estimate, mainly because delays in progressing the financial management and banking shared services centre resulted in an underspend of &euro;3.4 million.  Overall, there was a net underspend of &euro;5.6 million relative to the Estimate, and that amount was accordingly liable for surrender back to the Exchequer.</p><p> Along with the internal and external audit functions, an effective audit committee is one of the pillars of good corporate governance.  A key contribution of audit committees is to provide management and governing boards with independent and objective assurance on a range of matters including internal controls, risk management, whistle-blowing procedures and financial reporting.  The role of audit committees in the public service is essentially one of oversight, since management is ultimately responsible for matters such as internal controls and financial statements.  As the external auditor of most non-commercial State bodies, staff of my office engage with the relevant audit committees as required, bringing matters of concern to their attention, and following up with them to see that appropriate action is taken.</p><p> The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is responsible for the development and dissemination of guidance for State bodies in the area of corporate governance.  The current corporate governance requirements, including those for audit committees, are set out in the Department&rsquo;s Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies, which was last updated in 2009.  In a number of sectors, including third level education, customised codes of governance have been developed, but the broad structure of requirements is the same.  Apart from the codes of practice, there are numerous sources to which public bodies and their audit committees can refer for good practice principles and guidance.  As part of the examination, we compared the Department&rsquo;s 2009 code with those good practice sources.  We found the code contained only basic requirements relating to the structure and operation of audit committees and recommended that it be updated.  I understand that review process is under way.</p><p> Our examination of the operation of audit committees in a sample of six non-commercial State bodies found that, with one minor exception, there was full compliance with the code of practice requirements relating to audit committees.  It is encouraging to note that the bodies we examined had progressed beyond the code requirements and had incorporated many features of good practice in respect of how their audit committees operate.  However, the report also identified a number of areas where good practice is generally not being followed.  Those areas related to the selection and appointment of new audit committee members, recording of conflicts of interest, performance appraisal for committee members and measuring the effectiveness of the committee as a whole.</p><p> The report concludes that the requirements for audit committees in State bodies should be updated to reflect current good practice.  It recommends that, in developing updated guidance, the Department should pay particular attention to the areas noted where good practice is not currently being followed, as they offer the greatest potential for improving the effectiveness of audit committees.  The report also recommends that the Department should develop and issue a self-assessment checklist for use by audit committees in State bodies to determine their own level of compliance with good practice principles.  We have included our good practice checklist in the report as an aid for State bodies to use in the interim.</p><p> Following on from this special report, my Office will be conducting a half-day briefing session for chairs and members of audit committees in May this year on the theme of Increasing the effectiveness of public sector audit committees.  The briefing session will be facilitated by the Institute of Public Administration and I am happy to note that it will include presentations by staff of the Department as well as from my own office.  An invitation is being issued to all non-commercial State bodies within my remit to send representatives to that seminar</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-05a.270" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Watt" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015030500002#P00200"><p>Before addressing the items on the agenda, I would like to set out some of the main areas of our work programme during 2014.  More details of what we have doing are set out in our annual progress report, which is available on our website.</p> <p>  One of the key roles of the Department is the management of public expenditure.  In 2014, gross voted expenditure amounted to &euro;54 billion, a reduction of over &euro;9 billion from the peak that was reached in 2009.  Current spending was reduced by 9.4% and capital spending was reduced by 52.7%.  This reduction was done at a time of increased demands on public services due to both demographic changes as well as pressures related to the economic downturn.  During this period, reductions have sought to prioritise key services.  For example, social protection spending has been reduced by 3.4%; health by 8%; and education by 3.5%.  These account for 85% of gross voted current expenditure.  Meanwhile, expenditure across all other areas has been reduced by 25.4%.</p> <p>  Since the establishment of the Department in 2011, public spending has been managed close to profile each year.  The net outturn was 1.3% below profile in 2011 while, in 2012, it was 1% above profile and it was again below profile in 2013 by 0.9%.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report notes that net expenditure was above profile in four Votes and was below profile in 36 Votes for 2013.  This management of public spending contributed to a closing of the fiscal deficit and our successful exit from the troika programme.  The benefits of this can be seen, especially in respect of ten year government bonds, which now yield below 1% having peaked at well over 10%.</p> <p>  In 2014, net expenditure was 2.4% over profile.  This increased should be seen in the context of the consolidation of previous years.  While maintaining the focus on efficiency and value for money, the improvement in Ireland&rsquo;s fiscal outlook meant that the Government was able to increase investment in a number of important infrastructure and capital areas.  An additional &euro;162 million was invested in important public transport related capital projects and moneys were allocated to meet the cost of repairing the damage caused by the severe storms in 2014.  Additional funding was also provided last year to relieve some of the pressure on essential public services.</p><p>For example, the Supplementary Estimate requirement of &euro;680 million was provided for additional spending on our health services.  An additional &euro;177 million was required in the agriculture sector, related to the delayed receipt of an EU payment relating to the European Agriculture Fund for Rural Development.  This payment will be received this year, 2015.</p><p> In the Department we are focused on the need to reform our approach to budgeting and execution of budget.  The committee will be aware of the series of reforms to the budgetary and expenditure processes in recent years.  These reforms were aimed at improving decision making and value for money, as well as increasing fiscal transparency.</p><p> I will just mention some of the initiatives.  Initiatives relate to public spending code and value for money policy reviews which are now well established.  The introduction of performance budgeting links expenditure more explicitly to departmental strategy and outputs, and involves greater levels of public information and Oireachtas scrutiny over spending.  The establishment of the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service also continues to enhance the capacity of Departments to conduct value-for-money reviews and assess policy impacts of policy.</p><p> The committee will be aware of the second comprehensive review of spending, which was undertaken last year by our Department and published in October.  This process allows for the prioritisation of public money into areas where it is most needed and seeks to develop a more strategic approach to the allocation of public funds.</p><p> In the area of fiscal transparency and accountability, a number of other important reforms have been introduced.  The most obvious of these is the earlier publication of the budgetary documentation.  The annual budget is published now in October and the Revised Estimates are now in December.  This ensures the Oireachtas has time to debate and approve the budget in advance of the new financial year and to examine the Estimates much earlier than was previously the case.  There have also been important improvements in how Ireland reports fiscal data, in particular extending the focus beyond the Exchequer to include all subsectors of the general Government.</p><p> Sustainable and far-reaching reform of the public service was identified as a priority for the Department on its establishment in 2011.  The Government published its first public service reform plan in 2011 and its second reform plan in January last year, covering the period 2014 to 2016.</p><p> Yesterday, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, published a progress report on reform in the public service.  This report sets out the main areas of progress made so far, as well as reflecting on some of the reform priorities and objectives for 2015.  Copies of this report have been sent, I understand, to all Members of the Oireachtas.  The public service is now smaller and a good deal less expensive that in was in 2009, and its work in continuing to deliver essential services as budgets and staff numbers were reduced deserves to be acknowledged.</p><p> I will briefly touch on some of the changes, but I will not go through all of them.  The pay bill is now down by over 20% and as part of that staffing levels have been reduced by 10% over the period, from 320,400 in 2008 to 289,600.  We have implemented a variety of initiatives in looking at new service delivery approaches, including JobPath, a new call centre for assisting in the collection of the property tax and initiatives to improve how we manage State property.  Leadership has been enhanced across the services through the implementation of the senior public service leadership development strategy.  We have also reduced the number of public bodies by 181 - the so-called "quango cull".  That programme has now been successfully completed.</p><p> We believe that the need to improve productivity and efficiency in the administration and delivery of services will continue to be an important objective for the public service in the coming years, even as the public finances improve.  This is particularly the case given the demographic challenges that we face.  Our population has increased by 500,000 since 2005.  We have the highest percentage of people aged under 15.  Life expectancy has risen and almost 13% of our population are now aged over 65 years old.  These trends will continue to place increased pressure on public services for the foreseeable future.  In view of this the public service must become more innovative and efficient in its administration and in how it designs and delivers services.  In this context, we are looking at alternative models of service delivery and more strategic use of technology to meet both current and future challenges.  </p><p> I would like to highlight, if I may, some of these initiatives in more detail.  At the beginning of this year, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer published a new ICT strategy for the public service.  This has five key objectives: build to share, creating ICT shared services to support integration and efficiency across the public service; digital first, the digitisation of key transactional services to improve service delivery; improve governance, to ensure that the ICT strategy is aligned across public bodies; and increase capability, to ensure the necessary skills and resources are available to meet current and future ICT needs.  A big challenge that we have within the system is our ability to attract people with certain skills which are in very high demand now across the economy, particularly skills in relation to ICT and digitalisation.  Data as an enabler, the final element of the strategy, is to facilitate increased data sharing and innovative use of data across all public bodies.</p><p> With regard to the issue of open data and the possibilities for us, the strategy reflects the need for public bodies to change and fully exploit the potential of an increasingly digital world.  The continuing increase in the use of ICT by public bodies has resulted in the production of huge volumes of data.  This volume is valuable and the technology is now being used to transform the way services are planned, delivered and managed.  As public bodies have progressed in areas like e-Government and data analytics, the potential of data to help deliver economic, social and other benefits has become clearer.  We must do this, of course, while respecting fully data protection rights.</p><p> The Department is leading the implementation of the open data initiative in collaboration with other public bodies.  The public bodies working group is working on a technical framework for open data, to underpin the ongoing development of the open data portal and through consultation with stakeholders we wish to see how other ideas and expertise can contribute to this overall process.  As part of it, last month the Minister, Deputy Howlin, launched a public consultation on open data licences, and I hope that citizens, businesses and other public servants will engage in this process.</p><p> A public consultation process was also undertaken to inform the drafting of a new data sharing and governance Bill, which we are developing.  The objective of this Bill is to provide a legal basis for information sharing across public service bodies, with associated transparency and governance obligations.  We are also, within our Department, driving the development of shared services to improve information management and integration, as well as delivering administrative functions more efficiently.  The national shared services office is leading on the strategic direction of shared services policies and the implementation of shared services projects in the Civil Service.  I will mention some very briefly.  PeoplePoint, the HR and pensions administration shared service, has been in operation since March 2013 and already provides services for more than 26,000 employees across 21 organisations.  We have also put in place a single payroll shared service centre for the Civil Service, which now services 22 clients and currently issues over 70,000 payments per month to over 21,000 employees.</p><p> Work is progressing on the financial management shared services project.  We hope to issue a tender document in relation to this shortly.  This will have significant implications for Government accounting, how accounts are presented and the quality of financial information we are able to produce.  We might get a future opportunity to present separately to the committee on this project and what it means, if members felt that would be useful.  The potential benefits of this shared service will include greater capability to respond to IMF and EU requirements; more time for organisations to focus on strategic financial issues; improved financial information to support better decision making around budgets and expenditure; and reduced costs, improved performance and increased financial control.</p><p> Turning to Government procurement, the programme to achieve greater efficiency in public procurement is being implemented by the Office of Government Procurement.  Mr. Paul Quinn, who heads up the office, is with us today.  This office is taking responsibility for the procurement of common goods and services across the public sector.  The OGP also provides the national procurement policy function, customer support services and systems for all the sourcing organisations.  While budget responsibility remains with the public service bodies, the contractual arrangements put in place help these bodies to remain compliant and to deliver value for money.  The procurement functions have forecast a savings delivery of &euro;63.5 million for 2014.</p><p> On Tuesday of this week, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, and the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, published the OGP&rsquo;s report on public spend and tendering analysis.  I have copies we can circulate to members.  I understand it was published early on so members may have had a chance to see it.  This is a major step forward.  Prior to the establishment of the OGP we had no mechanism for collecting, analysing and reporting on spend data across the public service.</p><p> Some of the results from the work are interesting.  The report indicated that 93% of Government expenditure is with firms within the State and that 66% of expenditure is with the SME sector.  One of the objectives of this programme is to promote competition in markets and to fully support and encourage smaller suppliers in competing for Government business.  In doing so, the OGP works with Government agencies and industry representative bodies in developing and implementing initiatives, and in driving supplier education and awareness for small and medium enterprises.</p><p> The Civil Service renewal plan was published in October 2014.  This sets out a vision for the service and a three year action plan.  It outlines 25 practical actions that will create a more unified, professional, responsive, open and accountable Civil Service.  The plan responds to many of the criticisms that have been highlighted in many reports and in many discussions with the committee in the past.  Since the publication of the plan, significant progress has been made.  The Government has approved the terms of reference for the establishment of an accountability board for the first time, to strengthen accountability and performance across the service.  A Civil Service management board has been established to provide collective leadership and management to the service for the first time.  The board comprises all Secretaries General and heads of major offices and we are responsible for driving the implementation of the plan.  Priority actions for completion by mid-2015 include the first performance review process for Secretaries General; identifying options to strengthen the disciplinary code and to address under-performance; extending open recruitment in key areas to fill skills gaps; and carrying out the first Civil Service wide employee engagement.  Two weeks ago, we advertised, for the first time, a principal officer competition for middle managers across the service.  We have opened up recruitment at that level and we are looking for candidates both within the service and externally.</p><p> As part of the Civil Service renewal programme, our Department is also implementing HR reform across the Civil Service to better support managers and to enhance performance.  One of our major reforms in this area was the reduction in paid sick leave, introduced last year.  The new scheme effectively halves the access to paid sick leave for public servants while still providing support for them when they are ill.  I expect a downward trend in absenteeism following the introduction of the scheme last year. However, there remains a significant leadership and management challenge in tackling absenteeism across the public service.  Today, we publish the public service sick leave statistics for 2013.  The headline figures show that an average of 9.5 working days were taken per full-time employee.  In effect, 4.3% of working days were lost to sick leave in the public service in 2013.  While these figures do not reflect the impact of last year&rsquo;s sick leave reforms, it is clear that this level of absenteeism is not acceptable.</p><p> We also have been implementing a programme of political and legislative reforms to increase accountability, and to improve the quality of decision making and transparency in public administration.  I will not go through all the reforms as members will be aware of them but they include the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013, Freedom of Information Act 2014, Protected Disclosures Act 2014 and Regulation of Lobbying Bill 2014.  We are developing new legislation in respect of public sector standards Bill and the Department has initiated a new approach to appointments to State boards through which all appointments must be advertised openly on the State boards portal.  The statute law revision (secondary instruments) Bill will be also published shortly.  I have set out  in an annex to my statement the legislation we have delivered since 2011.  We have been responsible for preparing 23 Bills, which have been enacted.</p><p> I would like to turn to specific items on the agenda today.  The first item is the 2013 appropriation accounts for the Department.  The Estimate for 2013 was set at &euro;36.4 million, a reduction on 2012 levels, reflecting the fact that a new Vote was established to separately identify costs associated with the transactional shared services projects.  The surplus to be surrendered in 2013 was approximately &euro;3.6 million, which arose mainly as follows: savings on administrative budget pay of almost &euro;1 million arising from resignations, vacancies arising from outward secondments and slower than anticipated recruitment of replacements; lower than anticipated funding demands on PEACE and INTERREG projects; savings on the reform agenda fund due to reduced external support costs and the completion of work in-house where possible; and the timing of recoupments from the EU in relation to appropriations-in-aid.</p><p> The second item relates to Vote 12 &ndash; superannuation and retired allowances.  The 2013 appropriation accounts for this Vote show a net outturn of &euro;338.5 million compared to an estimate of &euro;384.6 million, giving a surplus of &euro;46.1 million for surrender to the Exchequer.  The 2013 gross estimate was based on existing pensions in payment on 31 December 2012; provision for cessation of pensions in 2013; an estimate of retirements and deaths in 2013; and an estimate in respect of lump sum payments to established civil servants.  It transpired that the number of retirements in 2013 was significantly less than anticipated, primarily because of the extension of the "grace period" and this led to lower retirements and, as a consequence, lower spending on the Vote than had been anticipated.</p><p> The 2013 Estimate for the shared services Vote was set at just over &euro;21 million.  The outturn for 2013 was &euro;15.4 million leaving a surplus to be surrendered of &euro;5.6 million. This surplus arose due to a delay in the transition of staff from originating Departments to programmes and the later than anticipated take-on of staff in PeoplePoint.</p><p> The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General reviewed the operation of audit committees in a sample of six non-commercial State bodies and assessed their compliance with the requirements of the code of practice.  With one minor exception, the review found full compliance among the bodies with the code of practice requirements for audit committees.  The recommendations of the report are also being addressed by the Department in the context of the updated Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies, which will be circulated to Departments for consultation in the coming weeks.  We will seek observations from both the parent Departments and the State bodies under their aegis.</p><p> The Department is almost four years in existence.  Over this period, we have played a substantial role in addressing the economic and fiscal crisis that faced the State.  We have also taken a lead role in driving the reform agenda, delivering much needed reform and renewal of our State institutions and our public services.  Effective management of public spending goes hand in hand with the reform agenda.  Reform supports the sustainability of public expenditure by delivering services in a more efficient, cost effective manner.  In turn, a strong and stable public expenditure framework allows us to take a more strategic and planned approach to optimise outcomes for taxpayers and public service users.</p><p> I would like to acknowledge the hard work and contribution of the staff of the Department.  The visible progress made would not have been possible without their commitment.</p></speech>

We debated in committee the Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2015-2017.  It struck me in parts as a work of fiction.  For instance, the forecast for health spending is entirely unrealistic.</p><p>The Minister has announced an open forum - a consultative process one presumes - to explore in an inclusive and all-hearing manner issues relating to taxation reform, spending and so on.  How does that sit side-by-side with the expenditure plans that have been already hammered out?</p></speech>

As part of setting out three-year envelopes we decided it was appropriate to have a spending review, which stands back periodically and looks at the challenges facing the State, to look at progress, and to look at what is happening to key indicators like unemployment, the number of social welfare recipients, demands in the health system, the demographics in education and so on.  So it is to stand back and set out, and to have a process then of engaging across the system both at a technical level and obviously at a political level in terms of what the demands are and what the allocations would be over a period ahead.  The whole purpose of the review is for us to stand back from the annual hurly burly of Estimates, budgets and all that, and have much more of a strategic approach.</p></speech>

I think that is something we have debated here previously.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has set out in the reports that for some time now we have had very difficult issues in terms of budget execution and keeping close to profile for health.  So clearly within the spending review allocations for health there is a much greater challenge to keep the outturns close to the profile and I think the Minister has been upfront about that.</p> <p>  It is interesting to look at the review we did in 2011.  If the Deputy looks at the allocations for Departments for 2012, 2013 and 2014 compared with the outturns, most Departments actually stayed fairly close over the three-year period.  In the last year of the period, which was 2014, there was slightly more slippage, but generally the majority of Departments were able to plan with much more certainty both in terms of the cash-----</p></speech>

We all know the challenges in health.  Based on the experience for the view in 2011 for most Departments, I think we have written to the committee on questions from Deputy Fleming previously.  We have set out that.  In fact for most Departments and most Votes we came fairly close over the three-year period to the allocation in 2011.  Of course, as the fiscal situation evolves and changes, it is up to the Government of the day to propose changes to Vote allocations and for the Oireachtas to vote on those.  There is nothing in this that cuts across Deputies' prerogative to vote for additional spending in areas if that is what they so wish.</p></speech>

We have had testimony today from the Small Firms Association and the Irish Schools Art Supply Federation in respect of the operation of the Office of Government Procurement and the procurement regime in play at the moment.  I know that Mr. Watt and Mr. Quinn are familiar with some of the dilemmas that face small and medium-sized enterprises with a particular emphasis on small and micro businesses.  This is not the first time we have heard this story that is very critical and quite alarming in respect of how we are going about our business at the moment.  I wish to put to Mr. Watt and Mr. Quinn a number of the issues and at the end we might come to some kind of discussion on how we resolve them, because they must be resolved.</p> <p>  I know - other members have had the same experience - that the stories today's witnesses tell tally exactly with the story I am hearing from small and micro businesses from every county.  It certainly rang true.</p> <p>  Aggregate contracts essentially lock out small players.  The notion of smaller players coming together to develop consortia is the stuff of fairy-tales.  We are advised by those on the front line that it is not practical.  It is a theoretical construct rather than being deliverable in real time and in real space.  The failure to unbundle down to an appropriate level and to regionalise tenders is devastating.  We were told earlier this morning that if this part of the puzzle does not change it will result in very significant job losses.  That is what we have heard.</p> <p>  On the manner of deciding on the successful tender there is a focus on price only rather than looking at the most economically advantageous bid that would capture issues such as regional balance, social objectives, environmental objectives, taking people off the live register, creating new work, all of those sorts of things.  The Welsh model has been cited as a successful operating model in that regard.</p> <p>  There is the issue of the Department's gathering and analysis of data.  In his opening remarks Mr. Watt conceded the point when he talked about the efforts that had been made and said that this was actually a great step forward because previously there were no data or analysis.  I draw his attention to the outworking of that statement.  No analysis and no data up to a couple of years ago mean that we established this new office, Mr. Quinn came into the position and a regime was put in place in the absence of overall data and analysis.  That is just a statement of fact unfortunately.  I recognise that Mr. Watt seems to have taken steps to remedy that position and I know it is a huge job of work.</p> <p>  It is a very problematic, however, for those of us who are legislators and policy makers, and more problematical again for people on the front line that we still have what seems largely to be a vacuum.  Even the data that have been pulled together are partial.  It is not the full picture of the &euro;9 billion spend.  I am not sure what one can glean from the data.</p><p>I have not read the document from cover to cover, so I am not familiar with the methodology the witnesses have employed.  I would like them to address those issues in the spirit of understanding that we do not have to go through the whole palaver around the need for efficiencies to save money for the Exchequer, which I acknowledge we need to do.  The issue here is the means of assessing what matters, what is valued, the quality and the social objectives, all of which are allowed within the EU framework, as the witnesses know.  We are told that the manner of assessment is heavily weighted in respect of price, to the degree of 35% of more, which is counterproductive.  Crucially, the issue of aggregating the contracts locks people out.  It was said earlier, and Deputy Conaghan may have said it most clearly, that we have here, as it seems to some of us at least, is a problem in the remit and orientation of the office in respect of what it has set out to do.  It has a crude approach in regard to moneys saved and expenditure avoided, and it misses the real bang for the buck, and the &euro;9 billion of them that could be achieved.</p></speech>

When we set out on this programme of reform, we never suggested that we had all the answers or that we had a monopoly on wisdom.  When one starts off on a programme like this one, there are unintended consequences and we are very happy to learn from what has gone on.  We did not have the advantage of listening to the contributions of two groups the committee had in this morning but I had the advantage of reading their submissions last night and, to an extent, myself and Mr. Paul Quinn can reflect on some of those.</p> <p>  We are very much conscious all the time of the need for us to balance the need to save money and the need to support a very important sector in the economy, the small and medium enterprise, SME, sector, which employes many people.  The president of the Small Firms Association, SFA, set that out this morning in terms of the contribution that the sector makes to the economy, the number of people employed in it and so on.  Our mandate is not around purely accrued value for money.  If it comes across like that, myself and Mr. Paul Quinn will have to reflect on that, but that is not our agenda.  Our mandate, which we were given by the Government, is to drive reform, professionalise this function, save money, provide supports to the SME sector in accessing contracts and to do everything we can to ensure there is a level playing field in terms of the assessing of contracts.  For example, we have tried to reduce the administrative burden tenderers face.  I was on the other side of the table for eight years in my career responding to public tenders and I am very much of the demands, as is Mr. Paul Quinn, and we have put in place steps to reduce to try to reduce the burden.  There are some crazy onerous requirements on companies to have turnover that is multiples of the value of the contracts, various indemnity insurance requirements and so on.  We have set guidance on this now.  I accept that issuing guidance and ensuring its implementation takes time.  Some public bodies may take longer than we would like for them to fully understand the impact of some of the measures we are proposing.</p> <p>  The office does not purely focus on achieving value for money, rather it is about procuring in a sensible and professional way, which drives economies and efficiencies and provides access to as many players as possible.  However, we accept there are occasions when that does not happen in practice and we are happy to learn and happy and to figure out better ways of proceeding.</p></speech>

Rather than the Secretary General coming into a committee meeting and responding  to questions, does that mean that he is willing to have a deeper engagement on these issues?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-05a.310" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Watt" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015030500002#T00600"><p>We are happy to have as much engagement as is appropriate on these issues.  Mr. Paul Quinn can talk about some of engagements that have already taken place.</p> <p>  Regarding a few issues the Deputy mentioned, in terms of aggregation, as a State we have an onus to get value for money for taxpayers.  There are occasions when we need to aggregate, or we need framework contracts and so on.  Within that we are aware of two things.  First, we accept the comments about the difficulty of developing consortia and we are examining that and are happy to consider if there is a better way in which we can facilitate the development of consortia to enable smaller firms to come together to compete.  I accept there is an issue there.  The is a question about lots, and Mr. Paul Quinn will answer this in more detail.  We encourage the separation of contracts into lots.  We can talk about what we have done in one of the cases.  Part of the policy response to these concerns is that we have much more engagement with entities procuring to ensure that we are dividing up in a way that makes sense and that enables SMEs to access contracts.</p> <p>  The second point around this is that when we decide on contracts it is not purely on the basis of price or cost, rather it is on the most economically advantageous tender.  In some cases the weightings might be too much in one direction and we do not take account of other factors, and Mr. Paul Quinn can talk about that.  Overall, it is not based purely on price, it is based on quality and service as well.</p> <p>  Third, in terms of data gathering, we have undertaken an exercise, and it involved a very detailed report, and I know the members have not had a chance to read through it.  It is important that the policy here is guided by evidence.  I am not saying that what the members heard from the SFA this morning is wrong because I need to note what has been said.  However, we need to reflect upon the evidence, given the new information we have, and then reach a sensible view.  We have undertaken a review of the practices of 64 public bodies, involving 35,600 suppliers with a spend of &euro;3.5 billion.  This is not a small but an enormous sample which, we believe, is representative of the procurement spend right across the system, and I would imagine the standard of error in this sample is quite low.  That would be my assessment.  This is quite comprehensive.  The results of this are very different from the numbers the SFA provided this morning.  I am not saying that we are right and it is wrong but we need to reflect and have a shared understanding.  Our data show that 93% of the spending we sample goes to firms within the State while the SFA's figures suggest it is 72%.  There is an enormous different between the two.  We need to understand the data and the evidence and that can better inform our policy.</p> <p>  Before Mr. Paul Quinn responds, I advise the committee that we are very happy to consider any form of engagement that we think is appropriate with the committee, the SFA or other groups to see if we can move this forward.  We are very open to considering how we can improve the way we function to achieve the objectives that, I believe, everybody shares.  I will ask Mr. Paul Quinn to respond now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-05a.311" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Quinn" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015030500002#T00700"><p>I thank the Deputy for her questions.  To add to what the Secretary General said, the committee will be aware that after our meeting last year in April 2014, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, and the then Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, issued a new guidance circular to the public sector around covering quite a degree of policy guidance for people on the issues we are discussing.  In particular, it requests people to do their market analysis, to understand the impact of their actions on those individual markets in order to make sure that whatever we take we sustain competition in the various markets.  Not all markets are equal.  Markets in the cleaning sector are very much locally delivered while, on the other end of the scale, markets in the energy sector are nationally delivered.  The actions and the strategies procurers have to take are fundamentally different.  Breaking contracts down into lots is very much a core element of that.  We have also reminded public procurers that value for money is not simply around price, it must balance the quality, overall life-cycle costs and the terms and conditions.  Providers who are prepared to stand behind their offerings and underwrite risk for the State is also a key part of determining value for money.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to the report.  As she recognised, a great deal of work was involved in bringing that report to the table.  It has taken 16 months of gathering data from various public sector bodies.  She was right in saying it is not a 100% sample.  I can be clear in saying it will never be a 100% sample because some of the State bodies from which we have to collect data are literally one-room schools dotted around the country from which we will never be able to get that information.</p><p>We may be able to sample.  Our intention is to reach a sample size of 80% to 85% of overall public expenditure.  In the report we have been able to produce in the past week is 63% of the estimated public expenditure of &euro;6 billion on goods and services for 2013.  It is a very large sample, and we believe it is representative because it looks not only at large organisations such as hospitals but also covers smaller organisations in education and local government.  It also covers organisations which are regionally based.</p><p> We spoke about regionalisation, and procurement can be broken down into lots.  Where appropriate, regional lots will be offered in the market.  It is down to the procurers to decide what is the appropriate strategy to deliver value for money for the taxpayer.  A prime example might be that every post office in the country would like if public bodies were to buy stamps there, but this would not be an efficient way for the State to buy its postal services.  We aggregate up the relationship we have with An Post, and the cost of delivering postal services for large Departments is done at national level and not by going to the local post office to buy a book of stamps which would be inefficient from a State perspective.  We must be very mindful of value for money.</p><p> Some of the push back we sense in certain sectors is driven simply by a lack of procurement in the first place.  It is not about aggregation in all cases.  The committee has come across in its deliberations quite a number of public bodies with an absence of procurement activities, let alone good procurement.  It is not surprising in one sense that as we look into certain markets long-standing relationships which have existed between suppliers and State agencies are being put to the test.  Ultimately this is at the need of the taxpayer, because simple direct relationships with suppliers without any competition do not deliver value for money for the taxpayer.</p></speech>

As the Department calculates what is in the best interests of the State and the taxpayer, which is entirely legitimate, there must be a calculation also of potential offsetting measures such as the loss of jobs, which is costly.  Having additional people on the live register is extreme costly.</p> <p>  This is an enormous amount of data, and I am not gainsaying this.  This is not a simple matter.  The Department is balancing using moneys smartly in every dimension and I understand this, but it is very troubling that there is such consistent criticism from the small and micro enterprises the Department purports to support, protect and facilitate.  They state it is not working, particularly the aggregation of contracts.  They tell us it is not that they do not know how to go about creating a consortium, it is just it is not a realistic ask or doable in business terms, not least because to bid in this manner one needs one entity to be the lead entity and take on all of the risk.</p></speech>

We do not require any one party to meet all of the requirements.  They can collectively meet all of the requirements with regard to how the consortium is put together.  We do not require them to take on any individual form.</p> <p>  I will speak about engagement because it is important to reflect upon it.  From an Oireachtas perspective, this is the third committee I have come before in the past three months to explain what is happening in procurement.  We are certainly listening to what Deputies tell us and we are very open, as the Secretary General stated, to learning, listening and adapting our approach and processes.  We also have in place a high level group on SME access, through which we meet the business development entities of the State such as Enterprise Ireland, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and InterTradeIreland.  We come up with programmes and solutions to assist SMEs compete.  It cannot simply be to the exclusion of other parties that we support SMEs.  We want to make SMEs fit to compete fairly and have a level playing pitch.  The Deputy is well aware of the work we do with IntertradeIreland and Enterprise Ireland on supporting training and awareness programmes-----</p></speech>

The numbers indicate 66% of our expenditure is with SMEs directly and EU statistics indicate - we do not have statistics for Ireland - that an additional 16% flows indirectly to SMEs through subcontracting and supply arrangements.  In total probably in excess of 80% of business finds its way to SMEs in the economy.  It is very difficult to separate out micro-enterprises and small businesses because we do not have the data in the infrastructure of the State or privately to assist us to separate out this information.  At this time we cannot reliably break expenditure information down to micro level because we do not have the data to tell whether many of the businesses are micro, large, medium or small.</p></speech>

It is entirely as it should be.  My concern is all of us know the vast majority of employers in the State are SMEs; for all of the hype sometimes about large multinationals and as valuable as they are, this is how we tick economically.  I believe Mr. Quinn that it is the Department's objective to support the model because it is what employs our people, and so far so good, but then we look at how the Department is going about things, particularly in terms of aggregating contracts.  I grant that Mr. Quinn made a fair point on energy supply.  We are told by the employers that aggregation locks them out of the game.  In a scenario where the majority of jobs are created by smaller entities the State procurement system is heavily biased in favour of bigger players because they do not face the same challenges as the SMEs and smaller businesses.  There is something incongruous in this.</p></speech>

We would definitely be very happy to sit down with the groups and any members who wish to participate.  There are differences with regard to the data.  We have a different data source and we may disagree with some of what the members have said.  When the members have a look at the data, they may or may not reconsider the position.  The data suggests that 93% of the spend is within businesses in Ireland, as Mr. Quinn has mentioned.  That is much more than we thought.  What is happening?  There are some sectors that are different.  The spend is much lower in utilities and medical, surgical and pharmaceutical supplies; small and medium enterprises do not dominate those sectors.  Much depends on the sector.  One can do a sectoral analysis and consider some of the more recent contracts that have given rise to concern.  If there is a concern, let us debate it and hear it.  If it relates to scale of contract and that lots have not have been broken up enough, we would be happy to engage in any way the committee wishes to have a discussion.  There are sectoral issues, so could we get to that level of detail and consider the issues?</p></speech>

My team and I met the Irish School Art Supplies Federation within weeks, although I do not have the date in front of me.  I am happy to meet them again.  We had quite a productive meeting.  With the Small Firms Association, through the small and medium enterprise, SME, working group there is ongoing discussion and engagement.  We would be very happy to meet them.</p></speech>

The other alarming statement came from Mr. Noonan; I am hope I am paraphrasing him correctly but he indicated the office was not fit for purpose.  That is what he said.  That concerns me.  The witnesses have been before other Oireachtas committees, which demonstrates that the Oireachtas is concerned about the sector.  It is extremely difficult for small companies to come together, as they are competitors, and be part of a consortium to make a bid.  They are a prisoner to such a system, as the price is forced downwards.</p> <p>  Another area of concern is the potential for job losses in the small and micro sector.  They are anchored in community and the business life of a particular town of village.  This cannot be just about money and we must consider social and economic consequences for rural Ireland, which is in deep difficulty now and could not sustain further job losses.  The Small Firms Association this morning suggested removing the price priority and the setting of targets for SME procurement, as may be witnessed in other jurisdictions.  Scotland, Wales and, to a degree, France look after small businesses in their economy and do not pay much attention to Europe when it suits.  The Small Firms Association also argued to change the provisions around subdividing a contract into lots as is currently set out in Circular 10/14, as it is easier for procurers to opt out than opt in.  I asked particularly about that circular and I was told it is, by and large, aspirational and does not really fit the Bill for the sector we are discussing this morning.  The argument was for the implementation of an appeals mechanism that would include mandatory feedback on lost tenders so parties can learn through mistakes and be open to changing the style of a process to suit the appropriate level of tendering and competition.  At the same time, it should protect the SME infrastructure as we know it in Ireland.</p> <p>  I find it difficult to comprehend the witnesses' argument, which does not at all reflect what was said to us this morning by the other group.  The meeting that has been suggested would be very important and a step forward.  I am only surprised it was not suggested earlier.</p></speech>

If somebody makes a statement with which I do not agree at a meeting, I can respond if I am there but I cannot respond if I am not present.  I would have asked about the evidence supporting the statement.  We would like to have that meeting so that if people say the office is not fit for purpose, I can explore what they mean.  If there is evidence, I will listen to it, but if there is no evidence, those people will need a different description of the office the next time they come before this committee.  I am happy to engage with those parties and we will do it this month.</p></speech>

Much has been said already so I will not go over all the issues again.  The idea of a meeting is a very welcome step forward but my fear is that if we read the transcript of the meeting from last April and compared it with today's comments, they would be similar.  A meeting was supposed to take place at that stage too and I have no doubt it happened.  Nevertheless, the process is moving at a slow pace.  I admit this is a relatively new departure for a very large sum of money, so there will be teething problems.  We saw evidence this morning of frustration because the process is taking so long, and by the time solutions are formulated, the relevant parties may not be there to feel the benefit.</p> <p>  This is a major area that cannot be covered today and we are trying to save money.  Has there been a conversation between the witnesses and the Minister about a potential problem with the remit, which may not be broad enough?  Has there been a question of whether we should go back to the starting blocks to look at the process again?</p></speech>

We understand what it is about.  Based on what we discover as we roll out this programme, Mr. Quinn and I are happy to meet the Minister, Deputy Howlin, and discuss how we are getting on and whether we need a revised or new mandate.  We have not had that conversation as we are delivering, and we report to the Minister based on implementation of what we have been asked to do.</p></speech>

In terms of the ones we were getting, we had some in the school arts, some on book sellers and one other to do with photocopiers and ICT.  In regard to other sectors or industries coming forward saying they have significant issues, they have not beaten a path to my door or written to me.  It is not coming through in any of the individual reflections from any of the industry representative bodies either.</p></speech>

There are many other factors going on here which I am sure are impacting upon what is happening in particular sectors.</p></speech>

I welcome the idea of a meeting but I would not like to find out here in 12 months time that another request for a meeting has been submitted and nothing has changed.  Perhaps what should happen now is that the witnesses would be upfront, which they will be, and say that this is as far as the Department can go and the business owners can say this is as far as they can go because all we are doing is having a conversation every 12 months, and many of these small businesses are under great threat.</p> <p>  On the PeoplePoint system, will one of the witnesses give me some general background on that?  What was the logic behind it, and where is it at now?</p></speech>

In terms of the recording of leave, absenteeism, the basic infrastructure, data management that underpins a HR system, which determines ultimately what people get paid, their pension and their entitlements, those transactional HR activities were undertaken by each public body in the past.  Each Department, and it could be a small Department or the Revenue Commissioners, would be dealing with their own transactional HR.</p> <p>  There are benefits in consolidating the system in terms of reducing the costs, reducing the numbers of people involved, getting economies of scale from technology, and also getting a more standard approach to information across the system so that we get much better information in common.</p> <p>  PeoplePoint, in effect, is a shared service which is consolidating transactional HR into one place, which previously was devolved across the system.  That is the motivation for it.  The motivation is twofold: to save money over time but also to improve the quality of information.</p> <p>  To give one example of it, in the past it would be very difficult for us to get common information on sick leave across Departments.  It would have been a major exercise for us to go to HR managers; it would take weeks.  With PeoplePoint we will be able to generate a report, say, on overtime, allowances, or the numbers of people in different offices.  It provides us with information to enable managers to manage more effectively.</p> <p>  The other key benefit is Departments can focus on what we call the retained or strategic HR.  Rather than engage in personnel functions the HR transactional function is to engage in strategic HR around finding out what is happening with sick leave, what is happening with under-performance, whether we are allocating staff in the right places and investing in learning and development.  It is to enable the HR units to focus on what we call strategic as opposed to transactional HR.  That is, in a nutshell, the essence of what we are trying to achieve.</p></speech>

We would have partnered with an external provider to help us with this.  This is an enormous change management project.  We went from 48 public bodies doing it in a particular way to a cleaning data, and then transferring it into a centre with all the complications.  It has thrown up a number of issues that are now coming to light, which are very helpful for managers.</p> <p>  We will not see the benefits for a number of years.  Elements of the start-up were slower than we thought.  We made some mistakes along the way so it has been slower, but progress is reasonable and we believe we will get to where we want to get to after a period.</p></speech>

We will save about 250 staff, and the yearly cost saving is several million.  I will come back to the Deputy on the numbers but it will be several million each year over the period.  What we are now looking at, based on what has been happening in the past number of years, is reassessing what we call the business case to see where we are, and we can share that with the Deputy.  There will be savings of &euro;12.5 million and 149 staff, who previously would have been on transactional HR, are now involved in other functions.  We are refreshing the numbers and we can come back to the Deputy with our assessment of that.</p> <p>  On the savings, there will be cost savings.  There is always a danger that we will focus on what we can just measure.  There are very significant benefits in the system from the new information we will get to enable HR managers understand what is going on, and then to drive change.  We will set out some of those benefits as well.  They could be of much more significance and strategic importance to the system over time than the actual cash savings from more efficient practices and better technology.</p></speech>

It took us longer to do the baselining when we established the migration of the different waves.  We did it in different waves, so there was some slippage compared to where we were of about 12 months.</p> <p>  We had a timeframe but when issues arose in the first wave of Departments we paused and tried to address those because PeoplePoint was under pressure in terms of the level of activity and the volumes they were dealing with - the outstanding cases.  We slowed down the transition of the various waves to give staff more time to get on top of it.</p> <p>  In simplistic terms, this is meant to be a self-service portal.  Rather than applying to a HR manager through paper or through the system, the person is meant to do it online and through the portal, and the manager gets notified by e-mail.  Some elements of it did not work as well as we had hoped at the start, and we spent a longer time ironing out those difficulties before we increased up to where we had hoped to be.  It is about a year longer than we thought to make the transition.</p></speech>

Considering the comments that Mr. Watt's boss, the Minister, made in recent days about the abolition of town councils being a mistake, the accountability and performance part of this document refers to the National Oversight and Audit Commission for Local Government, which undermines that to some extent.</p><p>It states the national oversight and audit commission for local government will do a list of things but that it was mistake to do this in the first place.  The funny thing from my perspective is that Mr. Watt might be right, but it needs to be spelled out what exactly the national oversight and audit commission for local government will do. There is a relationship with the Committee of Public Accounts because one of its roles will be to engage in financial scrutiny of revenue collection across the 31 local authorities to see how efficient it is.  That is of relevance to the committee, but is there a contradiction?  The Minister and the Department issue a document such as this which states, effectively, that it was a mistake to abolish town councils.  I think, therefore, that Mr. Watt might be right.  I had meetings with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government who had drafted the Act, but what I said fell on deaf ears.  I now realise that he probably had his mind made up before that debate started on town councils.  I took my own town council in Dungarvan as an example - its staff, the town clerk in particular, were outstanding - and what I knew would happen when he left when it came to local administration is happening.  What exactly will the national oversight and audit commission do because already I see the cracks when it comes to services provided when town councils were in place?  I am thinking, in particular, about housing and the way people are dealt with from Dungarvan to Waterford city.  The consideration necessary when it comes to dealing with individuals and their families is missing.</p></speech>

He supports achieving more value for money and undertaking more assessments.  I do not know whether there is a crossover from his views on town councils to the other, but he may clarify his comments.  The Deputy can ask him at a future date what he had in mind.  I can speculate on his motives for making the comments, but it is beyond my remit.  We are still friends and I would like to keep it that way, as long as we can manage it.  I do not see an issue in terms of the structures in place.  The Chairman probed me on this question in the past and there were issues around the independence of the local government audit service within the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and whether it should be merged with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General in a new office and the need for greater oversight in this space.  I will support whatever mechanisms are required to ensure the achievement of value for money is pursued and that things are done properly.  As the Deputy knows better than I do, the biggest reform introduced concerns how the vast majority of the money spent at local level is raised.  Over time, presumably, this will lead to councillors having much more oversight of what is going on within local authorities because they will be saying to ratepayers and property holders that they are paying to them; therefore, they will have to account for it.</p></speech>

Mr. Watt knows that we have talked about rates during the years.  It is devolving power to local authorities so far as revenue collection in their own areas is concerned.  Mr. Watt is announcing that this is happening around the country, but will he talk about the quality of the service provided, regardless of whether there are revenue raising powers locally?  What I have seen to date is a dip in the quality and level of service provided.  I do not know what is within the remit when it comes to making a determination on how successful the change has been in the services provided for ratepayers and ordinary citizens, but that is an issue that needs to be looked at.  How else is one going to find out if it is working?  Initially I advise that we survey ratepayers and ordinary citizens who have been subject to the change and speak to Deputies and Senators because they deal with the issue every day in their offices to find out if it has worked.  What the Minister said might have been a political statement to a certain extent, but we need to revisit the issue if it is found that the service has reduced.</p></speech>

Unlike other parts of the public service, there are many entities which provide comparable services.  I know that they are different as one cannot compare Dublin to County Leitrim or Dublin to County Waterford, but there should be a way to benchmark the cost and quality of services provided.  One of the roles of the group, as I understand it, is to do this and, to an extent, respond.  If a different service is provided in Waterford with which people are dissatisfied, it might indicate where there is room for improvement.  I am not exactly sure where we stand on this issue.  If the Deputy wishes, I will come back to him and see what the remit is and what it is doing.</p></speech>

May we have a short passage on what thematic reviews of local authority function mean?  The only point I am making, even though I might agree with the Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, is that there is a slight contradiction and a subtle undermining of what those on the commission might be tasked to do, while at the same time saying the abolition of town councils was a mistake.  Spelling out the role of the group and how it will perform its functions and come to conclusions is important because I already see cracks since the town councils were abolished.</p></speech>

Following on from Deputy John Deasy's point, does Mr. Watt consider it would be better to have the new audit committee which will audit local authorities under the Comptroller and Auditor General in order that the CEOs would be more accountable to the Oireachtas?</p></speech>

I would have thought that in making a change in local government funding arrangements there would be much less reliance on the centre and much more on local sourcing of money.  I would have thought this would change the nature of the debate such that over time, as mentioned by Deputy John Deasy, local councillors would be called to account not only for spending but also advising on how money should be raised.  Therefore, there will be a different type of accountability mechanism.  The centre will be providing funding to a figure of 10% to 15%; therefore, the role of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government or our Department will be diminished when it comes to the provision of funding.  We are in a different place.  I presume the establishment of the oversight board will have implications for the local government audit committee in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  I presume there will be a collapsing of one into the other.</p></speech>

As they contribute to the general Government deficit, for Maastricht reporting reasons there is a limit of about &euro;200 million on the addition to the general Government deficit that the local authority sector can engage in.  That was put in place in 2009 when the financial emergency began.  There is a constraint on their ability to borrow because of the financial situation they face.  As the Deputy is aware, local authorities have reduced staff numbers dramatically and have reduced their costs more than the wider public sector has done.  I have no doubt that their ability to raise funds is impacting on their ability to draw down-----</p></speech>

As the local authority is part of the general Government sector, restrictions are imposed on its ability to borrow, but ultimately it is a matter for the local authority.  The C&amp;AG has done a review of the land aggregation scheme, which was partly a response to the indebtedness of some local authorities who had gone into debt through buying up land for developments that were subsequently deferred or phased because of changes in the property market.  The central Government stepped in to provide support to some of those local authorities and the C&amp;AG has done an assessment of that scheme.</p></speech>

Our Minister was charged by the Government with this programme.  The Minister and his colleagues have delivered on 181 of the closures or mergers and the Government is committed to doing that.  From central Government, there are savings of around &euro;20 million.  For local authorities there are savings of around &euro;40 million.  However, there are also changes due to the simpler landscape.  There were overlaps and duplication between different agencies, which affected their ability to deliver, so merging and streamlining will bring benefits over time, in addition to the monetary benefits.  That programme has come to an end.  It was very time-intensive, because it required us to go back and change legislation.  Many new pieces of legislation had to be enacted.  There were also major challenges for the management and staff of the organisations.  Although an agency might have been merged, collapsed or abolished, the functions it was carrying out continued in most cases, because people believed they were valuable, and still do.  In that sense, it was a difficult programme.</p></speech>

That was for the issuing of statutory licences to the retail trade.  Mr. Watt might give an update on it.  That was the situation where 25 licences could be applied for on the single portal, which would cut down on administrative costs for anybody in the retail trade.  This was a far-reaching policy.  How far has it advanced?</p></speech>

This might defuse some of the issues about school supply.  A directive was given that where the accounting officer could be deemed the principal of a school, and they felt they were getting value for money and equality of standard, if they signed a statutory declaration, as the accounting officer for the school, they could deal with the supplier of choice.

That latitude is there for all public bodies.  However, I remind people that there is also an obligation on public bodies that are funded by the State to go through a procurement process.  They are not relieved of that at all.  If they find that by running a local procurement they can get better value for money than through a State framework, they can avail of that local framework.</p></speech>

Is there a real risk if they sign up to 16/13?  One is dealing with competent people who are in a job for 20 years and know exactly the quality of the product they are getting.  If they give a statutory declaration that they are in compliance with 16/13, are they contravening any Government policy by attempting to get the best value for money?</p></speech>

Mr. Quinn was very helpful about that issue with regard to clarification.  While I respect small businesses, it is very hard to keep everybody happy when one is dealing with &euro;9 billion of procurement contracts, no matter how one does it.   There is an issue of supply and demand and the economy of scale with 4.5 million people.  This is one of the most persistent issues at the moment.  Procurement in general is a bigger issue but we are dealing here mainly with the small firms issue, while this morning we dealt with supplying schools.  Would it be possible to issue a letter of clarification from the Department of Education and Skills to schools, stating that the principal officer of the school would do this without ambiguity or fear of repercussion afterwards?  This is a very important point because I know of several schools at the moment that are very happy to sign 16/13 on value for money and on quality.  It would defuse much of the confusion that prevails at the moment if clarification could be issued from the Department.  Every national school I know of operates by a circular.  They get a circular from the Department indicating that they are entitled to purchase following the 16/13 criteria and they can deal with their local suppliers.  Many of them prefer to do so.  The debate today would be resolved through that.</p></speech>

I argue with him that the way local government is developing is nonsense for the following reason.  Last month, there were two days of one week where two full pages of a newspaper was taken up through listing the losses and inefficiencies of spend by local government.  I presume the journalists got their information from the audit office.  Had that not happened we would have had no public consciousness about the losses.  Like it or not, the Committee of Public Accounts exposes what has happened, looks at all of the issues and then makes recommendations.  One does not get that with a local government audit and I do not question the ability of their audit team to do their job.  I am saying it would be far more beneficial, in the context of the reform of the State, and reforms that his Department is engaged in, to adopt a management tool.  The Department should say to the Minister that he should do so.</p> <p>  A sum of &euro;6 billion is allocated to local government.  I am not saying that the allocation is not audited.  I am saying audit committees are not necessarily established in every local government area.  There is also no public debate about  waste in local government.  I shall cite two of the examples of information that have come to us - the land aggregation information and information on the Poolbeg incinerator.  There is not a defined line for debate and I am extremely disappointed that such an initiative has not materialised in policy.</p> <p>  Was the Secretary General at the conference last weekend?</p></speech>

The restoration of local democracy and town councils is essential, which is what he wants to happen.  I agree with him.

I think that provides an opportunity and avenue for this committee to be involved.</p> <p>  In terms of local government, as I mentioned in response to Deputy Deasy, the vast majority of the spend by local authorities will now be raised locally.  There will be a greater role for members of councils and their governance structures to ensure the money is well spent.  I have never had an issue with any proposal which would involve the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General merging with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and taking over that function.  I have no problem with that initiative.  If that is the way people want to go or proceed then that is fine.  There is a role for this committee to look at Exchequer funds through the local government fund into local authorities.  Over time it will become a good deal less significant, as we know.  I do not think there is any issue why the Comptroller and Auditor General cannot perform that role.</p></speech>

Yesterday they released, by mistake or whatever knowing the games that are being played, a report which raises further questions about procurement.</p> <p>  I do not expect the Secretary General to know the following.  This morning the clerk to this committee received an analysis of a dossier which showed that contracts were being awarded without procurement - it was just ignored - even though some of these contracts were in the region of &euro;100,000.  A contract was then awarded to check on the contract that was issued for &euro;100,000 which cost &euro;58,000.  Then there were recommendations by staff to use a consultant who would cost &euro;1,000 per day.  I have just touched on these matters which have happened within the HSE.</p> <p>  Yesterday the committee went to the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to meet its counterparts from Northern Ireland.  We discovered that our counterparts in the North paid out &euro;1.3 million, not just without proper procurement procedures being acknowledged but without paperwork.  They paid &euro;1.3 million for an obsolete piece of equipment that was valued at &euro;30,000 but was never used.  The reason I say this to the Secretary General is because he oversees these Departments.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Not enough care is given to the spending of taxpayers' money on the other side of this issue.  My evidence for saying so is that the HSE day-in and day-out wastes money.  Yesterday, we saw a scandalous waste of &euro;2.3 million by the Irish State.  A total of &euro;4.3 million was wasted between the North and South and they failed to pick up on EU funding.  These are the things that we are missing.</p><p>What penalties or sanctions, can the Secretary General take to deal with a spending Department that completely ignores the process, which is what has been borne out in the evidence from the HSE and other Departments?</p></speech>

In relation to inappropriate claiming for travel, as I have not seen the details I will not comment on the case, but should a person make an inappropriate claim, the expectation is that the money will be recouped and the money will be paid back to the Exchequer.  We will ensure that the Department of Health together with the HSE will pursue the case in order that people who make claims which are not appropriate will repay the money which will be recouped to the taxpayer.  The guidelines from the Department are crystal clear and there is no doubt whatsoever on the issue.  We expect the money will be repaid to the Exchequer.</p> <p>  I will now respond to the question on procurement.  I read the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on procurement in the HSE.  Clearly the approach is not satisfactory.  The level of non-compliance is not satisfactory.  We absolutely agree with the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We do not believe those practices are appropriate.  Mr. Paul Quinn from our office has been engaged with the procurement side in the HSE to improve and professionalise practices.  We have signed a memorandum of understanding with them on how we will help them in the procurement of common goods and services, but the non-addressable spend will remain the responsibility of the HSE.  To answer the Chairman's question directly, we are not satisfied with procurement and we are working with the HSE to professionalise procurement procedures and to ensure that in cases such as contracts, where we do not have basic competitive processes, we have procedures.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General reported a number of years ago on such spending in Departments.  I think &euro;140 million of the spend involved non-competitive processes.  In most cases there are good reasons for that but within the HSE it is not appropriate to have that level of spend which is not subject to a competitive process.  We will be following up the report.  Mr. Quinn has already done some of the work in following up the case.</p> <p>  We also agree with the Comptroller and Auditor General's comment about sanctions on units and staff who have not complied or have not provided the basic information.  Our system is governed by circular 40/02 which provides that I must sign on the occasion that we do not go through a competitive process.  We go through a process in the Department where colleagues come to me with examples and we review them and we must ensure we are happy with them.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has identified that this is not happening in the HSE.  That is not acceptable.  There were various discussions about IT systems and manual systems but I absolutely agree with the Chairman and do not disagree with anything he said at all.</p> <p>  The Chairman raised the issue of the Bytel project and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  This is unusual.  It involved EU funding.  The project involves the Department and an equivalent Department in the North as well as the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which was not the lead Department.  I know the Chairman has been briefed separately on that.  Public money has not been spent appropriately and if there is any misappropriation, we will need to do everything we possibly can to recover that money.  I am not exactly sure where we are going with this so I do not want to prejudice anything that might happen.  We are very concerned that what happened should not have happened and it is a clear example of where taxpayers' money was not spent appropriately.  The Chairman has probably been briefed better than I have been about this but we will follow it up.</p> <p>  Let me make a general point about EU projects and EU funding.  We have extensive audits of this and the Comptroller and Auditor General would be aware of this.  Thankfully we have not come across many cases like this.  I am not for a moment excusing it, but we are confident that more than 99% of the spending co-funded by the EU is appropriate.  We have done well from this fund over the years.  This is not satisfactory and given that there were two Departments involved in a North-South project, we need to learn the lessons from it.</p></speech>

We have seen this time and again.  It is as if nobody in the Departments learns the lesson.  I have never seen anybody being sanctioned.  Mr. Watt referred in a speech during the week that it is hard to get rid of people when they do something wrong.</p></speech>

I will take on board what the Chairman says.  If there is a case that a contract has been awarded without a competitive process to somebody who had a relationship and a connected relationship previously with the entity, we do not believe that is appropriate and we would expect that there would be some response and action taken.  I do not want to go into the details of what that might be because it will depend on the circumstances.  Clearly, if anybody who is present saw that in their organisation, he or she would immediately ask what was going on.  It is not correct that it is not a competitive process.  Clearly if it goes to a company that has a previous connection with the body, then immediately there will be a perception of something not being correct.  I absolutely agree.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Watt know what I mean?  We know as from yesterday when the documents were leaked about the procurement in the HSE because it has been reported to us.  It will be a while before a hearing and a report and recommendations are put in place.  It is similar for the procurement process for the people who were before us this morning.  By the time one learns about it, some of them will have closed.  Let me give an example of a chemist who had the contract to supply medication to ten nursing homes where people are being cared for.  I have examined the case where a chemist was told one day that he or she had lost the contract, but he or she had not been asked to tender for the contract when the HSE were renewing it.  That chemist has spent 14 months arguing with the HSE about the fact that the procurement process excluded him or her.  Meanwhile some other chemist is supplying the nursing homes.  While he is arguing that the paperwork was not correct and that he was not asked to tender, he does not have the contract.  The system has a way of trundling on and the dogs will bark and the caravan moves on.  I think somebody should stop the caravan.  Somebody has to stop the HSE in its tracks.</p> <p>  In respect of the North-South case, a whistleblower had known about it since 2006.  How many more mistakes were made from 2006 to the present day in respect of procurement simply because nobody cried stop?  If this happened in a private business, there would be a board meeting and somebody would get the sack.  The system would be changed.  I do not think we should have to wait until recommendations are made.  I am saying that with due respect to Mr. Watt and his officials.  I think there should be a procedure at the end of each meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts that somebody should make a phone call to the relevant person, asking what is happening in their section.  It is farcical to listen to these stories every single week.  We propose to bring in the HSE next week, if we can.  We will hear what has been going on.  I think it is a terrible reflection on the system how correspondence from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General to the audit section of the HSE is dealt with.  The HSE, rather than reply efficiently and well, waits until the last minute and then does what so often happens here, it leaks it to the newspapers.  That is not acceptable.</p></speech>

A total of &euro;54 billion has been spent and there are 290,000 people so there will be issues.  One cannot extrapolate from one issue and then say that it is endemic across the system or that the issue arises, but clearly if the same types of issue come up within organisations, then obviously that is a flag and it is something that requires a response.</p> <p>  I have two further comments to make on the specifics.  In terms of whistleblowers, the committee is aware our Department drafted legislation which has been enacted to provide protection for people who want to reveal things that are going on, and they now have protection to do that which they did not have previously.  Our Minister has responded to this agenda and has now enacted very important legislation which enables people to identify wrongdoing and ensure that if they do, they will not be subjected to any adverse pressure or be treated unfairly.</p> <p>  We have embarked on the largest programme of public procurement reform ever.  We have done that because of a series of reports produced by the Comptroller and Auditor General and a series of discussions at the Committee of Public Accounts going back over a generation which identified not an amateurish but not a sufficiently robust and professional procurement function.  That is why we have a procurement office staffed with procurement people who are doing an amazing job in establishing this entity.  That is what we are doing.  We responded to concerns and the Department is working on them, but certainly in terms of the HSE, we would be interested in the committee&rsquo;s discussions next week.  We will follow the debate and see what more we could do.  We have a memorandum of understanding now and we are working with the HSE on common goods and services on which we will assist it to procure.  We encourage the HSE to have a professional approach to procurement in line with the guidelines and to address very seriously the issues raised by the auditor.</p></speech>

There have been further discussions about it and we are waiting for the HSE to come to us with the revised business plan to support a single financial platform.

I refer to Mr. Watt&rsquo;s letter this morning about the Tipperary hostel, which I went to see.  I keep on asking the Departments about it but nobody wants to step in to protect the millions that have already been spent on it.</p></speech>

I think the total involved was &euro;10 million.  The money that was spent on the church was well spent.  The completed job looked splendid, but now that is falling into rack and ruin.  We know now that there are no prosecutions in relation to the other allegations that were made.  It is now a case of trying to protect the taxpayers&rsquo; money that was already spent.</p></speech>

Some Departments do not get back to us.</p> <p>  The second question on timely responses relates to reports the Comptroller and Auditor General submits to Ministers.  Two relate to the Department of Education and Skills at the moment, one on the VEC in Cork.  Such reports can remain with the Minister for up to three months.  What do they do with them?  I refer to a stage following which the report has been sent to various people for comment.  Could Mr. Watt put an agreed reasonable protocol in place for a response from the Minister?</p></speech>

The clerk, Mr. McEnery, might know.  Over a period of six months we cleared a load of them and since then we have improved the timeliness dramatically.  The clerk will be able to give you the details on it, Chairman.  We have improved our record dramatically compared with what happened in the past.</p></speech>

I have signed off on the reports.  The statutory provision allows a Department up to three months.  In fairness, any time we have sent a report to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, it has been very prompt in getting it into the Oireachtas but other Departments have a different process.</p></speech>

Again, I ask this because Mr. Watt&rsquo;s officials are present at the meetings.  The Higher Education Authority was before us to discuss universities and institutes of technology.  Mr. McCarthy&rsquo;s report dealt with the audit committees in various places.  What we heard that day about how the Department oversees the spend in third level institutions and ITs was shocking.  Nobody had an idea.  The HEA does not have the staff to ensure compliance within the university and institute of technology sector.  Governance issues arise in terms of Waterford IT and the Institute of Technology, Cork.  Queries arise in terms of the amalgamation process between the institutes of technology in Carlow and Waterford.  There is no business plan for that process as it has not been worked out yet.  In Cork and Tralee the figure was in the region of &euro;6 million and yet no one was able to set out for us how the money was to be spent, and the structures to deliver compliance, transparency and accountability were simply non-existent in some cases.  Would the section in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that overlooks the issue have a chat with Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; and Mr. Boland because the system is not working?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-05a.463" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Watt" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015030500002#BB02700"><p>I imagine that it is the responsibility of the CEOs of the universities and institute of technology presidents, namely, the leadership of the institutions, to be accountable to the boards that are established and that they would have proper procedures and audit committees to ensure public money and other moneys, because in most cases a large proportion of their funding is not from the Exchequer.  In Trinity College now it is almost half and half Exchequer and non-Exchequer, and the ratio has changed for other institutions.</p><p>I presume that, in the first instance, it is a question of the leadership of those institutions having proper governance structures and audit committees to ensure that money is spent appropriately and that the HEA receives proper assurances that those structures are in place.  Someone on Marlborough Street cannot ensure that every pen is accounted for properly.  Instead, people can ensure that there are proper structures in place to govern how moneys are spent.  I can raise the matter with the Secretary General, Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, and ask him about the arrangements that are in place.  I am not familiar with them, but there are service level agreements between the HEA and bodies.  Money is dispersed to achieve various public policy objectives.  I can check exactly what the position is.  The Comptroller and Auditor General might know, but I presume that, at a minimum, they have audit committees.  These are large institutions with large budgets.</p></speech>

The most recent case of whistleblowing came forward from an agency and has proven helpful in a Garda inquiry and work that we are undertaking.

Apologies have been received from the Chairman, Deputy Dominic Hannigan, and Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe.  I remind members to ensure their mobile phones are switched off as they can cause serious problems for the broadcasting system.  I welcome television viewers who are watching this meeting live today on the Oireachtas channel on the UPC and Sky networks.  The committee is continuing its work of considering the critical issues facing Ireland in the event of the UK deciding to exit the European Union.  A referendum on that question has been promised by the UK Prime Minister if returned to power following the general election in May.  It is important to say to members that the committee took the decision to examine this issue now in view of its many potential impacts on this country and the many Irish citizens living in the UK.</p> <p>  Today the committee's work will be divided into two different sessions.  The first session will focus on the UK politics surrounding the issue of BrExit with the assistance of Baroness Quin of the House of Lords and Mr. Brendan Halligan, chairman of the Institute for International and European Affairs.  The time allowed for this session is one hour until 3.30 p.m.  In the second session today, we will be joined by the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Dara Murphy, to hear the Government's views on the prospects for UK-EU relations.</p></speech>

I look forward to hearing from them on these issues.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I invite Baroness Quin followed by Mr. Halligan to make their opening statements of five minutes each.  We were in London last week where we met two of Baroness Quin's colleagues, Lord Dubs and Baroness Scott, to discuss this issue over a lunchtime round-table discussion.</p></speech>

It is a pleasure to be here alongside Brendan Halligan as we were both colleagues in the European Parliament rather a long time ago.</p> <p>  I feel as if I have been involved with the European issue for a very long time having had as my first job after graduating a position in the Labour Party working on European policy.  I lectured at two universities in the UK on European politics subsequently before becoming an MEP and thereafter an MP.  I say that in order that the committee knows where I am coming from.  I took part as a foot soldier in the referendum campaign in the 1970s, arguing for a "Yes" vote by the UK on belonging to what was then the EEC.  I remember very well the arguments for and against that were made at the time.  It seems a bit surprising that so many years later membership is still a controversial issue in the UK although the issues that are most often mentioned have changed over the years.  I remember that in the 1970s the question of the Common Agricultural Policy was particularly prevalent in all discussions, but that takes a much lower profile these days while issues such as immigration and others have come much more to the fore.  We are still taking about referendums, however.</p> <p>  Whether there will be an in-out referendum and whether that will take place before or after a substantial renegotiation is not clear.  It is also not clear what all the terms of that renegotiation might be.  Obviously, certain things are mentioned such as immigration but there has been very little discussion of areas such as how we would co-operate with other European countries on environment policy, development policy and justice and home affairs, although all of those issues are very important.  We must then think about what life might be outside the European Union were there to be a referendum and were the vote to be in favour of withdrawal.  Only recently has there started to be any serious consideration of what the alternatives to EU membership might be, especially in trading terms.  There are a lot of questions to be asked about all of the possible alternatives, including whether we would be in the European Economic Area or simply members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and what this would mean for our relationships with our European partners, notably those countries in the European Union with which we have a special relationship, including, of course, the Republic of Ireland.</p><p>There are many questions around at the moment and I suspect members of the committee will probably ask me some of those in this session.  I again thank the members of the committee for inviting me.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-05a.499" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Halligan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015030500002#C00200"><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak.  I will base my presentation on the synopsis of a book the institute is about to publish shortly on the changing relationship between Britain and Europe, entitled <i>Britain and Europe: The Endgame</i>.  That expression is, of course, taken from chess and it signifies a moment when a very long game is about to come to the end.  The institute&rsquo;s UK project group believes this to be the case in respect of Britain and that we are coming to the end of a very long saga that began 70 years ago.  We have built on two books we published previously on the matter, one in 1996 and one in 2000 under the leadership of Garret FitzGerald.  Paul Gillespie was the editor on both occasions, as he is now.  The current project group is being led by D&aacute;ith&iacute; O&rsquo;Ceallaigh, who appeared before the committee very recently.<br/><br/>We take it that the common view is that Britain's very long and troubled relationship with the European Union is reaching a critical moment in history when the issue will be resolved one way or the other.  We do not see this as another episode in the saga but the closing scene of a history that goes back over 70 years.  There is no need to go into all of that.  Members of the committee know the oscillating position, with one party in the UK being in favour of Europe and by nature the other party opposing it.  One party changes its position and the other party changes its position.  There is this constant oscillation of attitudes towards Europe.<br/><br/>To try to explain that to ourselves, we have created four scenarios to explain Britain&rsquo;s relationship with Europe: a Britain that is fully in the European Union, supporting integration and participating in all policies; a Britain that is half in, generally supporting integration but not participating in things it does not want to; a Britain that is half out, opposing integration but accepting bits that suit at the time; and a Britain that is fully out, which is self-explanatory, reverting back to the pre-1973 position.  For practical purposes nobody in the United Kingdom wants a fully in position.  The Labour Party is in favour of being half in, while the Conservative Party clearly supports half out and many of its MPs and activists would prefer to see it fully out.<br/><br/>What the book is concerned about is that by a process of default, the current half-out position could morph into a fully out position without anybody noticing.  In a sense we are saying this is a moment of great danger for Ireland and Europe.  For that reason we end with a series of recommendations for other member states, for Europe as a whole and for us as people who are intimately involved.<br/><br/>We make one point on the referendum.  We believe a referendum is inevitable in the immediate future irrespective of who is in government.  Clearly it will happen under a Conservative-led government.  The momentum is so great that we do not see a Labour-led government being able to withstand it.  On the other hand, British legislation would require a referendum were it to be a substantial transfer of sovereignty from any member state to the European Union.  In other words, we think this will happen.<br/><br/>Therefore, we had better prepare for the inevitable.  We have started by looking at the demands the Conservative Prime Minister has placed on the rest of the Union.  We are all familiar with his Bloomberg speech, augmented by the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>article.  As far as we can see, there are seven demands in all: two relating to borders, two dealing with business and trade, and three focussed on the recovery and preservation of sovereignty.  We believe these demands boil down to a simple proposition: Britain has no intention of taking on responsibilities for which it has already received or won a derogation, such as on the euro.  It does not want to assume any new commitments, such as banking union, and it wishes to be relieved of some of its existing obligations, such as the free movement of persons.  It wants to recast the rights and obligations of EU membership on its own terms.  It is also clear that while changing its terms of membership is a central objective, membership of the Single Market is the overriding objective.  It wants to stay inside the Single Market to have access to European markets.  However, there is a problem in this regard because access to the Single Market has a price and, quite frankly, the British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, is not willing to pay that price.<br/><br/>However, there is more to it than the Single Market.  As expressed in the Bloomberg speech and repeated in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>article, the British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, does not wish Britain to participate any further in the process of ever-closer Union among the peoples of Europe.  The problem with that is it goes to the very heart of EU membership since ever-closer Union is the first objective of the treaties and one to which Britain solemnly subscribed when it became a member in 1973.  The key point is that British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, wants to freeze Britain&rsquo;s membership of the Union at the point at which it is now.  More than that, he wants to freeze the European Union at its current state of development.  That is a complete misunderstanding of what the European Union is.  It is an open-ended dynamic organisation, forever widening its membership, extending its policy agenda and deepening the interdependence of its member states, of which the euro is the most visible expression.  The eurozone has become the real core of the European Union.  As it furthers its integration, of course, and as Britain stays still, then the distance between Britain and the rest simply gets bigger.<br/><br/>The book suggests that the referendum offers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to deal with this dilemma.  We suggest coming up with a bespoke solution for the United Kingdom which will endure indefinitely and bring these repeated crises to an end.  I think that people will need to swallow hard here and accept that Britain will never join the euro, the Schengen area, the fiscal compact and so on.  That should be explicitly accepted by the other member states and would meet the demand that Britain, at least under the Conservatives, would not be required to go any further with closer Union.  Where we really need imaginative solutions are on border controls.  This could be done by marrying Britain&rsquo;s desire to be a full member of the Single Market with the common need to protect the Union&rsquo;s common borders from terrorist infiltration, as well as the common need to limit welfare tourism and control mass immigration.  Bundled together and adding in energy and cyber security, we could have a &quot;security union&quot;, of which Britain would be a full member.  President Juncker has proposed to create a capital markets union and obviously the UK would be a member of that.  All in all, the European Union would have four core functions of which Britain would be a member of three.  It would not be a member of the economic and monetary union but would be a member of the Single Market, the security union and the capital markets union.  That might be sufficient to keep it inside.<br/><br/>I have a word of warning about lists such as those to which we have referred.  I said there were seven demands that we could identify from the speech and the article.  Lists can be very misleading because they cloak the underlying reasons for Britain's opposition to Europe, which are cultural and psychological and are borne of a very complicated past and bred of a complex future.  In politics we all know there are publicly expressed good reasons for doing or not doing something, but behind that there are always the real reasons, usually unexpressed.  In the case of Britain, or more specifically England, the real reasons have been expressed by no less a person than Winston Churchill as long ago as the late 1920s and early 1930s when he said: &quot;We are with Europe, but not of it.&quot;  In other words, it wants to be in but out at the same time.  If one was to be unkind one could say have one's cake and eat it at the same time.  That is why the lists keep moving and it is very difficult to pin down what exactly the British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, wants.</p><p> If is self-evident that withdrawal would be a huge blow to the European Union and would cause particular difficulties not least for Ireland but Northern Ireland in particular.  We believe that if Britain opts to leave the European Union, Scotland will almost certainly demand a separate referendum and it is almost inevitable it will decide to remain inside the European Union, at which point the United Kingdom will break up and the result could be the United Kingdom of England and Northern Ireland, which would make Northern Ireland an orphan.  This would create a huge range of economic issues for Ireland, as detailed at length in a number of chapters in the book.  Also examined in the book, and referred to earlier by Baroness Quin, is Britain's future relationship with the European Union.  In this regard we have identified approximately seven models, all of which would be difficult for Ireland and many of which can only be regarded as fantasy solutions to Britain's problems.</p></speech>

I welcome Baroness Quin, whom I met briefly prior to the meeting, and Mr. Halligan whom we all know by reputation and is held in great regard throughout the country.  I also thank them both for their presentations.</p> <p>  Following on from Mr. Halligan's presentation, we share the view that it would be a big blow to Europe if the UK, which along with France and Germany is one of the three big players in Europe, were to leave the Union.  It would be a blow to the entire European project which has at its core the ambition of achieving and maintaining peace and integration in Europe, improving prosperity and ensuring adequate food supply and so on.  It would also be a pity if that happened, particularly in the context of Anglo-Irish relations.  I am sure that Baroness Quin will be aware that Anglo-Irish relations, in the history of our two countries, have never been better.  Anglo-Irish relations are now tremendously cordial.  Rapport and kinship between the two countries is very strong, as are trading, commercial and tourism links and family ties.  It would be a pity if, at a time when our relations are excellent, anything were to happen to separate us again, if not emotionally, then in practical terms.  It would also not be helpful to the further cementing of good relations.</p> <p>  As a Border representative and Deputy for Cavan-Monaghan, I have a specific interest in the implications of the UK's withdrawal from the EU on the Border area.  For example, would issues such as passport control and customs again become difficult?  As a result of the current weak state of the euro, there are exciting opportunities for that region in terms of attracting business and customers from across the Border, including Internet business.  Perhaps the delegates would give their assessment of the implications of a withdrawal by the UK from Europe on the Border counties, North and South, which areas have suffered hugely because of the conflict in Northern Ireland, and how far back it would set the clock?  Currently the Border is not a commercial or economic reality.  I am interested in hearing the delegates' views on how the withdrawal of the UK from Europe would apply practically.</p> <p>  We are all aware that negotiations on the transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP, which is the trade agreement between the USA and Canada and Europe, are sluggish and slow.  Intelligence reports suggest achievement of agreement will be a long-term process.  Given the delegates are expert in this area, in the unhappy event, in Ireland's case, of the UK leaving the EU, is it likely the UK will independently negotiate a trade agreement with the USA and Canada and, if so, what would be the implications of that for Ireland?  I found interesting Mr. Halligan's thoughts on the measures he believed would alleviate the UK's difficulties.  I had the privilege of studying history at school.  I agree with Mr. Halligan that there are deep-seated cultural and historical reasons at the root of all of the UK's objections.  I found his comments in that regard fascinating.  It is not an issue that has up to now been raised with the committee.  I agree with Mr. Halligan's remarks in that regard.  I also found the seven pointers he referenced very interesting.  As stated by other colleagues, it is important the negotiations continue in an effort to stave off the ultimate difficulty.</p> <p>  If Baroness Quin or Mr. Halligan can suggest ways we could practically assist without interfering or causing any damage, we would be delighted to do so.  I again apologise for having to leave the meeting at this point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-05a.503" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015030500002#D00400"><p>I, too, welcome our visitors, all of whom are experts in this particular field.  Their contributions over the years are unequalled.  I am conscious of the need for us not to interfere in an election process in a neighbouring jurisdiction.  We need always to be very careful not to do that.  When one considers the implications of this issue, it can be equated to a bad hangover in that in the event of following a certain route, one inevitably ends up with a hangover.  It would be much better if in the first instance we did not have to go that route and obviate the need for any remedial action.</p> <p>  My questions are similar to those raised numerous times with other delegates over recent weeks.  Do Europeans really realise what is involved?  Does Ireland and do all other members states, including the UK, recognise the magnitude of the task at hand and the implications of the UK following that route?  Do we in Ireland recognise the full implications of what it entails for us, Britain, Northern Ireland and the European Union?  Do we fully recognise the implications for the European Union as an entity, which as Mr. Halligan said has grown immeasurably over the past 70 years, and in the right direction?  Where are we as Europeans now headed?  Do we realise where we might go if we continue in this direction?  Is this a first stage in a gradual chipping away from the European entity?  Does it mean that a particular country might leave today and another might leave tomorrow, all based on good, domestic political reasons that can be justified?  Is it inevitable that the European Union will disintegrate?  To my mind, it is.</p> <p>  Many times we have discussed, including with Baroness Quin and Mr. Halligan, that there is no movement in the United States for any state to cede from that union.  I have often wondered why that is the case.  During my lifetime, and perhaps that of many here in this room today, that union has grown.</p><p>It has grown for very good reasons - power, strength, cohesion, unity and avoidance of conflict.  These were and still are very good reasons.  The European Union is based on the premise of eliminating war, food shortages and doing all the things that would be good in a society.  Do we realise where we might find ourselves in ten or 15 years time?  Given the unrest at present and the undercurrent that we have not seen for many years, one can realistically draw a comparison with what happened in the 1930s following the roaring 1920s.  Many people were disappointed by the way society was going and looked for somebody to blame.  In the United States President Roosevelt gave guidance.  Based on past experience European leaders have shown themselves, when left to their own devices, to be extremely divisive and extremely anxious to achieve improvements for themselves <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>others.  I do not think that can lead anywhere except to disaster.<br/><br/>I believe in the single currency and that participation in the euro zone should have been an objective for the entire European Union.  There is no argument whatsoever that will ever convince me that having a single currency across the Europea Union is not better than having a multiplicity of currencies.  I hold the United States up as an example.  <br/><br/>In the event that other European Union member states have a tendency toward eurosceptism or anti-Europe sentiments, where would it lead them?  What example would they follow?  Would they follow the same path and would it then not be inevitable that the European Union, as we have come to know it, would disappear?  I had the privilege, as I am sure some of my colleagues had, of meeting some of the founding fathers of the modern Europe.  When I think of their aspirations, the basis on which they moved forward and the way they put old animosities behind them in the interests of unity and the exceptionally brave actions they took in the political climate, they pushed ahead for very good reasons.  Will all of this work be put at nil in proceeding in the direction in which the United Kingdom is now headed?</p></speech>

There will be a general election there on 7 May.  It will be a tough fight and a hard fought election and I wish all candidates in the mother of democracy every success in the campaign.  We are conscious of the commitment given by the leader of the Conservative Party that, on being returned to power, he will hold a referendum on EU membership in 2017.  That is the reason we are working actively on the issue at the Joint Committee on European Affairs.  We want to put in the work before the horse bolts.  Mr. Gillespie's book is well researched and worthwhile.  I have read the extracts which outline what happened in the past and look forward to the future.  </p> <p>  Although what we are facing is not immediate, it is a possibility.  The Government, including the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, are quite determined.  We worked on the issue at the weekend.  I thank the committee secretariat, the Chairman and members who participated in discussions in London with interested parties.  Ireland will not be indifferent to a decision by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union.  We have a vested interest in the continuation of its work in the European Union.  The then Minister, former Deputy Desmond O'Malley, delegated me as Minister of State in the 1990s to lead the Irish delegation in the negotiations on the Single European Act.  As I recall it, one of the Conservative Ministers, Mr. John Redwood, was actively involved in the negotiations, but for some reason, those who were involved are not prepared to admit or take credit for the detailed negotiations undertaken at that time.  All of the documents are in the archives.  In response to the late Dr. Garret FitzGerald who said he would love to publish all of the documentation of the European Union, I said nobody would read it because the process had been long-winded.  Ireland had its top team of civil servants, including the current ambassador to the United Kingdom, Mr. Dan Mulhall, who worked hand in glove with the British.  Irish and British interests coincided and we negotiated what was a very good Single European Act in the interests of the European Union, Britain and Ireland.  Let the Conservative Party take credit for what it has already achieved in this regard, instead of walking away as if it had nothing to do with the negotiations at the time.  Its wonderful team worked extremely hard.</p> <p>  In the event of there being a referendum on membership of the European Union, there will be negotiations to meet the requirements of the Government at the time.  The adjustments required will be the subject of negotiations.  We wish that process success.  The issue will then be put to the British people.  The European Union must outline exactly what benefits have accrued to the United Kingdom since 1973.  We know what we have achieved in the Republic through our participation in the European Union.  Ireland is an attractive location for inward investment.  An example of how successful we are in working with the European Union is the announcement by Apple to invest &euro;850 million in Athenry.  From speaking to people in Britain, I know that they are not conscious of the benefits in being a member of the European Union.  They are not aware of all the contributions that have been made.  The Republic of Ireland should make a case to the people of Britain on the benefits of EU membership.  I would have no hesitation in travelling to Britain to canvass the Diaspora and warn of the dangers of a "Yes" vote in a referendum.  It would be in order to do his.  We would not be interfering in the affairs of Britain; we would be working together toward a united Europe in that regard.  </p> <p>  The uncertainty caused by the announcement by the British Prime Minister is not doing Britain any good as far as inward investment is concerned.  It raises a doubt about the continuation of the United Kingdom in the European Union.  This destabilises negotiations on inward investment, which is unfortunate.  We will await the outcome of the general election.  I am not putting questions to the delegates, but I hope that in sharing my experience we are opening dialogue on the issue.  We do not have the answers.</p></speech>

Obviously, a large number of issues have been raised and I will try to touch on a few of them.  </p> <p>  Deputy Joe O'Reilly stated it would be a big blow if the United Kingdom was to vote to leave the European Union, a view with which I concur.  I am perhaps less pessimistic about the certainty of a referendum being held than Mr. Halligan.  It is more than likely there will be a referendum.  If there is a referendum, the result is likely to be a vote in favour of continuation as a member of the European Union.  I say this because once one has a big open debate with discussions up and down the country, as happened in the 1970s, the unattractiveness of being outside the European Unino, particularly in the context of trade, will be brought home to people.</p><p>Public opinion is in an interesting state as far as the European Union is concerned.  It has been very negative towards the European Union for a while, but recently the movement has been somewhat more in favour of staying in the Union.  </p><p> One has to look behind the headline figures on public opinion.  For example, in my old parliamentary constituency there was a difference in view between people who because of their employment were more familiar with the European Union and others.  There were many in the constituency who worked in the very successful Nissan car plant in the north east of England.  No matter what job they held in the firm, they were very much aware that Nissan was in the United Kingdom in order to have access to the European market.  In the course of their daily work most of them were dealing in euro rather than pounds.  There would be a different debate if the publicity considered regions where there were industries which thrived because the United Kingdom was in the European Union Single Market, including supplier industries and the overall employment linked with these industries.  Having been Europe Minister, I remember vividly that, although the newspapers were full of horror stories about the European Union, I received almost no letters from my constituents about it.  On the whole, they raised matters to do with health, employment, education and so on.  In terms of public opinion, we need to think deeply about this.</p><p> The transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP, was mentioned in the context of whether, if the United Kingdom was outside the European Union, it would try to have an independent deal with the United States.  It is possible that it would, although it seems that, even though we have a close relationship with the United States, it is much more difficult to argue from a position of strength if one is not part of the European Union Single Market.</p><p> In respect of alternatives that might be raised in a public debate, some people in the United Kingdom look enviously at Norway, but its economy and size are very different from those of the United Kingdom.  It is a striking fact that Norway is the tenth largest contributor to the EU budget because in order to have access to the Single Market, it must pay quite a substantial fee and it is also bound by EU trade rules without having a seat at the table and being able to negotiate the rules.  When these issues become public knowledge more than they are now, it will influence the debate.</p><p> Mr. Halligan and members of the committee have mentioned that the European Union has grown significantly.  I agree, although it has grown in certain ways that were not foreseeable at the time such as the measures on the environment which were not thought of in the early days because the environment and climate change were not such big issues at the time.  </p><p> In terms of there being an ever closer union, the record is mixed, partly because of the very welcome enlargement of the European Union and it is quite hard to enlarge and deepen at exactly the same time.  Mr. Halligan and I are old enough to remember when Economic and Monetary Union was designed to come into effect by 1980.  It did not and there are many provisions in the Treaty of Rome about harmonisation of taxation which have never come about.  We have to see the reality and clarify in the context of the debate in the United Kingdom that it is a democratic structure, that there is no inevitability that certain things will be created.  Therefore, we should not be too alarmed or frightened about rushing helter-skelter into an overarching European government which would tell us all what to do every minute of the day.  That is not justified by its history.</p><p> Senator Terry Leyden said something about archives and the debate which took place in the past.  Reading some of the records is a salutary experience.  In Britain people tend to say we only joined a free trade area and that now we are lumbered with unpleasant changes.  In fact, we had been, with Ireland, part of the European free trade area and at the time the debate was about the contrast between a free trade area and the European Economic Community as it then known.  It may make me sound like a rather sad nerd, but before I came here, I read some of the debates that had taken place in the House of Commons in the 1970s before the referendum was held and they were not just about a free trade area, they were about a great deal more than this, including worries about the loss of sovereignty, agriculture and fisheries policy and so on.  People need to be reminded that these things did take place and I hope we can learn from the archives and the information mentioned.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-05a.509" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Halligan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015030500002#F00200"><p>It is a great pleasure to be sitting beside Baroness Joyce Quin again in a parliament building.  We were both members of the socialist group which at the time was the largest in the European Parliament.  We were present in the chamber in Strasbourg when President Mitterand made his famous speech in April 1984 which effectively relaunched the European movement and led to the creation of the Single European Act.  Senator Terry Leyden has said the Act was brought about on foot of publication of the famous Cockfield White Paper which contained, I think, over 330 proposals for various directives to create a single market.  He was British and had been appointed by Mrs. Thatcher.  The Single Market is most assuredly the creation of the United Kingdom, about which Jacques Delors was always very clear.  Senator Terry Leyden&rsquo;s point that the Conservative Party, in particular, should be reminded of its own history is very important and one it should celebrate.  In the most recent conversations with senior figures in the Conservative Party the exact opposite is the case.  Unfortunately, the reputations of Mr. Macmillan and Mr. Heath have suffered a great deal as a consequence of their having initiated the process of joining.</p> <p>  Psychologically, I am not too happy about what is going on in the United Kingdom.  The Baroness called herself a &ldquo;sad nerd&rdquo;.  I join her by saying that in preparation for this meeting I re-read parts of the memoirs of Jean Monnet, probably the political autobiography of all time which I read frequently.  The section I read last night was a page and a half in which he analysed the British psyche.  It is very well worthwhile reading it.  It was written over 30 years ago and deals with the psychology of Britain's history and the special role it has conceived for itself.  He was always quite relaxed about how to approach the United Kingdom.  He said eventually it would follow the facts but that the facts had to be created.  I am not so sanguine.  </p> <p>  For Deputy Joe O'Reilly when he reads the report on this debate, I could not overemphasise the significance of the point about culture.  When we go to lists to read something particular about the movement of this or that or the size of something in the context of the trade relationship, it is completely missing the point.</p><p>The second book, <i>Blair's Britain, England's Europe</i>, says that the problem for the United Kingdom and Europe is England's problem; it is not the Scottish problem or the Welsh problem or clearly, not Northern Ireland's problem.  It is an English problem and for that we require to understand the psyche, the psychology of England and in particular, of English politics.  There are not too many people better attuned and equipped to do that than the Irish, for all sorts of reasons.  The answer to the question about what we should be doing to bring about a resolution of this dilemma, is that we should be both explaining to our friends in the United Kingdom what we think the rest of Europe is looking for of them or is prepared to give them, and we should also be speaking to the rest of Europe about what the UK is looking for.  We should act as an interlocutor, an interpreter, going both ways.  That means we have to be very careful about ourselves.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Deputy O'Reilly raised the point about the Border.  At my age I can think back to when the Border actually existed and when one had to physically go through it.  I remember visiting Belfast for the first time as a teenager in the 1950s.  I do not think any of us wants to get back to that time because what would happen would be that the physical border would be reimposed for a start.  That would mean no free movement of people or, indeed, of animals, except those that can be moved across the Border in ways which are not completely legal.  There would be a new fiscal border.  All the customs formalities would be reinstated at a huge cost.  There would be a breakdown of the joint island economy which has emerged and it would be again separated into two economies.  Supply chains would be broken.  It would be catastrophic.<br/><br/>I note with interest that Deputy O' Reilly used the expression that the clock would be turned back, which is actually the term used in our report.  I am afraid that turning it back would lead to a situation where the two communities in the North of Ireland would neither communicate nor co-operate with each other.  The fragility of the Northern Ireland solution is one of which we should be very conscious.  I completely agree with Deputy O'Reilly's point that in circumstances where Britain were to withdraw, the whole context for Anglo-Irish relations would be profoundly changed and brought back to what it was before 1973.  We are now in a win-win situation, we are both on the same team and we are trying to work out solutions in common.  We often take the same point as Deputy O'Reilly made.<br/><br/>Our bilateral relations are influenced by multilateral relations.  I am old enough to remember what it was like dealing with London before we were part of the European Union, especially in the 1960s.  I can only tell members that it was not always a happy relationship.  As a young general secretary trying to establish for the first time a working relationship with my dear comrades in the British Labour Party, we were not always warmly received.  Joyce Quin, Baroness Quin, was one of those who warmly received us but it was hard going.  We were reminded from time to time just how small we were in relation to our partner.  It was not a very happy history.<br/><br/>The biggest loss would be in the area of Anglo-Irish relations.  For that reason, we have got to do something daring and imaginative to make sure it does not happen.  That calls for a special role for Ireland inside the European Council because it will be inside the European Council room, presided over by Donald Tusk, that the solutions will be worked out.  The key person is the Taoiseach of the day, as well as in the General Affairs Council, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  We need to have a very clear idea of selling to other member states that we must do a special deal with the United Kingdom that does not apply to anyone else.  We will all have to swallow it because the alternative is so awful.<br/><br/>Deputy O'Reilly and others asked whether this does not create a precedent.  That is the danger because without question it does and we will have to deal with that question.  What is termed Euroscepticism had better be renamed and I hope the Chairman will be very clear about terminology.  What is called Euroscepticism is really nationalism.  It is the rise of nationalism in a virulent form in many of the member states which we had succeeded in eliminating until very recently.  What we are really battling is the rise of nationalism in the United Kingdom which is English nationalism.  It is not very attractive in some of its formats.  We need to explain to our continental colleagues that there is profound danger within England, in particular, which we will need to help both the Conservative Party and the British Labour Party in overcoming.<br/><br/>I thank members for their questions and for their interest.  Like Gay Byrne on the &quot;Late Late Show&quot;, all I can say in respect of the book is that there will be a copy for everyone in the audience.  Members can have a soft copy almost immediately and the hard copy will be available within two weeks.  If members want to know anything further about the book they should ask the editor, Paul Gillespie.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State to the meeting.  The committee has been holding a series of meetings on the possibility of so-called, BrExit, the possible exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union.  The committee visited London last Monday and Tuesday when we met with the Minister of State's counterpart, Mr. Lidington and a number of MPs and Members of the House of Lords.  We met members of the Irish community at an event hosted by the Irish ambassador, Mr. Mulhall.</p> <p>  I invite the Minister of State to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

At the outset, I wish to compliment the committee on its work in this area.  Committee members visited the UK last week undertaking an extensive programme of engagements.  Yesterday, I had a conversation about that with Senator Leyden and also, in the past 20 minutes, with Senator Hayden.  I look forward to seeing the committee's report, including the transcript of today's proceedings.  I acknowledge the presence of members of the diplomatic corps at this meeting.</p> <p>  The UK&rsquo;s relationship with the EU is undoubtedly a subject of significant importance, as is the UK's relationship with Ireland.  Irrespective of our party affiliation, we all recognise that the UK&rsquo;s continued membership of the Union is very important in the context of our own country&rsquo;s continued economic, political and social well-being.  So it is heartening that we are all working together to identify the issues that arise and safeguard the interests of our own country and people.  The committee's hearings in recent weeks have made a significant contribution to this process and I appreciate the hard work that has been done so far and which continues to be undertaken.</p> <p>  Given what the committee has already accomplished, my intention today is not to repeat what members have heard in previous weeks.  Instead, I will focus on the Government&rsquo;s approach to the EU-UK question.  I am conscious that we have much to learn from this committee.  I have already referred to the engagement that a delegation from the committee had in London earlier this week, which was an important part of the process.</p> <p>  I want to start by addressing a seemingly trivial point but an important one nonetheless.  We are here to officially consider the United Kingdom's possible exit from the European Union.  On the face of it there is nothing wrong with this, but I would much prefer if the agenda read: &ldquo;United Kingdom: Keeping Britain in the European Union&rdquo;.  That is because our focus, across our political system and across Ireland, needs to be on keeping the UK in the Union, rather than preparing for the consequences of its departure.</p> <p>  That is not to say we cannot do both at the same time - we can - but Ireland should be sending strong, positive messages about the benefits of continued British membership of the EU, especially, to be blunt, in terms of the relationship between our two islands.  That is how we can best make a constructive contribution to the debate in Britain.  It helps us to avoid lending weight to the negative notion that a UK withdrawal from the EU is somehow inevitable.  That is something which I, for one, certainly do not accept.</p> <p>  What is the Government&rsquo;s fundamental approach to the EU-UK question?  The first point to make is this: British membership of the EU is absolutely in Ireland&rsquo;s best interests.  That conviction underpins the messaging, the diplomacy and the strategy when it comes to addressing this question.  Everything we do is predicated on the belief that we want the UK to remain in the Union.  This committee has already heard evidence in recent weeks as to why this is the case.  Instead of repeating much of that, I will briefly outline four key ways in which we benefit from our joint membership of the European Union.</p> <p>  The first is our economy.  The UK is our biggest trading partner, by far, with which we trade over &euro;1 billion worth of goods and services every week.  The publication in 2013 of the results of the joint UK-Ireland economic study &ndash; the genesis of which is to be found in the March 2012 joint statement of the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister &ndash; set out clearly the nature and depth of that economic relationship.  For example, the UK is the destination for 16% of Irish industrial exports and is also the largest recipient of service exports with an 18.5% share.  Nearly 200,000 Irish jobs, representing 10% of total Irish employment, depend on that close economic relationship which, in itself, is partly dependent on the fact that our two economies operate under the common umbrella of the EU&rsquo;s single market.  No matter what the sector, be it agriculture, pharmaceuticals or financial services, Ireland benefits from working with the UK under the EU&rsquo;s common economic framework.  We therefore cannot afford the potential deep uncertainty that would inevitably result from a fundamental change in the EU-UK relationship, let alone the concrete difficulties which could arise.</p> <p>  The second factor is the strength of the wider British-Irish relationship.  Our shared membership of the EU has played a vital, if often underestimated, role in bringing our two countries closer together.  Working together, side by side, within the EU apparatus helps to forge bonds and cement ties between our political systems and administrations.  That relationship could not but suffer if we were no longer part of the same European club.</p> <p>  The third factor is Northern Ireland, where the EU has been a genuine force for good, something which is often overlooked.  It has helped to foster peace and reconciliation, and has provided a framework for co-operation, including between North and South, and between Unionists and Nationalists.  As a wider Union of which we are all members, the EU has silently but seamlessly buttressed the peace process.  That is something which should not be forgotten, notwithstanding the great contribution of other countries such as the United States.</p> <p>  The fourth factor is the fact that the UK is an important friend and ally within the EU, in many ways our most important friend and ally.  On account of our shared history, similar economic model and common-law legal systems, Ireland and the UK think similarly when it comes to a range of policy areas, such as trade, the digital single market, better regulation, and co-operation on police and justice matters.  We are therefore frequently allies when it comes to hammering out agreements at the Brussels negotiating tables and we often rely on each other&rsquo;s support. </p> <p>  A British exit from the EU would therefore be a serious blow to the protection and promotion of Ireland&rsquo;s interests within Europe and, thus, to our strategic position within the EU itself.  It is no wonder, therefore, that we feel so strongly about the merits of British membership.  The stakes are so high that we need to take a proactive, determined and consistent public approach on this.  That is exactly what the Government has been doing and continues to do.</p> <p>  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, outlined our concerns and why the debate matters so much to Ireland in a major speech to the European Council on Foreign Relations in London last November.  The Taoiseach has reinforced these points on several occasions, most recently to Irish ambassadors in Dublin Castle.  Other Ministers have outlined our views too, including last Friday when the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, spoke about the importance of the EU for our relations with the UK, at an event organised by the British-Irish Chamber of Commerce.</p> <p>  Despite the often loud exchanges that characterise discussions on this question across Europe, we know that our messages are reaching our European partners.  However, our diplomatic campaign on this extends to far more than set-piece speeches.  As virtually ever Minister will attest, the EU-UK relationship figures prominently and regularly in bilateral discussions with our international counterparts, whether EU or non-EU.  While we are never slow to raise it ourselves, because of our close strategic relationship with the UK, others often look to us as well for insights on the debate in Britain.  I can attest to that myself as, last week, I was in Riga and Helsinki where our opinion on the UK question is valued and frequently sought.</p> <p>  The most important partner, however, is the UK itself.  While ultimately the nature of its relationship with the EU is for those in the UK to decide, we try to ensure that they are fully aware of, and sensitive to, the concerns of their nearest neighbour.  To that end, we have already had a number of productive discussions, both at political and senior official level.  Most notably, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, had a substantive exchange in December in Dublin with the British Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond, MP, where they addressed the intricacies of the debate and the Irish dimension to it.</p><p>I have discussed the matter with my British counterpart, David Lidington, whom the committee met earlier this week, as well as the British ambassador to Ireland, Dominick Chilcott.  Of course, discussions will only get us so far.  That is why we have been examining what further steps we can take to help the UK to remain firmly within the Union.</p><p> As a starting point, which was highlighted in the D&aacute;il last week by the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, we are continuing to work closely with our British partners, as well as other similarly minded EU states, on those policy issues where we share the same interests.  The main British political parties have all made it clear that the achievement of common EU economic aims is a key goal and will help strengthen the case for UK's continued membership.  For Ireland, this means that we should seek to progress on matters such as the digital Single Market, the completion of trade negotiations with third countries, such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, and the move to a more streamlined approach to EU regulation.  These are all goals that we wish to achieve anyway, but now they have the added bonus of helping to anchor the United Kingdom within the Union.</p><p> The UK might also seek changes to the way in which the EU functions or operates.  In this respect much will depend on the outcome of the forthcoming British general election in May.  It is fair to say that nobody here today would be surprised if a British agenda for change in one guise or another is presented soon after the election.  While I do not wish to engage in needless speculation on hypothetical scenarios, the likelihood is that the outcome of any subsequent negotiations between the UK and the EU on this agenda could be material in determining whether our British friends remain in the Union.</p><p> For its part, Ireland will take a pragmatic approach when it comes to considering any such proposals.  We are always open, as we should be, to effecting sensible changes to the Union that could improve the way it works for the 500 million Europeans.  This is only normal.  We have a shared collective interest in getting the EU to function as efficiently and effectively as possible.  We also recognise, as the European Council has done, that the UK has some legitimate concerns that should not be ignored.  Ireland will be sympathetic and supportive when it comes to addressing those, especially because the UK remains our closest friend and ally in Europe.  This does not mean that we should write blank cheques; far from it.  True friendship requires both parties to be fully honest with each other, so if and when we believe a UK proposal would be unrealistic or damaging either to our national interests or to the broader functioning of the EU, we will be direct, candid and forthright in saying so.  For example, the Government has already made it clear that it considers freedom of movement to be a cornerstone of the European Union.  We therefore could not, and should not, support anything that would undermine or weaken it.  That is not to say that we would reject out of hand any reforms to this, British or otherwise.  We should always be prepared to consider proposals on their merits, so long as this fundamental principle is properly protected and respected.</p><p> I assure the committee that all of the areas I have outlined are the focus of ongoing reflection and analysis within the Government.  Government Departments are examining the matter on an ongoing basis, and our embassy in London is also very heavily engaged.  There is concerted and significant activity under way to ensure we best understand the issues at stake.  Ultimately the question of the UK's future in the European Union can only be resolved by the British people and their government.  I am fully respectful of this democratic reality, as I am sure the committee is also.  However, there is no question of us avoiding the debate.  We have far too much at stake for that.  Accordingly, we will continue to contribute to it as constructively as possible.</p><p> In conclusion, it has been a pleasure to speak today on this extremely important subject, which is obviously of particular importance to this committee.  I hope I have been able to add some value to the many distinguished speakers who have appeared before the committee before my attendance today.  It is essential that this committee, the Government and the Opposition continue to exchange views and ideas as the issue evolves.  I appreciate that I have gone a little over time, but I will be happy to take questions from the members.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy.  We met him in the Seanad yesterday when we had a brief discussion on the situation.  I concur fully with his speech and with his remarks about the support of the Government and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  He has outlined the correct approach, and we will stay with that script.  This committee is very conscious that it should not be seen to interfere in any way with the decision to be taken in the general election on 7 May, but beyond that we will have a respectful approach to what will happen.  We are preparing, and that is the key point.  We must plan ahead, be conscious of where we stand and try to alleviate the fears and concerns of the ordinary people in the UK at that point in time.  At present, however, what the Minister has outlined is an extremely good blueprint for where this Government, and any future Government, should stand.  We are very united as far as Europe is concerned.  Our approach is united regarding where our interests, that is, Ireland Inc., lie in Europe.  We are very close in what we do and I believe every Member of the Oireachtas would be of the same opinion.  I regret I must leave but I welcome and concur with everything in the Minister's statement.</p></speech>

It was very positive, as it should be and as we would have expected given the Minister's previous membership of this committee.</p> <p>  It is good to see the Government taking this stance.  Of course, there is no other stance to take.  I believe there is no other stance for Europe to take, but that matter will be decided by the British people.  In the discourse between the Irish and British Governments to what extent do we, and can we, encourage our parliamentary colleagues in the UK regarding the need to recognise the importance of membership of the Union for the UK, that is, the importance from its point of view, our point of view, the point of view of Northern Ireland and the point of view of Europe?  How well is that being received, and how well will it be received?</p> <p>  Also, to what degree can the Minister and his colleagues convince other European member states, which might have like-minded tendencies?  For example, we were told by a representative of a committee some time ago that a certain number of European governments tend to liaise with each other on the basis that they have a common theme, and that euroscepticism, anti-Europeanism or nationalism, whatever one wishes to call it, is growing.  To what extent do we liaise with Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands, all of which have shown some reticence in this area in recent times?  How convincing can we be?  Can we make serious impacts in terms of canvassing support from those countries within the European Union which might have a tendency to go elsewhere as well?</p> <p>  There are many Members of the European Parliament who are openly anti-European or eurosceptic.  What measures have been taken within the European Union by each member state to identify the reasons for the growth in euroscepticism?  There must be some reason for it, apart from the growth of nationalism which was referred to earlier.  There are consequences.  If we reach a situation where everybody is opposed to Europe, and the public representatives who are elected to the European Parliament show there is a huge degree of reticence towards the European project, that is bound to impact in a negative way.  That is the basis for my asking whether it has been found possible to address the issues that appear to cause the problem of anti-European sentiments.  There are different reasons in different countries.  However, just because it becomes fashionable to be anti-European, it does not necessarily mean it is right.  I will be interested to hear the Minister's response.</p><p>To what extent have we convinced our colleagues of the financial and economic cost to Europe, to Britain and to Ireland of a British exit from the EU?  That short and simple question pertains to something that resonates with most people eventually.  It is all right to fantasise about things of this nature.  It is all right to be jingoistic from time to time.  It sounds good.  It is great rhetoric and all that kind of stuff.  However, it is hugely important that we recognise the financial or economic implications of such an approach.</p><p> It is imperative that each EU member state recognise the importance of maintaining the European project.  Any deviation from the European visions, ideals and objectives that were set out by the founding fathers many years ago could have permanent and lasting consequences, perhaps not immediately, that would have a disastrous impact not just on the EU but on the entire continent of Europe.</p></speech>

It is very good that we have an opportunity to explore the Irish Government's perspective on this issue at a reasonably early stage in the process.  As the Minister of State said, there is no other country that would be as affected by a potential British exit as Ireland would be.  That is true for a number of reasons, not least of which is that we are a small open economy on the periphery of Europe.  Britain is also an island nation.  We have the same peripheral interests, to some extent.  Maybe the centre of power in Europe has shifted to further to the east than it was when we joined.  Apart from anything else, it is very important for us that Britain stay in the EU because it is a friend, colleague and ally, is also an English-speaking country, also comes from a common law tradition and shares many of the same interests as Ireland.  In that context, it is worth mentioning the common border, the North-South issue, trade, and all the other matters the Minister of State has mentioned.  Does the Irish Government want a referendum in the UK?  We know the political realities.  The Conservative Party has indicated that it will have a referendum.  The Labour Party has indicated that if there is any move towards a closer Europe, it will put a referendum to the British people.  Ultimately, there is a likelihood that there will be a referendum in the UK, regardless of whether this happens today, tomorrow, two years from now or four years from now.</p><p>I looked briefly at the paper submitted by Mr. Brendan Halligan.  I would like to pick up on an interesting comment he made.  I would have some sympathy with his view that Britain's half-in-half-out relationship with the EU over the last decade is not particularly helpful for the future of the EU.  It can be argued that it would not necessarily be any harm, in the wider European interest and potentially in our own interest, to draw a line under this.  That would enable all of us to move on with the European project, regardless of whether that project is moving towards a closer Union or perhaps towards a less close Union, as some of the proposed British reforms would be indicate.  I suppose that is my first question.  Does the Irish Government have a view on whether we want this matter to be concluded by means of referendum?  If we want it to be concluded in that way, do we want it to be concluded sooner or later?  Is there a cost associated with all of this indecision over a period of time?  If so, is it a cost to the UK and not necessarily to us?  Do we have a particular view on this?</p><p>We are all aware that there is a shopping list in terms of the UK renegotiation.  The Minister of State mentioned some of the items on that list.  Could he expand on his understanding of what the items on that shopping list are?  He indicated that we would be prepared to assist the UK with certain matters on its agenda, but perhaps not with others.  He suggested that we might not have much sympathy with the UK's freedom of movement concerns, for example.  I suggest that those concerns relate not to freedom of movement <i>per se</i>but to some people's freedom of movement for the purposes of welfare tourism.  I refer to the idea of people being entitled to benefits in the UK without ever having worked in that country or earned social protection stamps or other benefits there.  Could the Minister of State outline what he understands the shopping list to be?  Which items on that list do we have sympathy with?  Which items do we have no sympathy with?  If the Minister of State answers by saying it is a developing concept I will understand, but it would be good if he could give any indication in this regard.</p><p>I would like to ask the Minister of State about our position on any renegotiation of the UK's membership of the EU.  Clearly, much of the work on any renegotiation will be done in advance of any potential UK exit, if that is what happens.  Does the Minister of State genuinely think there is any real recognition among our European colleagues of our particular interest in this?  It does not seem to me, on the basis of some of this committee's discussions in the UK, that there is an understanding at this early stage of the debate of the real impact this would have on Ireland as a nation.  I know we are small beans in terms of the UK's overall consideration.  In the Minister of State's opinion, how much understanding of Ireland's position exists at this point, not only within the UK but within the wider EU?  Is there an appreciation of how important it would be to us if the UK were to leave the EU?  Is it understood that we would need special consideration?  It concerns me that there seems to be a view abroad that we will go back to business as it was before by negotiating a free trade agreement with the UK.  It is being suggested that we will have our own special little arrangement.  There does not seem to be a wider understanding that we cannot do that.  It is no longer open to us because any arrangement with the UK would have to be made via the EU bloc of countries.  How hopeful is the Minister of State that there would be an understanding of our position in such circumstances, and that a special accommodation could be reached?  I apologise for asking so many questions.</p></speech>

When we were in London at the weekend, we met a wide variety of MPs from both sides of the House of Commons.  They touched on a number of issues that were of concern to them or to other people in their parties.  They spoke about issues such as loss of sovereignty, immigration and free movement.  The question of bureaucracy within the EU was raised in relation to procurement.  Red tape is a concern.  Like Senator Hayden, I would like to know whether these issues are being raised in any way by the Minister of State's counterparts.  Mr. Brendan Halligan spoke earlier about the need to be daring and imaginative to stop the UK leaving.  Perhaps the Minister of State might like to comment on the roles he feels the Council of the European Union and the General Affairs Council might have in this regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-05a.522" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/985" speakername="Dara Murphy" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015030500002#K00400"><p>I thank the Chairman.  I have been asked some very extensive questions.  I will respond to the question asked by the Vice Chairman and Senator Hayden before I come back to Deputy Durkan's question.  Ireland and many other European countries would agree with elements of what the British Government has been discussing.  We share its frustration with regard to issues such as better regulation, proper completion of the single market for services and the digital single market, the turbo-charging of measures such as the Juncker package, which we are now seeing, and trade agreements.  This ties into the question of how we can support Britain's ongoing membership of the EU.  We concur with much of what they say.  Perhaps we do not feel it is a sustainable method of negotiating national positions.</p><p>At the same time, reference was made by Senator Hayden to the fact that we have had a period in which euroscepticism or even Europe in general has been a matter of debate within the United Kingdom.  It is interesting to see polling and commentary to the effect that there is still strong public support within the United Kingdom for ongoing membership.  It is having a debate unique to the United Kingdom and it is for those people to engage on it.  As to the question of how we can influence the debate, I am not sure we can.  The Senator was correct in saying we would be more affected if events concluded in a certain manner, but the country that would be affected most is the United Kingdom itself.  Such events would have an impact for all the European Union.  There would be an impact for Ireland, but there is potential for it to affect everybody.  We are still in a very hypothetical position.  It is likely that there will be a referendum at some time in the future, but it is far too early to speculate on the question that may be asked and its context.  We must be aware of that.</p><p> Deputy Durkan mentioned common allies and themes.  It is very apparent that within the 28 member states there are different allies, depending on the issue.  Quite often we find ourselves on the same side as the UK, but that is not always the case.  That serves to indicate the very highly developed relationship we have as a community of 28 member states.  We can be most helpful not by engaging in the debate based on a selfish or economic interest; we should point out that Europe is much stronger by virtue of the fact that it has the United Kingdom, which is a big, democratic and powerful country, at the heart of decision-making.  That is not just in our national interest but in everybody's interest.  The United Kingdom is and always will be in Europe, as it is part of the geographical area of the planet that is Europe.  It is vital that it continue to play a very strong and pro-democratic role in engaging in politics across our continent, just as it has throughout modern European history.</p><p> If we consider how beneficial the European Union and the Single Market have been for everybody, it is fair to say that any weakening would have the potential to bring some economic cost, either through ourselves, through the United Kingdom or collectively.  The common European Union has been of benefit, so one would have to accept that there may be some economic difficulty if an exit came about.</p><p> The question of the origin of euroscepticism has been raised.  That has largely been based on the economic difficulties experienced across the European Union.  The European Union has taken the blame, even in our country, and perhaps unfairly at times.  There are parties to the left and right that do not even represent a cohesive group in the European Parliament.  The three biggest blocs are pro-European: the European People's Party, the Socialists and Democrats and the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.  Europe has collectively elected very significant numbers pro-European politicians to the Parliament.  It is a debate that will evolve.  I am not sure at this point what role any other member state can have in the democratic decision making of another member state.  We have had many referendums in our country, and other countries also like to have sovereign decisions.  The process in the UK will start in May's general election.</p><p> I have been fairly blunt today, as has the Taoiseach and others.  There was a question about the level to which other countries are aware of this.  At a political level, they are very aware of it.  Our view is being solicited.  There are 27 member states that would like to keep the European Union united, irrespective of the views they have about the difficulties the UK would have.</p></speech>

There is a very large Irish community there.  The ambassador gave a speech last week to the University of London.  It was a powerful speech that reiterated the views on Europe of the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister of State who is before us.  What role could we have in influencing those people?  Would that be considered after the election?</p></speech>

The European Union has had a general role in the peace process in a broad range of areas, including by providing financial and other supports.  The relationship between Ireland and the UK will continue to be strong.  We have issues that have been made far more straightforward by virtue of the fact that we are jointly within the European Union.  It is particularly in the interests of the Irish community in the UK and British citizens living here that we both remain in the EU, for a variety of what can sometimes be technical, bureaucratic and administrative reasons.  In remaining in the EU, we can engage repeatedly on so many different matters.  One can consider how American politics works, with the rotation of Democrats and Republicans on different issues.  Europe functions by consensus, and the process can be very slow and difficult.  Nevertheless, when decisions are agreed, they tend to be very robust, as countries may have had to give or agree a little.  Within that process, the United Kingdom has a very valuable and important role to play.  I very much look forward to the evolution of the process.  I believe the UK will remain where it belongs - at the heart of the European Union.</p></speech>

Historically, the cost of branded pharmaceuticals has been considerably higher in Ireland.  At various stages the European Union, the International Monetary Fund, the Economic and Social Research Institute and the Department of Health have publicly highlighted the cost issue in respect of Irish-patented and generic drugs relative to our European counterparts.  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 was introduced to address the comparatively high price of drugs by introducing reference pricing and the better labelling of generic substitutions.</p> <p>  The purpose of today&rsquo;s hearings is to examine the cost of pharmaceutical drugs, the effectiveness of reference pricing and generic substitution.  The joint committee will hold two sessions to hear evidence from a range of stakeholders representing both branded and generic pharmaceuticals, the Irish Pharmacy Union, alternative pharmaceutical suppliers and others.  The committee has received communications from one pharmaceutical company which has refused to attend the committee.  Separately, the committee will receive a briefing from the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive.  The committee intends to prepare a report examining the effectiveness of the initiatives taken in this area, with reviewing the testimony of delegates, before it makes recommendations to the Oireachtas and the Minister for Health.</p> <p>  I welcome from the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association Dr. Leisha Daly, president, and Mr. Oliver O&rsquo;Connor, chief executive; from the Irish Pharmacy Union Ms Kathy Maher, president, and Mr. Darragh O&rsquo; Loughlin, secretary general; from Teva Pharmaceuticals Ireland Ms Sandra Gannon, general manager, and Ms Aideen Kenny, head of commercial operations.</p><p>They are all welcome and I thank them for attending.  I remind them that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> I ask the delegates to keep their contributions to seven minutes.

I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Darragh O'Loughlin, who is general secretary of the IPU.  The IPU which has more than 2,200 members is the professional representative and leadership body for community pharmacists in Ireland.  Our members are committed to delivering a quality, an accessible, a personal and professional pharmacy service, putting patients first and which has as its primary goal the optimisation of the health and well-being of society.</p> <p>  I thank the Chairman and committee members for inviting us.  The joint committee, justifiably, wishes to understand the key drivers of the State's medicines bill and also wants be assured that the health service is achieving value for the money it spends on medicines.</p> <p>  I must point out that pharmacists do not have a role in the setting of the reimbursement price for medicines.  The formula for this price-setting process involves the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive, HSE, on the one hand, and the manufacturers of the medicines, on the other.  However, I want to clarify the dynamics of medicines pricing and supply in the State.  In economic terms, pharmacists are price-takers, not price-makers.</p> <p>  Medicine prices have fallen dramatically in recent years and continue to fall.  The ESRI report entitled, Pharmaceutical Prices, Prescribing Practices and Usage of Generics, published in June 2013, observed that price reductions in the order of 30% per item had been achieved between 2009 and 2013.  The average GMS price per item reimbursed by the HSE in 2013 was around the level seen in 2001 and 2002.  The introduction of generic substitution and reference pricing have since further substantially reduced medicine prices, with the price of some medicines falling by 85% in the past 12 months.  The chief pharmacist of the HSE went on record last summer to say Ireland was no longer paying above the European Union average for medicines.  The reference pricing process has seen a much more significant drop since that statement was made.  It is worth noting that not only is the State benefiting from these price reductions but that in very challenging economic times pharmacists are passing on the reductions to their customers and patients who are seeing the effect at the pharmacy counter in that the cost of filling their prescriptions has fallen and is continuing to fall.</p> <p>  Our research suggests that, on average, 80% or four out of every five medicines are dispensed under the State's drugs schemes, including the GMS or medical card scheme, the drugs payment scheme, DPS, and the long-term illness scheme, LTI, all of which are funded by the HSE at rates set by the Minister for Health.  The fees paid to pharmacists have been cut repeatedly in the past few years.</p> <p>  I will briefly outline the payment system for pharmacists.  For all State-funded medicines supplied to patients, or 80% of medicines dispensed, pharmacists are paid the ingredient cost, without a mark-up, plus a regressive flat fee.  Regulations made in July 2009 under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, Act saw the reimbursement price of medicines reduced from 100% to 91.8% of invoice price.  At the same time, under the FEMPI Act, the mark-up was cut from 50% under the drugs payment and the long-term illness schemes to 20%.  In July 2013 further regulations made under the same Act saw the mark-up eliminated, leaving pharmacists entirely reliant on the dispensing fee.  For the record, the GMS scheme has never attracted a mark-up.</p> <p>  The reimbursement model is dependent on the ability of pharmacists to negotiate terms with their suppliers to subsidise payments from the Government.  However, in many cases, this is not always possible and, in some cases, pharmacists are finding themselves dispensing at a loss.  This phenomenon is becoming increasingly frequent.  To ensure patients have timely access to vital medicines, pharmacists are regularly paying wholesalers more than what the HSE will reimburse.  As a result of a recent policy price change by one of the two remaining wholesalers, they now charge pharmacists 9% above the reimbursement price on the first &euro;2,000 of their monthly orders.  Effectively, this means that each pharmacy is subsidising the HSE to the tune of approximately &euro;2,000 per year.  It is estimated that since 2009 there has been a minimum of &euro;314 million in savings to the State in pharmacy fees.  In that period a further &euro;1.42 billion in savings has been realised by the State in reduced payments for medicines.  This has affected all stakeholders across the medicine supply chain - pharmacists, wholesalers and manufacturers.</p> <p>  As pharmacists&rsquo; fees are unrelated to the cost of medicines, we have no interest in seeing high prices maintained.  However, a cautious approach needs to be taken.  There is evidence to suggest that, as medicine prices reduce, medicine shortages increase.  This is a basic economic fact.  This is a small market in a global context and if it is more advantageous for certain suppliers to export out of Ireland to other EU markets where prices are higher, they will do so.  We have seen Irish patients bear the brunt of this.  IPU research conducted in August 2014 confirmed that there was a significant level of medicine shortages, with 99% of pharmacists confirming they had seen medicine shortages in the previous 12 months.  More than half of those pharmacists believed their patients' health or lives had been put at risk by medicine shortages.  As such, we believe a mechanism for price modulation needs to be found to balance the legitimate desire of the HSE to achieve lower prices against the need to ensure continuity of supply for Irish patients.</p> <p>  The objective of any review of expenditure on medicines must be to maximise value for money and ensure the best possible health outcomes for patients.  While price is part of the equation, it is essential that patients receive their medicines at the right time and take them correctly.  We know that the most expensive medicines are not taken at all or taken incorrectly.  Pharmacists have an important role to play in this process and there is considerable scope to develop the services delivered by community pharmacists through a more comprehensive, organised and funded service.  </p> <p>  Switching more medicines from prescription-only to non-prescription status empowers patients to take better care of their health, with the advice and support of their pharmacist.  This allows them speedier access to appropriate treatment, saving the time and cost of a GP visit.  It also saves the State the cost of the medicine and frees up valuable GP time to deal with more complex cases.  In addition, strong evidence from the United Kingdom demonstrates that introducing a new medicines service allows patients with chronic conditions to obtain greater benefit from their medicines by identifying problems early and improving adherence to medicines taking through an initial consultation with the pharmacy on dispensing the medicine but with a structured follow-up consultation with their pharmacist.  Patients who had presented for new medicines service consultations were shown to be more likely to be still taking their medicine or have sought help from their prescriber compared to patients who had not received the service.  Economic modelling showed that this service could increase a patient&rsquo;s length and quality of life, while costing the health service less, when compared to patients who did not receive the service.</p> <p>  The cost of most medicines is falling and will continue to fall in the next few years.  As a result, the public, patients and the Exchequer will continue to see considerable savings on their medicines bills.  It is appropriate that the committee should seek to ensure prudent use of resources and secure maximum value for the heath budget.  It must be recognised, however, that, even as medicine prices continue to fall, there will always be upward pressure on the State as a result of the increase in the number of eligible patients and greater use of exceptionally high cost innovative and biological medicines.  In addition, pharmacists are justifiably concerned that constantly falling prices can, in some cases, worsen existing medicine shortages, with a consequential negative impact on their patients&rsquo; treatment.</p><p>Optimising resources and patient care is fundamental to an efficient and effective health care system.  Years of short-sighted cuts in pharmacy payments have undermined the profession&rsquo;s capacity to deliver the badly needed pharmacy-based services which have been shown around the globe to improve patient health outcomes while reducing spending on health care.  It is time for the Government to engage with us on a positive agenda for change, to deliver convenient, accessible and cost-effective health care through a currently under-resourced and under-utilised pharmacy profession.  I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for their attention.  We welcome any questions from members.</p></speech>

We support health and growth.  Nine of the top ten pharmaceutical companies in the world have a significant manufacturing presence in Ireland.  The industry here employs about 25,000 people in highly skilled jobs.  A further 25,000 people are employed indirectly by our industry. </p> <p>  IPHA companies are research-based.  Our companies develop innovative medicines supplied first under patent protection.  Other pharmaceutical companies can make medicines when they go off-patent.  These are so-called generic medicines.  It is a very different business from ours.  Their representative association, APMI, will meet the committee later today.  Their business does not involve the high risk and massive investment required to develop new medicines.</p> <p>  Pharmaceuticals, like other innovations, are granted a 20-year patent life.  However, on average, the research and development phase and supply process can take up to 12 of those 20 years.  Reimbursement under patent protection may only be for eight years.  The cost of bringing a new medicine to patients is around &euro;1.4 billion euro.  It is a complex process.  For example, an older molecule like aspirin contains 21 atoms whereas the newer molecules currently available for treating cancer can contain up to 25,000 atoms.  It has been compared to the difference between a bicycle and jet.  Those jets are being manufactured and used in Ireland.</p> <p>  We seek to get the right medicines to Irish patients as quickly as possible.  Last year, we brought at least 29 new medicines to Ireland which have the potential to benefit 700,000 patients.  These medicines treat a variety of diseases, including Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, diabetes, cancer, hepatitis C, asthma, schizophrenia and other conditions.  Access to new drugs for all patients is a key part of our agreement with the Department of Health.  Our members also support at least 65 different patients&rsquo; organisations with important information on how to use these medicines properly.</p> <p>  Our economic impact in Ireland is not just in jobs created, taxes paid, investments made and research funded, year after year.  It is not confined to the &euro;1.2 billion in savings we have contributed over the past eight years.  It is mostly in the value of helping people getting back to work, enjoying a better quality of life, contributing to communities and living longer, healthier and more productive lives.  This is the value of public spending on health and on medicines in particular.  We have contributed to significant improvements in Ireland in life expectancy, in cancer survival and in cardiovascular disease.  Clot-dissolving drugs have saved many stroke victims from permanent disability or death.  New cancer medicines have made many cancers treatable and survivable.  HIV-AIDS has been converted from a terminal illness to a manageable condition.  Hepatitis C is now curable.  Rheumatoid arthritis no longer means lifelong crippling pain.  Life has been extended greatly for many people with cystic fibrosis.</p> <p>  The value of medicines for people is beyond an accounting calculation.  It is certainly well beyond the &euro;750 million the HSE spends on patent-protected and unique medicines in the community drugs schemes.</p> <p>  Our association negotiates and implements a supply and pricing agreement with the Department of Health and HSE.  Having an agreement helps the State and the HSE.  It means predictability and consistency in pricing and supply.  It involves a detailed test of value for money before any new medicine is paid for.  It tackles the risk of medicines meant for Irish people being sold to higher-priced countries.  Under the current agreement, which started in November 2012, Irish prices were set at the average of prices in nine other EU members states.  These countries reflect income levels similar to Ireland.  Most other EU member states use similar mechanisms for pricing medicines.  Competition law prevents our association from making individual pricing or other commercial decisions for members.  However, the agreement means that when a member company proposes a new medicine to the HSE, it must offer it at a price which is at, or lower than, the average of its price in the nine EU member states.</p> <p>  We have audited this process.  Last August, a third-party firm checked at how close to the average our prices were on that date.  The study showed that prices for patent-protected medicines were within 1.8% of the average of the nine countries.  Prices in Ireland are neither the highest nor the lowest in Europe.  Our member companies see agreed pricing and supply as an essential part of a stable investment and business environment in Ireland.  The results of our agreements are good for taxpayers and the health services.  Prices are falling, as the Minister has confirmed on a number of occasions, most recently last week.  The average price per item in the HSE community drugs scheme has fallen every year since 2009.  The Minister confirmed last week that the average cost per item is now running at 2001-02 levels.  At the same time, the number of items prescribed for Irish patients has risen by 73%.  These price cuts have made some room available to fund new medicines.  However, I must caution that we cannot rely on savings alone from off-patent medicines or price cuts to fund the promising new medicines for patients in the coming years.</p> <p>  It is now time to turn to a successor agreement.  The current agreement ends this October.  We are prepared for detailed discussions on all aspects of a new agreement.  Working by agreement between the State and industry is the best way to ensure patients get access to new and existing medicines as quickly as possible.  Prices are falling and significant savings have been made  Medicines deliver enormous benefits to people, which is a key part of the value of public spending on health and medicines.  The challenge we share in Ireland and globally is to bring health science and promising new medicines to people effectively and efficiently.  We need to share the benefits throughout our society, ensuring access to medicines and health care for all Irish patients.</p></speech>

I am joined today by my colleague, Aideen Kenny, head of commercial operations at Teva.  We thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss the cost of prescription medicines in Ireland.  I will give a brief overview of Teva Pharmaceuticals Ireland.  Teva is a global pharmaceutical company operating in both the generic and the innovative specialty side of the market.  For the purpose of today's meeting, we will focus on the generic element of our business.</p> <p>  Teva employs more than 500 people in Ireland at two locations, in Waterford, which is the global respiratory hub of Teva Pharmaceuticals, and in Dundalk, where we have based a commercial operation.  Since 2014, Teva is the largest supplier of prescription medicines in Ireland, the first time a generic provider has occupied this position.  In real terms, this translates into almost 8 million packs of Teva medicines being distributed here each year.  Every four seconds a patient somewhere in Ireland takes a Teva medicine.</p><p>Our innovative and branded portfolio treats conditions such as respiratory disease, multiple sclerosis, cancer pain and a number of other conditions.  We feel we are well placed with both an innovative medicines franchise and a very strong generic medicines franchise to comment on the cost of prescription medicines.</p><p> In real terms we have seen considerable change in recent years.  The catalyst for this change was the decision of the State, the largest purchaser of medicines, to embrace meaningfully the savings that were to be had from switching to a positive and pro-generic medicines policy.  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 facilitated generic substitution at pharmacy level and benchmarked Irish prices of generic medicines against the wider European market in the form of reference pricing.</p><p> Teva actively supported these reforms, inputting actively into the legislative process.  In parallel, we undertook a national campaign called Understand Generics, which with the help of broadcaster, Gay Byrne, aimed to inform patients on the impact of the legislation as they presented their prescriptions in the pharmacy and also in order that they might better manage and pay for their health care costs.  We were one of the few pharmaceutical companies to take this approach.  At that time just 10% of the medicine volumes were supplied by generic companies, whereas in the United Kingdom the equivalent was 80% of medicines volumes supplied by generic companies.  The position now, a few short years later, is that 34% of the total Irish pharmaceutical market by volume is supplied by generic companies.  We have come a long way in a very short time.</p><p> We estimate that in 2014, which was first full year in operation of reference pricing and generic substitution, more than &euro;150 million of savings were achieved.  This advancement comes against the backdrop of broader developments.  Let us consider the work of Dr. Sara Burke, a health policy analyst in TCD, on the resilience project.  This project shows that between 2005 and 2013, the number of people covered by public health funded medicine schemes increased considerably, as did the number of medicines dispensed through the public health schemes.  At the same time, the cost of drugs under public health schemes has decreased and remains the same, despite the volume increases, as the 2009 level.  Total payments by the HSE, including professional fees and drug costs, remain below the 2009 level.  Credit is due to many, including many members in this room, for ensuring that Irish taxpayers and patients realised the financial and health benefits which were to be had by switching to a pro-generic policy.  Progress has been made.</p><p> However, it is my firm view that the reforms of recent years are ill-equipped to deal with the future demand for medicines.  We must approach this problem head-on with innovative thinking and collaborative solutions.  As recently as last week the ESRI published numbers which show that we are living longer but not healthier lives.  Life expectancy now stands at 81 years.  However, 50% of the population now have two or more chronic diseases.  Some 61% of all adults are overweight or obese.  The HSE has stated that within five years the incidence of chronic disease will increase by a further 40%.  The numbers with heart disease, the killer of the largest number of Irish people, will grow by another 31%.  Some 30,000 new patients will be diagnosed with cancer every year between now and 2020.  The Irish longitudinal study on ageing, TILDA, also confirms this fact that a "combination of population growth and ageing will increase demands for treatments by between a quarter and a third by 2026 if current approaches to treatment continue".  Patients are paying more out-of-pocket expenses.  The combination of the new prescription charge and the increasing threshold for the drugs payment scheme has shifted a greater proportion of the cost of medicines to patients.  These realities solidify the challenge that we all face.</p><p> We all agree that we need to find a sustainable means of meeting our ever increasing health care demands.  This is why the pace of reform and our approach to spending on medicine must change.  This year we estimate that Ireland will save &euro;95 million on prescription medicine costs as a result of reference pricing and generic substitution.  We in Teva estimate that we could almost double this saving by taking a broader approach.  We estimate that some &euro;113 per annum in additional savings can be made in four specific areas.  Some &euro;60 million could be saved by opening up generic competition in the low value and volume sector of the medicines market, which currently costs more than &euro;200 million each year.  Some &euro;25 million can be saved by instructing those who prescribe in our hospitals to switch from expensive  biological medicines to the more affordable, equally effective biosimilar medicines where available.  This is what all the benchmark countries we look to have been doing for years.  Despite this, some of the country's largest hospitals continue to forgo the savings available in their procurement processes.  A further &euro;15 million could be saved by allowing pharmacists to dispense more affordable generic medicines to those patients who are presenting for the first time and whose prescription medicines may be included on the non-interchangeable list.  We are not asking that existing patients switch medicines, but we are asking that those who are starting out on medication can start on a cost-effective generic alternative.  We estimate a further &euro;18 million in savings can be achieved by incentivising cost-effective prescribing for non-interchangeable medicines such as inhaler devices, which currently cost the State more than &euro;72 million a year.</p></speech>

Let me give members an example of those price cuts.  It is proposed that the cost of a month's supply of the 10 mg pack of Atorvastain under the new proposed reference price is &euro;2.52.  If this is to be the case, let me outline the financial scenario that will unfold.  The State will recoup &euro;2.50 from the patient in the form of the prescription charges, the manufacturer of the drug will earn &euro;2.52, from which the manufacturer will have to pay for the manufacturing of the medicine and packing it in a unique Irish packet.  It will also have to pay for the transportation of that product to the Irish market and pay the wholesaler to control the drug and distribute it across the Twenty-six Counties.  The manufacturer will have to pay the Health Products Regulatory Authority the annual maintenance fees and licence fees and also the fees to maintain pharmacovigilance for the product in the marketplace, and all of that for a cost of &euro;2.52.  In effect, it means the State will recoup almost 100% of the cost of the medicines and those companies who meet the reference price, who need to manufacture, transport and comply with quality and regulatory requirements, carry all the risk and are not able to make a return on that level of pricing.  I wish it were otherwise but this approach is simply not sustainable.</p> <p>  The challenge for all of us, Government, the pharmaceutical industry and retail pharmacy, is meeting patients' needs sustainably.  We know that 2015 is a major year for all of those involved.  The decision-makers in the negotiations have important choices to make.  We urge them and the members of the committee to intensify reforms and grasp the opportunities on offer.  We take a balanced view of the future.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-05a.544" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/983" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015030500002#F00200"><p>I welcome the witnesses.  This is an issue that causes much concern.  Legislation has been brought through the Houses of the Oireachtas in recent years to try to address the cost of medicines to the taxpayer.  Clearly, our obligation is to ensure we get the balance right so that we have a vibrant market and we get value for the taxpayer.  We have a strong pharmaceutical base in this country, which is critically important to the broader development of the economy, but we cannot subsidise that by paying a great deal for patented medicines or even generics, which are very much to the fore and manufactured here.  We have a role to play to ensure there is openness, transparency, and a mechanism in place to ensure value for the patient and the taxpayer.</p><p>In the past there were sweetheart deals with companies.  The reason the pharmaceutical companies are here is that there was incentivisation above and beyond the traditional grant aid and supports for research and development, employment and so on.  That issue has always been left hanging in the air.  It has always been denied, and in a previous role I had as Minister of State with responsibility for trade, I denied it.  Nevertheless, it has consistently been raised, not only in the context of pharmaceuticals but also with reference to many other multinationals that locate here.</p><p>I wish to put a question to the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association.  Most of the companies that locate in Ireland are multinational companies, so obviously the Irish market is very small.  I assume they are not locating in Ringaskiddy, Little Island and other places because they want to supply the Irish market but because of other incentives - that fact that there is already a critical mass of pharmaceutical companies, our high-quality graduates, the taxation system, the infrastructure, and the link between the United States and Europe.  That is a given, but there is always a concern that we pay particularly high costs for medicines as a sort of a sweetener.  That has consistently been said, and I would like to hear the views of the witnesses on that issue.</p><p>Dr. Leisha Daly made two points in regard to agreement on supply and pricing.  Having an agreement helps the State and the HSE.  It results in predictability and consistency in pricing and supply, it involves a detailed test of value for money before any new medicine is paid for, and it deals with the risk that medicines meant for Irish people may be sold to higher-priced countries.  I assume there is a contractual arrangement in place between a company and the State in terms of the supply of medicines.  Therefore, how could there be leakage if there is a contractual arrangement in terms of medicines that are meant to be sold to the Irish market going to a higher priced market?  As that would be a breach of contract, I am wondering how that could happen.  It it happens, it should not happen.</p><p>In her presentation Dr. Leisha Daly said:<blockquote>Competition law prevents our association from making individual pricing or other commercial decisions for members.  However, the agreement means that, when a member company proposes a new medicine to the HSE, it must offer it at a price which is at, or lower than, the average of its price in the nine member states. </blockquote>I have two questions which I have asked in other areas before.  Who defines the nine countries in that basket?  Clearly, if there is limited supply going into that basket of nine countries, obviously there is an inflationary pressure on prices.  Is there potential to artificially inflate prices in those nine countries if supply is restricted to those nine countries?</p><p>I welcome all the employers in Cork.  However, we cannot have a view that they are here because we are paying higher costs for our medicines.  That is not a tenable position to hold, but it is certainly a tenable position terms of attracting attention among the broader public.Medicines must be purchased based on the merit of the medicine and not because of the number of people employed.</p><p>In regard to generics, the poor relation in the pharmaceutical industry, obviously great strides have been made in recent years.  How helpful has the legislation been in trying to tip the balance not in favour of generics but in favour of value for the taxpayer?  How receptive is Government, the HSE and the Department of Health to the witnesses' presentations from time to time in terms of reductions in the cost of medicines, and how it can make savings for taxpayers?  This issue will not go away.  </p><p>There is another major issue of concern.  Irish people are prone to travel far and wide and make comparisons in their own mind in regard to medicines that they can buy in M&aacute;laga or Marbella, or Puerto Ban&uacute;s, sometimes without prescription, although when they come back they must get it on prescription and it costs a great deal more.  Perhaps we could have an explanation as to why that is the case.  I know there are reasons for it.  I appreciate that we have a more restrictive prescription system here, but to a family going on holidays it does not make sense, given that we are all in the European Union.</p></speech>

I apologise on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, who cannot be present.</p> <p>  I am aware that some medications were said to be in low supply in Ireland, and it has been suggested that this was due to companies being able to get a better price in other countries.  Is this the case at present and, if so, what medications are in short supply and what is being done about that?  It was mentioned in the presentations that as the price of medicines gets lower there will be medicine shortages.  In Spain, Portugal and such places - one may be talking about different medications - the cost of many basic medicines is much lower.  I wonder why, if this is the case, there do not appear to be any shortages in the supply of those medications, which are often a tenth of the price that people pay in Ireland.</p> <p>  Ms Sandra Gannon mentioned savings of &euro;113 million and said she had met the HSE and the Department of Health.  That is a huge amount of money in the overall health budget.  Why have these proposals not been implemented if they are so straightforward?  Have the witnesses been given any explanation as to why they have not been implemented?</p> <p>  A recent report on Ireland suggested that up to 70% of medications by volume are now generic.  Maybe I picked that up wrong.  I think there was a reference in one of the presentations to 34%.  Perhaps the witnesses would explain that issue.</p> <p>  What savings have been made to date on the cost of medicines in the State, and how does that compare to other member states?  What progress has been made on reducing unnecessary prescribing under the general medical services, GMS, scheme?  Is a budget cap for pharmaceutical expenditure being considered?  How is the behaviour of prescribers monitored, and has progress been made since the commencement of the 2013 Act?  What is the current volume and value of generics in total pharmaceutical expenditure and how has this changed over time following the commencement of the 2013 Act?   It was stated that the prices of some medicines had fallen by 85% and that Ireland is no longer paying above the EU average.</p><p>That can only be a good thing.  It was also stated that some prices are falling and are now at 2001 or 2002 levels.  If they are now at 2001 or 2002 levels, the question of why they were so expensive in between arises.</p><p> In the second session this morning we have a presentation from Healthwave, the retail pharmacy business that caters for all State drugs schemes as well as private patients.  I know the member of the deputation have not seen the presentation, but they would be perfectly aware of the business.  That company seems to be able to provide a low-cost service.  What are the views of the witnesses on that?</p></speech>

This is an important discussion.  It is complex and it is important to dig down into some of the specifics.  I speak with a little familiarity with this area, having founded the All Ireland Cooperative Oncology Research Group, ICORG, many years ago.  Most of my research has in fact involved drug development, and that is what I have been primarily interested in.  I am proud of what we had achieved with ICORG.  We took on a rather improbable dream in a country that had only four oncologists at the time we founded the group and almost no patients going on clinical trials.  Since then we have brought in approximately &euro;30 million to &euro;40 million worth of free drugs to this country and created approximately 100 jobs.  In truth, those jobs are in the public sector, but I estimate that we have also created approximately 100 jobs in the private sector, because there are companies here which previously only had a sales force but then developed a research and development office to support the activities of clinical research trials.  We have had an honest and honourable role in developing four or five important cancer drugs.  I have been invited to present to the US Food and Drug Administration on behalf of a drug which was licensed partly on the strength of that presentation.  I have recently undergone an inspection by the Food and Drug Administration, which my team passed with flying colours.  We are proud of what we have achieved in that regard.</p><p>It is good that we are going to have the equivalent of the US Physician Financial Transparency Reports Act, or Sunshine Act, here in the near future.  It will enforce a transparency in the relations between the industry and doctors.  This is long overdue and I am supportive of it.</p><p>The Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, primarily represents the Irish affiliates of international companies.  The typical IPHA customers would be Irish sales and marketing forces selling and marketing drugs in Ireland, rather than representatives of the large manufacturing presence in Cork or west Dublin.  Over the years I have managed to get a great deal of money for research from these companies.  I have got them to support grants, match grants and so on.  However, one of the issues I never quite got to the bottom of was what went into the decision-making process in terms of where they put a manufacturing plant.  Were they more likely to put it in Ireland because we carried out good research here?  Were they more likely to put it here because the local market was favourable for the sales of the local Irish affiliate sales force?  To me that is simply not plausible.  I believe there is a complete disconnect between the decision on where a manufacturing plant goes and the minuscule size of the Irish market.  Companies put their manufacturing plants here for one reason and one reason only, and it relates to one number: 12%.  They come here because of the corporation tax rate.  There are other supportive reasons as well, but arguments to the effect that we should not prescribe generic drugs in Ireland because otherwise we would lose the manufacturing base have been advanced by the industry in the past and I believe they are wholly spurious.  The industry needs to get its act together on pricing.</p><p>The marketing, pricing and costing of drugs has changed dramatically.  The old philosophy used to be that a manufacturing company based the price it charged for a drug on the cost of developing it, plus the cost of the many failed drugs that never got to marketing, plus a reasonable market mark-up.  It was difficult to argue with that.  While science and medicine has become more sophisticated, so has marketing.  We now know that one of the key scientific components of marketing is pricing and the question of what the market will bear.  The things which determine what a market will bear include the quality of the science behind the drug and the quality of the clinical impact and its reach into medicine, but also emotional and social factors.  If a company has an effective drug for a rare disease that affects young people, it is likely that the company will try to yank the price up as high as it can, way beyond the developmental cost of the drug.  That is why I am troubled indeed when I hear of individual drugs costing many hundreds of thousands of pounds per annum.  That is simply not sustainable.</p><p>I know of one cancer drug we are prescribing that costs approximately &pound;120,000 per annum for a patient, and that patient would be on the drug for a year.  I know that the drug was licensed on the basis of a trial which included only 100 patients.  Therefore, the developmental costs of this drug had no relationship whatsoever to what was being charged for it.  Let us compare that to a drug like Herceptin, which was developed in an earlier era and which cost approximately &euro;30,000 per year.  It was based on trials that included 20,000 or 30,000 patients.  It was expensive to develop.  By the way, when we are allowed to prescribe bio-similars instead of Herceptin, I will prescribe them all the time.  We need to be absolutely unambiguous about this.  Our health service will not be able to afford the high-quality cancer, cardiovascular and cystic fibrosis treatments that are coming if we do not save everywhere we can.  In every situation where a generic drug exists that is much cheaper, we should use it.  In every situation where a bio-similar drug exists that is much cheaper, we should use it.  I take two generic medications with a clean conscience and a light heart every morning and I tell my patients the same thing.</p><p>The companies need to have a serious rethink.  Increasingly, the purchasers are government collectives throughout the Western world.  They probably need to draw a line under this and express to the companies the view that there is an amount of money beyond which they will never pay for one drug and that the companies can still make money on it.  I offer one example.  A good friend and colleague of mine, Dr. Leonard Saltz from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, was routinely prescribing a widely used colon cancer drug called bevacizumab.  A newer drug called aflibercept came along.  It was not bio-similar; it was a different company's product.  The company wanted to give it and took the view that it was a little better.  However, the price was astronomical.  Dr. Saltz went to the <i>New York Times</i>, wrote an op-ed and then went to the pharmacy committee of the hospital and said that they should not pay for it because the difference was too small and the cost too great.  Immediately, the company was able to drop the price of the drug by one half, which told us that there was no relationship whatsoever between where it pitched the price of the drug and the actual developmental costs of it.  The company made a calculation - as it transpired, a miscalculation - that the market would bear a higher cost.</p><p>We really need to get our act together on this.  If we are going to be able to take these wonderful new cancer treatments into the next generation, we need to look at numerous things.  How much money is spent on marketing to doctors?  How much money is spent on advertising?  Moreover, we need to look at the way pricing works on the drugs.  The bad news for the industry is that if they price it too hard, no one is going to pay.  That is where it is.  We need to work out a way to ensure that drugs become available at a rate that is affordable as well as allowing a reasonable profit for the companies and their shareholders.</p></speech>

However, there were some questions from Deputy Kelleher and Deputy McLellan about the differences in price that are visible to Irish patients who travel to Spain on their holidays.  Deputy McLellan wondered why Spain does not suffer shortages if its prices are lower than Ireland.  First, given that we are in a small island market, we will never have the lowest prices in Europe.  If we like, we can claim to have the lowest prices in Europe, but realistically that will mean we will have no medicines.  Pitching our pricing level at approximately the European average is probably the right way to do it, because we are a small market within an open market.</p> <p>  People will go on holidays to Spain and discover that it is not only medicines that are cheaper.  They will also discover that coffee, restaurant bills, hotel bills and car hire are cheaper.  Everything is cheaper in Spain because it is a lower-cost economy.  Ireland has a high business cost base.  I imagine that is what drives the prices.  For example, political colleagues of the committee members who sit in the European Parliament will come back and report on how much more expensive medicines are in Brussels compared to Dublin.  This is because Brussels sits above Ireland in terms of pricing in the case of many medicines.  There are medicine shortages in Spain, but they do not necessarily have shortages of the same products of which we have shortages.  Spain has brought in export bans on some products to address those shortages.</p> <p>  Shortages do not arise because the manufacturer, having manufactured the product, makes a decision not to supply it to the Irish market.  Their representatives will defend themselves in a moment, but manufacturers supply medicines, and once they leave the factory gate they have no control over where it goes.  They have complied with their obligations.</p><p>There is a parallel trade industry throughout Europe.  When we had higher prices than we do now we benefited from that because pharmacists were able to source some medicines for Irish patients which were approved by the Irish Medicines Board, IMB, as it was then and by the HSE and supply them at lower prices than were available here, much to the annoyance of the manufacturing industry at that time.  We could go to continental Europe then and secure approved medicines for use in Ireland at lower prices but that has turned now.  It has tipped over because our prices have fallen and now parallel trading companies that had a big business sending medicines into Ireland from Germany, for example, are now in the business of sending medicines from Ireland out to other markets.  The EU is based on freedom of movement of capital, goods and people so we cannot stop that.  It is a problem that is affecting more than just Ireland.  We are seeing a situation where pharmacists just cannot get some medicines, like certain drugs for chronic pain, epilepsy, thyroid deficiency and depression and so forth.  Over the Christmas period, for example, patients were walking into pharmacies with a prescription for Eltroxin which pharmacists did not have in stock.  That is an irreplaceable medicine; there is no generic alternative as such.  We in the IPU and the HSE were essentially scouring the medicine cupboards of the UK trying to get product in here to meet patient need.  The price of the anti-depressant Cymbalta, an innovative drug which is still on patent, is lower in Ireland than it is in the UK.  Once it leaves the factories and is supplied into the market, parallel traders can get their hands on it - which is perfectly legal - and sell it into a wholesaler or pharmacy in the UK.  It does not happen with all medicines.  </p><p> There are some medicines which are cheaper here than in the rest of Europe, while others are more expensive.  All we can really talk about is where the average sits.  The ESRI figure quoted indicates that the average medicine dispensed is at the same price point now as it was 13 years ago.  </p></speech>

The law precludes pharmacists from straight switching.  We can only give generic medicines for those products that are deemed interchangeable by the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA.  We are obliged by law to offer the patient a generic substitute but we cannot switch a medicine if the proprietary brand name is written on a prescription.</p></speech>

The medicines management programme, run by Professor Michael Barry, is starting to address this through the issuing of recommendations.  For example, if prescribing for gastric ulcers or gastroesophageal reflux disease, the recommendation is to use Lansoprazole rather than the other drugs in the same category because it is less expensive.  If prescribing for cholesterol, the recommendation is to use Sandostatin because it is effective and less expensive than the others.  It is only if that one does not work that it is recommended that prescribers move to the more expensive options.  That programme has started and Professor Barry uses the Primary Care Reimbursement Service, PRCRS, data from the HSE to monitor prices.</p> <p>  As far as unnecessary prescribing is concerned, while the numbers of items prescribed and dispensed are increasing all the time, arguably that does not prove unnecessary prescribing.  Rather, it is a result of the fact that more conditions are treatable now.  Diabetes patients 15 years ago, for example, were not taking blood pressure or cardiovascular medicines but then it was discovered that such patients are at greater risk of cardiovascular disease and other organ diseases so doctors started prescribing these medicines before the patients developed such problems.  The cardiovascular strategy holds that if patients have high blood pressure, their cholesterol levels should be controlled.  Doctors are adding medicines to treatment regimes, the result of which has been to improve health and to increase the length of people's lives.  It can also be argued that this results in savings in the context of hospital stays because if patients are at home and taking their prescribed medicines, they are not ending up in hospital.  </p> <p>  We have always advocated medicine use reviews where a pharmacist would be paid to sit down once a year with a patient who has a number of different conditions and is taking a lot of prescription medicine and comb through all of the prescriptions and review the appropriateness of and need for each one.  The pharmacist could make sure that the medication is both clinically appropriate and cost-effective, that is, that the patient is using the least expensive equivalent to treat his or her condition and is not taking anything that he or she should not be taking.  Such medicine use reviews are used in the UK and have prevented people from ending up in hospital, as well as saving money.</p></speech>

The Deputy acknowledged that our parent companies have significant investments in Ireland, unlike in other European countries such as Romania.  That said, the methodology for pricing medicines in Ireland is completely independent.  The Deputy will be familiar with the process of health technology assessment, whereby every patent-protected medicine that comes to the Irish market goes through a very rigorous cost-effectiveness assessment within the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE.  Following that, there is an assessment of pricing based on a basket from nine countries mentioned earlier.  While the pharmaceutical industry is a significant presence in Ireland, the methodology for pricing new medicines coming onto the market is a separate process, with independent assessment carried out by Professor Barry and his group in the NCPE.</p></speech>

Some of the countries in the group of nine would traditionally have been seen as higher priced than Ireland, while others would have been seen as lower priced.  Spain, the UK, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark are all in the basket and would traditionally have been seen as higher-priced than Ireland.  Part of the rationale for the nine countries chosen was economic, in terms of matching Ireland to income levels, <i>per capita</i>income levels, the economic status of the countries relative to others in the EU as well as the pricing levels.  We have provided the latest statistics on the basket in the supporting documentation which shows where Ireland is placed in terms of GDP <i>per capita</i>relative to the nine countries and relative to other European countries as well as in terms of the price level.  Ireland, relative to other European countries, is well off.  Our GDP <i>per capita</i>in 2014 was almost &euro;38,000 and our GNI <i>per capita</i>, which takes away the effects of the profits of multinationals leaving the country, was &euro;35,000.  Most of the countries in the batch of nine are around that level.  Ireland is a high-income country relative to the rest of Europe and in general our prices for all goods, as Mr. O'Loughlin said, are about 20% higher than the EU average price.  We are pitched at that level.<br/><br/>Some of the nine countries are traditionally higher priced while others are traditionally lower priced but they also reference their prices against those in other countries.  In terms of population, the group covers about 278 million people in the EU so it is not as if we are priced against a small subset of higher priced countries in Europe.  We are priced against almost two thirds or three fifths of the European population.  </p></speech>

The research we have done indicates that this does not refer, generally, to patent-protected medicines but to generics.  We have looked at that in some detail and, as I mentioned in my opening statement, our prices are at the average and Spain is included in that calculation.  It has been shown that it is generics that are at a much lower price in other countries and not patent-protected medicines.</p><p> I take this opportunity to acknowledge Senator Crown's contribution to the All Ireland Cooperative Oncology Research Group, ICORG, and its fantastic work for patients with cancer.  The research coming out of that initiative has contributed greatly to the development of our medicines.  The Senator made the comment that perhaps our industry does not support the use of generic medicines, but that is not the case.  Our business is about providing innovative medicines, bringing new products onto the Irish market, getting a fair price for them and working within the processes we have.  We certainly acknowledge that when the patent expires on a product, it is fair that generics be used in whatever quantities are required.  It is not IPHA's position to object to the use of generic medicines.  That is absolutely not the case.</p></speech>

Senator Crown asked about the general pricing policy of the industry internationally.  Unlike the situation under the United States Government at federal level, for example, we have the health technology assessment, HTA, run by the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, which is designed by the Health Information and Quality Authority, with the latter having issued substantial guidelines in this regard.  The HTA sets a threshold price level above which, in theory, a drug will be rejected.  It is a &euro;45,000 threshold per what is called a quality-adjusted life-year.  However, the guidelines also state that there is no fixed cost effectiveness threshold above or below which technologies are guaranteed to be rejected or accepted for reimbursement.  The process is there as a check on whether a new product is cost effective, how it should be paid for, whether it represents value for money and so on.  Price is a factor in that, but it is not a rigid mechanical rule.  Not many of us would want such a rule, because we have to take into account social conditions and Irish preferences.</p> <p>  As Senator Crown would know, this is a very complex area.  HIQA has set out complex guidelines in this regard and there are many people in our companies, including statisticians and clinically qualified personnel, who spend a lot of time and effort doing the analysis to meet the tests that are set by the State for determining whether new drugs are cost effective.</p></speech>

There was a question about the reception to our proposals for savings, which we issued in September last year.  All of the stakeholders are very keen to garner more savings and it will be interesting to see how our proposals are acted upon in terms of the required legislative changes, changes to the industry agreements which are up for negotiation this year, and in terms of negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO.  The proposals were positively received.</p> <p>  We must be very careful when comparing generic medicine prices in Ireland with those in other EU countries.  The legislation has really only been running its course for a year.  If we look at how the Health Service Executive is setting reference prices for generic medicines, it is not looking at the basket of nine countries.  Instead, it is looking at the generic prices across all EU states.  What we are seeing is that reference prices in Ireland are not being set at the median.  In fact, in some cases they are being set in comparison not with countries of similar GDP and population but relative to prices in the big five countries.  In the case of Atorvastatin, for instance, one of the most commonly prescribed medicines in this country and, in the past, one of the highest-cost medicines, we are seeing comparable prices with France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain.  Most Irish patients presenting at a pharmacy these days realise there is no longer much to be gained in getting their prescription medications dispensed in Spain, because Irish prices are very comparable.</p> <p>  Reference was made to product shortages.  One of the issues we see here, particularly in regard to Eltroxin, for example, a drug that is well over 20 years old, is that we have no mechanism in the Irish market currently to increase price.  I cannot think of any other product on the market that has not seen a price increase in the past 20 years.  Teva does have a generic licence for levothyroxine, which is the generic molecule of Eltroxin, but we have not been able to agree a price with the HSE which would allow us to bring that product to market.  The price being paid for Eltroxin right now does not represent the current costs of bringing a medicine, even a generic medicine, to the Irish market.</p> <p>  A question was asked about the volume and value of generic products within the market.  Again, we only have HSE data going back to 2013, but we do have industry data.  On the basis of those data, we estimate that the volume of generics within the market has increased to 40% since the HSE gave its estimate of 34%, and they account for some 17% of the total spend.  To clarify, the data show that generics accounts for 40% of the volume of medicines dispensed and approximately 17% of the total spend.  </p></speech>

Living in Dundalk, I am very aware that there has been a significant difference in the price of prescribed drugs in the Republic versus the price payable for the same medicines in the North.  Many constituents have contacted me to say the price of their prescribed drugs is much lower across the Border and, in some cases, four to seven times lower.  Coming from a business background, I would like to see the pharmaceutical industry producing a recommended price list for all generic drugs which would be available to all relevant parties, including doctors and patients.  That would lead to a more open and transparent system for everybody.</p> <p>  As a Dundalk person, I am very much aware that Teva employs more than 500 people in Ireland, some of them in my own town.  It must be doing something right when it is on top of the market.  Ms Gannon referred to potential savings of &euro;130 million in four specific areas, which is nothing to be sniffed at.  The first of these areas, in which a saving of &euro;60 million could be made, would involve opening up competition in the low-volume medicine market, which Ms Gannon tells us costs taxpayers in the region of &euro;200 million per year.  Will she explain what she means by low-volume medicines?  She referred to a saving of &euro;25 million that could be made by instructing hospitals to switch from expensive biological medicines to more affordable options.  What has her company done to encourage that?  Ms Gannon identified a further saving of &euro;15 million to be made by allowing pharmacists to dispense more affordable generic medicines to patients who present for the first time.  She indicated that generic drugs dispensing has jumped from 34% to 40% of the total market.</p><p>How do the witnesses find the quality of generic drugs?  People fear a change from a known drug to a generic one.  What confidence can the witnesses give them that generic drugs do what they claim on the label?</p><p> Mention was made of inhaler devices, with one in every eight people having some form of asthma.  Ms Gannon stated that a saving of &euro;18 million could be made in that regard.  Will she elaborate further on the figure of &euro;113 million?  I am a firm believer in the saying "Your health is your wealth", but many people cannot afford to buy drugs.</p></speech>

Last Saturday morning, someone whose husband had had two heart attacks attended my clinic in Cork.  He is on medication.  He takes the train from Cork to Dublin and then the train from Dublin to Newry every two months to buy medication because he can get two months' supply cheaper there than he can get even one month's supply in Cork.  He takes that much trouble because of the price variation.</p> <p>  The witnesses referred to cost savings, but let us be realistic.  The cost of medication went from &euro;570 million in 2000 to more than &euro;2 billion in 2009.  There was a significant increase in prices over a short period.  The State pays more than &euro;2 billion of a &euro;13 billion health care budget on medicines.  It is a major challenge.  While progress has been made, there is much more to do and we cannot step back from trying to reduce the cost of medications.</p> <p>  We have examined the figures on generic drugs.  In the UK, up to 80% of medication is generic.  We are discussing a 40% figure for Ireland.  Does Ms Gannon envisage that figure increasing further during the next three years and what percentage should we target?</p> <p>  In terms of what manufacturers charge pharmacies and pharmacies charge customers, what is the pharmacies' margin on generic medications and how does it vary between Ireland and elsewhere?</p> <p>  Mr. O'Loughlin referred to drugs in Brussels.  I worked there for two years.  The medication I was on at the time cost me &euro;11.25 in Cork, but &euro;3.25 in Brussels.  The ESRI published a report in 2013.  An issue arises with the cost of medication in Ireland, in that drugs are released here at an early stage.  While that is welcome, the ESRI asked whether the State was likely to be disadvantaged if products tended to be launched relatively early in Ireland and, thus, the comparative average pricing mechanism in the basket of European countries did not apply as widely as it should.  Essentially, we could compare prices with a wider group of countries if we entered the market later, as our current basket comprises a small group.  Will the witnesses comment on this point?  Should the HSE and the Department be entitled to a mid-term review of a medicine's pricing after, for example, two years in light of what it is being sold for in other countries?  This would be important.  If the State works with the pharmaceutical industry as well as pharmacies, we can all benefit from having new medicines available in the market at competitive prices.</p></speech>

I thank Ms Maher for her presentation and compliment the local pharmacies.  In every community, the local pharmacist is as important to customers as the general practitioner, GP.</p> <p>  Many of the questions on generic drugs have been answered, but how does the Irish Pharmacy Union, IPU, explain generic drugs to customers?  Whenever people, even family members, speak with me, they believe that a generic drug is the yellow pack drug and that they should be getting the "proper" one.  I encountered an incident in the past week.  A member of my family was on generic drugs.  It was only when she was prescribed the "proper" drug that she made some progress with her illness.</p> <p>  We are discussing quality of life.  For me, that is still being able to comb my hair, wash myself and do all of the other things that are important to me in life when I reach 81 years of age or older.  This is why I have an issue with people having so many prescriptions just to keep them alive.  It is wrong.  There has been a 73% increase in prescribed drugs and a longer life expectancy because of medication, but the ESRI has shown that a longer life does not mean a healthier one.  This is an issue.  I read the bleak figures from the HSE - 40% with chronic disease, 31% with heart disease and 30,000 new cancer patients.  Have the witnesses statistics on how many people who live longer end up in nursing homes?  It is what happens.  We extend people's lives, but do they have quality of life?  In my local area, the majority end up in nursing homes, including people who live close to me.  We should instead be helping people to plan healthier lives.  For example, how should we deal with young women who smoke during pregnancy?  We send them to counselling, but it makes not one bit of difference.  For the past couple of months, the committee has discussed alcohol and how to treat people who abuse it, particularly young people.  Drug abuse is also an issue, be the drugs legal or illegal.  If we start considering these questions instead of filling people up with prescription drugs, we might be doing more to sustain healthier lives.  This is just my personal opinion.  I am not a medical professional, unlike my esteemed colleague, Senator Crown, who knows much more about this issue.</p></speech>

What is the witnesses' opinion on the delivery of drugs to patients via alternative means, for example, the Internet and mail order pharmacies?  Will they comment on the issue of overprescribing?</p> <p>  Deputy Byrne made a good point.  It would be remiss of us not to compliment the local pharmacists in our communities who provide a sterling service in their relationships with many of the people who walk through their doors.  We should acknowledge that the pharmacist and the pharmacy play a key role in the community.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Healy and the Chairman for their kind words about the community pharmacist.  They are right, in that the community pharmacy is the heart and hub of every town and village.  Running a Border pharmacy and being from Northern Ireland originally, I am very aware of the price differences, but we must bear in mind that the price of drugs is set by an agreement between the Department of Health, the HSE and the manufacturers.</p><p>The ESRI report has shown that the price is falling and continues to fall.  It fell by 30% between 2009 and 2013 and that was before generic substitution and generic pricing took hold.  We have seen huge drops in the past 12 months alone since reference pricing came in, as Ms Gannon has pointed out.  Pharmacists have campaigned since 2003 to be allowed to substitute generics, so we could have made years of savings.  We welcomed generic substitution because there is much change we can bring about.</p><p> Deputy Catherine Byrne asked whether patients are confused.  It can be very confusing for patients.  Some of the drug companies ran campaigns to help patients to understand, but pharmacists spend many hours at the counter telling patients that the little white tablet that is round and flat is the same as the little blue tablet that may be oblong.  This does take time, because the change from a short popular name to a long chemical name is difficult to comprehend and a person needs to have faith in the product they are going to take to improve their health.  The PCRS and the HSE have acknowledged the difference pharmacists have made in the past 12 months in respect of the success of reference pricing and generic substitution in bringing down the State's bill.</p><p> Community pharmacists deliver medicines to elderly patients, young mothers and patients who are bed-bound or housebound across the country.  They make a huge contribution to their patients' lives in respect of the delivery of medicines.  Mail order pharmacy is currently illegal.</p></speech>

He alluded to a published recommended retail price list of some sort.  That kind of retail price maintenance is illegal in Ireland under competition law, so although the Irish Pharmacy Union represents 1,700-odd community pharmacies, we do not gather or transmit any data around private pricing.  Every one of those transactions must occur separately.  Pharmacists are legally obliged to make up their own minds about what they charge.  From an economic perspective as opposed to a professional one, we have one of the least regulated pharmacy markets in Europe, as has been acknowledged by the European Commission in its publications.  Pharmacies in every locale and market are competing with each other.  Competition is not just about price; it is about the quality of service, advice and location, and the convenience and service one provides to one's customers and patients.</p> <p>  Senator Colm Burke asked about the margins in the Irish pharmacy sector and how they compare with those in other countries.  Our research shows that in the past five years since the financial crisis took hold, the average turnover in an Irish pharmacy has dropped quite considerably.  This means that the margins in pharmacy are also dropping very considerably.  In percentage terms, our margins would be roughly the same as those in the UK.  Our turnover is falling to approximately UK levels or lower because the market is so competitive.  We have an overall market that is shrinking in value, but more and more pharmacists who graduate from college are establishing their own businesses and competing for ever smaller slices of a shrinking pie.  This is borne out by ESRI and CSO data.  The overall value of the pharmacy is shrinking even as the number of prescriptions is increasing.</p></speech>

The owner has a particular business model, which is a subscription model.  I will not describe it because I know he is coming before the committee later.  Many of the other pharmacies that do not have that business model have established costs, so the businesses have been in existence since before the financial crisis in what we thought at the time was a boom.  With upward-only rent reviews and high rates, rents and wage costs, it is not possible to reduce the cost base of any business, as the members know from their constituencies, and pharmacies are no different.  Pharmacies have to charge a price that covers the costs of delivering the service and operating the business.  In a competitive market, pharmacies have maintained a high quality of service and have seen prices drop considerably, so pharmacists are passing on price reductions as they come in to the fullest extent they can.</p> <p>  The Chairman asked about the steps that are being taken to address over-prescribing.  Some of the increase in the number of items dispensed on the State schemes is due to the increasing number of people who are eligible for the State schemes.  Senator Colm Burke spoke about the jump in expenditure from 2001 to 2009, when there was a very considerable rise.  There were many reasons for that.  One was a huge increase in the number of medical cards in circulation - from 1.2 million to approximately 1.8 million - because the unemployment rate suddenly shot up.  We were dispensing prescriptions for 50% more people.  During that time, more therapies were coming on line.  If we go back 15 years, more of the products that are generic today and that are becoming cheap today were new, novel and exciting medicines.  Examples include the cholesterol and ulcer medicines I spoke about and many of the asthma and respiratory medicines that we are so used to now.  Perhaps Dr. Daly will speak about this.  There was a wave of new medicines that were then very expensive but that have dropped in price since then.</p></speech>

It happened between 2000 and 2008.  That was when the big jump occurred - before the unemployment figures and the number of medical cards started to increase.  It appears that it was a case of who was prepared to sign the blank cheque.  There seems to have been very little control by the HSE and the Department, which was a concern I had.  Once prices are increased, it is very difficult to try to go back because people who own pharmacies have spent money - they were able to spend based on their turnover - and are now running into difficulties trying to service that expenditure, which is a huge challenge.</p></speech>

We just received the price.  Medicines were expensive, but the ESRI has shown that Irish doctors like to prescribe innovative therapies.  The Senator mentioned that the downside of being an early adopter of new medicines is that it can push up the price - the price paid on medicines, not the price for the individual medicines.  Historically, we have used more innovative and newer medicines here, whereas the UK has incentivised prescribers to stay with the older, cheaper medicines.</p></speech>

The Senator spoke about the drugs bill increasing.  It is important to mention again that there are 835,000 more patients in the system than there were in the past.  This has resulted in a 73% increase in the number of items being prescribed over the past ten years.  Life expectancy has gone up by an additional four years over those ten years.  The bill has gone up but the benefits are there in increased life expectancy.  Obviously, there are more patients in the system as well.</p> <p>  The Senator referred to the ESRI report.  There have been some comments on that report in that it only captured two out of the nine countries we are referenced against, so we would challenge the validity of some of the data in that report.  The Senator commented on Ireland getting early access to new medicines.  This is not the case any more.  It would have been like that five or six years ago when Ireland was one of the first countries to make new medicines available to patients.  The process is taking much longer now.  The period from when a drug is approved by the regulatory authority to getting reimbursement in Ireland takes two years or more, so we are not one of those early countries any more in terms of getting new medicines onto the market.</p><p> My final point relates to the mid-term review.  In each of the agreements there have been realignments at intervals.  We had a realignment of medicine prices at the end of November 2012 and November 2013.  It is not the case that we have agreements which run indefinitely; there have been realignments in between.  That is actually happening and prices are reduced at that point.</p></speech>

Obviously, everyone agrees that people living longer is good.  Individuals will become ill in older age as a result of chronic diseases, some of which relate to lifestyle issues, while others are contracted simply on the basis of misfortune.  Our medicines help them to avoid the worst effects of such diseases.  Medicines are necessary to deal with chronic illnesses.  For these reasons, many of the companies in the IPHA support the proper use of medication by patients with particular conditions and diseases.</p> <p>  On the generality of nursing home usage, in a previous life I worked as a special adviser in the then Department of Health and Children and had a particular interest in long-term care.</p></speech>

The prevalence of the need for nursing home care among those in the over 65 year age group should never be more than one in 20.  It should, in fact, be less than 5%.  It is important to emphasise that it is not the case that one will end up in nursing home care once one reaches 65 years.  Such care should only be necessary for those in the high-dependency category.  I am sure that one of the great campaigners in this area, Professor Des O'Neill, a geriatrician, still reminds everyone involved in it that, regardless of the age one reaches, one never has more than a 50% chance of suffering from dementia.  Again, there is no inevitability in this regard.  Obviously, we must manage conditions and chronic diseases that come with ageing, but people should not be of the view that once they reach 90 years of age, they will develop dementia almost immediately.  That is not the case.  The job of those in the pharmaceutical industry is to support the management of chronic diseases, acute illnesses and ageing in order to ensure the period of suffering experienced by those unfortunate enough to be severely disabled as a result of these conditions will be kept to a minimum.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-05a.594" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Aideen Kenny" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015030500002#M00600"><p>On Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick's questions about the proposed savings, wearing one of the many hats I wear within Teva Pharmaceuticals Ireland, I am involved in setting the opportunity to bring products - predominantly of a generic nature - to the Irish market.  Prices continue to fall to levels which are extremely low.  For example, Ms Gannon referred to atorvastatin, the price of which stands at &euro;2.52 for a 28-pack of 10 mg tablets.  The price of a 28-pack of 5 mg amlodipine tablets, a widely prescribed therapy for cardiovascular disease, is &euro;2.16.  For a pack of 28 simvastatin 10 mg tablets which are used in the treatment of high cholesterol, the cost is &euro;1.96.  I could continue to list other products.  More frequently, we are unfortunately being obliged to make decisions on the basis that economic circumstances dictate that it makes no sense for us to launch particular generic products in the Irish market.</p> <p>  The first &euro;60 million of the proposed savings of &euro;113 million relates to products which are on the market at below the target price of &euro;1.5 million to &euro;2 million.  At that price and allowing for the competition provided by five or six players in the generics market, it certainly makes no sense for us to bring a product to the market.  We are of the view, however, that if certain enablers were facilitated by the Government, it would improve the competitiveness of the sector.  I will return to these enablers.  </p> <p>  The next &euro;25 million in savings relates to expanding the level of uptake of biosimilar products.  Teva Pharmaceuticals Ireland has experience in this area because it launched three such products in the market, with mixed results.  It has been a hard slog to try to convince prescribers to recommend them.  This has predominantly been as a result of a perceived lack of safety in respect of these products and doubts as to whether they constitute effective therapies.  Ms Gannon will expand further on this issue.</p> <p>  Savings would also result from allowing pharmacists to dispense more affordable products which would not normally be substituted for patients' prescribed medicines.  This is a very interesting subject and would require patients who are perhaps not eligible to switch by virtue of the fact that the products they take are not included in the interchangeable list to start from scratch on these newer therapies.  We are of the view that considerable savings could be made in this regard.  </p> <p>  The final area in which savings could be made is respiratory devices.  Again, the products would not be those included in the interchangeable list.  Therefore, potentially, savings would be more difficult to achieve in the absence of enablers.</p> <p>  The enablers we are proposing would involve straightforward amendments to existing legislation; making them agenda items as part of the negotiations with the IMO later in the year; taking these enablers into account when the current industry agreements were being amended in order to change the price entry points; and ensuring prescribers and procurers took a more proactive approach to cost savings in their prescribing and procurement.</p></speech>

As stated, Teva Pharmaceuticals Ireland spent a considerable amount of money in trying to disseminate information on generic medicines because this was a new area for Irish patients.  However, generic medicines are used right across Europe as a mechanism to save money.  For example, some 80% of the volume of medicines dispensed in Britain and Northern Ireland are generic.  In the context of the level of take-up, generic medicines are frequently used in other European countries.  Generics are licensed through the HPRA in exactly the same way as originator medicines.  All of the regulations required in terms of good distribution and manufacturing practice are all applied to generic companies in the same way as they are applied to originator companies.  We are also subject to the same requirements in the context of monitoring our products on the market.  We monitor our products all the way through from the point at which we place them on the market.  Adverse events in respect of all medicines are reported to generics companies and, just like originator medicines companies, we report them to the HPRA.</p></speech>

Have questions arisen about it continuing?  </p> <p>  On the point made by Senator Colm Burke, people who visit my clinic and my office in Cork which is a very small place use the term "mockya drugs".  I have come across individuals who will refuse to purchase an alternative drug because it is not what they are used to taking.  Perhaps there is a need for everyone involved to consider how the campaign to which I refer might be pursued to an even greater degree.</p></speech>

We continue to invest in the "Understand Generics" campaign and support pharmacies in helping patients to understand the active ingredient in generic and branded medicines is equivalent and works in the same way.  The colour of the tablet might change or the packaging might look different, but, ultimately, the medication involved works in exactly the same way and the drugs are licensed and approved by the HPRA.  We continue to invest in this area and have a website.  In addition, we continue to supply pharmacies with material for patients.</p></speech>

Speaking from the perspective of Teva Pharmaceuticals Ireland and in the context of innovation, the State must realise patients demand that we have access to the most innovative treatments and therapies.  In one sense, generics afford the State some room for budgetary manoeuvre in paying for such treatments and therapies.  However, it must be remembered that the population is continually ageing, living longer and developing increasing numbers of chronic diseases.</p><p>It is certain that the State will need to pay more for medicine usage in the future if patients are to be allowed to access all of the new, targeted therapies that are coming down the line and the consumption of medicine remains at its current level.</p></speech>

As has been noted, with the population ageing and new medicines emerging, it will not be enough to assume that the savings being generated from older medicines will be sufficient to fund new medicines.  It must be acknowledged that more funding needs to be ring-fenced for new, innovative medicines coming to the market.</p> <p>  While the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association acknowledges the role of biosimilar products in providing value, these are not generic products as they are different molecules.  The decision on when and where to use them should not be based on financial considerations.  Safety considerations must also be taken into account and the IPHA is working with the Health Products Regulatory Authority on this matter.</p></speech>

Deputy Catherine Byrne and Senator Colm Burke spoke today and on previous occasions about pharmacists engaging with patients to support them in making healthier lifestyle choices and taking medicines correctly.  Some of the savings generated in securing lower prices for medicines should be expended on supporting patients to take medicines to ensure they benefit from them.  Patients need to take the right medicine at the right dose at the right time and to do so consistently.</p> <p>  The pharmacy profession does more than supply medicines.  Our role is also to support and assist patients.  Deputy Catherine Byrne is anxious that more be done to support people in making healthier lifestyle choices.  If people are to live longer, which would be good, it is preferable that they also live healthier lives.  Members are probably too busy to watch television.  In January the Irish Pharmacy Union worked with the "Operation Transformation" programme across the country, with the result that thousands of people visited their local pharmacy to have their body mass index, weight, height and waste circumference checked.  Pharmacists were making a statement that we needed to start addressing the fact that, as Senator John Crown stated, 61% of the population were overweight or obese.  Failure to address this issue will result in the system being bankrupted by cardiovascular disease and diabetes.  Pharmacists have a major role to play in controlling illness before it reaches the point where it requires medication.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding the different composition of these drugs, the costs seem particularly high from a layperson's perspective.  The Health Service Executive was forced to backtrack on decisions it took not to reimburse the cost of certain medicines through the primary care reimbursement scheme.</p></speech>

Many members will be familiar with pharmaceutical plants in Carlow, Cork and Grangecastle which are developing some of these new medicines.  It takes between three and five years to get a manufacturing plant up and running and costs up to &euro;500 million before it starts to manufacture a medicine.  The development and production of these medicines is a highly complex process.  Moreover, not all of them are as expensive as some of the headline drugs about which we hear.

Healthwave was founded in 2013 with a simple goal, namely to provide universal access to the best value in medication and care.  Healthwave is a retail pharmacy business that caters for all State drug schemes as well as private patients who pay in full for their medication.  Since our launch in 2013, we already have 10,000 customers from all over Ireland who regularly travel the length and breadth of the country to benefit from our service.</p> <p>  The pharmacy sector in Ireland has traditionally been extremely opaque, with pricing information near impossible to come by.  The most basic change we made when launching Healthwave in 2013 was to publish our prescription prices for everyone to see.  The fact that complaints were made by pharmacy owners to the regulator on foot of this action is testament to the reluctance of the industry to inform patients about price.  Thankfully, the pharmacy regulator moved to support this transparency, and in 2014 published guidance encouraging other pharmacies to follow suit.  Last week I received a receipt from an elderly gentleman who had been charged &euro;100.29 by another pharmacy for olanzapine, a drug for mood disorder.  Our price is &euro;19.08.  He will save 80%, or almost &euro;1,000 per year.  We know people do not have this kind of money to throw around.</p> <p>  Working as a community pharmacist in various stores throughout the country, I witnessed first hand patients ceasing medication due to cost.  It was these stories that led me to launch Healthwave, and with it a new model of pharmacy with universal access to transparent pricing and an unrivalled level of care and convenience.  In our first year, we saved our patients well over &euro;1 million.  Not only did we save the consumer hundreds of thousands of euro, but we have also saved the State significant expenditure on medication as a result.  It is worth recognising that the State plays no role in the prices pharmacies charge private patients.  However, I hope to demonstrate that by reducing costs and improving adherence in private patients, the State ultimately benefits with substantial savings.</p> <p>  As I stated, within 18 months more than 10,000 customers from all over Ireland subscribed to our HealthPass service, which is a new business model in Ireland.  We operate this business model to provide the best care and value to the consumer.  For a small annual subscription fee of &euro;25 customers become members and enjoy a number of benefits, which include access to an average of 50% savings on prescriptions, free home delivery and free house calls from our mobile pharmacist team.</p> <p>  Our retail prices for medicines are substantially lower than other Irish pharmacies and are closer to those seen in Northern Ireland.  How do we do this?  Very simply, we take a lower margin and dispense a high proportion of generic medication.  Healthwave sources its drugs from the same Irish wholesalers as other Irish pharmacies.  Generic medications are identical versions of a branded medicine that are released once the branded medicines' patent expires.  Generic medicines are cheaper to source and to supply.  According to the most recent ESRI report, generic usage in Ireland is low relative to other member states, at approximately 50%.  Healthwave&rsquo;s generic usage currently stands at 90%.</p> <p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 introduced the concept of interchangeable medicines, which was a huge leap forward in enabling pharmacists to reduce the cost of their patients' prescriptions.  I will give some customer examples.  A patient on cardiovascular medications attending a pharmacy in Ranelagh and paying the maximum &euro;144 per month reduced the bill to &euro;49.78 with Healthwave.  A breast cancer patient was paying &euro;94.55 in a large pharmacy chain for anastrozole and a calcium supplement.  Her bill reduced to &euro;19.08.  Receipts supporting these examples are included for the committee&rsquo;s information.</p> <p>  I will now speak about innovation at Healthwave and two services in particular, which are our mobile pharmacist and home delivery.  Patient safety is at the heart of everything we do.  Legislation requires face to face consultation between a pharmacist and a patient.  While this makes sense from a patient safety point of view, a trip to the pharmacy is not a simple task for everyone.  In February, we introduced a mobile pharmacist for our members free of charge.  Using our software systems, our team of pharmacists can conduct their consultations in the comfort of the patient's home, with remote access to any clinical information they may require.  Anyone anywhere can now access affordable medication.</p> <p>  In 2014 we also launched Ireland&rsquo;s first home delivery service.  Again, safety is our priority with this service.  Our technology enables us to track medicines from the moment they leave our store to the moment the patient signs for their delivery.  We have delivered medication to every county in Ireland.  We place a large focus on technology and have invested heavily in software development which allows us to streamline and improve many outdated and legacy processes, from inventory management to remotely accessible patient records by our mobile pharmacists.  Technology is at the core of our business.  We will continue to invest heavily in both products and job creation.</p> <p>  Ireland operates a State-subsidised drug scheme, the drugs payment scheme, whereby the maximum any individual or household will pay for medicines in any calendar month is capped.  The current cap is &euro;144.  Once the cap is reached, the State funds the excess.  By reducing the cost of prescriptions Healthwave has brought many patients below the drugs payment scheme threshold.  The most recent primary care reimbursement service report shows that 25% of persons eligible for the drugs payments scheme reached the monthly threshold, resulting in a claim to the HSE.  In our first year only 1% of our members hit the &euro;144 limit.  One patient had been paying the maximum &euro;144 per month for the pain medication Lyrica in a national pharmacy chain.  Healthwave reduced her bill to &euro;64.85, a saving for both her and the State.</p> <p>  Non-adherence costs the State.  Medication adherence is a measure of whether patients take their prescribed drugs as per the doctor's instructions.  The World Health Organisation estimates that medication adherence rates for chronic conditions in developed countries are at 50%.  In other words, half of prescribed medications are not taken.  Non-adherence leads to increased costs in the health care system.  Problems with patient adherence to medication were shown to be responsible for approximately 33.3% of preventable drug-related hospital admissions.  In patients with chronic disease, such as hypertension and high cholesterol, non-adherence can increase the risk of stroke four-fold and the risk of death three-fold.  In the UK it is estimated these admissions alone cost the NHS up to &pound;200 million per year.</p> <p>  Two key factors affecting adherence are cost and convenience.  It is estimated that the cost of drugs can reduce adherence by between 10% and 20%.  Healthwave has addressed this by lowering the cost of medications by an average of 50%.  Our customers travel from as far as Donegal and Dingle to access medication they otherwise could not afford.  The ease of access to a pharmacy can also negatively impact adherence, with studies estimating that patients living in highly rural areas were 64% less likely to visit a pharmacy than those in close proximity to one.  Recently, a lady from Artane in Dublin travelled by bus across the city to personally thank our team.  The week before she read about our service she had decided to stop taking her blood pressure and cholesterol tablets in order to pay her ESB bills.  However, with Healthwave&rsquo;s prices she can now afford both.  With our mobile pharmacist and home delivery service, we will ensure this lady, and all of our other members, have an uninterrupted supply of vital medicines.</p> <p>  The pharmacy industry is one which has seen little innovation in 30 years.</p><p>Healthwave is demonstrating that the cost of medicines can be dramatically reduced and adherence improved through business model innovation and technology .</p><p> I thank the committee for its time.  I will be happy to answer members' questions on these and other issues, in greater detail, during the course of</p><p>the meeting.</p></speech>

As stated my name is Martin Gallagher, chairman of the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland, APMI.  I am accompanied by my colleagues, Mr. Michael Cullen vice chairman, APMI, and Mr. Jim Hanlon, chief executive officer, Clonmel Healthcare Limited.</p> <p>  The Association of Pharmaceutical Manufactures of Ireland is the trade representative body for the generic industry in Ireland.  Its members include suppliers of prescription and non-prescription medicines both to the domestic and international markets.  The primary purpose of the APMI is to promote and support the common interests of the generic industry in Ireland and to be to the forefront of offering quality affordable medicines to the Irish population.</p> <p>  On behalf of its membership, the APMI is charged with forming appropriate relationships with the Department of Health, CPU and HPRA to ensure the introduction and continuous supply of affordable medicines.  The APMI is the recognised negotiating body for all agreements regarding supply and pricing of generic medicines in Ireland.  Its regulatory representation encompasses the expertise and the regulatory departments of the membership.  It is involved with the appropriate bodies such as, the HPRA, and has specific responsibility for ensuring that all members comply with general statutory instruments including the code of practice on advertising of medicinal products.</p> <p>  The APMI has a long history of co-operation with the Department of Health and relevant bodies in respect of pricing.  In more recent years due to the difficulties encountered regarding the supply and pricing of affordable medicines, the APMI entered into a three year agreement for the supply and pricing of generic medicines from November 2012.  This three year agreement paved the way for the introduction of interchangeability and reference pricing of pharmaceutical products in the off patent space.</p> <p>  Within 16 months of our current agreement the APMI was approached and an addendum was agreed to offer additional price reductions prior to the formal introduction of reference pricing.  Included in this addendum it was agreed that there would not be any further revisions before the ending of the original agreement in 2015.  The reference price mechanism has been successfully implemented and substantial additional price reductions and State savings have occurred.   It is important to recognise that the APMI has delivered on the cost savings as per the agreement.  It is estimated that these savings amounted to &euro;120 million in 2013 and about &euro;140 million to &euro;150 million in 2014 giving a total saving across the two years of &euro;268 million.  Generic companies employ more than 3,000 people in Ireland.</p> <p>  I have circulated a chart from which it can be clearly demonstrated that generic penetration has increased from 18.5% in 2010 to 42.4% by the end of 2014.  Information we have received from IMS in the past 24 hours states that penetration in now at 48%.  Between 2013 and 2014 the volume use of generics grew by 23% while the value has only increased by 0.2%.  In actual terms if we were to look at the products that are in the off patent space, as opposed to the total market penetration of generics is significantly higher.  This percentage level of penetration is at least equal to similar molecules in other EU jurisdictions.  I cite here Atorvastatin, Esomeprazole, Rosuvastatin, Omeprazole, Lansoprazole and Pantoprazole all of which fall between 80% and 90% generic penetration at this time. </p> <p>  There are future issues facing the current reference price and interchangeability model.  In relative terms Ireland is a very small country with a population of only 4.6 million.  As a direct result reference pricing does not work for low volume off patent molecules, and to generic companies it is uneconomic and a total disincentive to the launch of lower value molecules.  Excessive lowering of reference prices for the size of the market has and will lead further to generic houses exiting particular molecules thus causing shortages of supply and will lead to reduced or no competition in those particular molecules which will give rise to the possibility of price increases in the long term. </p> <p>  Clearly there are major costs saving opportunities in addition to the molecule savings to date, with generic high-tech products now available and the launch of a number of biosimilar products against higher cost originators.  There are currently no systems, mechanisms or incentives for physicians to prescribe alternatives to the high cost originator, or incentives for pharmacists to initiate change.  The implementation of changes to the reimbursement system, new incentives, mechanisms and guidelines, would need to be introduced to help deliver further significant savings to the health system.</p> <p>  A biosimilar is defined as a biological product that is "highly similar" to a licensed biological product, without regard to minor differences in clinically inactive components.  There must also be no clinically significant difference, in terms of safety, purity, and potency, between the "biosimilar" and the original, already approved biological product.  The point being made here is that biological products throughout Europe are not seen as generics and, therefore, they will require a different type of legislation for interchangeability.   Increased prescribing of biosimilars would result in more patients being treated with the same budget, and allow for the introduction and access to new more expensive medicines, in addition to reducing healthcare costs.</p> <p>  Arrangements are in place for the supply and dispensing of high-tech medicines through community pharmacies.  Such medicines are generally only prescribed or initiated in hospital and would include items such as anti-rejection drugs for transplant patients or medicines used in conjunction with chemotherapy or growth hormones.  The medicines are purchased by the Health Service Executive and supplied through community pharmacies for which pharmacists are paid a patient care fee; the cost of the medicines and patient care fees are paid by the PCRS.</p> <p>  As there are no incentives or guidelines for the retail pharmacist to substitute a cheaper generic molecule for the originator, the State continues to pay a higher reimbursement price for such products despite the significant savings that can be made.  Like biosmilars, if systems, incentives and guidelines were put in place for the inclusion of such generics on the high-tech scheme, it would result in more patients being treated with the same budget, and allow for the introduction and access to new more expensive medicines.</p> <p>  The key messages we wish to deliver to the committee are as follows.  The membership of the APMI wants to see more transparency in the setting of reference prices; we must agree a new entry level, currently the entry level is 60% of the original price which is far too low for new entities; less cumbersome method of modulating prices and the introduction of concessionary pricing; the membership wants a viable generic market with some degree of pricing flexibility; and legislation to be enacted so that biosimilar and high-tech molecules can be used to further reduce the cost of pharmaceutical products in Ireland.</p> <p>  The APMI and Generic Manufacturers of Ireland have saved the State significant millions of euro in the past two years, and are committed to delivering similar significant additional savings in the years ahead.  The provision of mechanisms that incentivise the introduction of biosimilars and high-tech scheme products would offer significant savings to the State, and give more patients in the State access to higher cost treatments.</p> <p>  The current reference price model has been effective in delivering savings to date on high volume small molecule products, and the APMI has worked with the State bodies to deliver these savings.</p><p>The threshold that makes this viable has already been crossed on a range of these molecules and medicines which has made them non-viable to supply without the introduction of concessionary pricing.  Further cuts would have a detrimental effect to the supply of medicines in Ireland.</p><p> As a trade representative body, we are keen to work with all parties to help assure the delivery of savings to the State, while assuring continuity of supply and increased access to treatments for Irish patients.</p></speech>

I am currently the Director of Research at the Graduate Entry Medical School, and Founding Director of the Centre for Interventions in Infection, Inflammation, and Immunity at the University of Limerick.  I am also a member of the university's governing authority.  My contribution to this committee is based on work completed, especially by Dr. Suzanne Dunne, and by a broader team comprised of researchers who have extensive experience of health care studies.  The work has led to the completion of a PhD and, for the most part, has been published in high quality peer-reviewed international journals.<br/><br/>This morning as I sat in the Visitors Gallery I heard discussions on reference pricing and pharma economics.  My focus here today will be on people who are at the coalface regarding generic medicines and especially the knowledge, attitudes and awareness of those people which are the influences of their behaviour.  Prior to implementation of the Act in 2013, we initiated a programme of work that allowed us to investigate the perceptions and attitudes of patients, community pharmacists and GPs towards generic medicines.  As Senator Crown will know, the relationship between hospital consultants and hospital-based pharmacists is quite different so we did not engage in any survey of those people.<br/><br/>Our work was designed to explore the topic by generating insights using interviews that were initially recorded, then transcribed and analysed<b></b>using well recognised methods.  This research is different to survey-based research where we know there can be confusion or even an over estimation of the understanding of generic medicines, for example, a misunderstanding of genetic versus generic in terms of the medicine. <br/><br/>We believed that the outcomes from this work would complement research done elsewhere, for example, in the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics.  Also, that the data would be evaluated in the context of there being previous international reports and published papers but relatively little directly focused on the Irish setting.We were unable to find published investigations, that had been completed, on the consumer or pharmacist cohorts in Ireland.  We found only one study on the GP cohort which was published in 1997.<br/><br/>Our work has been peer-reviewed.  Our review of the differences between generic drugs and their originator counterparts, using Ireland as a case study, has been especially well received as a comprehensive exploration of this topic.  It has been accessed more then 20,000 times online which places it in the top 5% of publications, as measured by level of attention, which is indicative of importance of this work and the generalisation of it in an international context.  <br/><br/>We further believed that the outcomes would be unique in allowing us an accurate picture of the situation in Ireland prior to the Act and, as such, it would position us well to revisit and compare these attitudes and perceptions following the introduction of the Act.  In other words, it would allow for an evaluation of the impact of the Act.<br/><br/>I shall summarise some of the take home messages generated by this work.  There is a hierarchy of understanding and acceptance of generic medicines in Ireland.  Let us bear in mind that my explanation here involves generalisations.  While health care professionals tend to have a positive view of generic products we found that pharmacists had the greatest understanding and acceptance, followed by GPs and, to a much lesser extent, the patient-consumer group. <br/><br/>Notably, the GPs had less confidence in generics than pharmacists.  In fact, 15% of GPs involved in our studies, though a small number, would prefer not to use a generic medicine in preference to the originator.  That said, since 1997, there has been a general and significant shift in favour of generic medicines.  Nonetheless, this disparity is problematic.  While pharmacists believed that although they are spending an increasing amount of time with their customers explaining aspects of generic medicines, patients are placing greater credence and trust in the opinions of their GPs. <br/><br/>In contrast with reports from other countries where foreign produced products were believed to be superior, Irish prescribers did not lack confidence in products that are produced in Ireland.  In fact, they recognised the employment and impact that manufacturers contribute to the Irish economy.  <br/><br/>Pharmacists believed that their jobs were becoming more complex due to the stock control requirements related to the sale of branded generics.  Patients expressed the lowest level of confidence.  Almost a quarter stated a preference for the branded medication in addition to a belief that generics were of poorer quality than originator medicines.  However, 25% of pharmacists and over 20% of GPs reported situations where patients complained that an originator medication did not work as well as a generic.  The implication of this is that its the change of medicine <i>per se</i>, rather than the introduction or use of a generic product, that is at the root of their disquiet.<br/><br/>A consistent message emerged from each of the cohorts that we worked with.  It was that the provision of information and relevant education is required on this topic.  In response, and in addition to assessing GPs, patients and pharmacists, we recognised that the information available on the Internet may influence the understanding of generic medicines.  Therefore, we evaluated the quality and understandability of relevant information available internationally and to those in Ireland.  Very similar to other jurisdictions, in Ireland none of the websites most likely to be seen by a searcher demonstrated the desired combination of providing high quality information in a readily understandable fashion.  To provide a potential approach to enhancing the provision of understandable health care information we developed a new tool.  We subsequently validated it using generic medicine information available in the UK, North America, Canada and Australia.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this research addressed a knowledge gap.  It also represents a baseline for the future study of these views post-implementation of the changes.  In the context of modern information provision, clear deficiencies in quality of information and accessibility of text were observed.  A health care and medical information website tool is now available for use in the development of something for the Irish market.<br/><br/>I wish to add some practical recommendations, insights and some points of note.  Approximately 88% of GPs prescribe generic medicines actively.  However, 94% of GPs and over 88% of pharmacists report receiving complaints from patients about generics.  Only 26% of GPs and 21% of pharmacists stated that they actually attempt to educate their patients or customers.<br/><br/>In regard to the mockya medicines comment - I wish to state that I am from Cork - we noted that over 30% of GPs and 64% of pharmacists expressed the opinion that at least some of the negative experiences reported by patients are due to the nocebo effect which is the opposite of the placebo effect.  In other words, if somebody believes they are getting a cheaper product then they do not have confidence in it and, therefore, do not perceive a benefit.  Some 77% of the pharmacists surveyed and nearly 90% of GPs stated they would accede to their patient's preference for a branded product.  In other words, because of the pressures of work, the need to deal with a large number of patients and customers, and the complexities of their jobs, these professionals are unable to spend time trying to persuade patients to take a generic product.  <br/><br/>Finally, patients exhibited a high level of trust in their physicians and 90% of patients stated they would be happy to take a generic medicine if it is prescribed by their GP.</p></speech>

I apologise on behalf of my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, who cannot be here.  I will start with Healthwave and ask Mr . O'Sullivan a few questions.  I found his presentation very interesting.  Healthwave is a retail pharmacy business that caters for all State drugs schemes as well as for private patients who pay in full for their medication.  It was launched in 2013 and it has 10,000 customers.  Mr. O'Sullivan said that there is, on average, 50% savings on monthly prescriptions, free home delivery nationwide and free house calls from its mobile pharmacist team.  Where is Healthwave based?  Is it based in Dublin?</p></speech>

Is it on the Internet?  In regard to free house calls from its mobile pharmacist team, will Mr. O'Sullivan tell us a little bit more about this?  He stated in his presentation that using its software systems, its team of pharmacists can conduct consultations in patients' homes with remote access to any clinical information required.  I presume that is on the Internet.  I presume also that many customers would be elderly and would not have that type of access.  I found the savings to be made and the examples given very real and very interesting.  If Healthwave can do this, why can others not do the same?</p> <p>  I got an e-mail during this meeting stating that the reason the cost of medicine is so high is because of failed competition law, enforcement regime and competition policy.  Does Mr. O'Sullivan have any views on that?</p> <p>  An earlier presentation stated that some medications were said to be in low supply in Ireland.  I made the point that other European countries, such as Spain, many medicines are available at a fraction of the cost.  I know of a number of people who travel from Cork to Newry monthly or bimonthly to fill prescriptions.  I had a case where a man said he filled prescriptions for six members of his family in Newry each month at a fraction of the cost.  If other countries can sell at these low prices, why can we not?</p></speech>

I raised an issue in the earlier session in regard to the possibility that companies had been lobbying our Government, alleging that domestic purchasing policies for the tiny, infinitesimally small by international standards, Irish market in some way influences the siting of manufacturing plants in Ireland.  I said I believed this was nonsense.  It took me a few minutes to find the reference but it was reported by Martin Wall in <i>The Irish Times</i>in December 2012 that high level representations had been made by Mr. Lechleiter from Lilly and Mr. Weldon from Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, among others, to An Taoiseach, suggesting that if we did not get our act together and prescribe expensive branded products, they may think about where they put their investment for jobs, which is nonsense.  We all know that investment for jobs is based almost entirely corporation tax and almost nothing else, except a good workforce.</p><p>The reasons the market fails here are complex and Professor Dunne's contribution has been very helpful.  We have a big cultural job to do on people, patients, pharmacists, doctors and purchasers in terms of being quite willing to move to generic drugs, if generic drugs have passed their analysis and have been approved.  If at that stage anybody has any  reason to believe one of them is less effective, they should then report it to the authorities and ask for repeat testing.  It is surprising how rare that is.  One never hears of that happening.  The products, in general, are quite good.</p><p>I prescribe some horrendously expensive cancer drugs and I made the decision a few years ago to try to save money wherever possible by prescribing generic cancer drugs but one encounters a lot of opposition from patients who repeatedly ask why they cannot have the particular anti-breast cancer tablet they have been taking for years.  I tell them they can have it but that they should know the generic one works just as well and it is a lot cheaper.  We have a job on our hands and our profession has failed a little bit in that regard.</p><p>Another part of the problem is that I do not believe the HSE is very good at purchasing.  It does not run the organisation like a business but rather like a bureaucracy.  One of the ways a bureaucracy deals with budget overruns is to try to delay spending and that is why we have waiting lists for beds, for operations and for clinics.  It is also one of the reasons we have delayed approval of products.  If one can put extra hurdles in the way of the approval of a product and get it into next year's budget as opposed  to this year's one, it helps one, at a time of great constraints in a health service, to meet that panic stricken budgetary deadline that one has to meet the next time.  </p><p>Gardasil, the cervical cancer vaccine, was originally unearthed before the financial meltdown and a correct decision was made to approve it.  A decision was then made, when we really got into the real horrors of constraint in 2008, that it would not be purchased.  However, a year or two years later, it was purchased, following what was alleged by the authorities to have been a robust negotiating process.  I happen to know that no tender was ever asked for either of those drugs at the time of the original rejection.The decision was made on the list price that one could get on MIMS for a vial of the drug which was never going to be the price a whole country, which might be vaccinating 30,000 to 40,000 young girls per annum, would be charged.</p><p>I have a question for Mr. Gallagher.  We hear a lot about the need for indigenous industry.  It was my impression that we had a number of Irish entrepreneur-driven generic houses in this country, which were quite big leaders in the field of generic medicines.  I may have my eye off this particular radar screen but I get the sense that is no longer the case and that most of what we have now is an increasing concentration of generic manufacturing in the hands of an ever smaller number of increasingly massive organisations.  Would this be a mischaracterisation?  Is there something we could do at a public policy level to foster and encourage the redevelopment of an indigenous generic manufacturing sector?  </p></speech>

In regard to Professor Dunne's presentation, one of the key issues is general practitioners and doctors.  They have to be leaders in the field of prescribing generic medication, informing patients and changing the whole culture.  It would appear from the presentation that approximately 15% of GPs have less confidence in generic medication.  This is linked to a question I asked earlier.  I understand there have been development in recent years in that area but can something further be done to ensure the maximum level of prescribing generic medication and that all doctors prescribe the generic form, unless in some exceptional circumstances?</p> <p>  I wonder how Mr. O'Sullivan would react to a suggestion that something which looks too good to be true is too good to be true.</p><p>I am not making a judgment, but I would like to hear his reaction to that question.</p><p> Is there limited availability of home delivery throughout the country?  Is there a restriction on the number of deliveries per annum?  </p><p> Is there a limit to the membership fee or does it increase every year?  What is the set-up of the organisation?  Is it targeted at a niche market in major urban centres?  Is the service available throughout the country in practice?</p><p> The level of generic penetration has increased to 48% of the market, according to the most recent figures available.  I am aware of this issue from my former life as a hospital manager.  </p><p> I am not particularly familiar with biosimilars.  Will Mr. O'Sullivan provide information on them?</p></speech>

Mr. O'Sullivan said Healthwave had been set up in 2013.  The advantage in setting up then was he knew the market he was going after and he probably set it up cost effectively.  I understand there are 1,700 pharmacies in the State, whereas there are only 350 in Denmark.  Does he think pharmacies are facing a major challenge, given that a large number of them expanded between 2002 and 2008 and spent significantly in extending and modernising premises?  Does he think each pharmacy that invested in trying to improve what it offered to its customers has been caught in the downturn, given the fact that medications are reducing in price and that cost competitiveness is the order of the day?  How will this pan out in the next five years?</p> <p>  Mr. Gallagher made a comprehensive presentation.  One of his key messages is that there must be an agreed entry level for reference pricing and that 60% is too low.  What would be a more acceptable approach?  He referred to greater transparency in reference pricing.  Will he elaborate on this?  Where does he think there is a lack of transparency and where can it be improved?  He also referred to the high tech scheme.  Does it require comprehensive legislation or could a minor amendment to existing legislation address the issue?  His strong view is that this is necessary.  Will he outline where the restrictions are under current legislation?</p></speech>

She asked how patients ordered their medicines. The majority of our patients still telephone us to order prescriptions.  This all happens after they have met our pharmacists in person, but most repeat orders are made over the telephone.  They can use e-mail also if they want to do so, but it is not an Internet or a mail order pharmacy.</p> <p>  I will elaborate on our mobile pharmacist service.  We send a pharmacist to patients' houses to review their medication.  This is great for those who are housebound, including the elderly or someone with a new child.  This service was only launched three weeks ago and the uptake has been great.  It means that if someone is struggling to pay for medication and he or she wants to switch to us, he or she does not have to travel to Dundrum which is the only store we have currently.  We will send a pharmacist to him or her for the consultation.</p></speech>

The fee is &euro;25 every year.</p> <p>  Deputy Sandra McLellan asked about the software and the system pharmacists used when making house calls.  She also raised the issue of elderly patients having access to the Internet.  I am not sure if she is referring to Internet access in the home, but our pharmacists have their own Internet access.  We do not expect people to have Internet access and our pharmacists have access through a mobile dongle.</p> <p>  The Deputy then asked why others could not do this.  As Mr. O'Loughlin and Ms Maher alluded to in the earlier session, many pharmacies were set up in more expensive times and locked into high costs, including rents, and engaged in expensive fit-outs.  As Senator Colm Burke said, we set up at a good time.  Despite having much lower margins, we have a responsibility as a business to generate a profit and operate responsibly and we intend to do so.</p> <p>  Deputy Sandra McLellan's final question was related to medication shortages.  She said she had heard of a large number of people travelling to Newry or Spain.  They do not need to do this as they can come to Healthwave.</p></speech>

The legislation enables us to do this, which is great for our model.  Most of the prices quoted in the presentation are for generic drugs.</p> <p>  Deputy Seamus Healy asked whether it was too good to be true.  It is not too good to be true.  People are voting with their feet.  We signed up 10,000 people in one year.  We have taken great time to develop the model and examined the prices of drugs in other countries.  The membership fee allows us to add services and give value to our customers.  The fee will not increase, but it allows us to innovate and introduce services such as house calls and home deliveries.  There are restrictions to home deliveries.  We offer four free deliveries a year as part of the membership fee.  After that, it is &euro;5 per delivery.  Customers pay it every month and it does not seem to be a problem.</p></speech>

While we are a Dublin pharmacy and our customers are predominantly in Leinster, we also have high concentrations in some of the bigger cities such as Cork, Galway and Limerick.  In the Deputy's question on whether the service will be available in practice, I think he is asking if we are trying to service the country from one shop.  We are not; we have expansion plans for more stores in the next few months.  The mobile pharmacy service will always continue given that, no matter where we have a store, there will be people in the community who cannot get to the pharmacy.  It is a very important part of the business.<br/><br/>Senator Colm Burke asked whether the pharmacy sector was under challenge and how I saw it playing out over the next five years.  Ireland has many more pharmacies <i>per capita</i>than other countries, including the UK.  However, given that Ireland is a rural country with the population spread out, one could argue that we need more pharmacies.  There are many unviable pharmacies in Ireland and it stems from the cost base when they were established.  We will see some pharmacy closures during the next five years.</p></speech>

The issue is one we have raised several times in various presentations.  As a generics industry, we need some sort of incentive to introduce the lower valued molecules into the market.  The current 60% entry level on a price is insufficient for us to consider these molecules at the early stage when we start to investigate them, which occurs some years before they come to market.  We would like a tiered approach in order that we can enter the market at a considerably lower price than the originator, but somewhere between that and where these prices are being pitched, for example, a year at 20% or 30%.  We would like some sort of mechanism to achieve it.  Our member companies are turning away generic products with a market value of up to &euro;5 million or &euro;6 million because when we consider them and take into account the pricing and costing, they are not viable in this jurisdiction.  Part of this is due to the size.</p></speech>

Again, there were significant price reductions accompanied by a series of pan-European charts comparing prices across other EU member states and not across the nine countries that were originally covered by the agreement.  We would like to see more precisely what they are comparing with when they arrive at a price for the Irish market.  When we refer to transparency, we mean more information.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-05a.653" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Cullen" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015030500002#U01600"><p>With the economies of scale in the Irish market, there are products for which pricing is going the other way.  Mr. Gallagher alluded to this and Mr. Darragh O&rsquo;Loughlin, secretary general of the Irish Pharmacy Union, mentioned it earlier.  Over the past year, there have been massive price reductions and we encourage competition and generic prescribing because it delivers the big savings that have been delivered over the past year or two, which we have highlighted.  The reference price of an ordinary pack of penicillin in the Irish market is &euro;1.57 compared to &pound;16.06 in the UK market.  Prices have totally changed.  A standard bottle of Flucloxacillin is priced at &euro;6.43 in the Irish market compared to &pound;26.04 in the UK.  These are standard antibiotics that are used by adults and children.</p> <p>  Senator Crown commented on expanding employment in generics manufacturing.  There is a new facility at Athlone Laboratories, which employs 150 people and manufactures penicillin.  Athlone Laboratories has told us selling penicillin in the Irish market does not cover its costs.  Our members are supplying such products on compassionate grounds, given that it is a loss-maker in the Irish market.  We need concessionary pricing on such day-to-day products.  In the UK, there are concessionary prices for products that reach a certain threshold above which they are unsustainable.  We have seen this in recent weeks with the antibiotic Trimethoprim, which is priced in the Irish market at &euro;13.48 for 100 compared with &pound;51 in the UK market.  There are massive differences which result in practices such as parallel export, which we are trying to deal with.</p><p> In response to Deputy Healy's question, a biosimilar is slightly different in that it is not made from a chemical composition or is not manufactured in that way.  It is made by natural sources or biotechnology methods.  For example, expenditure on anti-TNF drugs, which I was looking at yesterday and which are used for auto-immune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, rose by 12.5% over the past 12 months to a value of about &euro;190 million.  There are biosimilars for those products now and massive savings could be delivered by making the substitution.</p><p> Senator Burke asked a question about the high-tech scheme.  It is less immediately about legislation.  At the moment, if products are prescribed in the hospital setting, the patient takes the prescription to the retail pharmacist, who gives the product to the patient although the pharmacy does not buy the product.  The product is given it by the State free of charge.  There is no incentive for the retail pharmacy to substitute that with a generic.  We can supply generic versions of products on the high-tech scheme, many of which are now off patent.  There is currently no mechanism or incentive for the pharmacists to do that.  We ask for that to be provided.</p></speech>

I will answer a number of the questions simultaneously, particularly those of Senator Crown and Deputy Healy.  It reflects the complexity of the interactions between patients, physicians and pharmacists.  It is especially interesting that while the pharmacist probably has the greatest expertise in and knowledge of the drug development process and its regulation, the patient probably has greater trust and credence in the physician.  Coming to Deputy Healy's point, that means the personal attitudes of physicians play a role.  Some physicians will remember things like the indicative drug budgeting scheme from 1993, which, like a similar scheme in the UK, failed to bring about the savings that were expected, and they may have a certain antipathy to this kind of activity.  That being said, the greatest swing in attitudes that has occurred has been in favour of generics.  All the health care providers are on the same page in terms of being able to give the best value to their patients in a safe way.</p> <p>  My last point concerns a question that was put to the GPs and pharmacists when we looked at their perception of safety.  While the pharmacists would be aware that the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, plays a very significant role in ensuring that products available on the Irish market are safe and of high quality, the physicians may not recognise that.</p></speech>

This really relates to my point that GPs no longer really choose what medicine to prescribe, particularly in the community practice setting.  They make use of formularies and automated practice management systems.  Unlike the old days when one consulted a certain book, one is now given a list of the suggested products to prescribe for the condition of the patient.  The challenge is that many GPs are acceding to the patients' wishes because they do not have time to try to educate and persuade them that they should take a generic medicine.</p></speech>

One should bear in mind, however, that our work is based on a qualitative study so a very large number of GPs have not been surveyed.  If one were to carry out a larger study throughout  the country using a body such as the ICGP, one would get very valuable information on GPs' prescribing patterns.  "Rational prescribing", as it is termed, is an area of significant research, but it is not included in the work that we did.</p></speech>

That would be a very different interaction.  It all comes down to the product, be it for acutely ill patients, emergency patients or those in the community setting.  Having regard to generics, we are considering medicines that are commonly prescribed in the community setting.</p> <p>  Let me make my final point, and perhaps a recommendation.  Both the pharmacists and GPs involved in our studies referred to confusion caused by branded generics and the generic products, especially among the elderly they are dealing with.  The colour, shape and packaging of the products are problematic.  If the original product has "Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday" written on its packaging, it would be particularly helpful if the generic packaging also had it written on it.</p></speech>

Is there not a need to educate people?  I am sure the duty falls on a combination of people and organisations.  This relates to my earlier comment that there is a sense of fear and trepidation.  This is borne out in the survey.  If doctors did not accede to their patients' requests and decided, as Senator Crown suggested, to prescribe specific drugs, could it be done?  An issue arises with regard to the patient's confidence and trust in the doctor but, as Senator Crown stated, there is probably no appreciable difference in the types medication.</p></speech>

It is recognised as being exceptionally professional and competent in respect of the regulation of the introduction and the safety of the products available in Ireland.  This takes into account the associated parallel importing challenges.</p><p>The dissemination of information on generic products is problematic in that many people use the Internet as their primary source of information.  When we assessed the information available in Ireland, the UK, Canada, the USA and Australia, we found that Wikipedia is far and away the primary source.  The accuracy of information available from that source is questionable.  When we go further down the list and evaluate the quality and understandability of the information available on various sites, we did not found any site - or certainly no site in Ireland - providing both high-quality and understandable information for the general public which ranked highly in any search.  As members will be aware, people tend not to proceed beyond the first or second page of search results.</p></speech>

There are at least five strong generic companies employing approximately 3,000 people in Ireland.  My colleague Mr. Michael Cullen alluded to certain companies which are not to the forefront, such as Athlone.  There are also other generic manufacturers outside of the membership of the APMI.  However, the development of generics is done on a pan-European basis.  Most of the products are developed through central processing and licensing, with the result that many companies are part-manufacturing products or are campaigning products.  One of the issues for my own company in the past was that we had 28% downtime because of the number of products we were manufacturing.  That is primarily why many of the traditional companies, some of which were family firms, have been absorbed into larger organisations.</p> <p>  In regard to the marking of pharma products, there is no difficulty with including similar packaging to that of the originator, but it should be borne in mind that often there are patents on tablet shape and colour.  This is why one is more likely to see white tablets.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-05a.752" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2015030500002#B01600"><p>The question I want to raise is as relevant to section 14 as to other sections - that is, the interconnectivity between the section and the definition of "egg" in the legislation.  The draft Bill examined by this committee had a definition of "human reproductive material" which included an ovum or part of an ovum.  This had relevance in circumstances in which an ovum was provided but there was a background difficulty with regard to certain genetic diseases that could be inherited, such as mitochondrial deficiencies.  If a husband and wife are using their own reproductive material to conceive a child but the wife has a family history of mitochondrial deficiencies, there can be an intervention under what is now the new frontier of genetic reproductive medicine, which allows for modification of the wife's ova with no impact on the looks or personality or the overall genetic makeup of the child that is ultimately born.  A 0.1% change to the original material in the ovum using material from a donated ovum would prevent that the type of difficulty that arises from what could non-technically be described as mitochondrial disease, where the body is not able to properly digest food to create energy that is necessary.  This can have a dramatic impact on the health and welfare of children and adults in areas both mild and serious, including cardiac and respiratory issues.  This issue was addressed recently when the Westminster Parliament dealt with a deficiency in its own legislation that created a barrier to dealing with this in the context of assisted reproduction.</p> <p>  This is also relevant in a context in which a husband and wife have no fertility issues, in the sense that they can conceive naturally, but there is an inherited mitochondrial disease in the family.  What people may not understand is that the wife's ovum needs to be corrected in this particular way.  I am conscious that this is at the frontier of reproductive medicine.  It is something I was aware of when I prepared the draft Bill, and the reference to part of an ovum was designed to address this issue.  I am conscious that when dealing with legislation there are ten different ways one can draft something to address a problem - there is no perfect drafting methodology - and one can problem-solve with a variety of different phraseologies.  I am not sure whether there is a definitive definition.  In the context of dealing with the embryo, there is a reference to "a human egg" and "a human sperm" and there does not seem to be an recognition, as the legislation is currently drafted - I am open to correction - that one could in fact be dealing with 99.9% of an ovum derived from the wife, with the final 0.1% coming from a donated ovum, which would correct an inherited deficiency that has an impact on well-being and welfare not just for the child that is born but for generations into the future.  This is an issue that is relevant to this section and to earlier sections, and it is important that it be teased out a little.</p></speech>

It was always envisaged when the Bill went to a consultative process that it would be improved and that amendments would be made, as that was the whole purpose of the consultative process.  However, I am concerned that because of the changes that have been effected, this particular issue - the creation of an embryo, and ultimately a child, with contributions from two separate ova - may not be envisaged in the legislation as we are dealing with it.</p></speech>

Its policy is single-egg only.  The issue will be considered undoubtedly in the context of the development of assisted human reproduction, AHR, legislation, which will be worked on comprehensively.  The Minister for Health came to Cabinet some weeks ago and got permission to draft the heads of a Bill and he has announced a consultation for later this year.  The approach I have taken in the legislation arises from the Department of Health's present policy on this issue.</p></speech>

I do not believe there is anyone in this room, in any of the political parties or among the Independents, or anyone outside this House who would be of the view that a medical intervention that can ensure that a very serious genetically inherited physiological difficulty is corrected should not be carried out.  In the context of the hearings that this committee held - I followed them with great interest, and a very interesting report was produced - I am not aware of anyone mentioning a problem with regard to the definitions that were used.</p> <p>  The difficulty with the Bill is that it is dealing with aspects of reproduction.  What the Bill was originally intended to do was to identify parentage in the area of assisted reproduction.  It is doing that in a variety of ways.  A different formula is being adopted, and we will come to that shortly.  I must say, frankly, that there are issues in this Bill that I envisaged would have been dealt with as part of a consultative process that the Minister of Health would undertake.  Why that consultative process did not occur earlier is a mystery to me, because it was my understanding that it would have commenced fairly shortly after the heads of the Bill were published in January 2014.  The Bill seems to be dealing with some aspects of reproduction, and in fact - I am coming back specifically to the issue - it is dealing with some areas that it probably should not be dealing with and omitting other areas that it should be dealing with.  The point is that there are rules and specifics in the Bill with regard to whether anonymous donors are allowed or not allowed, and I am not sure whether we have touched on that.  Yet the Bill seems to be progressing at a great rate this morning without the sections being examined beyond amendments.</p></speech>

Currently, the overwhelming majority of couples who engage in assisted reproduction using donor sperm or ova are entirely dependent on anonymous donation.  There is a risk that this legislation, while providing for a recognition of the parentage of children born through assisted reproduction, will mean that a majority of parents with fertility issues who need assistance through donation will need to go abroad.  It will create another Irish solution to an Irish problem.  The issue of anonymous donation should have been part of the consultative process in which the Department of Health is engaged.  I do not know why it is now in this Bill without the extensive consultation that was required.</p><p> With regard to the issues of parentage and consent to the use of embryos in further DAHR procedures, we are talking about, to take a simple example, a couple who have not used an embryo created from their own reproductive material and are now agreeing that it can be used to assist another couple.  Perhaps this is a conversation that should have taken place on an earlier section.  However, it is relevant to this section and to the definition of ovum that is applicable to determining what is an embryo in the context of the legislation.  I have been part of this process and I have been on both sides of the divide in this committee, both as Minister and as an ordinary Member of the House.  There is no reason for us to enact a definition that is now recognised by our neighbouring Parliament to be out of date.  There is no reason for us to exclude the possibility in the area of assisted reproduction for couples who have fertility difficulties, and for those who do not but who want to correct an inherited deficiency that could have an impact on the life and welfare of the child to be born to them.  There is no reason for not ensuring that we have an adequate definition that addresses this issue.  This is not an issue of major complexity.  I ask the Minister on Report Stage to look at the definition that is being used and to go back and examine the definition that was framed in the heads of the Bill as discussed by this committee.</p><p> I appreciate that the architecture of the Bill has been amended and, knowing how the system works, I do not doubt that some of that change was derived from the Attorney General's office.  Without revealing too many secrets that I should not reveal, I can tell Members that during my three years as Minister there was many an occasion on which I had to engage in arm wrestling with the drafters in the Attorney General's office to ensure the legislation emerged out of that office in the form I wanted to see it.  It seems to me there is a risk that this legislation is going to create a block, if the Minister introduces the provisions on anonymous donation any time soon, on assisted donor reproduction occurring at all in this country for the vast majority of individuals.  We are at risk of creating a block on what I would describe as a crucial health intervention.</p><p> It is important to know where we are coming from.  This area is currently unregulated.  I agree that it is an issue for the Department of Health to introduce regulation for fertility clinics and, frankly, to introduce regulations or laws to deal with the issue of anonymous or non-anonymous donation, but why would we now change something and create a difficulty that does not currently exist?  If someone is able to avail of this advance in reproductive medicine in this country today, why enact legislation that might, when it comes into force, create a block that does not currently exist?  That is the point I want to make.  We know from what the Minister for Health has said that there is no possibility that legislation dealing with the areas he is addressing will come before the Oireachtas and be enacted before the next election.  It has taken decades for us in this State to deal with this matter.  There is very little chance, whatever new Government comes into office in 2016, that the matter will be prioritised for revisiting by the Minister for Health.  We should not create this difficulty.  We should not leave parents in this State with a family history of mitochondrial disease in a position in which the only way they can have that corrected is by travelling to England.</p></speech>

That is a very significant development.  He has also announced wider AHR consultation, which is also important, as there is much on which to consult in this area.  We have the recommendation made by the commission in 2005 for a regulatory authority, which is certainly needed.  In this Bill we are dealing with certain aspects of AHR, but we are not dealing with the wider issues; we are dealing with parentage issues.  I see the particular point raised as being very relevant to that wider debate and that wider consultation.  The Department of Health feels very strongly that there are many ethical issues involved.  Its policy is single-egg only and it is not addressing the issue of mitochondrial disease.  The UK, which has recently legislated on this matter, is the only country to have done so.  Many of the issues that arise are more appropriately dealt with in the wider AHR legislation and consultation.</p> <p>  With regard to anonymous donation, I wish to make a number of points.  The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child speaks about the importance of the child's having access to its own genetic information, and that is the reason we have taken this approach.  It clearly is in the interests of the child that it would have access to genetic information.  This is best practice internationally and is what other countries have done.  They have moved from anonymous donation.  Obviously there are still some countries where there is anonymous donation, and there is a history in Ireland of using both anonymous and non-anonymous donation.  This Bill makes it clear that we are moving to a situation of best practice in terms of donations and that they will be known.  We have gone further and have talked about the type of detail that will have to be kept by the clinics.  We are talking about the consent issues and the access of the child, when he or she reaches the age of 18, to that information.  All of that is dealt with in the legislation on the basis of the right of the child to access its genetic identity.</p> <p>  With regard to the concerns of some of the clinics, I want to reassure them that there will be a transitional period.  Much work remains to be done in terms of working out the detail of this regulation, the consent issues and the various other aspects that are addressed in the Bill.  There will be ample opportunity for the clinics to engage, primarily with the Department of Health, on this issue.  In fact, the Department of Health will hold a stakeholder meeting in the next few weeks in order to work with the clinics and discuss these issues.  I am absolutely clear that the principle outlined in the Bill is the right one in the context of children and going forward with AHR in this country.  There are transitional issues that have to be dealt with, and they will be dealt with, but the principle and the policy are right and they are in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the discussions in the committee, as well as the recommendations of the Ombudsman for Children.  Sweden moved to this system 20 years ago.  The international experience is that there can be a reduction in donations initially, but as the legislation becomes known and as people understand it this issue can be dealt with. </p></speech>

I very much support and have always supported the concept that in so far as is practical and possible children should be able to trace their origins.  That is a fairly basic principle.  We have failed abysmally to address that issue adequately in the area of adoption.</p><p>This is because of the constitutional issues and difficulties that arose in marrying the rights of children with the right to privacy of individuals who placed children for adoption at a time when no legislation on origin tracing existed.  Donation, whether of sperm or eggs, is a complicated and more difficult issue.  There is a diversity of different approaches worldwide.  Some states have no particular rules at all.  The donor may be anonymous or not anonymous.  Some states have a mixture of rules with options for anonymous donation or identified donation.  A smaller number of states require that the donor's identity be known.<br/><br/>The difficulty in Ireland is that it is an extremely small country.  Our population is entirely different from that, for example, of the neighbouring jurisdiction.  I presume that members of the committee have received the letter from the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.  I wish to refer to one particular aspect of it.  In its letter, the institute references the circumstances and the difficulties with regard to assisted reproduction in Ireland.  I do not know if the Minister knows the number of children born through assisted reproduction by donation.  If she does, perhaps the committee should be informed of it.  We are also entitled to know what consultation the Minister engaged in with fertility clinics and those members of the medical profession who are engaged daily in assisted reproduction medicine in this country.  We should not be enacting provisions and saying that we will have a consultative process later.  It was my understanding, when the heads of the original Bill were published, that the Department of Health was first going to engage in a consultative process.  This is why these particular provisions were not in the original draft Bill.  The Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists states in its letter: <blockquote>It must be realised that virtually no sperm, egg or embryo donation occurs in Ireland at present using sperm or eggs donated in Ireland.  It occurs in a handful of cases, usually involving family members or friends.  Virtually all sperm donated and used here is imported sperm, mostly from Denmark, and donor eggs used come mostly from the Ukraine.  Denmark allows anonymous or non-anonymous [donation] and the Ukraine is all anonymous.  The majority of couples having egg donation in fact travel to Spain or the Czech Republic where donation is anonymous.  This practice will undoubtedly continue for many years yet and it will take a slow cultural change for the majority of Irish heterosexual couples to move to open donation.  Many people in Ireland do not live [it says] in a tolerant or liberal community.  Recent appalling coverage in the media confirms this.</blockquote>I will not comment on the last bit.<br/><br/>I am someone who emotionally believes, as opposed to intellectually believes, that children should be able to trace their origins.  However, first, there is no certainty that individuals living in this State, in circumstances in which they have not done so to date, will, in the future, when donation is non-anonymous, provide the necessary donations to facilitate Irish couples in conceiving where there are fertility issues.  Second, it is unenforceable legislation in any case.  Until there is a united global approach, or at a minimum a united European approach, in this area, those who wish to conceive by anonymous donation will simply get on the plane and they will conceive.  Third, even though all of us instinctively feel that children should be able to trace their origins, the truth and the reality is that the children concerned, and it might sound tough to say this, would not be born or exist in many instances without anonymous donation.  It is a question of a balanced and rational approach that needs to be applied.<br/><br/>I am aware of what the UN and other organisations have said.  However, we now live in a remarkably different world.  One reason for recording information about donors or knowing information, for example, about the background of the biological parent or parents of an adopted child was so that its origins could be traced.  The Minister referred to the second reason, which is that individuals would have some knowledge of heritable health difficulties they could suffer as a consequence of the genetic make-up of their biological parents.</p></speech>

Since the discovery of the genome and all of the enormous advances in genetic and hereditary medicine, the idea of having a history from the biological parent which is comprehensive and adequate is now largely irrelevant.</p> <p>  As I understand it, most of those who donate sperm are young men in the 18 to 30 age group.  Unless they are required, be they in Ireland, Denmark or the United States, to provide details of their medical history annually, how their vulnerabilities develop and what their medical history is may not be known until they are in their 50s, 60s or 70s.  By that time, the world will have substantially moved on for the child who has been born.  The practical reality is that we cannot require someone who makes a donation to furnish annual returns as to the state of his or her health.</p></speech>

This discussion illustrates the very broad range of issues in relation to AHR and all of its complexities.  We are the first Government to begin to address this issue and we are, I repeat, addressing some aspects of it regarding parentage in this legislation.  However, there are many issues which will need much more detailed work and consultation because there are so many aspects to the area.  It is primarily a Department of Health area.  I think everyone would agree with this.</p> <p>  The issue of identity is far greater than medical history.  This is the reason all best practice suggests that all of the information about the donor should be made available to the child at a later stage.  The intention is that as much medical history and information as possible would be made available.  If we move from anonymous donation to known donation, the donor is making the decision in a different way because he or she is making it with the knowledge that the information is going to be made available when the child is 18 years of age.  This, as well as the question of ongoing provision of information, changes the perspective and the decision the person is making.</p> <p>  Many of these issues are related to the broader discussion on AHR.   The current policy from the Department of Health is as I have advised.  This is why this section of the Bill is drafted as it is.</p></speech>

My understanding of the structure of the Bill is that any parent to whom a child has been born by use of assisted reproduction by donor up to the time when the Bill becomes operative, and who wants the child to be regarded as their own, must make a court application to do so.  I am talking about the straightforward situation of a husband and wife where the wife has given birth.  The original legislation had a structure where there was a presumption of parenthood and if there was a challenge to the parenthood of a child a court application could be made.  The effect of that was that, for the vast majority of individuals who had a child through assisted reproduction by donor, the child would be regarded as effectively theirs.</p> <p>  I ask the Minister again if she is aware of the number of children who have been born by assisted reproduction by donor over the past 30 years?  What work has been done to assess how many court applications could arise if the only way to establish parentage of a child born where there has been a donated sperm or ova is through the making of a court application?  What consideration has been given to the capacity of the courts to cope with that?  What consideration has been given to the difficulties that might arise if, as is likely, there are hundreds and possibly thousands of children whose parents will not make this application as the children may already be adults or no longer be living in this country?  Issues with parentage could arise on the death of a parent where there is a succession dispute.  Will the fact that a person did not apply create a difficulty and will there be some measures in the Bill to address the consequences of this?  </p> <p>  Perhaps I misunderstand the Bill but it does seem to me to envisage that where there has been a birth through assisted reproduction and a donated sperm or ova there will not be an assumption of parenthood by virtue of the fact that the couple residing together, whether they are married or a same sex couple, will require a court decision.  If the Minister wants to provide for a degree of certainty in this matter, the Bill could have both the presumption and, should problems arise later, the facility to apply for a court declaration so that a person could marry the two processes.  Removing the presumption leaves individuals vulnerable and will result in a lot of unnecessary court applications being made.</p></speech>

One of the difficulties in this whole area, which emerges when one begins to examine it, is that there is not much in the way of statistics so it is difficult to give precise numbers.  There is no legislation covering the area, and while there are EU regulations and Medical Council guidelines there are poor data because not all the clinics operating in the country provide the information to the relevant European group.  We received a lot of representations on this point and it is envisaged that the couple would have an opportunity to deal with the issue retrospectively.  We have built a procedure into the legislation whereby the couple can go to court to present the information and have the issue dealt with.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-05a.792" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2015030500002#E02000"><p>May I respond?  It is relevant because there is a connection between the children to whom the sections apply and the process whereby declarations of parentage are sought in the District Court.  We sometimes think we have to invent wheels that have long since been invented in other countries.  I do not know the exact statistics but as far as I am aware, there have been many thousands conceived and born over the past 30 years as a result of assisted reproduction by donor.  Many of them are now adults getting on with their lives and not all are living in Ireland.  Members of the committee may not be aware of this but we used to have what were known as "presumptions of paternity".  Mothers in our law were always individuals who gave birth but the issue was often who was the father.</p><p>There were presumptions of paternity.  If a married woman gave birth to a child, the presumption was that her husband was the father.  Now we are living in a more complex world of assisted reproduction where children are being conceived by donated ova and sperm.  In other jurisdictions they move from presumptions of paternity to presumptions of parentage and the architecture used in the draft Bill provided for presumptions of parentage and was based on international precedence that had worked well in a variety of other countries.  It was not a reinvention of a wheel that does not work; it was the transplanting of a wheel into our legislation that has proved to work well.</p><p> The Minister has said that presumptions of parentage are taken out of the Bill.  In the context of couples who have fertility issues in the context of using donated sperm or ova, or even now, in the context of the issue I raised previously, where one may need a small intervention in a married woman's ova or in a gay woman's ova to correct an inherited difficulty, presumptions of parentage become a lot more important.  I do not understand why presumptions of parentage are taken out of the Bill.  I genuinely do not understand it.  Happily, it has nothing to do with the Department of Health.  It is to provide some degree of certainty as to the parentage of children in circumstances where issues might arise.  It is a good idea that one not only has the presumption, but that the parents of a child, or the child himself or herself, has the facility to make application to the court to get a declaration of parentage but that was always in the draft Bill.</p><p> We currently have in our law provisions that derive from the Status of Children Act 1987 where one can make application to the courts for declarations as to parentage or paternity.  I urge the Minister to reintroduce the presumptions on Report Stage.  It is a serious issue.  I do not think one can say one will only recognise that the people who have cared for a child born through assisted reproduction throughout the child's life are the true parents of the child if they make a court application and get a court declaration.  If that invitation is taken up and if presumptions are not in the Bill, there could be thousands of applications taken to our courts which could be snowed under in trying to deal with them, albeit I appreciate they may not be contested applications.  The volume of those applications could be enormous.  There is also the blindingly obvious issue of should individuals incur legal costs in having to make those applications where there is no inter family dispute as to who the child is and who should be regarded as his or her parents and there is no conflict as to whether the parents consented to the use of assisted reproduction.</p></speech>

It appears to preclude what is termed DIY DAHR.  As the Minister is aware there are currently many families who have availed of reproduction outside of that parameter.  The concern is whether that would impact on their guardianship and parental rights.  I appreciate that the DAHR facilities would have a robust method of fully informing the persons involved in terms of consent and ensuring they are kept up to date.  Is the Minister ruling out any other means of reproduction outside of DAHR facilities?  Is that what this section about?  In terms of those who are currently availing of that facility, how are they impacted?  To repeat a phrase used earlier, what are the unintended consequences?</p></speech>

There are numbers of people who would use what they describe as traditional methods to effect a pregnancy in circumstances which may not involve intercourse but which may involve a donation, particularly of sperm, which would facilitate somebody becoming pregnant.  There is an issue around that and how that is to be regarded under the Bill.  Relevant to the preceding section - I did not want to hog matters in any way - is the question I asked earlier and I want to ask it again.</p><p>What consultation has been engaged in to date with members of the medical profession engaged in reproductive medicine and the fertility clinics with regard to the practice of assisted reproduction by donor continuing in this State should these provisions be introduced?  Has the Minister considered what I believe would be a more appropriate and balanced approach, which I again say should be dealt with by the Department of Health and should not be part of this legislation, which is to make provision for assisted reproduction by both anonymous donor and non-anonymous donor, which is, because of the type of difficulties I referenced earlier, a policy that has been adopted in some other states where either is a possibility?</p><p>  I want to come back to this without repeating everything I said previously.  I do not believe that these sections in this Bill should be enacted in the context of maybe we will engage in a consultative process later or the Department of Health will do it.  Either there has been a consultative process and the problems that I have described have been addressed, and what is stated here by the Minister disagrees with what is stated by the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in the passage I read out, or, if the Minister agrees with what I read out, how is it that we are in this space where this is going ahead with these provisions in it that were not part of the original consultative process and without, as it seems to me, an adequate consultative process having occurred?  I think it is only now dawning on members of the medical profession that this is an area of major difficulty.  </p><p>  I do not believe that the majority of couples who currently anticipate requiring assistance from fertility clinics and assisted reproduction would be aware of what we are doing with this Bill on this issue and I do think this aspect of the Bill should be part of a broader consultative process because it was not part of the original consultative process on the Bill.  That consultative process would appropriately be dealt with, without upsetting members of this committee, by the health committee because it uniquely requires looking at some medical issues and availabilities.  I do not want us, out of the best of idealistic motives, and I am not attributing any ill motives to anyone, by facilitating children to trace their origins, to create the unintended consequences of creating a barrier which up to now does not exist to assisted reproduction by donation in Ireland.</p></speech>

These provisions have been carefully designed to allow the assignment of parentage in limited and specified circumstances.  A requirement that the treatment takes place in a clinical context is an important element of the safeguards included.  If wider provision were made for the assignment of parentage other than on the basis of genetic connection, this obviously would have significant consequences for the positions of natural fathers, for example.</p><p>There are several difficulties with Deputy Mac Lochlainn's proposal even if consents can be taken in broadly the same way as envisaged in sections 4, 9, and 11 of the Bill.  In particular, it will not be possible to have independent verification that the child was born through a donor assisted human reproduction procedure and it will, therefore, not be possible to provide the necessary certificate under section 25(5).  That certificate is essential to enable a couple to jointly register as the parents of a donor-conceived child.  There would also be significant difficulty in ensuring that the safeguards allowing revocation of consent by a donor can be properly implemented.  The case law on the position of a donor in cases of self-insemination is to be found in the Supreme Court judgment in the case of McD <i>v</i>. L.  This found that the man concerned was, in law, the child's father and had the same statutory rights to seek guardianship, custody,and access as another non-marital father.</p><p>The Bill does not attempt to regulate this issue or, for example, to ban it.  It has the consequences though in relation to parentage as set out in section 5.  However, where all of the adults involved are in agreement and it is in the best interest of the child concerned, there are options available which will allow a non-biological parent to secure a legal relationship with the child.  That person could apply for guardianship of the child under section 6(<i>c</i>) of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, as inserted by section 45 of the Bill, leaving the parental status of the natural father unaffected.  Alternatively, of course, the mother and her partner could jointly adopt the child under the Adoption Act 2010 as it is proposed to be amended by this Bill.</p><p>In short, they will have a route to parentage which does not run the risk of undermining the position of natural fathers.  I cannot accept the amendment.  There is a very clear process and approach laid out in the Bill in relation to the question of the procedure and where it is carried out.</p></speech>

If they have the aid of clinicians and they have legal advice outside of the parameters suggested in this proposed legislation, is there any room for flexibility in terms of those who have gone down this course already?  There is a sense that, as a result of this legislation, they will have lost the rights that they would have assumed they had or they see themselves as having less equality with parents who have gone down the route of the DAHR clinic process.</p></speech>

The strong legal advice that I have is absolutely against doing that and the case law that I have quoted in relation to the Supreme Court is very clear about the assignation of parentage in that case.  The way the Bill is constructed is to ensure that where there is that transition from the donor to parentage, there is a very clear route outlined for all involved so that the rights of everyone are protected, the donor and the parents.  What we have done in the Bill is that we have outlined clear routes to parentage but we have the safeguards of where the procedures are taking place and the independent verification of them.  That really is the essence of the approach.  As far as I am aware, there is no precedent for what the Deputy describes of opting out of the parentage provisions by a donor by way of affidavit.  I am not aware of any precedent for that.</p><p>This Bill is a beginning and in looking at this Bill, Deputy Shatter was dealing with the parentage aspects in order to have clear procedures in this area regarding what I call the routes to parentage where there was donor-assisted reproduction.</p></speech>

A number of recommendations arose from the committee's consideration regarding the question of identity.  A clear recommendation came from the committee in that regard, of which I took note, as well as from the Ombudsman for Children and the relevant international provisions.  That is what primarily has determined the approach regarding the child's right to genetic information.  It is very much a case of considering it from the point of view of the best interests of the child.  This is what has informed the approach in the Bill.  There has been ongoing consultation between the Department of Health and the relevant clinics and their submissions have also been considered.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-05a.833" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2015030500002#H01000"><p>Unless I am missing something, it appears to me that the Minister is stating that neither she nor her Department has been engaged with the fertility clinics and that they have not considered the difficulty that could arise if we move from anonymous donation to identifying donors.  No assessment has been undertaken as to whether a barrier will now be erected when this comes into force and will be placed in the way of couples who wish to conceive in Ireland through assisted reproduction by donor.  I apologise but this is too important an issue.  This legislation is designed to do something that has been ignored for too long in this country, that is, to provide rules with regard to parentage of children born through assisted reproduction.  Unfortunately, the issue of surrogacy effectively has been abandoned to whoever is in government the next time around.</p> <p>  However, one should not do something that has unintended consequences.  I accept absolutely that the Minister does not intend these consequences.  I accept absolutely that this is a well-intentioned approach to ensure that children can have information with regard to biological parents, that is, the donors.  I accept absolutely the intentions behind this are well-intentioned and would not wish anyone to misinterpret what I am saying.  I believe the necessary consultation on this matter has not occurred and that it will have unintended consequences.  I believe it will greatly stress couples who have personal fertility issues and will create a difficulty for the continued work on existing fertility clinics.  Moreover, I do not think it is good enough, for example, to state that while the measure will be enacted, it will not be brought into force instantly but that the Government will then engage in a consultative process.  There must be some certainty in this environment for both couples and members of the medical profession as to the direction they are taking over the next period of time.</p> <p>  I wish to give one simple example in this regard.  At present, there are couples throughout the country who are having difficulties in conceiving.  They will be getting some medical assistance and, inevitably, will be attempting to conceive without assisted reproduction.  The next stage may well be that they will attempt to conceive through assisted reproduction by use of their own reproductive material.  The third step, if that does not work, may be by donor.  In circumstances in which couples may have some reasonable prospect of conceiving by use of their own material without donor, will members, because these provisions are coming down the track, put them in a position where, if they wish to go through assisted reproduction in Ireland, they must forget about that and must conceive rapidly through anonymous donation for fear that in six, 12 or 18 months' time, there simply will not be donors in this country and their only alternative option will be to leave the State?  Are we going to put couples in that position?</p> <p>  It is too serious to simply state there will be a consultative process later on and it is unfair.  I acknowledge the Minister's amendments in this area are well-intentioned.  I am totally familiar with the international legal provisions to which she is making reference and am aware of the recommendation of this committee.  However, while I am open to correction by members, I do not think the committee explored whether, if we did what is now proposed, it could have the unintended consequence of bringing to an end for a time assisted reproduction by donor in Ireland.  I do not believe any member of this committee envisaged that unintended consequence as a possibility.  Moreover, I do not think one should simply ignore what the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists is saying about this issue.  I urge the Minister to rethink the presence of the provisions contained in this section and related sections.  I will not come back and repeat this but I urge the Minister to rethink the appropriateness of their inclusion in this Bill with a view to what she states should occur, that is, the engagement of the Department of Health in a consultative process and these elements of this Bill being removed from it on Report Stage.  Let the Department of Health get on with its consultative process, which is the area in which it should be dealing and not on the issue of parentage in the context of surrogacy.  This is the particular area with which it should be dealing.  Let us not create a difficulty or unnecessary worries for people by the enactment of this measure in its current form without understanding the unintended consequences.</p></speech>

Each member of the committee has a significant understanding in this regard and obviously wishes to support the very best practice in this area.  At this stage of the discussion, it is appropriate for me to state that in respect of the broader regulation of assisted human reproduction, the regulation of clinics and all the details this area involves, which are many, complex and evolving, the appropriate place for such discussions clearly is in the development of the legislation being undertaken by the Department of Health.</p> <p>  As for concerns about the future of donor-assisted human reproduction in Ireland, if one examines the position internationally, when countries moved from anonymous donation to known donation, donor-assisted human reproduction did not stop in those countries.  It simply meant that best practice was in place with regard to protecting the interests of the child.  While I clearly desire to have a system that is effective and that works, there are a couple of key principles, one of them being a move from anonymous to known donation.  I already have spoken about that.  As I stated, there is not evidence available from elsewhere that in the longer term, this has been a problem in countries which have moved in this direction.  In addition, I have made it clear that a stakeholder meeting is coming up between the Department of Health and the clinics.</p><p>I have already spoken with the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, on a transition period.  We can examine the length of the transition period so that these issues can be dealt with.  The range of concerns the clinics have can be worked through during that transition period, but in terms of the routes to parentage and assigning parentage in this Bill, I have very much taken the approach that it should be known donations rather than anonymous ones.</p></speech>

The first deals with those who have selected or paid for anonymous sperm.  We seek that they would be given a further period after the enactment of the legislation to avail of the process on which they have already embarked.  It is a very sensitive and difficult process for the hopeful parents involved and the intention is to take account of that.  I understand 600 to 700 patients across the country would be prevented from completing their treatment and they are the people addressed in the proposed new section 24(8).</p><p>Section 24(9) deals with those who have initiated the process of anonymous egg donation and allows them to complete their treatment cycles.  The third subsection deals with having the same donor to produce siblings.  We are advised that it would be reasonable to allow three years from the birth of the first child.  If the legislation as put forward by the Minister is enacted it would apply to people who engage for the first time in the process, but the intention is to take a compassionate approach to those who have already engaged in the process in recent years in order that would be allowed to complete the cycle.  That is the advice we have been given.  We are hopeful the Minister will accept it as it is a very reasonable amendment.  It is a compassionate amendment.</p></speech>

In principle, I broadly agree that such a transitional period has its merits and I stress in that regard certain transitional provisions are already included in section 20(5) and 20(6) of section.  The Deputy's provision in the proposed section 24(10) would to some extent cut across the provisions set out in 20(6) which sets out a three year period from the commencement date to allow the couple to have a sibling using gametes from the same anonymous donor.  That is a very specific section to deal with the issue of siblings.</p> <p>  As an alternative to the amendment, I propose to give a clear commitment to the Deputy, together with the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, that Parts 2 and 3 will not be commenced for a minimum period of one year from the date of enactment and that would provide at least the same transition period which would enable couples currently undergoing treatment to continue with that treatment and will give clinics time to prepare for the new regulatory framework.  This is a practical and pragmatic administrative solution to which I will give a binding commitment so that we will have a seamless transition to the new regulatory framework.  On the basis of my commitment in that regard I ask Deputy Mac Lochlainn not to press the amendment.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-05a.857" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2015030500002#J02200"><p>First, I will address the specific provision the Minister referenced.  It is section 24(5).  It provides for a period of three years from the date on which that subsection comes into operation, a gamete to which paragraph (a) of that subsection does not apply may be used, basically, in an assisted human reproduction procedure.  Then it goes through a whole series of issues.</p> <p>  The three years is the problem.  I am going to ask the Minister to amend that on Report Stage because in circumstances where there is frozen material available to be utilised in assisted reproduction, that could be used over many years.  In the context of that, it does not make sense that it is confined to a three-year period.  For example, where a couple has an arrangement or where material is available, will it be the case that if one wants to have children, one had better have three in three years?</p> <p>  I do not understand the three-year provision.  It creates unnecessary difficulties.  Could the Minister clarify if, for example, this were to apply to an embryo, if a number of embryos were created - I understand it will apply - let us assume there are five frozen embryos that a husband and wife can utilise to conceive a child and a donor has been involved with regard to the material required to create the embryos, are we going to say to them, first, any ones that can be utilised to conceive must be done within three years of the enactment of the Bill because the donor was anonymous?  That makes no sense.  There is no merit in it and I would suggest that should be revisited.</p><p> When replying in respect of Deputy Mac Lochlainn's amendment, the Minister indicated that Parts 2 and 3 of the Bill will not be brought into force for a minimum of one year and possibly longer.  I am of the view that Part 3 should be removed from the legislation entirely.  The difficulty with Part 2 is that it contains provisions relating to identifying the children born through assisted reproduction.  I am quite happy that the provisions which should have been left to the Department of Health to deal with in the first instance will not be brought into force for a minimum of one year.  I suspect that some of them will never be brought into force in their current state.</p><p> There is an urgent need to make specific rules in respect of the area of parentage.  Under the enabling provision in the legislation, at section 1(3), the Minister "may appoint by order or orders either generally or with reference to a particular purpose or provision and different days may be so appointed for different purposes or different provisions".  Basically, this means that he or she may bring different sections into operation.  There is an urgent need to provide clarity with regard to the parentage of children born through assisted reproduction.  It is bad enough that we are leaving out children born by means of surrogacy, particularly in the context of the number of court cases which have taken place to date on that issue and the number of parents and children affected.  We should not be saying that we are not going to provide clarity for children who are born via assisted reproduction for a minimum of one year and possibly longer.</p><p> I do not want the Minister to be in a position in the future where when she wishes to bring certain sections into operation, she will be of the view that she has made a pledge not to do so.  I hope that when the legislation is enacted, the provisions which offer clarity regarding parentage will be brought into force.  Even though I disagree with the necessity for individuals to be obliged to go before the courts to obtain orders or declarations of parentage which indicate that their parents consensually agreed to use assisted reproduction by donor, we should postpone the possibility of their being able to do so for a minimum or possibly a good deal longer.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the blanket promise to the effect that Part 2 will not be brought into force for at least a year.  The parentage identity provision should be implemented immediately.</p><p> I welcome the fact that Part 3 will not be brought into force for at least one year.  It would be preferable if the matter to which it relates were dealt with by the Department of Health.  Whatever the position, the three-year provision in section 24(5) must be revisited.</p></speech>

I will be introducing a further provision on Report Stage to clarify the position even further.  For constitutional and other reasons - but mainly constitutional ones - embryos are permanently exempted from this provision.  Even if the donation is anonymous, it will be permanently exempted.  I wish to make that point perfectly clear to the Deputy.  Parts 2 and 3 are inextricably linked because they set out in the Bill the whole approach we believe is necessary in the context of identity.  They also construct the framework to be put in place in order to ensure clarity in respect of the various routes to parentage.</p></speech>

That is regrettable.  I do not believe there was a necessity to mix these issues up in this particular way.  I urge the Minister to reconsider what is being done here.  If she insists on going down the road of including in the Bill measures which would more properly be dealt with under legislation relating to the Department of Health and which are clearly recognised as creating a difficulty in the context of assisted reproduction by donation, then the issues to which I refer should be separated from the rules relating to parentage.  They are of no relevance at all to the thousands of children already born by means of anonymous donation for whom a court procedure is being provided in order that they might definitively identify who are their parents so that their parentage will not be a matter of dispute in the future.  It is regrettable that the issues in question have become interwoven in the way I have outlined.  I make these points because it has taken us 30 years to get to the point of enacting legislation in this area.  I urge the Minister to examine the architecture of the Bill in order that the parentage of children born to date can at least be readily determined, addressed and dealt with and to ensure that matters will not be left in limbo for a minimum of one year and possibly longer.</p></speech>

I propose to amend the references in subsections (5) and (6) to consent to a form that is substantially the same as provided for in sections 6 and 14.  This is because that is too high a threshold for these particular transitional provisions.  Accordingly, I will amend the Bill in order to clarify that the consent in question is to the use of the gamete embryo in a donor-assisted human reproduction procedure.  I will also make further provision to clarify that where a couple already have embryos - formed using gametes from one of them and from donor gametes - stored in a clinic, there will be no limitation on the time within which they may use those embryos.  This is the point I sought to clarify earlier.</p></speech>

Effectively, however, what is proposed means that gay couples who have had children through assisted reproduction will be left in a position whereby, for a continuing and indefinite period, the parentage of their children will not be capable of being definitively addressed.  That is most regrettable.</p></speech>

This is not in place yet.  Regarding the original provisions in the Bill and the developments in the provisions dealing with identity, the appropriate ministry is the Department of Health.  I thank the Department for the work it has done in this because provisions have had to be brought in ahead of the comprehensive legislation needed in this area.  There has been detailed contact and consultations with the Department to arrive at this particular architecture in the legislation.</p> <p>  In the first instance, this register would be the responsibility of the Department of Health which has agreed to take it on.  As the legislation develops, the work that unit is doing within the Department of Health would be taken over by the authority which will be responsible for AHR.  The Department will be responsible for the development of this register.  It has much contact with the clinics and it will be working closely with them to establish the range of procedures necessary to ensure this will operate effectively.</p></speech>

Whatever legislation the Department of Health is working on that might get published in 2016, 2017 or 2018 will provide for the creation of a regulatory authority in the area of assisted reproduction fertility clinics.  It again illustrates why this aspect of this legislation should be dealt with by the Department of Health and should not be in this Bill.  What is becoming clearer as we are having this discussion is that these provisions in this Bill will create a blockage on reforms relating to identifying the parentage of children born through assisted reproduction for heterosexual couples or gay couples across the country and that there is no certainty as to when any of the provisions in Parts 2 or 3 will come into force.</p> <p>  The reason it is important is because the architecture is making the presentation that this is a function that the Minister for Health is personally going to perform or his officials.  When we come to sections 32 and 33, we will see that the Minister is then given an adjudicative function which is, because of its nature, completely inappropriate for a Minister to engage in.  The adjudicative function will be around determining what information may or may not be given to a donor-conceived child who has achieved the age of 18 years or the parents of a donor-conceived child.</p></speech>

I am again making the point that I know what the Minister is doing is well-intentioned.  It is another indicator, however, that crucial aspects of the legal architecture still need to be created.

I am not for a moment suggesting that the development of the national donor-conceived person register would wait until there is an independent regulatory authority dealing with donor-assisted human reproduction, DAHR.  I am simply making the point that in the longer term, clearly that is envisaged.  We need that and that is quite obvious from the commission's original report of 2005.  What I am saying is that in discussions with the Department of Health, it has agreed that it will be responsible for the development of the national donor-conceived person register.  We do not have an authority at present, so we have to identify where this work is going to be done.  There are clearly resource issues as well, which the Cabinet has discussed and of which the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, is well aware, but the Department of Health has accepted that this would be part of its responsibility in terms of the implementation of this Bill.  That decision has been made and the Department of Health has agreed to it.  There is no question of putting off the implementation of this element of the Bill until there is an authority in place.  I simply made the point that in the longer term, clearly these provisions would transition into an authority when it is established.</p></speech>

Deputy Shatter has mentioned since early this morning that there are different threads running through sections and I agree with the points he has been making all along, but we are only now coming to deal with the points in these sections.</p> <p>  I have done quite a degree of extensive work on the adoption information and tracing legislation.  I believe that instead of a contact register being set up in this area for children who are born as a result of the donor-assisted human reproduction procedure, as in the case of children born naturally, a no-contact veto provision should be provided.  As much information as possible should be provided both on the donor side and on the side of the child who was born as a result of the donor-assisted human reproduction procedure.  That information should be on a register in as much detail as I would be advocating in terms of the adoption information and tracing legislation, so that either the donor or the child could register.  They would have to give this information but they could put in a no-contact veto provision stating that they do not wish to be contacted, rather than an application having to be sent to the Minister or whoever seeking the information and the Minister having to check what is on the file.  The Minister mentioned that there would be a stakeholders' meeting after this and she mentioned time and again the role of the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs should certainly be brought into this discussion on this area as well.  If the information on the tracing legislation goes through, and I hope it goes through in this D&aacute;il term, and if the Minister takes up my suggestion about including a no-contact veto provision, there would then be a difference between children and adults who are born as a result of the donor-assisted human reproduction procedure and children who are born naturally.  I am not sure what is the politically correct way to put that, but that should be re-examined.</p></speech>

In developing this legislation, what is very much in our minds is the very difficult issues that have emerged in regard to the situation where children did not have access to identity and genetic information.  That has been a central part of our approach to the setting up of provisions to ensure that as much information as possible would be given to the child.</p> <p>  Deputy Ferris, in the first instance, might elaborate on the no-contact veto provision in order that I understand precisely what is meant by that because obviously that would have to be translated into legal terms and I can then respond to the points she has made.</p></speech>

That is why I suggested that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs should also brought into this conversation when the stakeholders meet.  I was working on the adoption information and tracing Bill rather than on this Bill but it applies to this one as well.  All possible information about the birth mother or birth parents and the child who was adopted should be on the register.  In a case where a child, on reaching a certain age, or a birth mother would contact the register of adoptions seeking information to see if there is corresponding information there, and the information from both sides would be on the register for health and various other reasons, if the birth mother did not want to be contacted by her child at any stage, she could put a no-contact veto provision on the register.  Her information, details about herself, her medical history and other information she might want to provide would be on the register, but instead of that person being contacted and advised by the Adoption Authority that their child wants to contact them, and a certain time being allowed for that person to respond, that person, either the adult child or the birth parent, could put on the register that they do not wish to be contacted.  I know people have fears about harassment and all of that but we already have legislation in place that covers that.  I made quite a long submission to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs on this issue on behalf of the Labour Party, so it is on the record.  I would ask the Minister and her officials to contact the office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to get this information.</p> <p>  An aspect in this respect that might create a difficulty arises under section 33(3).</p></speech>

They want to know information about themselves.  If, say, the birth parent or, in this case, the donor gave the information about themselves but did not want to be contacted, they could still give information about their medical background.  That is far more optimistic and healthy in terms of the future and it will help many people.  That is the basis on which I am proposing this.  If we were to put in the wording as it is, it would be completely different from what will be possible in the adoption information and tracing legislation.</p></speech>

The child will not be contacted with the request if he or she has not made a notification that he or she is willing to be contacted, so the donor cannot veto.</p><p>That is a vital component of the approach we have taken to consent in the Bill, so that if one is a donor and is making a donation, one will be told that a child has the right to that information at age 18 and one will be asked to give as much information as possible.  The range of that information will have to be worked out, but there are fairly accepted international standards.  I have a great deal of information on what has happened in other countries when they have moved from anonymous to known donation.  We are saying that the donor cannot veto and that is an important part of the approach we have taken to consent.  Once the donor is involved, the donor will know there is a register and that the child has access to that information and can be given all the details the clinic has at that point.</p></speech>

This section provides for two things: for information to be given either to a child over 18 or to the parents of a child under 18 concerning matters recorded in the register.  However, it also provides in subsection (2) that the donor of a sperm or ovum, and it will more frequently be sperm than ova because of the way reproductive medicine tends to work and the difficulties people experience, "may request the Minister to provide him or her with information from the Register on the number of persons who have been born as a result of the use in a DAHR procedure of a gamete donated by the donor, and the sex and year of birth of each of them".  How will that work in practice?  Is the Minister obliged to respond and provide the information?  Is there a timeframe within which information should be provided?  Is there any basis for the Minister not to provide the information?  I am just curious about how that will work in practice.  I am open to correction, but it does not seem that there is anything else in the Bill of relevance to that subsection if the Minister refuses, for example, to provide the information, or decides to take five years to make the decision.  I may be wrong.</p></speech>

That is the extent of the information the donor can request.  I intend to amend this section on Report Stage to oblige the Minister for Health to comply with a request for information from the national donor-conceived person register, subject to the provisions of sections 33 to 35, inclusive, and to provide that the donor of an embryo who has provided gametes used in that embryo will be able to request information on whether a child has been born as a result of the donation.

In subsection (3)(a) it is stated "if satisfied that sufficient reasons exist to withhold the information concerned from the donor-conceived child" and so on.  Does that close the door completely on information being given?  People get on in years, they change their minds and circumstances can change.  Does that provision close the door completely on information being given, or can a request for the information being submitted at a later stage?</p></speech>

If that situation changed, clearly, the request could go in again.  Obviously, there could be an appeal by the person as well to the Circuit Court and notice would be given to the Minister.  It must be heard otherwise than in public in these particular circumstances because they would be very unusual circumstances.  It is a provision included for exceptional circumstances where the child's safety would be prejudiced by releasing the information.</p><p>There is a process.

There is obviously an interaction between subsection (2) and subsection (3), in that under subsection (2) the Minister must within 12 weeks from the date on which notice was sent release to the child the information requested unless the relevant donor makes representations to the Minister setting out how it would affect the safety or well-being of the donor or the donor-conceived child or both.  It seems to be an issue of safety or well-being.  I do not know in legal terms what the phraseology "well-being" means.  I have absolutely no idea what it means.  The meaning of "safety" is reasonably clear but I do not know about "well-being".  In the context of the donor, should the well-being solely relate to the donor or to anyone associated with the donor, such as children born to him by a partner, whose well-being needs to be considered in all of this?  I simply do not know the answer to this.</p> <p>  Subsection (3) states the Minister shall consider these representations and if satisfied sufficient reasons exist to withhold the information, may do so.  The words "well-being" and "sufficient reasons" are not adequate.  As the child will be over 18, will the best interests principle be applicable or some other principle because the child at that point will be an adult?  In the context of the adoption legislation and the difficulties around tracing origin and giving information, the paramount consideration when making a decision about revealing information was the welfare of the child.  We now use, correctly, the formula "best interests".</p> <p>  These provisions are very unclear.  It is not clear whether the Minister must state the reasons he or she makes a decision.  There should be an obligation to expressly state what the reasons are.  It is not clear procedurally.  For example, if the donor objects, will the Minister have in front of him or her an application for information and a donor objection?  Will any of the information contained in the objection be furnished to the now adult child?  I do not know the answer to this.  Will the child have an opportunity to respond?  I am not clear on this.  Will any fair procedures apply?  I do not know.</p> <p>  In the context of an appeal there should be an obligation that the court knows the exact basis on which the Minister has withheld information.  Presumably whatever document is furnished to the Minister by the donor will have to go to the court.  We cannot have a court process where an adult child makes an application without the adult child knowing what it is he or she will confront.  Some form of the objection will have to be given to the child, even if it is redacted to exclude the name and identity of the individual who has raised objection.  I am not sure why we are doing it in the Circuit Court, other than Circuit Court judges often behave better than some of our District Court judges do in giving time to deal with family cases and family issues.  This is a serious practical problem but it is another day's issue.  There are problems and this has not been fully thought out.  There are difficulties with it.</p> <p>  The Minister must make a decision within 12 weeks and release the information.  This cannot take place until a child is 18.  If the notice goes out to an address of the donor that the donor gave at the time he donated sperm, who is to know whether the donor receives the information?  Is there any provision to ensure this will be sent to an up-to-date address?  There are issues which need to be teased out.  I do not want to go on at any greater length, but I am not sure how well this has been thought out.</p> <p>  I am concerned about how legal costs will be dealt with.  Let us say the Minister makes a decision to turn down an application.  Subsection (3) states an appeal on notice to the Minister will be held otherwise than in public.  Will notice to the Minister make the Minister a defendant in the proceedings?  Let us presume I am a 20 year old who wants to obtain this information, and on the basis of something the donor has said, the Minister makes a decision I should not get information.  Could I find myself in a Circuit Court application with the Minister represented by senior and junior counsel and either representing myself or being represented by a solicitor?  What legal costs will arise in this process?  This is an important issue.</p> <p>  The provision also states it will be heard otherwise than in public.  This goes completely against the tenor and new ethos of the courts legislation enacted in 2013, under which family law cases or family applications can now be reported but anonymity of the people is preserved.  There is a residual right on the court to exclude reportage in particular circumstances.  The media have not taken it up in the manner I would have hoped they would, but some of what happens behind what used to be the closed doors of a family court is now getting some fresh air and there is some insight and limited transparency.  There is no particular reason the same rule should not apply here.  If there are issues around the circumstances in which information will be made available, and the anonymity of the parties needs to be preserved, information on the donor and information on birthdates should not come into the public domain, but the manner in which these applications are dealt with in the family courts and the family Circuit Court, which I presume will deal with it, should not be any more anonymous than any other type of family case.  With transparency there is greater public insight into how the courts approach matters and greater insight by Members of the House as to whether laws are not working as anticipated and need to be changed.  I query this.</p></speech>

The strong presumption which clearly exists throughout the Bill is in favour of release.  I have been advised, in the context of establishing a register such as this, one should allow for exceptional cases and that this should be provided for legally.  My legal advice is it can be done in the way I have outlined.  It is not the best interest principle, in the sense we are building it in as a basic right for the child to information.</p><p>We have done this for the reasons I have already mentioned.  In some ways, it is similar, if not absolutely comparable, to the position that applies in immigration, where there is ministerial discretion.  While that issue arises frequently, this case would involve exceptional circumstances.</p><p> In terms of court, we have stated that the case must be heard otherwise than in public, but my understanding is that this would not preclude some aspects of the case from being made public if the court so decided.  I am not sure, so I will check.  This provision is to be seen as a strong presumption in favour of release while allowing for exceptional circumstances, for example, where the safety or well-being of the child or the donor could be at risk.  The Minister would have to justify his or her decision if it was disputed.  For the reasons I have outlined, it is important that we include this provision.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-05a.966" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2015030500002#S00200"><p>The only issue is that the legislation does not use the words "exceptional circumstances".  It uses the term "well-being".  I am very conscious of, and I want to come back to this, the desirability where possible of facilitating individuals born through assisted reproduction or through adoption to trace origins, but one has to have a robust and coherent procedure and there has to be a prescription as to how it is going to work.  The Minister has not replied as to whether it is envisaged a Minister who turns down an application would effectively be the defendant or the respondent in these applications and would play a role in defending the decision or whether the Circuit Court would be at large to consider it all from the perspective of what has been submitted to the court and then make a decision.  I do not know the answer to that.  Perhaps that could be clarified.</p> <p>  I do think it is important that there is a reasoned basis for the decision.  It is not simply that the Minister decides he or she is not going to release the information and there are no reasons given.  There is a need for this section to delineate an obligation to detail the reasons for the decision made.</p> <p>  I am presuming on the other side of this, as we are dealing with this, that if a decision is made by the Minister to make the information available, the donor can appeal to the Circuit Court.  Equally, where the Minister rejects the donor's objection, presumably the donor should know the reason why.  If it is a one-sided appeal, that would be a very strange procedure.  I am particularly concerned in circumstances where the appeal is not going to be dealt with, from what the Minister said, in the initial period when this legislation might be in force by a specialist body.  It is going to be dealt with by the Minister or the Minister will make a decision based on whatever recommendation he or she may or may not get from officials in his or her office who are assigned to process these applications.</p></speech>

Subsection (3) reads:<blockquote><br /><br />Where a relevant donor to whom <i>subsection (2) </i>applies makes representations to the Minister in accordance with that subsection, the Minister shall consider those representations and--(a) if satisfied that sufficient reasons exist to withhold the information concerned from the donor-conceived child, shall refuse the request under <i>subsection (1)...</i></blockquote>This is the threshold test.  There is ministerial discretion in that decision and a range of factors would be taken into account.  The Minister would be the defendant, as in the other example I cited.  The donor cannot appeal the decision.</p></speech>

If the decision is based on "well-being", there is a need to clarify what "sufficient reasons" means or can the Minister simply say that, based on his or her perception of the well-being of the donor or the well-being of the child, he or she will or will not make this decision?  I do not think it is appropriate that a mechanism is created which is designed to protect safety or designed to protect "well-being", whatever that means, where if a decision is made not to do something, the party affected by that can appeal, but where a decision is made to do something, the party affected by that cannot appeal.</p> <p>  Can I put it in a political context?  Let us assume for a moment, as the Minister said, the bias would be to make information available, but when it comes to making a decision, a Minister cannot come to it with bias.  He or she must make an objective decision based on the information furnished to him or her.  Of course, one of the difficulties is how the information furnished is validated because this does not involve any form of a hearing process.  It seems to be based on some form of written submission.  That is a particular difficulty.  If it is the type of procedure that is here envisaged - not to be obtuse about it - and a 20 or 25 year old wants information or the donor does not want information provided, the Minister is the person making the decision.  It is not an independent body or authority.  Does the donor or the 25 year old conceived with the assistance of donor-assisted reproduction mechanisms start knocking on the doors of the constituency clinics of individual Deputies asking them to urge the Minister to make a particular decision or not?  If we are going to have this process, it should not be a ministerial process.  It should be a separate authority.  I do not believe that it should be brought into operation with a Minister dealing with it until the independent authority is dealing with it.</p></speech>

In light of other provisions in the Bill, we should remember that the donor has consented to the giving up of parentage and the pathway to parentage for the child.  The donor has put himself or herself in that situation.  One must take this point into account.</p> <p>  I can consider the Deputy's question on the use of the term "well-being".

The Minister said the information would be made available to the court, but when does the person making the appeal get the information?  Do they have to wait until they are in court?  That would mean they are at a disadvantage straight away.  God forbid, but if the donor was a mass murderer it would not be in the best interest of a person to have this information.  I just feel the person making the appeal is completely on the wrong foot.  They may be a young person with limited resources to engage a legal team and they will not have the same expertise.

I mentioned that some statistics were collected by the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology.  They collate statistics in relation to AHR procedures conducted in European Union countries.  The majority of the Irish fertility clinics give information to the ESHRE on a voluntary basis regarding the AHR procedures they conduct, but not all of them do.  Because of the lack of legislation and regulation in this area, we cannot be absolutely definitive about the information, and it does not encompass all AHR procedures that are conducted in Ireland.  The most recent statistics available are from 2010.  Those figures show that there were seven IVF clinics in Ireland, of which six provided data for 2010.  In 2009, six out of seven clinics provided information to the ESHRE.  The data for 2010 show that there were 1,856 cycles of <i>in vitro</i>fertilisation and 1,320 of intracytoplasmic sperm injection.  In 2009 there were 1,987 cycles of IVF and 1,328 cycles of ICSI.  It should be noted that each cycle does not necessarily result in a pregnancy or the birth of a child.  The numbers relate only to IVF and ICSI and not to other AHR procedures, so we do not have exact figures for the number of children born on foot of AHR procedures in Ireland.  These are the most comprehensive figures I could get.</p></speech>

One of the key criticisms of the Bill that is quite widespread is the fact that it does not give automatic guardianship to the father at the time of birth.  If there are any reasons someone should not be given automatic guardianship, one assumes they can be dealt with through the courts process.</p><p>When an unmarried father registers his name on a birth certificate, he assumes he will be entitled to guardianship on the basis of having his name acknowledged on the birth certificate, but that is not the case.  We want to remove the conditionality in this Bill and ensure that a father who has stepped up to the plate is entitled to automatic guardianship.</p><p>We talk about teenage pregnancies and young men accepting responsibility as a father and all that comes with it.  Maybe the parents do not live together and are separated from the get-go but the father pays maintenance and helps with the upbringing of the child.  That is not possible in these circumstances because of the proposed legislation.  There is also the issue of fathers who have to work abroad, which is a big issue in Ireland today, and who cannot physically be there.  If the couple are not married they cannot comply with the criteria.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.  I ask that we work between now and Report Stage on trying to ensure there is automatic guardianship for the father, and, failing this, that the father is informed from the get-go that having his name on the birth certificate does not entitle him to automatic guardianship, and that he should seek to make a statutory declaration.  I will deal later with the issue of a central register for these declarations.  My own hope and that of my party is that there would be automatic guardianship.  Of course, if the father was not fit to be guardian, that could be dealt with through a court case.  We need full equality in parenting.  The purpose of this legislation is that it reflects the diverse nature of modern families in Ireland.  It also reflects the reality that about one third of children are born to unmarried mothers.  If all fathers were to step up to the plate, one third of them would not be given automatic guardianship.</p><p>So much more needs to be done in respect of the wider issue of father's rights in terms of family law and our courts system, which has families stuck in waiting rooms with other civil cases.  There are long queues, which causes distress.  It would be a good start if we were to make a clear statement that the mother and father, if they are not married, have equal guardianship rights from the get-go.</p></speech>

I have to introduce a Bill in the D&aacute;il so I am keeping an eye on the monitor.</p> <p>  Our amendment is along similar lines and is about improving the rights of unmarried fathers.  We are seeking to ensure that the father of a child is aware of his rights at the time of the registration of the child.  The amendment places the onus on the registrar to ensure the father is aware that the registration process is taking place, giving him an opportunity to apply for guardianship under current legislation.  The amendment would, for the first time, put the onus on the State to afford the mother and father the opportunity to jointly sign the statutory declaration consenting to the appointment of the father as a joint legal guardian.  Oftentimes, unmarried fathers are unaware of the importance of the registration process.  We believe there is currently a great imbalance between the rights of the mother and those of the father.  In some instances this imbalance is justified, but in many instances it clearly is not.  The amendment seeks to address the imbalance.</p></speech>

In a lot of cases, it may not be possible for the mother and father to be living together.  There are teenage pregnancies where both parents could be living at home with their own parents, or the father of the child could be married to somebody else.  There are difficulties.  The woman could already be in receipt of the one-parent family allowance and not allowed to cohabit with her partner.  It is very restrictive and does not take into account the diverse society in which we now live.</p></speech>

I have to have further discussions with some legal people on this.  It has partly to do with how, even in marriage, guardianship does not entail equal rights for both partners.</p></speech>

As the committee is well aware, there is at present no provision in law for automatic guardianship for non-marital fathers.  The legislation will introduce such a provision for some non-marital fathers.  Under it, an unmarried father will automatically become the guardian of a child if he lives with the child's mother for at least 12 consecutive months, including three months after the child's birth.  The policy decision was taken not to extend automatic guardianship to all unmarried fathers for a variety of reasons.  Some unmarried fathers will not be involved with their children to any extent.  However, the unmarried father will be able to make a statutory declaration jointly with the mother saying that he is the guardian of the child.  That option remains for an unmarried father, as does the option for him to go to court to be given guardianship.</p> <p>  In the section dealing with the best interests of the child, the Bill specifies that the best interests of the child are the paramount consideration for the courts in such circumstances.  I would point out to Deputies that one of a number of specified factors and circumstances that the court must take into account when determining the best interests of the child is the benefit to the child of having an ongoing meaningful relationship with each parent and sufficient contact with them to maintain such a relationship.</p> <p>  The legislation is the first recognition in Irish law of a mechanism for automatic guardianship of a child for a non-marital father.</p><p>That is the first point I want to make.</p><p> To reply to Deputy Mac Lochlainn, he should be aware that his amendment would delete the newly proposed provision which will make certain fathers automatically the guardians of their children.</p></speech>

However, this deletion will simply mean that a substantial number of non-marital fathers will not now benefit from the new provision which would enable them to become guardians automatically without taking any further action.</p><p>Are we also dealing with Deputy Collins' amendment?</p></speech>

Subject to some particular comments I want to make, I can accept the spirit of the amendment.  These comments are, first, that the information on guardianship proposed in the draft subsection (5)(c) is specific in regard to a court application under the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964.  It may put registrars in a difficult position if they are required to give information to new parents on possible adversarial processes.</p><p>I am keen that parents have information, but the information which should be provided is confined to the fact that the father is not a guardian unless he takes further steps.  I also intend to provide for registrars to have the power to witness statutory declarations.  They are not in a meaningful position to carry out any form of welfare or best interest test.  Further work will be necessary before establishing a register or repository on the basis of guardianship declarations being made in a variety of places.  On the basis of the commitment I am making to bring forward a Report Stage amendment, I ask the Deputy not to press the amendment.</p></speech>

That is unfortunate.  We do not propose to remove section 40(a) but rather section 40(b).  That is out of our control but we will resubmit the amendment and ensure it is worded properly the next time.  As we are speaking to amendment No. 39, I will be moving it on behalf of the relevant Deputy.  I would like to see it implemented.  The Minister has not outlined why she believes automatic guardianship should not be given.  Once a father has his name on a birth certificate, why can that automatic guardianship not be given?</p></speech>

As a Deputy, I meet many fathers who do not get any or adequate access to their children, particularly if a couple does not get on.  The people may be separated, for example, and the issue is that the parents do not regularly see the children.  I know courts can make decisions in this regard.  Is there any implicit recognition in this legislation of a right to see the child?  I know there are legal issues with the likes of barring orders and so on.  One of the commonest complaints I hear from fathers is that they have nowhere to bring a child even if they have access.  Poorer families in particular might have to walk in Drogheda or Dundalk on a Saturday or Sunday or go to the back of a pub or inappropriate places.  These people want to bond with children but cannot do so in such places.  I recently visited the Tusla centre in Drogheda and there is a special room for provision.  Could the State do more to assist parents in such difficult positions?  Often, if these men are not living at home, they are living in very poor accommodation or apartment complexes.  They are often in very difficult financial circumstances.  It is an issue for a number of my constituents.</p></speech>

For example, people mentioned cases of domestic violence and many called for exceptions to be made if the pregnancy was a result of rape.  A variety of circumstances were cited by Deputies who spoke on the Bill.  Many family law practitioners would have a particular concern about the issue.  Nevertheless, it is a very real area for consideration.  The approach we have taken in the Bill is to link the automatic right to cohabitation for a specific period.  It is the first time this is being dealt with in legislation.</p> <p>  For non-married fathers who go to court seeking guardianship, the vast majority of such requests are granted but a percentage are not granted where the courts do not consider it in the best interests of the child to have the father as a guardian.  That is because conferring guardianship has specific effects.  If a father is not on the scene or involved, his failure to exercise guardianship responsibilities has real consequences for the child and mother.  The mother would have to apply to court to dispense with the consent of the father to the issue of a passport, with related implications.  It would be extremely difficult to place the child for adoption or for the mother to adopt the child jointly with a new partner if the father did not consent to the adoption.  However, all of these issues would in such a context be very carefully considered with respect to the best interests of the child.  Other considerations would also apply.</p> <p>  I will go through some other concerns in detail.  If a mother decided to relocate with a child, her legal position and authority to do so would be unclear as a guardian has the right of custody within the meaning of the Hague Convention on international child abduction or the Brussels II bis regulation.  These are very vital protections where both parents are involved with the child's life, but they could be problematic for a mother and child if a father with no involvement with the child had an effective veto.  These are real and potentially serious implications of automatic guardianship, and that is not to speak of some of the other issues I discussed.</p> <p>  I am therefore proposing an amendment.  There is a real problem in that many fathers, especially young fathers, are not aware that they can sign a statutory declaration in front of a peace commissioner or a commissioner for oaths that would give them guardianship rights.  There is a real information deficit with this issue, and that is a clear opinion of all the non-governmental organisations working in the area and speaking about it.  A number of Deputies have raised the point and argued that it should be easier and more straightforward for fathers in that position to know their rights and be able to exercise and vindicate those rights through a statutory declaration.  That relates to cases where a mother does not object, because where there is conflict, there would be a court hearing.</p> <p>  Perhaps I can give a further indication of the Report Stage amendment I intend to introduce, as it may be helpful to the discussion.  I have gone into some detail already.  The purpose of this Report Stage amendment relating to guardianship is to enable registers to witness a statutory declaration by which the father can be appointed a guardian at a time when a couple is registering a child's birth or within a short period afterwards.  Treoir and a number of other organisations made submissions in this regard.  This statutory declaration mechanism is easy, straightforward and inexpensive.  The principal difficulty for many non-marital parents is that most are not aware of the existence of this mechanism.  This amendment would ensure that a couple would have necessary information and can make an informed choice on whether the father should be a guardian.  Subject to legal advice, it is possible that the Report Stage amendment will amend the Civil Registration Act 2004.</p><p>I also plan, and will say so on Report Stage, that I will review this issue in two years time, at which time it will be possible to consider the impact of the proposals in this Bill to make it easier for non-marital fathers to complete a statutory declaration.  We can see what the result of that has been and whether we are seeing the kind of increases we would expect to see.  Many people who have looked at this area feel that the information and the access to the statutory declaration is one of the big barriers.  I believe that with the combination of initiatives in this Bill, we are moving forward substantially in regard to the rights of non-marital fathers.</p></speech>

There is a provision at the moment that the father can be granted guardianship rights by the mother.  What the Minister is suggesting, I think, is that guardianship will be made known more clearly and explicitly at the time of the birth of the child.  If that happens, then the cohabitation provision will not apply because the father will be a guardian by virtue of the declaration.</p></speech>

It is at that point that the registrar will inform both parents that they can choose to avail of a declaration of guardianship.  If that happens, then the cohabitancy rule does not apply because one has made a declaration at that point.  If, for whatever reason, a father has not done so, then the cohabitants rule applies.</p> <p>  I assume that the Minister intends to hold a public information campaign.  I presume there will be a visible poster for everyone to see when they go into the registry office, as well as that a person in the registry will be obliged to say to people when registering that they should be aware that a father does not have automatic guardianship and if they wish to have it, he can make a declaration there and then.  The Minister has suggested that is way and that if a person has not done so at that point, this provision would kick in then.</p></speech>

Quite a number of Deputies and organisations working in this area have spoken about the need for better information to be available to fathers, for example, in maternity hospitals and when the mother is registering the birth, and that there should be information leaflets available advertising such information and very obvious things.  There is clearly an information deficit in this area.  The provisions are obviously responding to those suggestions.</p> <p>  I have also had some contact with the Department of Social Protection which is supportive of this provision.  The provision is not by any means saying there is automatic guardianship for non-marital fathers.  It simply takes an initiative in this area that will ensure that more fathers would be aware of the statutory declaration.  It also makes it easier for them at the point where they could do so, when the family or mother and father are registering the birth of the child. </p></speech>

If he wants to sign a statutory guardianship declaration to say he wants to be a guardian of his child, can the mother of the child object to him signing such a declaration?</p></speech>

The father must go to court where a decision is made.  This Bill is based on the best interests of the child and a range of considerations apply, including the ongoing relationship that the child would have with both parents.  My understanding is that the vast majority of guardianships in those circumstances are granted in the courts but not all are.  Clearly, there are cases where the court considers that it is not in the best interest of the child to go in that direction.</p></speech>

If a couple has cohabited for 12 months of which three months can be after the birth of the child, which means nine months beforehand, the father of the child gets automatic guardianship.  I have serious doubts about that provision although I do not oppose it.  I have serious doubts as to why 12 months' residency or cohabiting qualifies somebody to be the automatic guardian of the child.  I am reminded of the old saying, if you want to know me then come and live with me.  The mother of the child may have better and more reasons, after that period, for denying guardianship than when the child is born and the father applies.  Does the Minister understand what I am saying?</p></speech>

There are very different views on this point.  Some jurisdictions have automatic guardianship for non-marital fathers while others do not.  Other jurisdictions use a variety of criteria or mechanisms.  The situation varies quite substantially.  We had this debate in the D&aacute;il where some people asked, as Deputy Ferris has done so, about those circumstances where the involvement of the father may not be in the best interest of the child and where that only emerges after a certain period.  Obviously in the legislation we are taking important steps.</p> <p>  Given that one third of children are born outside of marriage in this country, this position affects many father.  We are saying in the Bill that it should not automatic but that where a father is living with the mother three months after the birth and these circumstances have been met, the father then would have automatic guardianship.  As we can see, people will also say the stipulated time is not long enough.  At what point does one decide that the father could have automatic guardianship?  Does one say one year, two years, three years or does one just say it is an inherent right that a father should have?  That is the issue we are grappling with here and there are very different views on the matter.</p></speech>

That is why I do not believe this provision to be necessary.  At its core, this is a matter of equality.  Like many others, I am arguing that the mother and father should begin as equal guardians to the child.  If there is a good reason the mother objects to the father being a guardian, then she should take her case to the courts.  If she is found to be in the right, then I presume the court will not grant guardianship to the father.  The difficulty now is that the father must ask permission from the mother to be granted his equal rights.  That is not fair.  The cohabitation rule is a distraction.  The core issue is that the father must approach the mother to be granted equality.  If she agrees, then all will be well.  If she does not, however, he will be obliged to take her to court.</p> <p>  I feel very strongly about this matter.  As public representatives, we have all been obliged to deal with fathers who have needed to have recourse to the courts.  I accept that there are terrible fathers and men who have no right to claim the title "father".  However, there are also very good fathers who have been exasperated as a result of their need to undergo the legal process just to exercise their right to be parents to their children.  If we get this right, we will send a clear signal to the effect that we are of the view that mothers and fathers are equal from the outset.  If an issue arises, then the mother, or indeed the father, will be able to take a case before the courts to state that the other person involved should not have guardianship rights.  The courts, which are independent, should decide these issues.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the position on the cohabitation rule and examine the possibility of granting automatic guardianship from the outset.</p></speech>

This seems to be the first section dealing with the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 in the Bill and it seems to also be partially a definitions section.  I want to just repeat something that I said in the D&aacute;il on Second Stage.  I believe it is good legislative practice that we try to keep what is a fairly complex area as legislatively clear as possible.  I really do not understand why the Bill does not simply repeal all of the relevant provisions in the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 and the Status of Children Act 1987 that relate to guardianship and custody of children and do what the original draft Bill did, which was incorporate all relevant provisions in the one piece of legislation.  I think that, when we are dealing with section 40, we see how additional complexities arise as a consequence of that because of the multiple amendments having to be made to the 1964 Act.  I still do not understand why that change has been effected.  The only reason I heard mentioned was in case we left something important out that was in the 1964 Act - if there is something important in the 1964 Act that needs to be retained, it could have all been retained.  If we adopted this approach to legislation, which is epitomised by section 40, we would never have enacted the Adoption Act 2010 and would have just done a series of amendments to all of the preceding adoption legislation.  We would not have enacted the Freedom of Information Act 2014, which replaces all of the previous legislation in that area.  I just do not understand why we have made this more complex than it needs be.</p> <p>  In relation to the specifics of the section, in so far as it is amending the 1964 Act, there are, and have been since 1964, definition deficiencies in the 1964 Act where concepts are not adequately defined.  The Law Reform Commission, when it was looking at this area of the law, recommended certain changes.  A part of the changes it recommended was a change of terminology so that we replicated here the terminology that they have adopted in England.  That is not appropriate and certainly was not appropriate after the constitutional referendum relating to children.  It is right that we retain the terminology we have, but the issues in particular that were dealt with in some of the draft legislation which are excluded - I do not understand why they are excluded - are important definitions of concepts people think they are familiar with but which are normally defined in similar legislation in nearly all the other common law jurisdictions with which I am familiar.  I want to raise these particular definitions and suggest they be incorporated by the Minister on Report Stage.</p> <p>  The first is the concept of access.  We were discussing access previously.  There was a definition of "access" in the measure that this committee previously looked at, which said, "'access', in relation to a child, includes the right of the child to maintain personal relations and contact with a parent and relatives or other person with a bona fide interest in the child on a regular basis except where such access is not in the best interests of the child".  What that did by way of a definition which could be incorporated into section 40 as an amendment of the 1964 Act was make it clear that access was the right of a child as opposed to simply the privilege of a parent or the entitlement or right of a parent.  There have been court decisions which have described "access" as the right of a child.  The definition recognised that the access or contact that a child had not only included the right of the child to maintain personal relations and contact with the parent, but also with relations.  I think that is important because, when relationships collapse, all of us as public representatives learn of circumstances where, in the marital war or parental war that follows people's relationships collapsing, important people with whom a child has contact are often cut off, like grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins and others within the family.  Later provisions of the legislation allow for relations to make applications for access, but there is a need to define what we mean by "access".  That is a modern definition which reflects the approach taken in a series of other countries.</p> <p>  We also do not have a definition of "custody".  Everyone thinks he or she knows what the concept of custody means.  One of the great areas of difficulty when relationships break down is, if one parent is awarded custody, the other parent thinks he or she has no further involvement or engagement with his or her children.  While the concepts of custody and guardianship have been used for some centuries, they are not adequately defined in Irish law.  There is a need to define the concept of custody and be clear on what we mean by it.  We reference it in the legislation; it is not defined.  The definition that was previously before this committee stated as follows: "'custody', in relation to a child, includes the provision of day-to-day care of a child, to protect and supervise the child and the right to provide a residence for the child and may include providing such care for one or more specified days or parts of days".  On some occasions, parents have joint custody.  They share the custody of a child and a child can live with one parent for a period of the week and the other parent for another period of the week.  We do not have a definition.  Unless I am missing something, it seems that the definition has been dropped out of the legislation.  Again, I do not understand why.</p> <p>  Turning to the final issue that I want to mention in this context, I cannot think of where else I can reference it other than in the conversation that we might have on section 41, so if the Chairman wants to pull me up when I-----</p></speech>

Does the Minister wish to respond to any of the issues raised about the definitions of "custody" and "access"?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-05a.1076" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2015030500002#EE00700"><p>Yes.  We took a different approach to the development of the legislation.  We decided that, instead of repealing the guardianship Act, we would amend it in this Bill in the way that has been outlined.  That different approach had implications for other sections of the Bill and some of these definitions.  My legal advice was that no new definition was required or advisable in our approach to the Bill.</p> <p>  This is a contentious area in the courts.  A number of broader points were made by Deputies in the course of the Second Stage debate.  In light of the new initiatives contained in the Bill, many Deputies made the point that how children and families were dealt with in the court system needed to be improved and court welfare services for parents needed to be developed.</p> <p>  I take the Deputy's point on the definitions of "access" and "custody".  The decision to amend rather than repeal was taken.  This is a large Bill and has involved a significant amount of work.  I wish to take this opportunity to thank the Attorney General and all of her staff who have been working on it for months on end to address the range of issues it encompasses.  While I take the Deputy's suggestion about including further definitions, it was decided to amend rather than repeal, and my advice was that the concepts of access and custody were well understood in the context of the 1964 Act.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-05a.1077" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2015030500002#FF00100"><p>With due respect, to say that makes no sense whatsoever.  I am sorry to phrase it that way.  If the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 remained exactly as it was with no amendments, there would still be a need for us to finally have a definition of these concepts.  They are defined worldwide in legislation dealing with the custody, care and upbringing of children.  In my view, the entire Act should have been repealed.  On occasion I have had to wrestle with the approach of the Attorney General's office to particular pieces of legislation.  The drafting of the Bill would have been simpler if the Minister had not travelled the route she has taken, yet even travelling that route, there is no logic in the suggestion that these concepts should remain undefined.</p> <p>   The concept of access, as the courts have generally perceived it, has largely been applicable to the relationship between a child and parents.  This legislation does something very important in recognising the role that relations can play in a child's life.  There is a need for us to provide a modern definition of access, as opposed to allowing it to remain a concept that is referenced in court judgments in various formats and differing half-definitions.  Some judges have tried to define access as something that is the right of a child.  It makes no sense that in 2015 we are enacting a piece of legislation of this nature while the basic concepts of access and custody are not defined.</p> <p>  There also is a need to define them because there is enormous confusion on the part of parents as to what the concept of custody means.  I am going to talk about guardianship later on.  Once one parent concedes custody to the other in a court or mediation context, perhaps in circumstances in which it may not be practical for him or her to look after the child on a day-to-day basis, he or she is conceding a whole range of other things on which it is important to be consulted, such as the child's health, education, cultural engagement or religious upbringing.  The parent who obtains custody believes that, because he or she has custody, he or she can exclude the other parent from engagement on such issues.  In order to reduce the level of family embattlement that takes place when relationships break down, there is a great advantage in having a clear definition of custody, such that people understand it to mean that the child is physically being cared for by one parent, without meaning that that parent should not consult with the other parent, who has a good relationship with the child, on some of the fundamental decisions to be made about the child's life.</p> <p>  One of the difficulties have I found as a practising lawyer, particularly in the District Court, is that judges often do not themselves distinguish between guardianship and custody, and are confused about it.  To get over the sense some parents have that they are to be disengaged from their child's life entirely when the other parent is granted custody, there are occasions when judges make orders of joint custody that do not involve the child living part of the time with one parent and part of the time with the other.  They make an order of joint custody and detail that the child should primarily reside with one of the parents.  That is just a custody order.  Even the Judiciary can be confused as to what on earth custody means, particularly at the lower levels.  I have seen it on multiple occasions in 30 years of practice as a family lawyer.  It is extraordinary how this is a continuing and prevailing difficulty.</p> <p>  I ask the Minister to reconsider this on Report Stage, because it makes no sense.  I do not know what advice could be legitimately given to suggest, even given the somewhat complex structure that has now been adopted, that it would do some damage to include the definitions I have suggested or some reasonable variant of them.  That is an issue on which the Attorney General's office should be further engaged.  I presume we are stuck with the structure that is here, but I would dearly love to know why we are preserving a piece of legislation that contains some provisions - I do not have the 1964 Act with me, but from memory I think they are in Part III - that have been redundant for decades.  Why are we not providing a modern legal framework in its entirety?  We should have one piece of legislation that people can go to - namely, the legislation dealing with guardianship, custody of and access to children - rather than having to stray through myriad different pieces of legislation, with sections of one Act amending another Act that amends another Act.  It is bad legislative practice and it is also unfair to assume that when we legislate this way, everyone who practises in the area, including the Judiciary, will necessarily find their way through the legislative maze that is created.</p></speech>

The decision to approach it in this way must be taken in the context of some of the other provisions in the Bill that are helpful in terms of the types of decision the Deputy is saying have to be taken in court.

That is the point about the best interests provision.  The Deputy would be very familiar with the fact that on occasion, repeals of entire Acts have resulted in inadvertent deletion of provisions it was intended to retain.  Clearly, a factor in preparing for this legislation was that the 1964 Act, as everybody on this committee knows, is embedded in Irish law and is in daily use in the courts.  While preparing this Bill, we decided this was the way to go at this point, given a whole range of considerations.</p></speech>

In both of those jurisdictions, as in England, these concepts of access and custody are defined and are complementary to each other, as opposed to getting in the way of one another.</p></speech>

I want to return to the issue of guardianship as well.  It is important that we have an extended description of the obligations - perhaps &quot;responsibilities&quot; is a better word - and rights of guardians.  I will not detain the committee by reciting what was in head 36 of the draft Bill that this committee considered last year.  That particular provision reflected global best practice in jurisdictions that have the most up-to-date legislation dealing with children.</p><p>It is particularly important in the context of relationships that have broken down to specify the rights and obligations of parents and to ensure the custodial parent involves the other parent in fundamental issues relating to children.  I made a point in the D&aacute;il about what happens in a small number of instances when relationships break down.  This does not apply to the majority of parents who behave responsibly when relationships break down by trying to protect their children from difficulties.  Most custodial parents try to maintain a good relationship with the non-custodial parent where it is in the best interests of the children to do so, but I am afraid that some parents do not behave in this manner.  Some parents go to war with each other.  Mothers create problems for fathers, or fathers create problems for mothers.  Some parents simply try to destroy the relationship between the child and the estranged parent.</p><p>The provision in the draft Bill to which I have referred was an important one.  It stated:<blockquote>In exercising or continuing to exercise the duties, powers, rights and responsibilities of a guardian in relation to a child, a guardian of the child shall act jointly (in particular by consulting wherever practicable with the aim of securing agreement) with any other guardian of the child.</blockquote>Such a provision has not been included in the Bill before the committee.  The draft version of the Bill further provided:<blockquote>Except where otherwise stated by way of court order, each guardian is entitled &ndash; (a) to be informed of and consulted about and to make all significant decisions affecting the child in the exercise of the powers, rights and responsibilities of guardianship derived in subhead (5), and <br /><br />(b) to have sufficient contact with the child to exercise those powers, rights and responsibilities.</blockquote>Under the draft Bill, each guardian would have a responsibility to &quot;nurture the child&rsquo;s physical, psychological, emotional, intellectual, social and other personal development &quot; and to &quot;ensure the child is properly maintained and supported and is provided with necessary medical care, food, clothing, accommodation and access to appropriate education&quot;.</p><p>A range of matters were detailed in head 36 and the subheads that were published.  I emphasise that these measures were not reinventing the wheel.  They were based on best practice in other jurisdictions.  It was considered not only that they improved the law and provided clarity, but also that they helped to create an ethos in which the courts would encourage co-operation between estranged parents in the interests of children.  Those provisions represent a statutory roadmap, to some extent, in so far as they could very well be included in a very reasonable leaflet indicating to estranged parents that each of them has particular rights and responsibilities and that they need to co-operate in the best interests of their children by approaching matters as detailed.  I presume I will be told that these provisions are not being included in this legislation because they were not in the 1964 Act.  I am afraid that does not make any sense.  If we were simply trying to keep the 1964 Act in place, some of the other changes that we are happily implementing would not be part of the legislation.</p><p>I am raising this not simply in my capacity as a politician but as someone who practised in the area of family law for over 30 years.  I used to spend large parts of my time trying to persuade people who wanted to go to war with each other to deal with each other in a more civilised way in the best interests of their children.  There were occasions when it was extraordinarily difficult for them to gain that insight.  This legislation envisages that parents who are not co-operating might avail of parental counselling services or certain other support services.  In that context, it would be extremely useful for the obligations of parents, as well as their rights, to be set out in a straightforward, easily understandable linguistic framework that would be part and parcel of this legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-05a.1091" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2015030500002#GG00600"><p>It might be helpful to the discussion to point out that section 45 of this Bill, which inserts a new section 6C into the 1964 Act, is linked to the points that have just been made.  It gives the court the power to appoint a person other than the parent as a guardian.  It spells out in detail the rights and responsibilities of the guardian.  The proposed new section 6C(11) of the 1964 Act provides that those rights and responsibilities are to:<blockquote><br /><br />(a) decide on the child&rsquo;s place of residence;<br /><br />(b) make decisions regarding the child&rsquo;s religious, spiritual, cultural and linguistic upbringing;<br /><br />(c) decide with whom the child is to live;<br /><br />(d) consent to medical, dental and other health related treatment for the child, in respect of which a guardian's consent is required;<br /><br />(e) consent under section 14 of the Passports Act 2008 to the issue of a passport to the child;<br /><br />(f) place the child for adoption.</blockquote>These key rights are clearly spelled out in the legislation.  We have dealt with the point that guardians must act jointly.  That does not always mean consulting on all decisions, especially those which are urgent.  If we were to draft the legislation in a different way - a stronger way - it could cast into doubt the right of the guardian to make any decision unilaterally.  That was the legal advice I received about the way this could be dealt with in legislation.  Of course I realise, not least from my own practice as a social worker over many years, that these decisions are extremely difficult and complicated.  I am aware that a range of relationships and competing rights come into play.  I have always acknowledged Deputy Shatter's major contribution to this legislation.  I think it will give us further enhanced powers, not least because the definition of &quot;best interest&quot; is dealt with in much more detail than ever before in legislation.  That will be very helpful because it will ensure the courts have further legislation on which to rely in order to make the best decisions for children in these very difficult family relationship situations.</p></speech>

The very content of the section referenced by the Minister is causing me the greatest puzzlement because some of it reflects the provisions I mentioned.  It is extraordinarily perverse that we are spelling out the rights and obligations of third parties who are named as guardians by the courts without defining or spelling out in detail what being a guardian actually means to a child's parents.  It really does not make sense.  I would like to see the best possible legislation here.  I have no interest beyond ensuring we have the best possible legislation that protects the best interests of the child and provides absolute clarity for parents regarding their rights and responsibilities.  Most parents in happy families do not need to be told that.  It is of particular importance where parents are estranged.  It is distinctly odd to set out the rights and responsibilities of third parties who have been made guardians by the courts without also delineating the rights and responsibilities of parents as guardians, especially given that this is done in legislation worldwide.  I just cannot fathom why we are doing this.</p></speech>

They prescribe how to deal with difficulties that arise when a parent fails to comply with a custody or access order and, effectively, this legislation will deal with the issue of access.</p> <p>  There is provision for a parent who has financially lost out.  For example, attending or arranging to meet a child for access but for some reason, or rather the other parent obstructs that.  One parent can be required to compensate the other for whatever financial loss, the parent can be given alternative or substitute access, and he or she can be required to attend a parenting programme or family counselling.  All of this is very worthwhile and works well in Australia.  The provisions here substantially reflect the provisions in the Australian family law Act.  </p> <p>  With the Australian family law Act, in Australia they discovered that all of this was right and well but there were groups of parents who were so entrenched that it simply did not work.  One can urge people to go to parental counselling or to participate in some sort of family counselling or parenting programme, or one might even force one parent to pay the other parent the cost of the bus fare for an abandoned access that does not take place.  It is important that we realise there is a small group of parents who set out to destroy the relationship children have with the other parent when a marriage or relationship has collapsed.  It does not have to be marriage, people may have been cohabiting together, but one or both parents can go to war with each other.</p><p>Sometimes it is simply one and sometimes it is both, and the children are in the middle of it.  When this happens, the judges are frequently out of their depth.  They find family cases difficult to deal with.  In practice, when parents conduct themselves in this way, judges will normally urge on multiple occasions a parent to abide by court orders.  I have seen judges threaten to transfer custody of a child from one parent to the other where the custodial parent is clearly misbehaving, but very often that is not an appropriate order to make because the parent who is anxious to have access to a child either does not have the accommodation where a child could live or they are at work and it is not practical that they have the day-to-day care of the child.  There can be a whole range of reasons that it does not work.</p><p> I have seen on occasion judges literally tearing their hair out to resolve problems.  When people are on civil legal aid through one of the Government law centres and where one parent, for example, can afford a lawyer and the other cannot, and the parent with the lawyer decides to go to war with the other parent, there is the risk that the law centre would just throw its hands up and the parent who is experiencing difficulties in spending time with his or her children find they cannot even get legal representation to make their case to a court.  On occasion, judges just lose their temper with everyone, and where one parent is misbehaving and the other is behaving properly, the judge just does not want to know and will not listen to either of them, to the detriment of the children and the parent whose contact with the children is being obstructed.</p><p> That long introduction is about saying there is no point in having all of this in the Bill if there is no sanction the courts can impose where one has a recalcitrant parent.  The only sanction the courts can impose at present is they can send parents to prison.  No one wants to see parents sent to prison.  Judges, understandably, are enormously reluctant to do that and in circumstances where it is the custodial parent who is misbehaving and the other parent does not have the capacity to care for a child for some of the reasons I gave, that is not even a practical option and it is not in the interests of the children that that occur.</p><p> Other jurisdictions have tried a variety of different ways of dealing with the situation.  One is that parents can be fined, so as opposed to simply paying someone back the cost of the bus fare or the cost of the petrol to drive out for an access visit that never takes place, the courts can impose a fine.  Often, where marriages or relationships have broken down there is limited finance so imposing a fine may not be a great option and indeed it may affect the children because there may be less money in the household, but it is one of the options that should be there because there are circumstances where people have gone to war where it is not a financial matter, they are just at war with each other, and the court should have sanctions as an option.  The court should have an option, for example, to require the recalcitrant parent to do community service.  It does not put them in prison or cost them money but takes up some of their spare time.  They could be doing the community a service while the other parent is having access.  There is a need for some form of sanction that falls short of imprisonment.  Some suggestions were put in the draft Bill for the consultative process on which I expected people would have different views, but it seems there is now no sanction if one does not comply, other than the one I mentioned - that one might be required to pay someone back the cost of their missed visit.</p><p> If a court takes a view that two parents together, or one who is creating a difficulty, should go to parental counselling and the court makes that order under this arrangement and the parent simply does not co-operate, the question is what is to happen next.  I am asking the Minister that question.  If the court orders that parents should go to family counselling together and one parent turns up and the other does not, the question is what is to happen next.  If they both turn up and one is just abusive of the other at the family counselling as opposed to trying to work through issues to the benefit of the children, what is to happen next?  An answer is required in that regard for this to work, and to improve the predicament that some estranged parents find themselves in, which is enormously to the detriment of children.</p><p> The other thing I have learned from 30 years of family law experience is that I can recall circumstances where I represented estranged spouses in the late 1970s and early 1980s who went to war with each other and where one spouse set out to destroy the relationship of the children with the other spouse.  I was long enough as a lawyer to subsequently represent the adult children of those people who themselves were in a dysfunctional relationship because they had been damaged as children by the way their own parents conducted themselves, and now they were damaged in their relationship and they were now behaving in exactly the same way because that is all they knew.  This is not just about particular couples; it is about a cycle of family dysfunction that needs to be broken.</p></speech>

The provisions in 18A and 18D of section 56 are very carefully balanced to address the issue, which is that we want to enable children to have meaningful relationships with both parents.  The mechanisms we have here seek to change a parent&rsquo;s behaviour, obviously not to penalise the child.  It would be very traumatic for a child if a member of the Garda were to enter the house and remove the child by force to bring him or her to the other parent.  We clearly want to see a situation where the court has increased powers to ensure that the parents are not in contempt of court and that they do carry out what the court intended in relation to the access issues we are talking about.  The existing enforcement orders do provide for quite a number of approaches.  I will not go through them all but they are listed under section 56(4)(a), (b) and (c)(i)(ii)(iii) and 123, which I believe gives the court extra opportunities which do not exist at present to ensure that the terms of access are met by both parents.  That is the intention.  Of course there will be circumstances where a parent may simply be in contempt of court.  I was advised that community service is an alternative to prison and therefore a prison sentence would have to be specified in the first place before a person could be asked to do community service as an alternative.</p> <p>  The other influencer in terms of how we approached this section was the strong representations made to the committee by the Ombudsman for Children, who said that we should not adopt this approach to access.  She advised very strongly against removing those sanctions, as did other organisations such as One Family, and Women&rsquo;s Aid also made comments in relation to the sanctions.</p> <p>  This is a very difficult area in terms of trying to get parents to work well together in the best interests of the child.  Sometimes, clearly parents do not act in the best interests of the child.  The new mechanisms in the Bill will be helpful for courts.  The broader context where this can be dealt with even more effectively is in reform of the courts, developing court welfare services to a greater degree and having more contact centres.  All of those areas need development in this country as they are very under-developed at present.  We have had two very good pilot projects on contact centres where very good work was done by Barnardos and other groups to help parents.  In effect, they mediate with parents and make sure access visits go well.  The feedback I got from Barnardos is that a very significant amount of detailed work needed to be done with parents before they could get them to the point of fully fulfilling the access, but they felt the contact centres were a very worthwhile way to approach it.  We have a lot of work to do in this area to support parents to continue parenting even where there is high conflict, tension and emotion.  A lot of work can be done with those parents but it does require the development of services in this area.  There is much work to be done in this country in that regard.  We removed the sanctions to which Deputy Shatter referred that were in the original draft on the basis I have just outlined.</p></speech>

I am an enthusiast for what we have here, in subsection (4) that the Minister mentioned, the parent counselling, family counselling, all of these provisions, which indeed were in the original provision that the committee dealt with.  I have no theological or ideological commitment to the original Bill because my perception was that it could be improved and we wanted to go through a consultative process but I do know that unfortunately with the best will in the world there are a group of parents who will not cooperate with any of these arrangements and the courts are bereft of an alternative then to imprisonment.  We need to ensure that parents who behave badly and who could impact, not only on the best interests of their children as children, but on the capacity of their children as adults to have a normal functioning relationship, that the activities of those parents are curtailed, that there is some sanction the courts can utilise.  There is no particular reason, for example, a community service sanction in the context of family law needs to be tied in with anyone committing criminal offences.  It is just that community service is an alternative in the criminal law area to a sentence of imprisonment.  There is no particular reason there could not be a stand-alone provision where a judge dealing with a recalcitrant parent behaving contrary to the best interests of a child could not say, "Well, if you do not go to parental counselling or family counselling and if you do not genuinely co-operate, I have other remedies at my disposal and one of the things you may have to do is go off for a couple of hours or three or four hours every week and do designated community service".  That is not the worst of sanctions but it incentivises co-operation and it is not a sanction that renders a parent incapable of continuing to act as a custodial parent, if it is the custodial parent who is misbehaving.  I think we have to have an open mind on these things and all I am saying is, and I keep coming back to something I said this morning, we are not inventing the wheel.  We are travelling a route that other jurisdictions have travelled in this area some 20 to 25 years ago and have discovered that just doing this is not the solution.  This is really valuable and helpful but there must be some alternative sanction if it is not working.  </p></speech>

There were many contributions in the last Stage in the House about fathers' rights and the alleged denial of access by women to fathers in custody.  There were many contributions by different Deputies about that.  I think in this section it clarifies that a second parent can apply to the courts for enforcement and for custody.  There seems to be a lot of confusion between guardianship and custody among Deputies and among members of the public.  It seems to me that this is what is being used to justify the introduction of automatic guardianship, which I would have questions about, because guardianship gives somebody sweeping powers, for example in relation to passports and the residence of the child.</p> <p>  In cases where relations have broken down, and contact with the child may have broken down over years despite, let us say, the father in this case, living for a full year or more with the mother, I am a bit concerned about the safeguards in relation to violence against women, people who are escaping violent relationships, and giving automatic guardianship to men, in this particular case.  One in five women experiences domestic violence.  That is quite a lot of women.  We have the highest rate of single-parent families in this country.  I know there are situations where men have been deprived of seeing their children but, it is very clear here, they can apply for custody and unless there is a very good reason, they will get access to their children.  What I am more concerned about is guardianship being given automatically to people who may have had no connection over a long period of time, financial support, emotional support or anything else.  There are quite a lot of lone parents, who are women, who I know are quite concerned about that.  Could the Minister give her views on that?</p></speech>

We had a discussion as regards that issue, as indeed we had on Second Stage.  I have indicated some amendments that I am bringing in which would make it more likely that non-marital fathers would sign the statutory declaration and that they could do that at the same time as the birth registration.  That is without moving towards the automatic guardianship which some Deputies had asked for and, indeed, which other Deputies on the committee had expressed some serious concern in relation to.</p> <p>  What is at the heart of the Bill, and what I have described as the golden thread running through the Bill, is the definition of "best interest".  For the first time we have gone into detail, as I have already said to the committee, about what constitutes best interest.  The point I want to make in response to the Deputy is that we have linked with quite a wide range of organisations that work directly with families where there is violence.  We have included in the best interest description, when the court is making a decision about a child in relation to access, custody, or guardianship, "The court shall have regard to family violence that has occurred or is likely to occur in the family of the child including the impact or likely impact of such violence on the safety of the child and other members of his or her family, the child's personal well-being, including the child's psychological and emotional well-being, the victim of such violence, and the capacity of the perpetrator of the violence to properly care for the child and the risk, if any, that the perpetrator poses to the child."  That is an interesting point that is often spoken about.  We have gone into quite a lot of detail.  It is one of the sections---</p></speech>

I certainly do not think that criminal law should be introduced into the family law area.  I am concerned about the circumstance where, whether it is the mother or the father, one of them is misbehaving and creating an enormous difficulty with regard to access issues.  On occasions fathers create enormous difficulties for custodial mothers by not complying with access arrangements or using them to try to turn the child against the mother.  I have seen every combination of this.  What I am saying is that what we have in the Bill allowing the courts to require people to attend parental counselling, allowing the courts to require people to attend family counselling, all of this is a great advance and very important but we need, when those individuals who the court directs to do this do no cooperate, the court needs some sanction and there is no reason why, for example, the court should not have the capacity to prescribe stand-alone community service.  It is not about a criminal offence.  It is a sanction instead of committal to prison for contempt of court.  It is not even a substitute for that, it is not asking the courts to commit anyone to prison.</p><p>There should be sensible, stand-alone sanctions that do not damage the parent-child relationship and which are pragmatic and workable in circumstances where people do not have much in the way of available funds and where imposing a fine may not be a practical sanction.  The courts need some form of sanction in order that, instead of judges urging people who are obstinate and intent on using their children as pawns in an ongoing relationship battle, they can tell those parents that if they do not conduct themselves properly they can do X.  At the moment there is not an X which they can do.  The only X available is parental or family counselling or making good the cost of attending where access was not granted, but if that does not work, what happens next?</p></speech>

Section 86 amends section 42 of the 1995 act, which allows the court, either instead of or as well as securing a maintenance order under section 41, to order a lump sum payment.  The Deputy raised this point on Second Stage.</p> <p>  The amendment in paragraph (a) is technical to reflect the additional categories of orders which may be so secured.  The amendment in paragraph (b) provides for the insertion of a new subsection which gives the court the powers to order how a lump sum should be spent, including providing suitable accommodation for a child.</p></speech>

I will reference it as (2A) in section 86(b), though it is cross-referenced as section 42(b)(2A).  Under this provision the Circuit Court or the High Court can make a lump sum order that is unlimited in amount.  It can be an order made instead of, or in addition to, a periodical payment order.  How will this work in practice and is it adequate?  The amendment of sections 41 and 42 of the 1995 Act is not adequate and does not go far enough.  I direct my attention to a child born outside marriage because in a marital family there is no difficulty about lump sum orders in other provisions in our family law legislation.  My example involves an unmarried couple who reside together for a period, a child is born and the father makes off.  Let us assume the father is reasonably wealthy and owns a number of properties or substantial assets and he may well be able to afford a house for his child if the court orders a lump sum payment including an element for the accommodation of the child.  Does this section envisage a provision for a sufficiently large sum of money to buy a home for the child in these circumstances?  In mirror circumstances, if a marriage broke down, would a spouse be required to buy a home for the other spouse and child?</p></speech>

I am conscious of cases in this area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-05a.1176" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2015030500002#MM00200"><p>That leads on to another issue which is a problem.  I would have mentioned I was involved in court proceedings some years ago.  This is a declaration of interest that I have referenced on several occasions.  The McE case involved an unmarried mother left high and dry by an extremely wealthy father with whom she had been residing.  The Circuit Court made an order for &euro;400,000 for the purchase of a house for the benefit of the child and the mother.  The High Court reversed that order on the basis that lump sum orders under this particular provision could be made to benefit the children of married couples but not a child born outside marriage.  This made no sense in the context of how the law was framed.  The case was taken to the European Court of Justice and was settled on the basis that the law would be adequately changed to ensure no judge would do this in the future.</p> <p>  This provision goes part of the way.  The real difficulty is that it does not spell out in full what the Minister intends.  I agree with her that this is the intention.  There is a risk, however, in the manner in which the Judiciary approaches this.  The antiquated approach taken in the above case by a learned member of the High Court which was clearly going to get this State into difficulty in the European courts could be replicated.  There is a need to expressly make it clear that in making provision for accommodation, it can include, where it is financially appropriate, a sum be provided for the purchase of a home for the benefit of the child and the parent - most frequently it will be the mother - bringing up the child.  That is not clear from this, however.  This measure could be interpreted by a court as requiring someone to provide a couple of thousand euro by way of a lump sum as a down payment for a rental property.  It may well be that this is what it can only be where people have very limited means.  However, that was not the intention.</p> <p>  The second aspect is that if the courts are to make a lump sum order to allow for the purchase of accommodation to give a child security, the courts have to have powers to determine the ownership of that property.  If a lump sum is to be provided for accommodation, is the property, for example, to be purchased in the mother&rsquo;s name to be held in trust for the child?  Is it to be purchased in the father&rsquo;s name on the basis the child will only live in the property until a particular age and then will vacate it?  Can the lump sum be used to put the property into the joint names of mother and child where perhaps the mother will be the primary custodial parent, the best part of 18 years?  It would be a gross injustice that when her child finally reaches adulthood and ends education that she and the child could be rendered homeless.  This is not adequately teased out yet.</p> <p>  The original provision that the committee considered had another section that allowed for the courts to order that property be purchased in the name of trustees.  More work was needed to be done on that particular provision, however.  That was fine by way of heads of a Bill but it needed to be teased out further.  It now seems to me that instead it has not dealt with the ownership of a property that might be purchased to provide a roof over a child&rsquo;s head, provide security in that property, to provide the parent caring for the child, who in 98% of such cases in these circumstances will be the mother, will not be rendered homeless after she has brought the child up.  These issues need to be dealt with.</p> <p>  There are interesting provisions in English legislation that could be possibly adapted into Irish legislation.  They would have to be adapted, however, because the manner in which English courts have interpreted their particular measure is not adequate to meet our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.  This has been dealt with in other jurisdictions.  The reason is simple.  If a marriage breaks up and a divorce decree is sought, the courts can make lump sum orders and require that a home be purchased with funds where there are family assets for the benefit of the mother and child.  When a couple breaks up or a child is born outside of marriage to a very wealthy father, then that child should have the same equal entitlement to a roof over his or her head as any other child has.</p> <p>  What was in the original draft Bill was not by any means perfect.  It was adequate for a consultative process.  There is a need to tease this out further.  This is too brief and knowing the manner in which the Judiciary will come to approach this, we will all be back again some years from now.  What is more important - people being back here or the State being in the European Court?  This will be to the disadvantage of a number of children in coming years for whom better provision could be made if we deal with this correctly now.  A more sophisticated provision addressing these issues should be introduced on Report Stage.</p></speech>

Family law Acts do not require accommodation to be purchased in the names of children.
