Apologies have been received from Deputy Mary Lou McDonald.</p><p>The minutes of the meeting of 25 January 2018 have been circulated.  Are they agreed?  Agreed.  Any matters arising from the minutes will be dealt with shortly.</p><p>The next item is correspondence received since the committee's last meeting.  In category A correspondence are Nos. 1049 and 1050, which are the briefing document and opening statement received<b></b>from Ms Hilary Murphy-Fagan, chief executive of the National Shared Services Office, for today's meeting.  This has been published.  </p><p>In category B correspondence, from Accounting Officers and Ministers and follow up to PAC meetings, we have received correspondence from John O'Sullivan, commissioner of valuation, dated 26 January 2018, which provides a briefing note on the dates of Laois valuations.  </p><p>One request for follow-up information was made at the meeting last week and the secretariat has followed up on a number of other matters which we should receive in the next two weeks.  We will note and publish that. </p><p>Category C relates to correspondence from private individuals and any other correspondence.  Item Nos. 1038(i) to (ii)<b></b>was received<b></b>from an individual dated 23 January 2018 in relation to alleged Tusla misuse of public moneys.  A copy of a letter from Tusla to the individual in relation to a report mentioned is attached to it.  I propose in the first instance that we write to Tusla for a response to the key items raised in the correspondence.  Tusla seems to have written directly to the person on 12 January and the individual who wrote to us has reverted to the committee with further queries.  We will ask Tusla for a response in so far as it can give it, as it relates in part to individual staff members.</p><p>The next item is No. 1042 received<b></b>from Deputy Catherine Murphy in relation to the funding model for local authorities and population changes.  Does the Deputy wish to speak to the item?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-01a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018020100002#A00400"><p>I should say at the outset that this does not fundamentally refer to local property tax, so I do not believe it falls within the rubric of Government policy.  It refers to the allocation of funding to local government, as it relates formally to the local government fund.  The information was gathered around 2000 based on what was known as the needs and resources model.  It counted what was there historically and the benchmark was that no local authority was to lose out.</p> <p>  There was no future-proofing of the model and no counting of population.  There have been several censuses of population since then.  The baselines which were set originally around 2000 or 2001 are not very different from what is used now.  There would have been changes relating to Irish Water and the associated transfer of staff, resources and liabilities and there was a change last year related to how pensions were calculated, but otherwise the baselines have not changed.</p><p>I have examined a number of comparators between counties that are growing rapidly and some that are not growing as quickly.  In all cases where there has been a population increase, I have tried to match them with counties of comparable sizes.  For example, Mayo has a baseline of &euro;17 million whereas Wicklow has a baseline of &euro;6 million.  If one considers how the local property tax, LPT, is impacted by the baseline, one will see that Mayo receives a sizable transfer of funds whereas Wicklow contributes to the LPT fund.  In terms of gross expenditure by counties that are not dissimilar, however, Mayo actually has a great deal more money to spend.</p><p> Other pairs show the same trends.  Where Limerick City and County Council is concerned, the city has a decent commercial rates base.  Fingal has the lowest baseline in the country, but it has been the most rapidly growing area.  Parts of Fingal did not even exist when the resourcing model was established.</p><p> The baseline is influencing how much of the money that must be spent is self-funded, effectively replacing the grants that would otherwise have been paid from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport or Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The baselines need to be amended and account must be taken of population changes in any calculation if there is to be a fair allocation and value for money around the country.</p><p> I wrote to determine whether the committee would consider this matter.  What is being examined at the moment is exclusively a revaluation of LPT.  Projecting that revaluation forward, the areas with stronger population growth will recover better and, due to the baselines, far more authorities will fall into the self-funded category and will have less discretion with the overall take.  The LPT will be undermined by the baselines.</p><p> I wrote because I was unsure as to whether this matter fell within our remit, but it is problematic.</p></speech>

Examining the current figures in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report is all well and good, but we need to know where the baseline is coming from, so it is relevant.</p></speech>

I do not believe Deputy Murphy meant that.</p></speech>

Galway County Council is third from the bottom in the league and the second largest county in the country.  We had two emergency meetings with departmental officials last week and the week before regarding this underfunding.  The officials have put on the record that they do not have money to do the roads.  Deputy Murphy referred to falling.  Without exaggerating, the roads are falling apart, but Galway is the third last.  It is a major problem.</p></speech>

We were called to an urgent meeting by the acting county manager, such is the situation on the ground.  I am just balancing what has been said.  Something is amiss.</p></speech>

While this is not the forum for the discussion, we can get into it in the March sitting.  There is capacity for local authorities to raise funding themselves.  In many cases, they reduce funding.  We cannot ignore the fact that the capacity exists and is often not used for other reasons.  There needs to be balance in this argument.</p></speech>

We will alert the Department to send a detailed briefing note to us on this topic well in advance of that so that we can be well armed with information when the issue is raised.</p> <p>  The next correspondence is No. 1046 from an individual dated 9 January 2018 regarding an alleged co-ordinated sabotage of a research programme focused on developing a comprehensive blueprint for the delivery of acute hospital health care in Ireland.  We have received earlier correspondence from this individual, with whom the Department of Health has also been in direct contact.  The essential matter appears to be related to policy and not within our remit.  I propose that we write to the individual explaining this and that the committee's consideration of the matter is now closed.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  To be straight up with members, I met this man at my constituency clinic last summer.  I was not able to progress the issue because I had difficulty with it.  Essentially, it is a health policy issue, so our committee does not have a role.  We will write to him with that response.</p> <p>  Next are Nos. 1048(i) and 1048(ii), received from Ms Laura Burke, director general of the Environmental Protection Agency, dated 24 January 2018, providing a response to our request for an explanatory note on an item of correspondence received by us from the Irish Environmental Forum.  The correspondence from the EPA refers to a report by the European Environment Agency in 2011 as well as other matters, including the review of the EPA in 2010.  The EPA has responded directly to the individual.  It attached in our correspondence a letter that it sent to the then Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht on 2 May 2013 regarding the same issue raised by the same individual.  If an issue arises, it is for that-----</p></speech>

Members have received a dossier that came from them also.  Some of these questions have been put to a Minister in the D&aacute;il but the unions involved are not content with the answers received.  There are issues regarding the underfunding of the pension scheme.  There is also an allegation that a ministerial order was disregarded.  They are calling for an independent investigation into the governance of the two CI&Eacute; pension schemes.  The issues appear to concern governance.  They are also seeking funding for independent legal advice.  There is a lot contained in the dossier members received.  I am seeking guidance from the Chairman as to how or if we can address this issue.  If we cannot do it, is there another mechanism by which this matter can be raised?</p></speech>

We have three reports before us today, the first of which is the accounts of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board for 2016.  This is a small operation with a clear audited opinion.  The other report is the 2015-2016 accounts for Mary Immaculate College in Limerick, which have a clear audited opinion and attention is drawn to recognition of the deferred pension funding and a standard for all universities and colleges.</p> <p>  The committee has received the financial statement for 2016 from the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.  This organisation maintains the register of tenancies and provides dispute resolution services for tenants and landlords.  The turnover of the organisation is &euro;10.2 million.  It is clear audited report but the Comptroller and Auditor General has drawn attention to &euro;2.1 million of legal fees where the relevant services had not been procured by way of competitive processes since 2011.  Before I came to the committee today I had a quick look at the accounts for the RTB.  The expenditure of the year 2016 was &euro;10.3 million and the single biggest cost was legal and professional fees of &euro;2.147 million.  The salary costs were only &euro;1.5 million.  That an organisation can spend 20% of its total income in one heading without going to a competitive tender, for the last seven years, is utterly unacceptable.  The committee will write to the RTB for a detailed note.  We will ask for a detailed note, company by company, to provide the total payments that were made in the financial statements of 2016, legal firm by legal firm as the case may be, or the other professional advisers.  I am sure we could include valuers also.  We will ask why there was not a competitive tendering process in recent times.  When we get this information, the committee will scrutinise it further.  The scale of this non-procurement relative to the size of the organisation is extraordinary. </p></speech>

I can read that paragraph for the committee, which states:</p><blockquote>In 2016 the RTB incurred expenditure totalling &euro;2.1 million in legal fees to a firm of solicitors where the relevant service had not been procured by way of a competitive process since 2011.  The service wasn't put out to tender in 2016 because substantial legislative change in 2015 and 2016, and our use of insourced legal staff from the firm to work alongside RTB staff, created the risk that we would lose accumulated knowledge by changing supplier at a time when we had significant operational deliverables such as the roll out of Rent Pressure Zones.<br /><br />The RTB is aware that this contract does not comply with guidelines and in 2017 intends to publish a request for tender under the Office for Government Procurement's legal services framework.</blockquote></speech>

It is an explanation, but a weak one to say that the board wants to stick with the professional advisers it has because of changes in legislation.  These advisers are almost embedded in the organisation at this stage, they have been working alongside it for so long.  We have covered it.  We will get the note.</p></speech>

It looks as if there are people from the particular firm effectively working with the board permanently and dealing with various issues on an ongoing basis.  We will come back to that.  That is agreed.</p> <p>  The next item is the current work programme.  Members have a copy.  We agreed to some of it at the last meeting.  When we go into private session I want to talk about the presentation from Brian Keenan on corporation tax receipts.  We will talk about that topic in private session in a moment, before the witnesses come in.  We will hold that over.  On the rest of the programme, there is a full meeting on the topic of public private partnerships, PPPs, alone on Thursday, 22 March.  I suggest that we bring in the Department of Education and Skills, Transport Infrastructure Ireland and the National Development Finance Agency, which manages these partnerships.  It is a subsidiary of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA.  There are some smaller PPPs under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality and the odd other small project, but the two big users of PPPs are the Department of Education and Skills and Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  We need a full meeting on PPPs.  We will have to rearrange the other items for a later date.</p></speech>

As the Chairman knows, Carillion has collapsed and the construction of a number of schools is on hold as a result.  In advance of that sitting and that hearing, can I ask Mr. McCarthy whether the Comptroller and Auditor General's office has done any work on public private partnerships in the past?  Does it have a document that it might be able to present to us?  We had some discussion on the issue before in respect of different Departments.  When the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform were before the committee there was some discussion on whether the processes in place to evaluate the effectiveness and value for money of public private partnerships are what they should be.  Obviously that will inform the questions which we put, but if there were any reports produced or research carried out in the past which would help us it would be useful if they were given to the committee.  I am not sure whether any special reports or reporting on PPPs were carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General's office, but if there were-----</p></speech>

It is necessary and timely.  Those two areas specifically are the most important in that regard.  Can we reverse into the whole issue of national procurement guidelines, tendering and so on in some way?  It is a topic which keeps surfacing but which we never delve into.  There are issues here in respect of costs to the taxpayer.  I do not think they are smooth.  They need to be changed.  "Tweaked" would not be a big enough word for me; they need to be changed substantially.  This one-size-fits-all approach with regard to national procurement rules is not working.  It is causing issues in some sectors, especially given the developing economy and the capital plan which is supposed to be announced every week.  Given the way the national planning framework is progressing that will not be announced for another year.  It is an apt time for us to discuss this issue in this format.  The Chairman might come back to me on that.</p></speech>

The second thing I will mention, so that it can be put on the schedule for some time in late March or early April, is that we must come back to the issue of the IT contracts in an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Some of the information which has come out is completely contrary to the evidence which we were given in this committee.  I have read the transcripts of our committee deliberations on this topic and, frankly speaking, some of the information which has come out in the D&aacute;il, which has come back to myself and other Deputies in replies to parliamentary questions, and which is now out in the public indicates that the scale of this issue is pretty huge.  We are dealing with large amounts of money.  We are dealing with a certain supplier.  This issue needs to be opened up and there needs to be accountability on it not just in respect of what is going on, but also in respect of why we were given certain answers in this room over which I would now have very serious questions.</p></speech>

We will have a few Accounting Officers here that day.  I have one question for the Comptroller and Auditor General.  A large proportion of the PPPs entered into in the past, and which are still in place, were in the area of water services under the local authorities.  They have now gone to Irish Water.  Can we get at that through this committee?  They were under the Department but are now under Irish Water.</p></speech>

The National Shared Services Office was set up in 2014 as an administrative office within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  From the beginning of this year, 2018, it has been a stand-alone office with its own Accounting Officer.  It is responsible for delivering suitable business services on a shared basis, mainly for other central Government Departments and offices.<br/><br/>The shared services office currently provides two main services: PeoplePoint,<b></b>which provides a human resources and pensions administration service; and the Payroll Shared Service Centre,<b></b>which provides a payroll and pension payment service.</p><p>A shared services financial management system is in development.  At the end of 2016, 39 departments had transferred HR functions to PeoplePoint and 43 had transferred their payroll functions to the Payroll Shared Services Centre, PSCC.</p><p> The 2016 appropriation account for the Vote for shared services records gross expenditure totalling &euro;36.4 million.  There was an underspend in the year of &euro;7.35 million.  That was 17% relative to the gross estimate.  This was primarily due to delays in planned transfers of staff from departmental payroll centres to PSSC, and delays in staff recruitment.  There has been a change in the presentation of the Vote for 2016.  In previous years, each of the main shared services was reported on as a separate expenditure programme.  For 2016, only a global programme is presented.  Pay costs totalling &euro;21.1 million accounted for 58% of the expenditure.</p><p> Turning to the chapter on the management of salary overpayments, acting as the agent for the bodies it serves, the shared services office processed payments of &euro;3.2 billion relating to 102,400 employees in 2016.  This involved running 2,438 weekly, 1,482 fortnightly and 192 monthly payment runs.  It should be noted that the payments made for the bodies concerned are charged back to the relevant appropriation account or financial statements of the bodies concerned, and are not a charge on the Vote for shared services.  During the audits of appropriation accounts for 2015, we noted a general increase in the level of salary overpayments being reported.  I decided to examine the matter across the board for 2016, focusing on how the shared services office managed and recovered salary overpayments.  The examination found that the office notified its client departments that overpayments totalling &euro;4.6 million were outstanding at the end of 2016.</p><p> In any large and complex payroll system, it is likely that some salary overpayments will occur, usually because it is necessary to process the payroll to meet pay day commitments before all information that might require a salary adjustment is available.  The examination found that late notification was the cause of the overpayment in the majority of cases reviewed.  In a sample examined, this mainly occurred because the PSSC were only notified weeks, and, in some cases, months, after an employee should have been put on a zero rate or a reduced rate of pay, for example, due to extended sick leave.  There can be late notification by the relevant employer department to PeoplePoint, and-or by PeoplePoint to PSSC.  Like any debt, it is important that salary overpayments are managed effectively, and repayment arrangements put in place promptly.  In figure 10.2, the chapter presents an overview of a framework for the effective management of overpayments.  The examination found scope for improvement in each aspect of this framework.</p><p> We found that, at the end of 2016, there were almost 650 identified overpayment cases where the amount of the overpayment had not yet been recorded.  The overpayment had arisen more than six months previously in a quarter of these cases.  Delays in identifying the value means the recovery process cannot begin, which may ultimately make it more difficult to recover the overpayment.  We also identified two ways in which overpayments arose, but which were not being correctly captured by shared services.</p><p> Even in cases where the overpayment amount had been calculated, there was evidence of delays in commencing recovery action.  At end 2016, there were more than 380 cases with an overpayment value of &euro;1.1 million outstanding for more than a year, with no recovery plan in place.  Based on the examination of a sample of cases, the average time taken to issue the first letter requesting repayment was 13 weeks.  We also found there was a lack of clarity between the NSSO and the departments being served around the division of responsibility for management of identified overpayment cases.</p><p> Recovery of overpayments is often by means of regular deduction from future pay.  There is no system in place to identify cases where deductions have ceased but the full amount of the overpayment has not yet been recovered.  The examination identified overpayments to four individuals where this had happened.</p><p> Overall, it was found that the systems in place did not provide the necessary information to allow for the effective management of overpayments.  It was not possible to readily generate an aged analysis of overpayments or to quantify the level of recovery.  Extensive manual intervention was required to calculate the amount outstanding at year end and the examination identified a number of errors in this calculation.  In addition, the reported year end figure did not include all overpayments, mainly due to a lack of clarity between the NSSO and client departments as to the respective responsibilities for particular types of cases.  The chapter makes a number of recommendations to improve systems and recovery processes, and to clarify responsibilities.  I am glad that the Accounting Officer accepted all of the recommendations, and will provide an update on their implementation.</p></speech>

I thank the committee also for the opportunity to make an opening statement.  As we have provided the committee with briefing material, I will endeavour to provide a relevant overview in my statement to make best use of the committee&rsquo;s time.</p> <p>  The matters being examined are chapter 10 of the Comptroller and Auditor General report 2016; which is titled Shared Services &ndash; Management of Salary Overpayments, and the Appropriation Account 2016, Vote 18, which is the Vote for the NSSO.  Before I give an outline of these matters, and as this is my first appearance before the committee as the Accounting Officer for the NSSO, I would like to set out the background of the office and the progress we have made in delivering our objectives in recent years.</p> <p>  The NSSO is a statutory office, established under the National Shared Services Office Act 2017, on 1 January 2018, when it became a separate Civil Service office, under the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The NSSO is contributing to the modernisation of corporate administration and professionalisation of these functions across the civil and public service.  The office is responsible for shared services provision across the entire Civil Service . This allows Departments and offices to focus on their core purpose of effective front-line service delivery.  While each sector in the public service has responsibility for implementing shared services, the NSSO supports the progression of the strategy across the public service by providing advice and guidance on best practice, creating professional communities for learning about shared services standards, policy development and research.</p> <p>  The Chairman will be familiar with MyPay in County Laois, which administers payroll for 28 local authorities and pensions for 15 local authorities, and HAP in Limerick, a housing assistance payment scheme.  A new multifunctional shared services centre for higher education is being established in Dublin.  Athlone has an administration centre for schools, and SUSI's data centre in Cork and its operation in Dublin administers the grant payment shared service for students.  The HBS is the provider of multiple shared services to the HSE and it has plans to consolidate administration further.</p> <p>  The NSSO has two shared services operations in four locations - Clonskeagh, Tullamore, Killarney and Galway - which comprise HR shared services, providing HR and pensions administration services to 34,500 civil and public servants, and payroll shared services, administering payroll, travel and expense, and pension payments to 124,500 civil and public servants.  A project is well under way to develop the shared services model for financial management and this will go live in mid-2018.  As articulated by Secretary General, Mr. Robert Watt, during previous sessions with the committee, the Government must invest to deliver cost and efficiency benefits, and shared services is an intrinsic part of that transformation of strategy.</p><p>Since 2012, the Government has invested &euro;32.3 million capital funding in technology, facilities and consulting costs for HR and payroll shared services.  While this is still at an early stage of maturity, the savings estimated for HR and payroll shared services to date are &euro;21 million and it is expected to deliver &euro;13 million annually, as these centres are fully established.</p><p> In addition to cost savings and improved effectiveness arising from standardised processes across the Civil Service, other benefits include the following.  Payroll shared services has replaced 18 payroll offices around the country that had different licensing and versions of payroll systems with one shared service centre on a single technology platform administering payroll, pensions, and travel and expenses one way across Government.  In 2016, payroll shared services made 2.7 million payments to the value of &euro;3.24 billion.  This increased to &euro;4.7 billion in 2017 and will increase further in 2018 now that all in-scope public service bodies have transitioned their payroll and expenses to the NSSO.  HR shared services responded to 77,466 calls and closed 215,268 cases in 2016.  In 2017, this increased to 86,028 calls and 231,289 closed cases.  This level of service delivery was acknowledged with the awarding of the CCMA 2015 Shared Services Award to PeoplePoint while the Civil Service Innovation Award went to the PSSC in the same year.</p><p> A further &euro;42.7 million is the estimated capital investment required to establish finance shared services.  The development of a new finance technology solution for Government is well under way.  A single finance technology platform will replace 31 financial management and reporting systems across Government Departments and offices and facilitate transaction processing in the new finance shared services operation in the NSSO.  When fully established, finance shared services will deliver a sustainable reduction in the annual cost of Government financial management of approximately &euro;15.4 million annually from 2021 through a reduction in the cost of support for finance technology, and a reduction in the resources required to provide financial management processing.</p><p> Since 2014, the NSSO has delivered many benefits for the Civil Service.  These include the introduction of one set of standard HR and pension processes, applied consistently, based on common HR policies.  These standard processes are eliminating local interpretation and thereby increasing fairness for employees.  Civil servants can access HR and pension services through a much wider range of channels, including the first online system, giving them easier and faster access to important information on entitlements and services.  For example, the HR portal receives over 300,000 visits per month.  HR data analytics are more readily available to management on a Civil Service-wide basis.  The first online system for public service travel and expenses claims was introduced, with payments processed within a week.  Online payslips are provided to all payees and there is immediate access to payroll information, including downloadable P60 forms.  This is a significant change to the hard-copy payslips and paper-based receipts of the past.</p><p> Insights gained through shared services informed the development of Government policies, such as absence, leave and the recoupment of overpayments.  Improved technology has resulted in automation in several areas, including the updating of personal information, for example annual leave, removing the need for repeated manual entry on the HR system.  Almost 1.5 million annual leave updates have been recorded in four years and further automation is on the way.  A single definitive source of information can be utilised for many purposes that can help the Government with the implementation of strategic changes and the development of data driven, evidence-based policy formulation.  Shared services continues to have a positive impact by creating dedicated specialist teams whose focus is solely on service quality through process improvement, technology and digitisation.  Our team is building expertise and competencies in complex large-scale transformation programme management, service and quality management, lean thinking and digital and technology innovation.</p><p> As with any organisation on this scale and at such an early stage of maturity, progress has not been without its issues.  It is reasonable to expect that challenges and corrections are needed as part of the set-up and stabilisation period.  As with other shared service organisations in the public and private sectors, this has also been the case for the NSSO.  We have encountered and solved a number of issues and learned some lessons.</p><p> I turn now to address the Comptroller and Auditor General Report 2016, Chapter 10 - Shared Services &ndash; Management of Salary Overpayments.  I start by thanking the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General for its valuable assistance in preparing this report to deal with complex issues, which I will now articulate as follows.  The committee should note that the Comptroller and Auditor General report accepted the inevitability of salary overpayments, given the scale and complexity of the payments involved and it acknowledged that there are many causes for overpayments.  I stress that the NSSO is very aware of its responsibility for the stewardship of public moneys.  When any overpayment occurs, the NSSO pursues the recovery of those moneys as soon as possible in a standard way for all staff.  In the response to the Comptroller and Auditor General report, it was noted that the value of overpayments in 2016 represents just 0.3% of the pay bill, confirming that 99.7% of the pay bill is being administered effectively.  I also welcome that the Comptroller and Auditor General noted in his report that the audits of those bodies did not find any material errors in the payroll charges.  Of course we would like to eliminate all overpayments, but we do not operate in a perfect world where every pay impact is notified in time to administer prior to the payroll run.  Adjustments to salaries are always needed, be it public or private sector.  An overpayment occurs when a staff member is paid more than his or her entitlement.  Overpayments to staff of salary, allowances and expenses can and do occur because of late notification, after the payroll closed and the file has issued to the bank for payment.</p><p> I confirm that the NSSO agreed to all the recommendations in the report from the Comptroller and Auditor General on the overpayment of salaries to civil and public servants and has commenced implementation of actions required.  As well as accepting all recommendations in the report, we outlined that a number of actions would be taken.  Since the last quarter of 2017, a monthly report on overpayments issues to each finance officer.  This shows the current balance outstanding on plans in recoupment, the value collected on all plans "year to date", and the list of all active overpayment cases.  This provides the finance officer with all the information required.  The decision for off pay cases remains with each Accounting Officer.  Responsibility for legacy cases is being progressed and a statement on responsibility will be inserted into the service management agreement for 2018.  In the Comptroller and Auditor General report it was noted that there was a delay in recovering overpayments.  I confirm to the committee that just over &euro;2 million was collected in 2016 and the estimate for 2017 is higher.  A revision to the recoupment circular in May 2017 allows for recovery of the full value of an overpayment within a month in circumstances where a staff member has been overpaid for a period of five days or less.  This has resulted in a reduction in the time taken to process overpayments.</p><p> The reform of sick leave in the public service, while creating significant savings and standardisation of administration and elimination of legacy issues, has meant that staff are reaching sick leave thresholds earlier which increases the risk of a pay adjustment not being notified in a timely manner.  Shared services is reliant on employees and managers notifying sick leave on the first day of occurrence.  Late or delayed notification results in overpayments.  Regular communications were issued by the NSSO to Civil Service staff to notify them of their obligations and an intensified information campaign is also planned for 2018 with local HR.  Following a comprehensive analysis of the root cause of overpayments in 2017, a review of pay impact processes in the NSSO including greater automation is under way.  This will help to reduce and eliminate any delays in the NSSO.</p><p>Furthermore, internal organisation changes are planned for the end of the second quarter of 2018 to centralise the calculation of overpayment values, in order to shorten the time taken to agree the recoupment plan and start to recover the money.  Consequently, I believe the NSSO will reduce the number and value of overpayments further in 2018.</p><p> On the appropriation account published in 2017, I welcome the clear audit opinion given by the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of Vote 18 for shared services, which is subject to review today.  Since the NSSO was established on an administrative basis in 2014, I have worked to ensure that the NSSO operates effectively and efficiently and that the use of public resources is scrutinised and optimised to ensure best value for money for the Exchequer.</p><p> Notwithstanding that, there is an issue with under-expenditure in the Vote.  The reasons relate mainly to the ongoing project work we are delivering.  These projects are very significant.  The NSSO is leading a very significant transformation programme across Government.  There is a balance between maintaining the project pace within an acceptable level of risk while ensuring delivery and value for money.  Our best attempt to forecast may require adjustment if a risk arises.  In 2016, the underspend was declared and surrendered to the Exchequer in a timely manner.  We are aware that, for 2016, there was a significant underspend as set out in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  As an office, we are very conscious of ensuring we set realistic forecasts and adjust as soon as possible on an ongoing basis, consistent with public financial procedures.</p><p> Shared services contribute to the modernisation of the civil and public service.  They create capacity to build a clear strategy for HR, payroll and finance and improve the capability and professional skills of our staff.  By operating a single standard way of working, the NSSO is able to contribute strategically and respond quickly to new and emerging requirements such as when a new Government Department is created.  Shared services are about standard processes supported by self-service technology.  It is a balancing act, investing to reduce costs and demonstrating efficiencies and improvements while at the same time changing responsibilities and accountabilities.  While making these changes, issues such as overpayments are amplified by the centralisation of data and the transparency that shared services bring to such matters.</p><p> Before I conclude, I acknowledge and thank my staff who have really got behind this major change programme and worked hard and long hours to deliver it.  Without their dedication and focus, the NSSO could not have achieved these milestones reached so far.  I also thank past members of the shared services steering board and programme boards for providing their support and time to assist the delivery of this ambitious programme of change.  I am confident that further improvements currently underway will result in a positive impact on managing overpayments more effectively.  I will answer any question the Chairman or members of the committee may have.</p></speech>

I think it is their first time here.  From a general point of view, it is a first for us too.  I have a number of questions.  In Ms Murphy-Fagan's contribution, she said that the organisation and its process is pretty new.  She said a number of lessons have been learned but did not outline what they are.  What are they, in order of priority?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-01a.129" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Hilary Murphy-Fagan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018020100002#H00600"><p>Having implemented two of the three major programmes, we have learned and done well with strong governance for the programmes and delivery of the change.  One of the biggest lessons was the impact of the change and the requirement to support the change management in each public service bodies, PSBs, and to support users with the system.  While we have communicated and developed communication materials that were disseminated in various PSBs, we have learned that we need to do even more of that in the future.  We have taken that lesson as it relates to financial management shared services and really increased the level of engagement, communication and awareness for financial management.  That has been a big lesson because there is an impact on the end user when one moves to a shared services model, particularly with the difference in responsibilities and accountabilities because they change when one moves to a shared services model.</p> <p>  The second lesson is that we have robust business cases in every case.  That was a requirement for the Government to make a decision to implement this change.  We did not start the benefits management and tracking as early as we could have.  We now track our benefits which I was able to insert into my opening statement.  When it comes to financial management, we will have a benefits statement which will be signed and agreed with each Accounting Officer before we start the transition to the final shared services.  We will make sure that we monitor that.  A last point, despite the best attempts, efforts and experience of my staff and the competencies and capabilities they have gained in the past year, is that with any large-scale transformation programme, while there are significant benefits, there are also risks.  We have to consider how we manage those risks and look for certain risks that maybe, with the wisdom of hindsight, we could have dealt with sooner.  We will certainly look at that in the future.</p></speech>

We constantly monitor and report on our performance against service level targets.  We have a service management agreement in place with each body.</p><p>We monitor our customer service through satisfaction and we have a complaints procedure that we monitor for complaints as well but, as with any service organisation, and particularly at our very early stage of maturity, we can always do better.

Two years later, overpayments amounted to &euro;4.6 million.  Ms Murphy-Fagan stated overpayments will reduce in 2018 but they have the opposite trajectory.  Given such a trajectory, why is Ms Murphy-Fagan confident that she will be able to turn the ship around?  What has changed?</p> <p>  For example, I was contacted by somebody on a matter of no real issue in which there was a very small sum involved.  Before the last election, there was a private secretary who, obviously, received an allowance for that role.  Two years later, he was contacted to pay back a small amount of money.  That is not the issue.  The issue was it took two years.  He did not even realise he was overpaid.  In fact, he was only contacted recently.</p></speech>

The data is not comparable in that we were servicing a much smaller number of client bodies in 2014 than at the end of 2017.  For the Departments that transitioned later during that phase, they themselves continue to manage their overpayments and they also had their payrolls - they themselves were processing payrolls and administering payroll.  When one looks at the data, I can understand the question.  However, it is a moving target because the number of bodies we service is different now.</p></speech>

One was implemented then.  Then, in May of 2017, further revisions to that were made, following the experience from the NSSO of recovering the money and following feedback from the client bodies and the staff who received overpayments themselves.  That has brought a number of clarifications which is helping to eliminate any disputes because it is very clear on what the responsibility of the NSSO is and what the responsibility of the individual employee, if he or she received an overpayment, is.</p></speech>

Assuming that the local HR agrees that the recoupment should proceed, there is then a notification process to the individual.  There are two letters that issue to the individual in that regard which provide an opportunity for the person, I suppose, if he or she has a query on the amount or a question around the speed or otherwise of the recovery plan, to engage with shared services.  It does afford that opportunity for engagement by the individual to agree the recoupment plan.  Our policy is for 8% of gross pay to be recouped within a 12 month period at the outset.  Most of our overpayments fall within a band of &euro;1,000 or less.  I suppose the incidence of dispute within individual cases probably is relatively low but it could happen.</p></speech>

There is confusion over who is doing what.</p></speech>

Certainly, there was confusion at a point in time, particularly for the bodies that transferred earlier.  Those cases came across to the NSSO.  For Departments that transferred more recently to us, first of all, we have clarified in the service management agreement exactly what the responsibilities are in relation to legacy cases.  Second, for those cases that may be sitting with a payroll office in a Department if they are transitioning in, they are clear that it is their responsibility to calculate the value of the overpayment.  Given that earlier I stated that all of the Departments in scope have now transitioned in to us, the issue of legacy cases is a very small one at this stage.  We have a small number of legacy cases.</p></speech>

To be honest, it was not a good experience in that they felt many of the staff were demoralised in respect of a number of issues.  I will outline them to the witness and she can respond because, obviously, we must have both sides of the equation.  They had difficulty explaining a number of issues for many of the people the office serves.  There were issues relating to overpayments, delays and mistakes with pension payments, which had not happened previously, delays of two to three months with the payment of increments, which had not happened previously, delays with leave applications, particularly applications for parental leave for some reason, and mistakes and misunderstandings regarding starting pay when people get promoted or moved.  A specific issue raised with me, which is quite unique, relates to the early shutdown of payroll before Christmas, which meant some people on lower wages did not get the overtime payments they were depending on for Christmas.  Another relates to delays in issuing P60s.  The Chairman asked about that earlier, probably for the same reason.  Does the witness wish to comment on those issues?  Are they accurate?</p></speech>

Obviously, as another stakeholder I would always welcome any evidence they might be able to provide regarding how we could improve our service.  I said at the outset that this is a very large-scale shared service operation and it is still relatively immature.  Second, service is utterly important to us.  It is our reputation and we are constantly striving to improve it.  We have a very strong governance process.  We have a customer services group which has representation from HR managers and finance officers from the various Departments we service.  My colleague, Ms Lyons, is on that customer services group and it is chaired by the chief human resources officer for the Civil Service because shared services are part of that HR strategy.  The group meets monthly to look at what the top issues are.  Service management meetings are held very regularly to examine what issues are arising for staff or management, to understand the root cause of those issues and to see how we can improve those.  We keep a log or record of everything.  We look at what issues we are able to resolve and close and what issues remain open.  It is really quite a robust system around service management.  We report on our performance against service targets so it is very transparent.  We do not hide anything.  It is very transparent for everybody on how we are doing.</p></speech>

Given the number of people the office is dealing with, we are bound to get information from them.  When one centralises a system such as this, particularly with regard to HR, it is a system and process where one must follow rules and logic.  I am a former IT manager so I understand the process by which it all must work.  I had to centralise systems in my time.  When one is dealing with HR issues and financial payments, particularly HR issues, there seems to be an almost impersonal element to it that needs to be flagged or dealt with in some way from one occasion to the next.  I suggest that some pathway is created whereby individuals who have a personal or a once or twice in a work career issue, instead of just being identified as a case number, have a way in which the issue can be pushed up the line and processed relatively quickly through the HR functions and the organisations.  I have heard that cases involving an exceptional issue are not being dealt with quickly enough.  The witness might accept my suggestion.  Trust me, I am hearing that from the people to whom I have been talking.</p> <p>  I have a final couple of questions.  One of them is somewhat out of left field.  Obviously, there are capital outlays relating to where the office is going in respect of the financial management of bodies.  Financial management is going to be the third leg of the organisation.  Personally, I believe the office should consolidate what it is doing first.</p><p>Moving into that space is probably the right thing to do.  I have rolled out massive large-scale projects in a previous life.  The NSSO needs to bed down and then move on again.</p><p> As regards underspend, it would be preferable for an organisation such as the NSSO not to have an underspend, given the scale of its operations, because it will be fighting for money for the financial management leg of its work.  Why was there a significant underspend?</p></speech>

The first is that a plan for the transition migration of a payroll into my office is only a plan and, as we get deeper into the preparation and level of readiness for transfer, things may arise such that we have to change the sequencing of Departments.  A Department may have to come ahead of one that was in the original plan, and that is always open to change, or things may have to be slowed down to ensure we manage any risks we identify.  A delay of transition or migration creates an underspend on our vote because we do not recruit the staff we intended to or transfer staff to our office who were doing that work previously, for example.  However, the corollary is that where we have an underspend, that pay bill spend is on the corresponding Vote and, therefore, is neutral overall but it shows up in my Vote if we have a delay.</p> <p>  On the capital expenditure side, the underspend is primarily due to the very large finance shared services programme.  Approximately 50% of the capital cost has already been spent for that programme but there have been delays.  Having followed due process in respect of procurement, there was an initial delay in finalising the contract with the provider or system integrator, which delay had a knock-on effect in respect of our Estimate for the following year, which had already been created.  It is not a matter of an overall overspend but rather is more of a timing issue because we will actually spend-----</p></speech>

The responsibility as to how that happens and the break-off point between the organisation and the service provision by the NSSO needs to be very clearly defined because one could end up with a "who is blaming who" situation.</p> <p>  The service that is provided in the Chairman's constituency, which I opened while Minister-----</p></speech>

Late notification of requests for payment reductions was one of the main reasons for the majority of overpayments.  Officers appointed at a grade of assistant principal or higher are entitled to 30 days annual leave but PeoplePoint is currently allocating 32 days leave to them.

Prior to 2011 for staff at those grades, the entitlement was for 32 days.  That has changed to 30 days.  Our detailed analysis has demonstrated that a small percentage, not a large percentage, had been given more annual leave than they were entitled to.  It was approximately 4% to 5% and less at principal officer grade.  The National Shared Services Office, NSSO, has been in contact with those staff and local human resources to rectify that.  It applies to a small number of people.</p></speech>

In this case, we are looking to rectify the annual leave balance.  We have already done that on the system.  It was done straight away.  We now need to focus on where we recover those balances where people had too much.  We do that in a very collaborative way with the individuals involved.</p></speech>

It would generally be an agreed amount per pay cycle.  Most of our overpayments are of a value of less than &euro;1,000, so it would generally be recouped within 12 months.</p> <p>  I wish to assist on the matter of annual leave.  A certain number of those cases were found to be correctly entitled to the level of leave because of arrangements on secondment for various organisations.  Local human resource personnel confirmed that a certain percentage were correct.  As Ms Murphy-Fagan indicates, the other cases are recouping through annual leave arrangements the excessive annual leave.</p></speech>

Part of what we do now is to focus on how to prevent overpayments happening in the first place.  This concerns awareness of what late notification can mean.  As we mentioned, we intend to re-run a campaign with individual employees and within our shared service centre.  There will a full process review of any procedures that are pay-impacted to ensure we reduce any cause of delay or error within our own shared service operation.</p></speech>

This perhaps links to the Deputy's question about whether somebody has a dispute on the amount of overpayment, as we must be able to show the calculation of how the overpayment amount was arrived at.  We know we have had delays in reaching those values and that is one area of improvement we are working on.  We are seeking to centralise how we calculate those values to speed up the process internally.  Once the value is identified, we are into the process I outlined earlier of going back to a local HR person to confirm that the recoupment is in order for proceeding and notification with employees.  There is a two-letter notification process with employees.  We are very much focused on how to cut out any of the delaying steps along the way.</p> <p>  We have much improved internal reporting.  Ms Murphy-Fagan referred to reports going externally to our client base, but within our own walls, we have significantly improved reporting for ourselves for management information.  On a weekly basis we can see how cases are moving through the system and at each stage, from value assessment through to notification and a recoupment plan being put in place, along with the targeting of possible delays.  We can give the committee assurance on what we have done since the results of 2016 and through 2017 in terms of sharpening and improving our process.</p></speech>

I reiterate for the reassurance of the committee that we are very much focused on a weekly basis on reviewing exactly where cases are at for different statuses and ensuring they are moving forward.

We put a plan in place and scheduled Departments to migrate to us at certain times each year.  We have completed all the migrations at this stage, so we are talking about this after the fact.  The surrender, in terms of HR and payroll, will not happen again because all the Departments have now transitioned across to us.  However, from time to time we have to review the plan to make sure that the pace is correct and to make sure that there are no risks.  If there is a bigger risk we may have to change the sequence and bring a different Department forward instead.  We may have planned to take in a Department and transfer the staff who carried out the work in that Department to us, but if the sequence changes we do not take those staff in.  We planned for that in our forecast.  That might create an underspend on the pay bill.  However, the corresponding Department will still have to pay those staff.  That is why I say that we do not pay them, but those staff may still be paid.</p> <p>  We may delay recruiting staff, if we do not need them until a certain date, because of the change in the plan.  We may not get the staff in on time, which would create an underspend in the pay bill.  At the end of each year, before the start of the next year, we try to give our very best estimate of the level of work, the timing of it and the transitioning.  From time to time that has had to change for risk management purposes.  That is now complete for HR and payroll.</p></speech>

We make sure that we have very robust programme management.  Both Accounting Officers - myself and the Accounting Officer for the relevant Department - have to sign off on gateway controls each and every month before we go live.  If for any reason something significant arises which would create a risk for us to proceed then we may have to stall, but at this stage I have no reason to believe that we will not go live and on time this year, as planned.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Finance, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the President's establishment, the Exchequer accounting and superannuation accounting is all coming to us mid-year, and represents the beginning of our finance shared services centre.

In the course of that transition there was an arrangement made between their union and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine that they would be available to take the voluntary redundancy.  They had transitioned to the NSSO and were now on our payroll so it was agreed that we would process the administrative arrangements around that redundancy and then make a recoupment request to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  That happened after year-end, so the cost is represented in our 2016 account, with the subsequent recoupment to appear in later accounts.</p></speech>

Looking at the cost saving side of the business case, those costs primarily arise from either savings on technology and the IT side, bearing in mind that there are 31 financial management and reporting systems across all the bodies that we will provide finance shared services to on one single platform.  All those systems are currently being maintained.  When finance shared services goes live, the savings will come partly from the savings on the IT and technology side and also by savings in the numbers of staff required to carry out the finance administration.  Those staff will be reabsorbed within their own Departments to do different work and other work.</p></speech>

On finance shared services we have not started.  On the HR side, through the benefits realisation assessment, we were able to establish that we have made savings.  Staff who previously carried out that work have been redeployed to do different work.  If the Department had a new resource requirement, instead of going to recruit somebody, those staff could move in and fill those positions.  The staff are redeployed either to new roles or to existing roles elsewhere.</p></speech>

It is something that I would certainly consider doing in the future.

In some instances, it is not.  I would like to mention another issue that comes up.  I know we are all in a modern world now.  The NSSO deals with pensions for retired civil servants.  Some of them may be of a particular age.  They might not have the level of computer literacy needed to print off P60s and payslips.  Do elderly people have the option of continuing to receive payslips and other information in hard copy?</p></speech>

There was a very small project team in 2013, when the operation started to deliver services in Clonskeagh in Dublin, but staff numbers started to grow when payroll services commenced at the end of 2014.  As we expanded the service offering to new Departments, the number of staff working in shared services increased.  Shared services is a specialism that requires clear accountability for all the people who receive the services and the Departments that are served.  It also requires clear funding arrangements, a very strong customer focus and a continuous improvement focus on operations and technology.  I suppose that is different from the business of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which is primarily a policy Department.  The NSSO is more than twice the size of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We always envisaged that when the shared services centres got up and running, it would not make much sense to stay within the Department in light of the lack of synergy.  We are the administration office.</p></speech>

I do not have a difficulty with the use of the word "corporate" but it suggests something that is not normally used in the world of public services.  I am looking then at what happened in Britain where the services were put into a shared service office to centralise HR, payroll and related services and that was then outsourced and, in essence, privatised.  It became profitable to do it then.  Once one has set up a unit like that, has shared services and does what Ms Murphy-Fagan says she wants to do, namely modernise corporate administration, the next logical step for some is to outsource and privatise the service.  Is that something that could be envisaged in this State if we follow the logic of what happened in Britain?  I am trying to understand Ms Murphy-Fagan saying we are behind the curve while looking at what has happened in most European countries.  Where these service offices were set up, almost all of them were outsourced over time.</p><p>If my comment is there, it is around the use of shared service models.  I was not referring to outsourcing.</p><p> The Deputy is asking me to comment on a policy matter that at some point of time in the future but that is not necessarily within my own-----</p></speech>

I am making an observation from my own perspective.  I think I am being logical when I say that if this has happened in other European member states, and in fact one newspaper report states: "Government, SSCL and arvato, which is the company that got the contract, are all to blame for shared services centres failing to achieve value for money."  So far from achieving savings in Britain, it cost them more and eventually the government privatised them.</p> <p>  The reason that I raise this is that it is a matter for policy makers.  Obviously it is a matter for the Minister.  I am not going to put Ms Murphy-Fagan in the position to comment on policy.  We have come through a number of  meetings where services have been outsourced and there is an arm's length between us who hold those who spend taxpayer's money to account and Accounting Officers.  The Accounting Officers will tell us that there is a service level agreement.</p></speech>

Each business case was evaluated on its own merit.  If it did not make sense it did not go ahead.  In fact there was one service area that was looked at with the Department of Finance for banking shared services, and we did a feasibility study but we found that the cost benefit did not stack up so we did not proceed with it.  In each case we look at what services could be in the scope and if those services could be provided in a shared services environment with technology, what would the service quality be and what would be the cost savings to the taxpayer if we proceeded.  In each and every case, we go through that process.  It is a very rigorous, robust evaluation process.</p></speech>

The report by the Comptroller and Auditor General focused on the need for action and activity in particular areas.  Reporting was one area that the overpayments working group had recommended along with a more robust root cause analysis of what causes overpayments.

What we are looking at is a reorganisation internally to centralise the calculation of values.  It has been a distributed function within our payroll shared services centre.  We recognise that it can cause delay where it is spread across a number of different functions.  We intend to centralise it so that we reduce and eliminate delay in the calculation of values.  That is key to the recoupment process commencing.  Until a value is confirmed, the recoupment process cannot commence.</p></speech>

We do not need an IT system to tell us all that.  There has to be a value before it can be recouped.</p> <p>  The weakness identified was the IT system as I understand it - the Chairman is shaking his head.  I will just put my question.  It showed a snapshot in time as opposed to the history.  For example, cases were closed and nobody knew if the repayments had stopped or not.  The snapshot in time was a problem.  It was not giving an overall picture.  I would have thought that as the office went for a very expensive IT system, one should be able to see that.</p> <p>  Another thing is the confusion.  Ms Lyons has told me the confusion is gone.  Certain Departments thought the office was looking at the legacy cases and other Departments thought it was their role, for different reasons.  That confusion is gone, is it?  They all know what they are doing now.  Going back, then, to the snapshot in time, the IT system required a lot of physical inputting of data.  Can Ms Lyons clarify whether that has changed?</p></speech>

One is picked up by what the Deputy referred to earlier in terms of improved reporting, looking at where cases are in terms of status and balances outstanding.  That will improve that picture and it will be an improvement for finance officers to be able to track as well.</p> <p>  The other thing to remember is that not all the payrolls were within the shared service centres.  The reconciliation between what was being recouped in a Department and not necessarily through a payroll that was being administered by the shared service caused another layer of reconciliation challenge.  Now we have all the payrolls within the shared service so we have a better view end to end.  We would, therefore, be able to see where a recoupment stopped and why, and to follow it up fairly quickly.  The situation in 2016 certainly presented more challenge in trying to manage it as an end to end process.  The full migration of payrolls will improve that.</p></speech>

On the cases that were closed - I am reading from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on page 148 - in 2016, 4,419 overpayment cases with a value of &euro;4.4 million were closed.  However, due to the limitations on the information available, the examination cannot quantify how much of this amount had been recovered at the year end.</p></speech>

When we get to this point in the meeting, a lot of the questions will have been asked.  I am generally supportive of shared services and consolidation rather than fragmentation.  It always comes with a health warning, however.  We want it to be effective as well.  Some of the examples Ms Lyons has drawn attention to where there is consolidation, such as the likes of the housing assistance payment, HAP, shared service centre in Limerick - I think it should have been left out.  Sometimes they do not work very effectively.</p> <p>  There is a customer services group and obviously that gives some sort of indication of how well the service is working.

We get feedback through that survey.  We also have a complaints procedure.  We prefer to hear that we are doing well - and we get feedback to say we are providing a very good service - but in those cases where we do not satisfy or make people happy, we have a complaints procedure which is used.  However, the volume is very small.  I think last year I looked at 80 complaints into the HR shared service centre, of which 50 were upheld and 30 were not.  We also have the contact centres so staff can call in if they are not happy.  They can give the case reference.  They can also talk to somebody on the phone who is really quite knowledgeable about the issues to see can we help them.</p></speech>

If they were physically located in the same building, they might have gone down the corridor and handed in a piece of paper and asked for something to be done for them.  It is the model of shared services, I suppose, in that we are very much part of the Civil Service.  We are civil servants providing this service to everybody.  We are just remote.  People cannot see us but we actually have people coming to visit our offices on a very regular basis.  Our doors are open to showing people what our offices look like.</p></speech>

It was a greenfield site in Clonskeagh in Dublin.  It opened its doors in 2013, a time when there was a lot of pressure on resources everywhere.  A decision was taken that we would recruit on a voluntary basis from the Civil Service.</p></speech>

The line manager still approves certain things so if I want to apply to take parental leave, I would put that message online and the system will automatically route it through workflow to my line manager who will give approval.

We are looking at the next generation of technology that will give much more self-service functionality to users of the system.  The technology landscape is moving to mobile devices and the cloud.  We know we will have to upgrade and change the systems we have today, as users demand different things.  The system we are using is a HR management system that was procured in 2004.  Each Department used it previously but we have reconfigured it to work in a shared services environment.  We did not put in new technology for HR.  We had to put in technology for document management, case management, the contact centre, and the telephony system but the core HR system was not new.</p> <p>  When it came to payroll, most of the payroll offices were already using a similar system albeit on different versions.  We deployed the latest version with self-service technology features.  That is the system we are using in the payroll but it is different.  They are not one and the same.</p></speech>

I cannot give the Deputy the 2016 figure.  On the 2017 figure, I think some 5% of staff left us during the year to go outside the Civil Service.  Other staff moved because they got promoted to other roles, either within our office or in other Departments across the Civil Service.  Those are 2017 data.  I do not actually have the data in front of me.  We do have a level of churn but that is also not unusual for our business.  The Civil Service had a level of churn also so we just monitor the situation.

Everyone gives an estimate, which is subject to verification, after the end of the year.  I believe Ms Murphy-Fagan has said she has already sent information to the Departments.  She is reasonably confident about what has been produced.  I am sure she had a health warning on her statement and that it was not absolute.  Could she just outline what her office has done because it has produced some information?</p> <p>  That leads to my next question.  Given that the office will be getting its Estimate of expenditure approved for 2018 any day now, I expect that, in calculating that figure, the NSSO should be able to estimate what it believes the figure for outstanding payments will be at the end of 2018.  I am now moving on much further.  If one is coming in to get the group of Votes for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform next month, this month or on another occasion, it is logical to be asked about this.  I refer to where one is looking for the Estimate figure for the office for the coming year - the Estimate for its Vote.  A level of overpayments will be in place for last year and one will have to know, in one's working papers, the estimated figure for 2018.  That is relevant to the Vote the office requires.  Therefore, I presume it will be possible for the office to give us some estimate.  I stress that it will be an estimate.  Ms Murphy-Fagan spoke about planning.  In my opinion, one cannot calculate one's Estimate for this year properly if one has not estimated where one believes one will be at the end of December.  Am I jumping the gun?</p></speech>

Service quality and accuracy is fundamental to our business.  Under our system, dedicated people take random cases that are closed every week and test 5% of all cases to check for accuracy, and whether they were processed correctly, whether all the procedural steps were taken, and whether they were uploaded to the correct document or system.  That is an important measure for us because it tells us about the quality of the service we provide.  Earlier I mentioned the ISAE 3402 international assurance standard of quality, which is the internal audit control test.  Our quality management data are consistent with what the external tests show and, therefore, we have a constant, reasonably high level of quality.  I do not say we fail to make errors but we have a fairly consistently high level of quality, which is important because our staff work hard on that</p></speech>

If a Department or an office transfers the function to the NSSO and 30 of its staff were involved in payroll and HR services, how do we know some of those posts have not been suppressed?  Some staff, for example, may be redeployed but if there is no redeployment and there is no work in the Department, some posts could be suppressed.  It is not up to the NSSO to check on the suppressed posts but this is one way of knowing whether the savings happen.  If the NSSO takes on numbers, there should be a reduction somewhere else.</p></speech>

Where staff used to do that work in a location and they cannot, or do not want, to transfer or it is a remote location such as Dundalk to Galway, we would look at the original pay bill for them and work out how many staff are still in that payroll function.

I thank the Chairman and members for welcoming me to Dublin and giving me this opportunity to come to the Oireachtas to discuss the European semester and economic developments in Ireland and the European Union.<br/><br/>My visit is taking place in the context of the European semester, which has become our main economic and fiscal policy co-ordination tool, and we have an opportunity to discuss with member states key fiscal, economic and social challenges.  In the European Semester Office we prepare country reports.  In line with the practice established last year, we sent the analytical parts of the draft country reports to the member states, waiting for their factual comments and inputs.  The negotiated country reports provide countries with the opportunity to view the factual feedback.  We found it quite useful when we first did it last year.<br/><br/>As regards the situation in Ireland and Ireland's position as regards the European semester, first, we have seen strong economic growth in Ireland last year, close to 5%, and this year the economic growth is close to 4%.  The economy is developing, unemployment is reducing and job creation is proceeding at a good pace.  All in all, we see positive developments in the Irish economy.<br/><br/>As regards Ireland's fiscal performance, Ireland has made a major adjustment since the crisis and this year we expect Ireland to meet its medium-term budgetary objective.  According to the European semester, we set the medium-term budgetary objectives for each EU member state to meet.  In the case of Ireland, it is 0.5% of GDP structural deficit and now we forecast that Ireland will actually reach the medium-term budgetary objective.  What is important is that public debt is reducing.  The figures for public debt need to be interpreted with caution because in 2015 there was a major readjustment of the calculation of Irish GDP and also the debt-to-GDP ratio decreased very rapidly, but if we use other measures to do this assessment, like public debt <i>per capita</i>or public debt per tax revenue, we still see that Ireland has quite high public debt and is exceeding the Maastricht criteria threshold of 60% of GDP.  It is important to stay the course and continue to reduce the public debt.  It is also important in the context of potential economic shocks, which Ireland may face.  In our assessment, a most immediate and imminent issue which we will need to deal with is Brexit.  Brexit is a potential source of uncertainty, especially in Ireland which has the closest economic links with the United Kingdom from the EU 27 countries.  The European Union is ready to stand by Ireland and support Ireland in this process and also to address negative economic consequences that Brexit may bring.<br/><br/>As regards the European semester, we also issue country-specific recommendations to address certain challenges which we think are important.  In the case of Ireland, we have three country-specific recommendations.  First is a fiscal recommendation and I touched on this when I spoke about the medium-term budgetary objective.  I stressed the need to continue to reduce public debt.  In terms of the privatisation of public expenditure, we propose to prioritise investment, especially in areas of transport, energy, water supplies and also to enhance social infrastructure, including social housing and child care facilities.  This is one of the directions where we think there are infrastructural bottlenecks which need to be addressed.<br/><br/>On the social side, we see that while unemployment is decreasing, there are still issues in terms of activation policies and a relatively high share of low-skilled workers.  The level of participation of women in the marketplace is below the EU average.  We recommend the delivery of an integrated package of activation policies to improve the employment prospects of certain categories of people.<br/><br/>Our third recommendation concerns the financial sector and the need to address the level of non-performing loans.  This is in a sense a legacy of the crisis not only in Ireland but in many European countries, so we are currently developing action plans to reduce the number of non-performing loans at EU level.</p><p>It is worth pointing out that, primarily, this is still the work of the member states and much progress has been done on this in Ireland.  In mid-2017, which are the latest verified figures we have, the non-performing loans, NPLs, ratio stood at 11.6%, which is still high compared with most historical levels and with other EU countries.  Further work is needed on NPLs.  We will also be bring forward an action plan to reduce NPLs at European level, working on several directions, requiring banks to put sufficient means or to create sufficient buffers to cover losses if new loans become non-performing, to tackle delays in debt recovery, and, in terms of insolvency and loan enforcement frameworks, to open up secondary markets.  We will bring forward a blueprint on how to set up national asset management companies within the EU state aid and banking union framework.  Of course, Ireland has the National Asset Management Agency, which is already working.  Perhaps this work theme is not so relevant in the case of Ireland.  Those are our main findings in terms of the European Semester.  Overall, in Europe we currently have good economic development. The latest  figures show that last year we had 2.5% growth both in the EU as a whole and in the euro area.  We should be using this good economic momentum to continue the work on deepening the economic and monetary union, EMU.</p><p> I will say a few words on that work stream.  As the members will be aware, in December the European Commission put forward a package of proposals on how to proceed with deepening the EMU.  We consider the most immediate priority to be the completion of the banking union and capital markets union.  In the case of the banking union, all the elements are already on the table.  I refer to our bank reform package, which we put forward in November 2016, which mainly concerns risk reduction, and the ongoing work on reducing non-performing loans.  Also, last October we came forward with some ideas on how to unblock the discussions regarding the European deposit insurance scheme.  We believe it is important to reach an agreement on the fiscal backstop for a single resolution fund.  We believe this can be done on the basis of the European Stability Mechanism or, potentially, as we propose to transpose it to the European monetary fund.</p><p> Looking forward in terms of deepening EMU, we want to reach two objectives to strengthen the resilience of the EMU and to improve the crisis management tools of EMU.  In terms of resilience, there are the risk reduction measures, which I already described, but also a continued focus on structural reforms.  We have some proposals on how we can further support structural reforms in member states.  We propose a structural reform delivery tool as a support mechanism and we propose to extend our existing structural reform support programme.</p><p>In terms of crisis management tools, we already have the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, which we propose to strengthen and transpose into the European monetary fund, anchored in a European Union legal framework.  We propose to create a euro area of fiscal stabilisation function to help countries to address large economic shocks, asymmetric economic shocks, and this euro area of fiscal stabilisation function could take place in a form of European investment protection scheme.  The problem is often that investment is the first item to be cut in times of fiscal strain and then it undermines the recovery and potential growth of a country.  Therefore, we propose this European investment protection scheme to sustain a level of investment during the crisis.</p><p> We also propose to have a dedicated convergence facility to support those EU member states which are working towards euro adoption.  Primarily, I am talking about technical assistance and, in some cases, it can also be financial assistance.  It will send an important signal that the euro area is open and transparent to non-euro countries, that we do not want to create new dividing lines in Europe and that we are willing to support those countries which are working towards euro accession.  That, at a glance, outlines the main ideas and elements of our deepening of the EMU package.  Those are my introductory remarks and I am open to hearing members' comments and taking their questions.</p></speech>

I would like to raise a few issues with him.  I note his list of responsibilities includes proposing measures to make financial services work better for consumers and retail investors.  A key consumer issue in Ireland regarding financial services is the very high mortgage interest rates charged to Irish consumers.  In Ireland, the official Central Bank Statistics show that for all new mortgages, whether they be variable or fixed rate, 3.18% is the average rate.  In the eurozone the equivalent is 1.83%.  We regularly see publicity around interest rates as low as 1% to 1.5% across Europe and consumers here are paying, in some cases, more than 4%.  We do not have a fully functioning Single Market in the area of financial services.  Therefore, people in Ireland find it difficult to understand why they cannot access cheap mortgage rates that are available elsewhere in Europe.  Does the Commissioner have any plans to deal with that issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-01a.748" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Valdis Dombrovskis" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018020100002#B00400"><p>Yes, we had been dealing with and continue to deal with this issue.  Since the crisis we have seen certain weaknesses in the organisation of the financial systems, so the financial sector integration has reduced and financial sector activities increasingly were taking place along national borders.  It is certainly an issue.  We are now looking at ways that we can promote such cross-border financial sector activity.  Currently only 7% of European citizens use cross-border financial services.  We are not talking about large-scale integration.  Among other things, we are assessing cross-border loans, namely, what are the obstacles to cross-border loans.  Our analysis shows it is mainly to do with loan enforcement frameworks.  If a bank is to provide loans or mortgages with a collateral across a border in another EU member state, there is at least a perception of the financial sector in terms of the banks and their associated costs if there is a need for loan enforcement in case the loan becomes non-performing.  We would work with the country, especially if the loans are not very big, to enforce as a collateral.  We will bring forward some proposals in this area.  We will put forward a proposal on accelerated extrajudicial collateral collection mechanism while providing safeguards to customers towards some kind of aggressive loan collection practices.</p><p>That could be one mechanism to address this obstacle in terms of cross-border loans.   From the point of view of the European Union, we would be willing to see more financial integration, more cross-border financial services and therefore more competition, which eventually would result in lower interest rates for consumers.  That is something we are very much willing to support and facilitate.  It is part of our work on a retail financial services action plan.</p></speech>

I suggest to him that it should be a priority because if we are to have a full Single Market for financial services and at a time when all of the larger banks are being regulated directly by the Single Supervisory Mechanism, which is European-wide, it should be the case that all consumers, certainly those within the eurozone, should be able to avail of products being sold by banks that are regulated by the European-wide regulator.  That seems perfectly logical to me.  What people will want to know from the Commissioner is when he expects to see practical progress in respect of this issue because Irish consumers are paying way over the odds not just in regard to mortgage rates, which apply to residential customers, but business customers as well, and also in regard to insurance where, again, we do not have access to products that are being sold elsewhere in Europe.  When does the Commissioner expect actual progress from which people will be able to benefit?</p></speech>

It will then take a year or so.  It is a legislative process so there will have to be discussions with the EU Council, member states and the European Parliament before it is adopted and becomes applicable.  It is not the only measure we are assessing in terms of the provision of cross-border financial services.  We had been doing that already through the payment services directive as regards payment services.  We also see obstacles in areas on cross-border money transfers, for example.  We are a single European payment area but it is actually a single eurozone payment area, not an EU payment area, so we propose to extend it to the entire European Union.  There are a number of obstacles to cross-border financial services and we will be coming forward with several proposals in the spring.</p></speech>

One relates to non-performing loans, which the Commissioner addressed in his opening statement.  The rate in Ireland is falling but it is still high.  The way we would like to see banks reduce their non-performing loans is by reaching agreements with borrowers and restructuring loans but what we find here in practice is that the main banks are reducing their level of non-performing loans by selling loan portfolios to international funds, commonly known here as vulture funds.  That is the main method being used here to reduce the level of non-performing loans so while it might improve the balance sheet of the financial institution concerned, it can create other knock-on problems and consequences, particularly for the borrower whose loan may now be owned by a fund that takes a much more aggressive stance by way of foreclosure, enforcement and so on.  It is the Commissioner's objective to reduce non-performing loans but does he have any view on how that should be done?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-01a.753" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Valdis Dombrovskis" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018020100002#C00500"><p>As regards non-performing loans, it is also related to the Deputy's previous question.  If banks held a high share of non-performing loans, it means they are suffering losses on those non-performing loans and that cost is passed to the customers.  That results in, among other things, higher interest rates, which banks are charging Irish customers, and we see the same tendency in other countries with a high non-performing loans ratio.  Ireland is not among the countries with the very highest level of non-performing loans.  The three countries with the highest levels are Greece, Cyprus and Portugal, but in any case this is an issue.</p> <p>  I mentioned in my introductory remarks our non-performing loans action plan on which we are working for direction.  The first is the prudential regulations as regards buffers.  Banks need to build for non-performing loans and we will be coming forward with a proposal for new loans which may become non-performing.</p> <p>  The second is insolvency and loan enforcement frameworks where we are doing some benchmarking.  We do not believe it is realistic to achieve a harmonisation in that regard because systems are very different and countries are very reluctant to change them.  We are doing the benchmarking, therefore, which we can then address through the European semester to see what is working in insolvency systems, what is not working, what are the best practices and then, through country-specific recommendations, show the countries possibilities to address this problem.</p> <p>  The third is the secondary markets of non-performing loans.  One problem is loan enforcement practices, which the Deputy mentioned.  There have to be strong consumer safeguards in that regard and also consumer protection organisations which fight against aggressive practices.  That is clearly not acceptable.  From the point of view of financial stability, in terms of a spread between bid and ask prices, we see there is an information asymmetry that needs to be addressed if we want this market to be functional.</p> <p>  Fourth, I already mentioned the blueprint for national asset management companies.  Ireland already has a national asset management company, which is working.  Recently, the European Commission also found that the way it was set up is in line also with EU state aid rules.  There had been some complaints so the European Commission had been assessing that and found it to be in compliance.</p> <p>  Those are the four work directions of non-performing loans.  We will come forward with complete proposals on the European side on non-performing loans in the spring.</p></speech>

We hope that continues right through to the end but is it the objective of the European Union to ultimately negotiate a free trade agreement with the United Kingdom?  We are now moving into a new phase and there is talk of the transition period and so on.  Having a free trade agreement will come with certain obligations on the UK but is that the position of the European Union?  Is the objective to negotiate a free trade agreement that is tantamount to what we currently have within the Single Market?</p></speech>

That is very much on the EU's agenda.  As I said, the EU will continue to support Ireland in the context of Brexit because we recognise that of the EU 27, Ireland is the country most affected by Brexit.</p><p>In the Brexit negotiations, we are currently concentrating on the transitional period.  We are now doing preparatory work on a mandate from the member states on future relations and to start the negotiations on future relations with the UK.  The free trade agreement will be one of the main elements in future relations.  Those future relations will probably not be tantamount to the EU Single Market.  There are certain conditions for access to the EU Single Market, which the UK has decided it is not willing to respect.  We talk about respect for freedoms, including the free movement of labour, a financial contribution to the EU budget and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.  There are certain choices the UK has to make because the Internal Market does not come for free.  There are certain conditions that countries that are members of the Internal Market must respect. </p></speech>

I want to explore the area of the European semester and economic governance.  I will explain where I am coming from.  I was in the European Parliament from 2011 to 2014 when some of these measures were introduced, including the six pack, the two pack, austerity, and the fiscal treaty.  What we saw was an example of the shock doctrine of using a crisis of capitalism to enshrine some of the neoliberal laws in European law and to reduce democracy at a European and national level.  That is the effect of those laws.  What democratic legitimacy does the Commission have to be engaged in instructing, directing or recommending governments to implement certain budgetary decisions?  In the Commission's engagement with Italy, it stressed that the adoption of the 2018 budget with no watering down of its key provisions would be crucial.  It underlined the importance of sticking to the important structural reforms, notably as regards pensions.  What democratic legitimacy does the Commission have to be demanding so-called structural reforms from democratically elected governments?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-01a.758" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Valdis Dombrovskis" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018020100002#D00300"><p>First I will address the broader question of EU economic policy, including the Stability and Growth Pact, and then I will come to the question on democratic legitimacy.  Something that a number of countries have experienced during the crisis, including Latvia, which is the country I know best, Ireland and a number of other countries, is that if they want to pursue contracyclical fiscal policies during the crisis, and that is what has been discussed, they also need to pursue contracyclical policy during the good times, meaning they have the fiscal space or room for manoeuvre in case of economic shocks.  Unfortunately, for those countries that had not been doing so before the crisis, there was no fiscal space or room for manoeuvre during the crisis and countries were being shut out of the financial markets.  The other question is how a country can finance its debt and deficit.  What are the sources of finance?  That is where the question of restoring financial stability and the EU rules on restoring financial stability came in.</p> <p>  Regarding the democratic legitimacy of the European Commission and the decision-making, first it must be said that the European Commission has rights and obligations that EU member states with their democratically elected parliaments and appointed governments have delegated to it.  It is enshrined in the EU treaty which has been ratified by all EU member states and where the role of the European Commission as a guardian of the treaty is also foreseen.  At the same time, it must be said that any decisions that are taken at EU level are Council decisions.  When we come up with draft decisions as a European Commission, whether on the fiscal or structural reform side, they are draft decisions and those draft decisions have to be approved by the Council.  It concerns fiscal decisions, any other decisions and any legislative proposals.  They are called legislative proposals because the Commission comes up with a proposal.  It is for co-legislators, the European Council and the European Parliament, to make the binding decisions.</p> <p>  On structural reforms, it is also important not to mix certain elements.  Italy is in a preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact, as is Ireland.  We address country-specific recommendations on structural reforms to member states, but first, as the name suggests, they are recommendations.  Second, those proposals, in any case, are endorsed by the Council.  That is how the structure works and that is where democratic legitimacy comes from.  Its functions are delegated to the Commission by EU member states with their democratic decision-making process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-01a.759" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1433" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018020100002#D00400"><p>I will respond to two points.  Mr. Dombrovskis said the rationale for the fiscal rules was the idea that the crisis resulted from irresponsible public spending and rising debt, etc.  That is not the reality across the world or, in general, across the European Union.  It certainly was not the reality in Ireland.  In Ireland, pre-crisis, we had a debt-to-GDP ratio of 25%, which was as low as Germany's.  The reason it exploded was because of a private sector banking collapse that was then taken onto the shoulders of the public.  None of the fiscal rules that existed, if they had existed pre-crisis, would have made a difference to the crisis.  The idea that it is a response to the crisis does not hold water.</p> <p>  In defending the democratic legitimacy of the process, Mr. Dombrovskis put significant weight on the fact that the Commission proposes and goes to the European Council and that the governments are at the European Council.  What he did not say is that the voting process at the European Council is turned on its head.  Instead of needing a majority or a qualified majority to pass the Commission proposal, is it not the case that when it comes to economic governance proposals, a reverse qualified majority is required?  In other words, to reject something, there has to be a substantial majority of member states.  How is it democratic to reverse either a simple majority process or, even worse, to have a reverse qualified majority process?  How can it be claimed that there is endorsement by the Council for proposals when that process has been reversed in that way?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-01a.760" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Valdis Dombrovskis" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018020100002#D00500"><p>On the first question, the fiscal rules existed in Europe before the crisis.  The Stability and Growth pact set a 3% limit on government deficit and a 60% limit on debt.  It all existed before the crisis.</p><p>What was done after the crisis is that, first, a European semester was introduced as an annual cycle of fiscal and economic policy co-ordination, so it was recognised that a more systematic overview of the member states' fiscal and macroeconomic policies is needed.  A macroeconomic imbalances procedure was introduced because it was recognised that countries not only face fiscal problems, but also macroeconomic problems and there was more emphasis on prevention such as the preventative arm of the Stability and Growth Pact, the setting of medium-term budgetary objectives and aiming for a balanced budget in the economic cycle.  Those were the things that were introduced.</p><p> As regards Ireland, we are fully aware that many of the Irish fiscal problems stem from the collapse of the banking system and an unprecedented scale of bailouts which Ireland undertook.  Nevertheless, that did not remove the question that if those decisions were taken, what are the sources of financing of the debt and deficit.  This question, nevertheless, was still there and those bailouts, which we saw in a number of countries was the reason for introducing the banking union.  As members know, the basic principle of the banking union right now is not for a bailout but a bail-in, meaning that first the shareholders and creditors of a bank take the losses and the taxpayer is not first in line to pay for the mistakes of the banking sector.  It was also a lesson learned from the crisis and that is an underlying principle of the banking union and underlying reason for strengthening bank supervision and also a regulatory framework for introducing a single rulebook and a single supervisory mechanism.</p><p> On decision-making processes, once again, all the decision-making processes as they are enshrined in a treaty or EU legislation are decision-making processes decided by EU member states and on different procedures it can vary from unanimity to qualified majority, to simple majority, to reverse qualified majority but once again those are decisions taken by member states in line with democratic procedures</p></speech>

I appreciate that he has limited time.  It might seem to some now that the EU has moved on from the Irish question given the recent agreement of sorts.  It is my belief that the EU could still play a crucial role in protecting Ireland, both North and South, in a very direct way from the damage of Brexit, first, by ensuring that the EU energy and infrastructure programmes look at the needs of the island of Ireland as a whole.  Has the Government requested a review of the TEN-T and TEN-E projects in transport and energy so that the new reality of Ireland's geographical position relative to the EU is taken into account?  Are we being considered?  We do not want to be left behind.  We want to be front and centre of decisions that are being made in Europe in relation to our vulnerability to Brexit.</p></speech>

As regards TEN projects, it is worth noting that the European Commission has a certain distribution of responsibilities and TEN-T and TEN-E projects are the responsibility of the transport and energy Commissioners so I am not working directly on those areas and I cannot give a qualified comment on it.  It is worth noting that we are now also preparing negotiations for the next multi-annual financial framework which will set the EU budget for the next period, post 2020, and that is a good moment also to address issues and new challenges.  There are a number of challenges which stem directly from Brexit, also in the case of Ireland in terms of infrastructure.  Perhaps Mr. Kiely could add more specific information and explain about projects in Ireland.</p></speech>

It has been raised in discussions with Commissioners but I am not sure any formal request has been submitted.  As the Vice-President said, given where we are in the TENs programme we have gone past the review stage so it would be in the context of the post 2020 period.  I am not aware that any formal request has been submitted but I can check and come back to Senator Conway-Walsh.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-01a.769" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1378" speakername="Rose Conway Walsh" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018020100002#E00900"><p>Could I suggest that a formal request would be made, perhaps by this committee, because otherwise we will miss opportunities?  There is no point in trying to close the door after the horse has bolted.  The witnesses will be very aware of the infrastructure deficits, the regional imbalance and inequality that was reported even last week in the ESRI report.  There is an urgent need for infrastructure.  Adding Brexit into that context makes it a very worrying time for all of us, but especially for people like me who live in the regions.</p> <p>  Does Mr. Dombrovskis believe that Brexit constitutes exceptional circumstances and that the EU should now allow for derogation from the rules to allow the Government the adequate scope to invest North and South to protect against the fallout from Brexit but also to put the country into a prime position to thrive thereafter?  What specific measures of flexibility from the EU fiscal rules does he think Ireland should seek?  It seems that the flexibility in our investment must be a priority.  Does he agree with that?  What suggestions does he have for us?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-01a.770" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Valdis Dombrovskis" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018020100002#E01000"><p>First of all, of course we must see the final agreement of Brexit to assess potential economic consequences, including for Ireland.  As I said, the member states are still preparing a mandate for the European Commission to negotiate its future relationship so at this stage we cannot really say what exact implications it will have and what response will be required.</p> <p>  In terms of flexibility within EU fiscal rules, as I mentioned in my introductory remarks, there is a certain flexibility and there is an investment clause allowing countries to temporarily deviate to facilitate EU co-financed investment.  There is a structural reform clause to support structural reforms.  There is an exceptional circumstances clause which has been used, for example, in the case of natural disasters and also in the context of the migration crisis in 2015.  There are different possibilities which are available according to EU fiscal rules.  When and which of those tools are used and when and which of those tools are requested is also the competence of the Irish authorities.  I discussed that also yesterday with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  It is also clear that it is important to find the appropriate timing.  When an economy is growing like now by 4% to 5% a year, which is the Commission forecast, and if anything the outcome may be at least as good, if not better, as our autumn forecast then it may not, therefore, be the best moment to trigger all the flexibility clauses.</p><p>If there is a Brexit that triggers large negative economic consequences then those clauses are there and can be triggered.  It provides a certain fiscal buffer in a more forward looking way.  When I described our proposals on deepening the economic and monetary union, one of the proposals is a euro area fiscal stabilisation function to protect investment.  While it is a new proposal and needs to be discussed by EU members states and by the European Parliament and eventually agreed, if it becomes part of the decisions that are taken in the context of deepening economic and monetary union then, once again, it is possible to use.  This fiscal stabilisation function is exactly there to support countries in case of large asymmetric economic shocks.</p></speech>

In the areas I come from we have unemployment rates of 20% to 30%, no broadband and very inadequate infrastructure.  We very much rely on the EU for support there.  As the witness has said, it is up to our own national Government to make those requests and to tell the real story of what is happening here and tell of the real challenges that citizens across the island are facing.</p> <p>  Former EU Commission President Barosso established a task force, the aim of which was to make sure that Ireland was achieving the maximum possible level of EU funding.  Is there a scope for that here?</p></speech>

The discussions are starting around the next planning period post 2020.  We expect complicated discussions because Brexit will, once again, leave a hole in our EU budget.  The UK is one of the largest net contributors to the EU budget.  We will need to address this hole in the budget and there are only two ways to do this is; either through more contributions to the EU budget by member states or by developing or strengthening our current own resources system, thereby reducing expenditure.  Already we are hearing very different signals from different member states.  Not surprisingly they are coming down more or less along the lines of net payers and net contributors.  We will, however, need to balance this.  First we will need to address this shortfall from Brexit and we will also need to find fiscal space for new priorities.</p></speech>

I just have one query on Brexit.  Does Commissioner Dombrovskis feel that Brexit will be of benefit to the UK, the European Union or to Ireland?  What is his view on the financial impact of Brexit?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-01a.776" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Valdis Dombrovskis" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018020100002#F00600"><p>There will, of course, be a negative economic impact.  We conducted some assessments immediately after the referendum in the UK.  I cannot say with a large degree of certainty, because we still do not know the future relationship model of Brexit.  The economic model will depend directly on this but it is very clear that if we are untangling decades of economic and financial sector integration it will have a disruptive effect.  We will need to address this disruption.  First we need to define our future relationship to see how disruptive it is going to be.  We already know that some of the political choices the UK has made on Brexit will mean leaving the EU Single Market, and potentially  the customs union.  All of these decisions are adding to the negative economic impact.  The European Commission is also preparing for different scenarios, including the so-called "cliff edge" scenario.  We need to be ready for that although it is certainly not something we would aim for.  While we aim to reach agreement and to minimise this disruption, we also need to be realistic about it.</p></speech>

Does Commissioner Dombrovskis have a view on that statement?  I believe that under Article 50 it is possible to extend the time, if there is unanimity among the European Council members.</p></speech>

On the one hand the UK maintains its access to the Single Market and on the other hand it respects all the conditions such as free movement, payment to the EU budget and recognising the European Court of Justice jurisdiction.  Post-2020 we will be in a new multi-annual financial framework.  Any transition periods post-2020 would imply a new negotiation on the UK financial contribution to the EU budget.  In any case that could be complicated.  This is why the current thinking is for the end of 2010.</p></speech>

Norway's model provides Norway with access to the EU Single Market but on exact conditions.  Norway respect the four freedoms including the free movement of labour, the European Court of Justice jurisdiction and the contribution to the EU budget directly to EU member states via the Norwegian financial instrument.  This provides the Norwegian financial contribution, which is quite substantial.  The capitation is significantly higher than that paid by the UK.  Those were not conditions that the UK was willing to accept.  This is why there will not be a Norway model or European Economic Area model.  This is why the relationship will be less close, with the UK being outside the Single Market.</p></speech>

The idea is that we need to complete the banking union.  There are discussions among member states.  Some are putting more emphasis on risk-reduction measures and some are putting more emphasis on risk-sharing measures.  To move forward, both need to move in parallel.</p> <p>  If the Senator is interested in banking union, we can go into it more deeply.  I will explain the context of the sentence that the Senator quoted.  As regards fiscal rules, we have the EU fiscal framework and certain associated enforcement mechanisms.  Currently, we do not need to use any sanctions because we see that the fiscal circumstances are improving.  Average budget deficit and debt levels are going down in both the EU and the euro area.  Countries are correcting their excessive deficits.  In the spring, we will assess France.  It corrected its excessive deficit in 2017, as foreseen.  Given that this is the case, we will have only one country left that is subject to an excessive deficit procedure, that being Spain.  It will need to correct its excessive deficit this year.  </p> <p>  As regards the preventive arm, we see that countries are moving towards their medium-term budgetary objectives.  Some are at risk of deviation so we are working more in respect of those countries.  There is one country against which we have launched a so-called significant deviation procedure, namely, Romania.  It is the second fastest-growing European country, yet balances, in terms of budget deficit, around 3% of GDP and risks ending up being in excessive deficit.  We forecast that Ireland will meet its medium-term budgetary objectives this year.  We see that things are on track.</p></speech>

Mr. Dombrovskis is saying pressure is being put on banks to sell off non-performing loans.  When pressure is put on the banks to sell off those loans, he will note most groups that buy them are vulture funds.  This committee has tried to get vulture funds to come here to talk to us but they will not do so.  Has Mr. Dombrovskis been lobbied on the question of why the non-performing loans should be sold off?  Has he any mechanism for governments to buy the non-performing loans?  Governments can borrow money at 0%, 1% or other very low interest rates.  There is no reason governments could not buy non-performing loans.  Why is Mr. Dombrovskis not saying the governments should buy them?  Why is it that the vulture funds buy the non-performing loans in most cases?  We can see at first hand what vulture funds are doing with the non-performing loans and to the borrowers.  Has the Commission come up with any proposals on how governments could buy these loans?  If so, we have not heard them.</p></speech>

We are currently implementing it.  I was speaking at length on this to others this morning.  I will be responding to other members' questions so I probably will not be able to elaborate in detail on the action plan.  I will just outline, therefore, what we are recommending specifically to Ireland.  We have a recommendation for Ireland specifically on non-performing loans: "Encourage a more durable reduction in non-performing loans through resolution strategies that involve write-offs for viable businesses and households, with a special emphasis on resolving long-term arrears."  Our recommendation to Ireland is a resolution strategy that involves write-offs.  To be clear, that is what we are recommending specifically to Ireland.</p></speech>

This is particularly the case in Ireland, where GDP made huge jumps.  I made this point to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform when he was here last year.  He agreed with me.</p> <p>  With regard to our debt, the previous Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, pointed out to us on his last day in the Seanad that Ireland has the second highest level of debt per head of population in the world, after Japan.  Some 40% of our corporation tax receipts are from ten companies, and approximately 80% of our corporation tax is related to American foreign direct investment.  What point does Mr. Dombrovskis have to make to us on the vulnerability of the Irish economy even if a quite small number of factors change?  The debt is significant.  Corporation tax receipts are vital if we are to manage to reduce our debt.  We are very vulnerable, particularly in the context of proposals in terms of the taxation of the digital economy.  Mr. Dombrovskis is looking at us from above.  What points has he to make to us that he has not already covered in his statement?</p></speech>

We also see the process of deleveraging.  That is why we are also emphasising the need to continue to reduce general government debt ratio.  It is in our country-specific recommendations.  The emphasis is still there.</p> <p>  On the question on the taxation of the digital economy, we have already touched on this.  It is still work in progress.  The European Commission is currently ascertaining the best way to address the taxation of the digital economy.  We have had discussions on this with the Irish Government.</p><p>It is also recognised that we need to adjust digital taxation because our tax system is basically outdated.  This area has been developed for an economy that is tangible and that includes tangible assets and goods.  It is not adapted for the increasing share of digital economy.  We can only predict that this share will continue to increase.</p><p> We expect digital economy companies to pay their fair share of taxes.  We want to reflect the principle that taxes should be paid where real economic activity is taking place.  If companies are making profit in Europe but not paying taxes in Europe, it is a problem and we believe that needs to be addressed.  Of course member states will need to have discussions to find the right balance.  As committee members are aware, in the area of taxation the unanimity principle applies and all member states need to agree.  We are ready to have those discussions.  Ideally, this would move forward at international level in the context of the OECD framework and the fight against base erosion and profit-shifting.  If we see that this international war is not advancing sufficiently, then Europe should be ready to act and move forward.</p></speech>

In the short time that is left I wish to refer to your opening remarks, Mr. Dombrovskis.  You have stated that Ireland's recovery has been fast-paced and broad-based.  It has been fast-paced but there remains significant disadvantage in the country, especially in the regions, as outlined by Senator Conway-Walsh.  A significant number of the people we represent have not enjoyed any lift in their quality of life.  Much work remains to be done.  I would not like that statement to go without comment.</p> <p>  You said in your opening statement, Mr. Dombrovskis, that the performance of the banking sector has returned to normal.  It is far from normal.  Small businesses cannot get banking loans.  I presume you are aware of the tracker mortgage issue in this country.  Significant numbers of people have not been paid or put back on the correct rates.  Banking is far from normal.  If fact, if something is not done in banking we will get back to a situation where the banks will act as recklessly as before.</p> <p>  You referred to the broad tax base.  Our corporate tax continues to be talked about in Europe.  It is central to our economic well-being and development.  We would not like to see interference from Europe that would in any way damage our prospects of being able to secure further outside investment in the country.</p> <p>  You referred to banking union, Mr. Dombrovskis.  This committee has written several times to Mario Draghi in respect of his appearance.  I have written to him on a personal level in respect of the tracker mortgage issue.  His response has been quite pathetic in terms of understanding the issues we face and our efforts to deal with them.</p> <p>  Reference was made to non-performing loans.  You said that the resilience of the Irish banking sector has improved significantly.  It has not.  It is living on taxpayers' money.  A vast amount of money was paid in by the Government to keep the banks afloat at a time when Europe did not do many favours for this country by insisting that we could not burn the bondholders.  That is what has us in this situation that we are not in.  The Commission is pushing for non-performing loans to be dealt with.  However, it has to understand that, up to recently anyway, the banks completely ignored country-specific recommendation No. 3, which you cited earlier, Mr. Dombrovskis.  You referred to write-offs for viable businesses and households with a special emphasis on resolving long-term arrears.  The banks have persecuted small businesses and individuals.  We have significant levels of deaths by suicide, family disruption and trauma, all from the fact that the banks refuse to deal with the issues before them in a way that shows some degree of compassion and humanity.</p> <p>  It is my opinion that Europe stands idly by and watches as our citizens are punished for something they did not inflict upon themselves.  I am simply giving you my views.</p></speech>

When discussing economic, financial and fiscal issues with a parliament, typically I like to have an open exchange of views.  You referred, Chairman, to some written remarks and not to the speech that I delivered.  In a sense I have not read out that statement.  This point was made clear to colleagues at the beginning of this meeting.  That is exactly the problem but let us clarify this point.  I stand by the statement, by the way - that is not a problem.  There was strong insistence from colleagues that they wanted a written statement from me.  However, I am saying that I prefer not to deliver a written statement in meetings such as this.  I prefer to have more open discussions.  It would probably be better to refer to what I was actually saying in the meeting and to check against delivery.  It is not that I am willing to deny anything that I have written.  It is simply a procedural point.</p> <p>  I will come back on the substance of some of the points raised.  You referred to the broad-based recovery, Chairman.  You may agree or you may not agree, but the assessment of the Commission is that the Irish economy has made a remarkable turnaround.  We see it in the fast economic growth and decreasing unemployment.  We see it in the rapid development in many sectors of the economy.  We are not saying that everything is solved.</p> <p>  Let us consider the EU economic policy priorities - they are equally valid in Ireland.  We are saying now that we have economic recovery.  At the same time, we must work to make growth inclusive, address income inequality and restart the process of convergence both within and among EU member states.  That is our focus.  Our economic policy priorities indicate that is exactly what we need to focus on now.</p> <p>  The next set of country-specific recommendations is in development.  I am talking more generally rather than prejudging specifically the country-specific recommendations for Ireland.  They will help to focus on the reduction of income equality and on the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights, recently agreed by member states.  They will help to put more emphasis on addressing the special social problems that you have raised, Chairman.</p> <p>  You referred to the banking sector, Chairman.  We see once again that the level of non-performing loans in Irish banking sector has reduced rather substantially.  Actually, it has been one of the fastest reductions.  Of course we are aware that this entire issue is sensitive and we need to tackle it with strong consumer safeguards.  It is a matter for national supervisors and national consumer protection institutions to prevent aggressive loan-collection strategies, something also emphasised during this meeting.</p> <p>  You raised the question of the European Central Bank and comments by Mario Draghi, Chairman.  I cannot comment, because we must respect the independence of the ECB.  The European Commission does not comment on the decisions of the European Central Bank - it is an independent institution that responds for itself.</p></speech>

I am the chief financial officer of Ulster Bank Ireland DAC and I am joined today by Ms Elizabeth Arnett, head of corporate affairs.</p> <p>  As the committee is aware, we are in a close period and therefore we cannot discuss issues which may trigger discussion of financially sensitive information regarding provisions or disclosures.  There may be some questions that stray into this territory.  I will be happy to take those questions away if I cannot answer them and come back to the committee where I can.  We are here to discuss the progress made regarding resolution of the tracker mortgage redress issue.  I will give an overview of this and then we will be very happy to take questions, which I am sure committee members have.</p> <p>  As committee members know, our examination is ongoing and we have, as part of our phase 2, identified just under 3,500 customers who are impacted.  The impact on these customers and the length of time it is taking to pay redress and compensation is unacceptable and, rightfully, we are being challenged on this.  I repeat the apology that Ulster Bank has made to our customers in this regard.</p> <p>  When the Central Bank tracker mortgage examination letter arrived in our bank we took a number of months to consider how to respond, but by March 2016 we had begun the process of establishing our programme.  In hindsight what we should have done was mobilise somewhat earlier and have deliberations concurrently.  By doing it the other way we probably added three months to our programme that potentially could have been avoided.</p> <p>  The work involved in identifying impacted customers is one of the largest and most complicated projects ever undertaken by the bank.  We have more than 200 people working full time on the programme.  I know this is no consolation to people who have been waiting too long for the redress and compensation to which they are entitled, but let me try to explain the challenge of the process in more detail.</p> <p>  Ulster Bank started with 300,000 customers in the scope of the examination.  They were customers who were active, redeemed or sold between 2001 and 2015.  Customer journeys were segmented into different categories, which required different levels of review.  By way of example, these customers include those who drew down on a tracker rate and did not move to any other product or margin at any time.  There are approximately 64,000 of these and we could discount them from the process quickly.  Of the 300,000 mortgages, we carried out an in-depth review of over 7,000 to determine whether or not they were impacted.  As I am sure the committee appreciates, this involved a lengthy process of rebuilding customer files, locating original hard copies of documentation and putting together a full journey of what those customers went through.  This process was made difficult in Ulster Bank because we were dealing with five mortgage systems across two banks extending for a period of over a decade and a half.  There was a high degree of variety in these accounts.  We found over 1,600 different journeys, with some customers having up to 20 different points in that journey.  By way of example, a journey includes mortgage drawdown, product switches, any rate changes, any forbearance or special arrangements and mortgage redemption.  This process identified just under 3,500 impacted customers and is set out in the phase 2 report we submitted to the Central Bank.  As of quarter three of 2017, we made a provision of &euro;211 million for this project, which includes administration costs and compensation and remediation to customers.</p> <p>  In designing the examination, the Central Bank framework requires that we look retrospectively at our loan book and apply a contractual, regulatory and, very importantly, customer lens to determine whether there is an impact.  The vast majority of the 3,500 customers were impacted due to ambiguous and potentially confusing terminology in our documentation, and as a result, these customers did not get the correct rate.  I do not wish to appear to minimise the nature of the impact, but rather to give the committee an understanding of what we have found as a result of our work to date on the examination.</p> <p>  The ambiguity in the documentation we produced presented circumstances whereby our subsequent actions certainly disadvantaged our customers.  The requirement to be clear in all communications with customers is the minimum standard to which we must, and do, hold ourselves.  In this regard, we did not meet the standards and we failed our customers.  We deeply regret this and apologise unreservedly to all impacted customers.  We are putting this right, accepting the pace is frustratingly slow for our customers and for ourselves.</p> <p>  In total, the transparency and ambiguity issue to which I have referred affected approximately 88% of the 3,500 customers.  The other 12% were primarily due to operational errors and the absence of required warnings.  Approximately 2,500 of impacted customers are still with Ulster Bank and we have returned them to their correct rate.  We stopped the harm as quickly as we could.  As the committee is aware, this happened on a phased basis, mostly during the first quarter of 2017 and the back end of 2016.  For customers who are no longer with Ulster Bank, we are working through their remediation, with a commitment to complete this and our commitment on the overall 3,500, by the end of the second quarter of 2018.</p> <p>  For customers who lost their homes as a result of the tracker mortgage issue, we have a special process in place on top of the standard remediation.  For example, where we identify customers who have lost their homes as a result of the loss of a tracker rate, we communicate with them, appoint a single point of contact for them, arrange a meeting and offer an upfront initial payment of &euro;50,000 in advance of completing the full redress and compensation process.  We commenced the process of paying redress and compensation in September and to date we have paid more than 1,200 customers.</p> <p>  There are a number of key principles for us in this phase of the examination.  It is very important for us that we put each customer back to the position he or she would have been in had the error not occurred.  This involves reconstruction of each customer account using the correct interest rate; quantification of the amount of interest overcharged at the incorrect rate, and reversal of that overcharge; calculation of the monthly repayments that should have been paid by the customer and a refund of the difference between that total and what was paid by the customer; and restoration of the mortgage balance to what should now be outstanding, following reversal of the interest overcharge and refund of repayments.</p> <p>  The letters we write to customers are designed to complete a picture for them.  In some cases these can contain up to 30 pages but they also include a summary.  They contain a full financial statement going back to the month when the impact happened and provide a month by month statement for the years the impact happened.  Customer accounts, in calculating redress amounts require manual intervention and calculations.  At present, this cannot be systemised because of the multiple variations that exist in each customer journey.  This necessitates additional quality control and assurance checks.  In calculating redress and compensation for even straightforward cases, there are up to 120 separate data points that can move each time there is an additional payment on the account.  This means the calculation is very time sensitive.  For live Ulster Bank customers, a short period opens up each month when all of the data is collected and reviewed, the calculations are made, the calculations are checked, the letter is compiled and checked and then issued before the next payment is made on the account and the data points have changed.  This has been a slow and challenging process, and I would not even begin to express how difficult this has been for customers.  We are focused on paying what is due to all impacted customers as quickly as possible.  There is no advantage for us if we drag our feet on making this right and there is certainly no advantage for our customers.</p> <p>  We have more than just a regulatory or contractual obligation to our customers.  We believe we have a moral obligation to be fair and to put things right as quickly as possible when it goes wrong.  We also accept and acknowledge the focus of this committee, the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank in this matter and holding us all to account.  Ulster Bank has certainly learned lessons from this and, while we are still in the process of finalising our programme, we are applying these lessons across the bank.</p><p>Throughout this process, our people on the front line - helping customers and dealing with queries - have worked tirelessly, and that is despite how the public may feel about those of us at senior level.  I would like to draw that distinction.</p><p> To close, I emphasise again that we are working to finalise our numbers.  We will continue to engage with the Central Bank as regards a phase 2.  While we expect some additional customers to be impacted upon, we do not expect the issues to be on the same scale.  Despite this, we have failed.  This has not only impacted on our tracker customers but society's trust in banks and, indeed, our credibility as an industry.  We will continue to work hard to complete this programme, learn from it and rebuild trust in our bank.  We are serious about our commitments to our customers and we are listening and learning from the experience of this programme.  I thank the Chair and look forward to questions.</p></speech>

I will have to check that.  I put it to the witness that he should be here.  He is still the chief executive officer.  He is the person who is accountable.  We might look into that precedent issue.</p> <p>  Turning to the matters at hand, the tracker examinations, in the questionnaire, Ulster Bank says that in the region of 15 private dwelling homes, PDHs, may have been lost as a result of this issue.  A phone is on.  It is not mine.  Mr. Stanley has said up to 15 homes have been lost as a result of being denied tracker mortgages by Ulster Bank.  Will Mr. Stanley bring us up to date on those cases?</p></speech>

We are continuing to work through our buy-to-let book to look at loss of ownership.  There is the potential that a designation on an account that was originally buy-to-let may have become a PDH over the period to date, which would mean that it would fall into the PDH category.  That is the reason we say 15.</p></speech>

From reading Mr. Stanley's submission and looking at the history, I know the bank has had some unfortunate information technology glitches in recent years.  It seems the bank's systems are in a bit of a mess.</p></speech>

The five mortgage systems I referred to are legacy systems that existed over the period.  We are down to two mortgage systems as of last year.  That is a legacy problem but it does impact on pulling data out from the 2001 period.  With two systems, we have far more robust and central information technology.</p></speech>

For the record, it is not acceptable that the chief executive officer of the bank has not appeared before the committee today.  I note that the bank provided further information and its opening statement quite late yesterday.  If all the other banks were able to provide the information when requested by the committee, Ulster Bank should have been able to do so.  I welcome that despite the bank's reservations regarding appearing before the committee at this time, it nevertheless accepted the committee's request.</p> <p>  I wish to raise a number of issues.  I acknowledge that we are only dealing with the tracker mortgage issue today and that we will have an opportunity on another day to discuss issues related to the global restructuring group, GRG, and the revelations that are being uncovered in respect of Ulster Bank's parent body in Britain.  Hopefully, that will flow into a full investigation into Ulster Bank's activities here.  </p> <p>  In regard to where Ulster Bank is at in terms of phase 2, the Central Bank is in dispute with Ulster Bank on the final numbers.  </p></speech>

Whether a customer is part of a large or a small group should not determine or influence whether we deem that person impacted.

It is not the case that those staff members were just working on those 200 cases.

Whatever the 200 people in Ulster Bank who were working on this in January were doing, the first port of call is to pay back these individuals.  Ulster Bank's great achievement in January was to give 197 customers back their money.  When did Ulster Bank first find out that these individuals were impacted by it?  It is a beautiful word - a nice industry word.  These people were robbed by the bank because it told us in December 2016 that it was aware that 2,000 people were impacted, or robbed, by the bank.  It is not the case that Ulster Bank only found this out a couple of weeks ago and now has to do all the calculations and all the rest.  As the bank knew from December 2016 that these customers were impacted, how are members supposed to accept that a bank regulated here by the Irish State is in such disarray that it cannot return money it wrongly possesses in its accounts to its customers at least a year and one month after knowing and admitting it wrongly held that money?  Is that not the case?  Ulster Bank knew for more that a year and one month that 2,000 customers had their money wrongly taken from them by the bank.  As of today, the bank has not given back their money to 800 of them.</p></speech>

For this quarter, we are focused on getting the 2,500 out.  It is not the case that people have been sitting on their hands and have just been focused on the 197 customers we paid in January.  They are also focused on getting the other two months ready and out the door as well.  I accept fully that this has taken too long to do.  Regarding the reasons for it, what I tried to outline in the letter was the complexity of what we are dealing with.  People are working very hard and are fully aware of the difficulty this is creating for customers.  They are fully aware of it.  We want to solve this for both our customers and ourselves as quickly as possible.  We have no interest in dragging this out.  As the Deputy can imagine, it is costing us a lot of money to run all these processes internally.  We need to fix it for our customers and ourselves as quickly as possible and that is where our focus lies.</p></speech>

I am the same, as I am sure are the rest of the committee members.  The number of letters I get from Ulster Bank customers exceeds all of the letters I receive from other customers from all of the other banks combined.  That the trend at which we are now looking because of the messing in which Ulster Bank is involved.  It is not just about not paying back the customers.  What about people who are putting in for their own data?  What is the story there?  There is a 40-day period during which the bank must provide with their data.  Is that not the case?</p></speech>

It seems that the bank is a shambles.  It cannot get to grips with this.  Mr. Stanley's apology and excuse for this earlier on was that when the Central Bank wrote to it in 2015, Ulster Bank sat on its hands for a couple of weeks and had a wee yarn with itself about how it would respond and that is why it lost so much time and is so far behind the other banks.</p></speech>

Since then we know that the bank has identified another 1,500.  The figure for home loss, however, has not increased despite that increase of 1,500.

It has been operational errors where different wrong rates were keyed in and some of the customer protection code, CPC, warnings required were not given.  We are putting a customer lens on this in respect of remediation.  Our core volume was around the use of an ambiguous term, home loan rate, and reverting to a home loan rate, and the contractual view is that the law was not broken but that is not the issue here.  The issue is that it was ambiguous from a customer perspective and created an expectation that they could revert to a tracker.</p></speech>

I could read an email I got from a customer which is horrific.  It speaks about, in their words, being "harassed" by Ulster Bank because they were falling into mortgage arrears.  They were brought in by Ulster Bank and questioned about the amount of money they were spending on hospital charges to visit their dying mother, it speaks about the problems in their personal life in terms of mental stress and taking medication as a result of all this.  This is the responsibility of Mr. Stanley's institution.   Will there be any accountability?</p></speech>

I asked the Governor of the Central Bank, Philip Lane, is it the case that Ulster Bank's IT system is so bad that this is the problem and he said yes that is the case.  The bank's IT system had a glitch which locked its customers out of basic banking services for weeks on end.</p> <p>  The bank paid a dividend two days ago of &euro;1.5 billion to its parent group at the same time that its IT systems are in such a shambles that it cannot pay back money it took wrongly from customers' accounts over a year later.  Would it not fit it better to tell NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland, RBS, no, actually we are not paying a dividend, we have a duty and responsibility of care to our customers here in Ireland and we will invest that to make sure this will never happen again and that we have robust systems?</p></speech>

We had five mortgage systems and that is the complexity of going back into systems that are closed down, extracting the information and rebuilding customer files.  We now have two and in effect most mortgages are on one.  That absolutely has been a challenge of the past.  It is not there today.  During the course of 2017 we completed that migration and we now have only two mortgage systems.<br/><br/>In terms of investment in systems, those are RBS's systems, not Ulster Bank systems <i>per se</i>.  RBS invests &euro;1 billion a year in IT and systems upgrades and we are the beneficiaries of that.</p><p> It is happening both in our mortgage systems and our mortgage processes, and indeed other investments across the bank.  </p><p> I will conclude by commenting on the dividend, which was also raised.  Ulster Bank is excessively capitalised at this point.  That, as the Deputy is aware, is taxpayers' money that came in from the UK, and was needed, in order to capitalise the bank.  The European Central Bank, ECB, our own Central Bank, and indeed our own parent company, are quite comfortable with the view that it was appropriate to make that dividend.  We remain the most capitalised bank within the Republic of Ireland, certainly the most capitalised of the main banks.  That is why the dividend was repaid.  Investment continues to take place in our system.</p></speech>

It is absolutely disgusting that Mr. Gerry Mallon is not here today.  This is a scandal for which Ulster Bank has had to make a provision of &euro;211 million, yet he does not see fit to come before the committee to answer questions.  He should consider changing the bank's name from &quot;Ulster Bank&quot; to &quot;Ambiguous Bank&quot;.  It is hard to even ask intelligent questions.  There is so much fudge around when everything happened or did not happen.  I find it absolutely exasperating that he is not before us today, benefiting as he is from the bank.  I will try to confine my questions, but as others have said, we get more letters from Ulster Bank customers than from those of all the other banks combined, and that is not by accident.  There is nothing ambiguous about that.</p><p>We must also remember that in December 2016, Ulster Bank promised that all customers would be written to by the end of the year.  Perhaps Ulster Bank did write to them.  I will give the witnesses an example of one customer.  Since January 2016, he has received the same letter over and over again.  I laughed earlier when Ms Arnett referred to a &quot;high degree of variation&quot;.  There certainly is not a high degree of variation in Ulster Bank's contact with these customers.  I do not accept that the degree of complexity prevents Ulster Bank from communicating effectively with its customers, because some of these calculations can be made by the homeowners themselves, as indeed they have been.  These are customers who are paying 3.75% interest as things stand.  They know they have overpaid by, say, &euro;300 a month over ten years, so they know the overpayment amounts to &euro;30,000.  They know that is what is due to them, compensation aside.  As such, it is extremely frustrating for us and for them to see that we are here two years later.  They are still opening their envelopes, getting the same thing over and over.  </p><p>There are so many contradictions in what the witnesses say about the way they treat customers.  Mr. Stanley's opening statement claimed:</p><blockquote>&quot;The letters we write to customers are designed to complete a picture for them.  In some cases these can contain up to 30 pages but they also include a summary.  They contain a full financial statement going back to the month when the impact happened and provide a month by month statement for the years the impact happened.&quot;</blockquote> <p>Very good.  However, that is not what customers are telling us.  </p></speech>

When customers ask for their own data, the bank does not give it to them.  Instead the bank blames the system, as has happened in this hearing.  Ulster Bank hides behind its systems when accounting for the period when customers had to endure having their money taken, and now it refuses to give that money back, or delays in doing so.  Justice delayed is justice denied, as far as I am concerned.  My colleague outlined some of what these families are going through.  They have been hounded and persecuted by the banks and by Ulster Bank, and the CEO does not even see fit to come before us.  It is so frustrating.  When will the new CEO be appointed?</p></speech>

It first robbed them of the tracker rates to which they were entitled, second, it harassed some of those people when they fell into arrears, and third, even compared to other banks, it has been dragging its feet in providing appropriate compensation and redress, which is an ongoing abuse.  I have quite simple questions.  Approximately how much money did Ulster Bank benefit from as a result of denying customers their right to tracker mortgages or correct rates?</p></speech>

One is that the economic circumstances which the banking industry and the country were going through back in 2008 meant that the tracker product was loss-making.  Banks will take products out of their ranges at any point in time.  In taking these products out of their ranges, I do not believe sufficient consideration was given to the implications for customers who might have come off a tracker and onto a fixed rate and for other such instances.  That is what I believe happened.</p></speech>

Is Mr. Stanley aware that there was tension in the mortgage centre among the staff who were working on tracker mortgages and that the staff at ground level were put under pressure to not allow people back on to trackers and to get people off them?  In some cases that I am aware of there were disputes.  The union was involved.  Staff members only agreed to do it on the basis of putting a note on the system which said that management had instructed them to do so.</p></speech>

It was before my time.  To be clear, as far as I have been able to determine, there is no evidence that there was any systematic or coherent effort to move people off trackers.  If one looks at when people moved off trackers, it was generally during periods of high interest rates when it was cheaper to have a fixed rate than a tracker rate.  That is where the difficulty and challenges occurred.</p></speech>

It also indicates that they had a better ethical approach than the management which was driving this process.</p></speech>

Was there any communication between Ulster Bank and other banks on this issue?</p></speech>

In our case many of these instances were customers going on to fixed rates and then not reverting to tracker rates.  Even before tracker rates came into existence the standard market practice was that when customers came off a fixed rate, if they did not choose another product, they would revert to the standard variable rate.  There was probably an over-reliance on that standard practice.</p></speech>

We are expected to believe that it just so happened that the situation benefited the bank to the tune of &euro;100 million and that nobody thought it through.  Does Mr. Stanley understand how I find that hard to believe, even though my opinion is not as important as that of the customers harassed by Mr. Stanley's bank?</p></speech>

Like my colleagues, I think it is reprehensible that Mr. Mallon did not appear today.  We have been pursuing Ulster Bank to come before the committee for many weeks.  The bank did everything in its power to ensure that it did not.  We have a body of work to do and now we find that the bank has arrived in without its CEO.  This is not personal, it is just that the buck stops with the CEO.  Mr. Mallon should have been here today.  I want to put that on record.  The bank has come in here kicking and screaming.  It has not come in of its own accord.  We have a duty to the public, and in particular to the tracker mortgage holders - the victims - who got caught up with many of the institutions, including Ulster Bank.</p> <p>  I just have a few quick questions.  What is the total figure the 1,214 customers who have been redressed and compensated at this stage have received?  How is it broken down between redress and compensation?</p></speech>

For buy-to-let it is a little lower - &euro;2,000.  However, I very much caution the Senator that we have not completed the process.  In effect, that figure is only for the 1,200 customers I spoke about earlier.  That is too small a group to say that is the overall figure.

It was reported towards the end of last year that there was a dispute between Ulster Bank and the Central Bank.  Between 2,000 and 3,000 additional tracker mortgage holders might be impacted upon by this scandal.  Can Mr. Stanley tell me where this matter stands?  What is the profile?  What is the area of dispute regarding these 2,000 to 3,000 customers on top of the 3,500?  It could be virtually double the original figure.</p></speech>

The Senator missed the earlier part of our discussion.  The Central Bank has asked for extra evidence and asked us to look at a number of policy areas again.  These were judgmental areas in terms of whether cohorts or elements of customers were in or out.  I ask the Senator to let me finish because he missed the earlier part of the session.

The more information we have, the more we can give some reassurance to customers.  Based on what we have heard this morning, I do not believe that the people watching these proceedings this morning will be overly reassured that they will have everything by June.</p> <p>  Deputy Jack Chambers e-mailed me about a particular constituent who says that some Ulster Bank switcher customers have received a cheque for the amount they overpaid from the date they were wrongly removed.  They say they are currently going through the procedures but that many other Ulster Bank switcher customers have not even received the courtesy of a confirmation that they are impacted and will be dealt with in due course.  The customer has a list of questions including why Ulster Bank switcher customers have not received written confirmation that they are impacted under the process, if everybody will receive confirmation that they are impacted, and, if they are impacted, by when will they receive it.</p></speech>

It would be wrong of me to say that because someone is not among the 3,500, they are not impacted.  That is the immediate challenge we face.  After that we can be quite clear with customers about who is or is not impacted.</p></speech>

Mr. Stanley is getting the brunt of what he would probably get.  It would have been to Mr. Stanley's benefit if he was here.  My understanding is that Richie Boucher was either on holidays or was going within a very short number of weeks, after a very long time in the bank.  Mr. Stanley has told us that this individual will be there for a further six months.  This meeting has not been half as helpful as it might have been had he been here and if we had much more data on the 1,200 or 1,400 customers.  The fact that the 1,200 or 1,400 is around one third of the confirmed customers paid is far behind everyone else, which Mr. Stanley has confirmed.</p> <p>  I do not have much more to raise here because it has all been covered already.  In view of the closed period issue and lack of data, I do not have much more to raise.</p></speech>

The bank's complaint handling centre received a letter from a customer in January 2016, over two years ago.  The letter thanks the customer for their letter of 23 January and tells them that the bank is currently working through the Central Bank requirements and will continue in due course if this customer's case falls within the scope of those requirements.</p> <p>  It is quite obvious that the Central Bank was working with Ulster Bank before 2016.  This point follows on from Senator Horkan's comments.  The Central Bank was working with Ulster Bank prior to 2016, so we are talking about 2015 and the requirements of what they would agree.  The letter says the bank will contact the customer in due course if their case falls within the scope of those requirements.</p></speech>

We are clear about the 3,500 customers whose cases we came here this morning to discuss.  We have had several challenges back on our phase two report on which we hope to close with the Central Bank in coming weeks.  That will allow us to be clear on what customers are or are not impacted.  We will commit to communicating with all customers who are impacted at that point.</p></speech>

We submitted our phase two report in March 2017.  The Central Bank came back to us in November 2017 with a series of questions and clarifications, to which we responded by mid-January.  We need to conclude on those and close out any residual customers who may be impacted and who are not included in the 3,500.  That is the timeline.</p></speech>

Once we conclude the process with the Central Bank, as I said in response to Senator Horkan, we will communicate with all impacted customers within a month.  To be clear, this will involve communicating with them, it will not involve sending out individual cheques for any residual customers.  We still have to work through the complications of that process.</p></speech>

Some of those staff were already at risk of redundancy but were retained as part of the bank.  Some staff were in line for redundancy and, indeed, many wanted to move on and may decide to go.  We will look at the numbers and what other issues in the bank require support.  Many of these staff have built up a very good skill set, whether they use it in Ulster Bank or elsewhere.  We need to decide on this.  Put simply, if there was no tracker mortgage examination in a year's time, and nothing else was happening in the bank, many of that 200 would be surplus.  That does not refer to the individual staff member but the full-time equivalent numbers in the bank.</p></speech>

Many lessons have been learned from this process.  For me, one is that we must listen to the customer and put the customer lens across what the bank does rather than viewing it through a purely legal or contractual lens.  That is a core lesson not only for Ulster Bank, but also others.  That is not what was done.  The view was very much a legal one of where the bank stood contractually.</p></speech>

One is based on behaviour and culture and the other is operational changes.  On operational changes, first and foremost, we are looking to ensure that our documentation is very clear and there is no ambiguity within it.  We have simplified our mortgage products to remove any ambiguity.  We have looked at our full mortgage process to see if we can identify any risks within it.  One might argue that if that had happened prior to 2000, looking at tracker mortgages and what aspects of risk were there, we might not be here today.  Those are the types of steps that we have taken to examine the banks operations and how we can address the issues we have identified.</p> <p>  Importantly, we are examining behaviours and how our values as a bank, and have come a long way in how we expect our staff to behave towards customers.</p><p>We have come a long way in that regard in terms of our code, standards and policies and how we work that into the expectations of what staff do and how they behave.  We survey every staff member, of whom there are 75,000 as we are part of the RBS group, across the entire bank to identify where, for example, staff members feel it is not acceptable or encouraged to raise issues in their section of the bank.  We want to have a challenge culture such that a member of staff can challenge something with which he or she is not comfortable.  We have put a big focus on risk management, in particular in Ulster Bank and very much led by the board, and being very proactive in terms of identifying risk to customers.  Much has been done but we have a long way to go on those issues.  However, we are very committed to achieving our ambition to be number one for customer service trust and advocacy.</p></speech>

That can be agreed through a number of avenues, such as working things out with customers and getting them off non-performing loans, asset sales or, potentially, write-downs.  There is not only one option in that regard.</p></speech>

At one point prior to the meeting I was willing to accept that Mr. Mallon would not be here.  Every business goes through changes and Ulster Bank is no exception to that.  I have seen change in businesses.  However, having reflected on that and the fact that, according to the witnesses, Mr. Mallon is working out six months' notice, Ulster Bank has a brass neck like no other I have seen because Mr. Stanley and Ms Arnett have put an opening statement before us this morning that would lead members to believe that Ulster Bank is putting the customer first.  We have a moral obligation to be fair and to put things right as quickly as possible when we get it wrong.  However, Mr. Mallon did not turn up here this morning but has a number of months yet to serve in the bank, which reflects very badly on it.  Ulster Bank tried to get a different date for this meeting, in spite of other banks also being in a closed period, which is nothing short of obstruction of the process of the committee and our examination of the affairs of Ulster Bank in the context of tracker mortgages.  The scant information that has been put before the committee today is a further example of almost an unwillingness to understand the scale of the difficulties it has created for people.</p> <p>  The witnesses could spend the day dealing with statistics and so on but I am going to look at facts.  For seven years, Ulster Bank contested every case with Padraic Kissane and it learned nothing in that time.  I will take the witnesses to correspondence from Ulster Bank customers, as referred to by other members.  The committee is defending Ulster Bank customers but Mr. Stanley and Ms Arnett should be doing so as that is their job.  All they are doing is playing with words and I do not accept half of what they say.  We have received correspondence from a lady who was reinstated on her tracker in January 2016 and, to date, has not received a letter about redress.  Before Christmas, she telephoned Ulster Bank to find out when she could expect to be repaid the money it wrongfully took from her.  She was told it could not give her information and that nobody could tell her when that might happen but that it would be addressed in the second quarter.  She had to pay considerable fees for various advice to deal with Ulster Bank in the earlier stages of her efforts to get what was rightfully hers.  She will probably have spent between &euro;6,000 and &euro;8,000 on advice by the time the process concludes.  Will Ulster Bank refund her that money?</p></speech>

If she is the figure for change, she is not making a great job of it because she told me she would contact those customers immediately, but did not do so.  As of yesterday, she had not done so.  Customers are still waiting to be contacted, as indicated in the first letter I read out, while this letter, written yesterday, indicates that Ms Arnett has not contacted the individuals whom I was told she would contact.  She gave that commitment.  The person who wrote that letter was written to in November 2017 in regard to his or her tracker loans, one of which has been offloaded to a vulture fund.  I asked for immediate intervention in that regard because it was unfair and wrong.  The vulture fund has since attempted to enter the building, change locks and cause nothing but distress for the people involved.  I do not know how Mr. Stanley and Ms Arnett can sit there, knowing this has happened, and say what they have about their customers.</p><p>When Ulster Bank wrote to the customer it disclosed information on at least half a dozen other customers not associated with this.  Mr. Stanley was asked about data protection earlier.  This is a data protection issue, it is obviously a customer issue and is an issue in which I asked the bank to intervene.  It is still ongoing.  The bank is still giving no relief whatsoever to the individuals concerned.</p><p> Senator Horkan referred to questions to do with switchers.  Deputy Jack Chambers and other Deputies have written to the committee because they are also receiving correspondence.  They are asking the same questions.  Ulster Bank switcher customers have not even received the courtesy of having it confirmed they are impacted and will be dealt with in due course.  The witnesses might take note of some of these issues as we go through them because I will ask for an answer on each and every one of them.</p><p> In another letter from a customer, the person says the terms and conditions within the contract to the effect that the tracker was for the life of the mortgage have now been changed.  This person's money has been returned, which amounted to almost a year's net wages plus a small amount for compensation.  The terms of the contract have been changed to favour the bank.  Will the witnesses explain this to us?  It raises questions about switchers.</p><p> These are just a tiny sample from the volume of correspondence we have received.  Will customers be refunded for overpayments during the time they were with AIB?  This involves another bank and Ulster Bank.  Another customer was waiting 17 months for the bank to rectify a situation and, having notified the bank of the person's personal, health and financial situation on 26 November 2017, as well as receiving confirmation from the bank at a further meeting on 7 December 2017 that the customer would be treated as a priority, the customer had to write emails to us on 26 January because the bank did not respond.</p><p> None of what the witnesses are saying adds up in the context of a batch of emails I have received about how the bank is treating its customers.  I want to ask about First Active tracker customers.  Will the witnesses answer these questions?</p></speech>

I will make reference to the first comments made by the Chairman on scant disregard for the workings of the House.  That certainly is not the position we take in any way, shape or form.  With respect to the constraints we feel are on us during a closed period, I raised those matters with the committee before Christmas.  Mr. Mallon's resignation came last week and we were unaware it was coming.  We were looking for a three-week deferment of our appearance in order that we would be out of the closed period to allow for a discussion on other topics.  I note the Chairman questioned our bona fides in this respect and this instructs us that we have a long way to go before we will build trust with the Chairman and the committee.  We will certainly work to do this.</p> <p>  On the individual customers to whom the Chairman made reference, I apologise because my understanding was we had resolved those issues.  I contacted the Chairman's office this week to make sure I had followed up on everything.  That is my fault entirely and I apologise for it.  I will look into it.  I can only apologise for my own failing in respect of that.</p></speech>

Those mortgage systems have been in existence for more than ten years and there is a standard set of contracts that go with the system, and when people have been migrated across to those systems they have defaulted, in effect, to that contract.  I am not sure whether this is the term, but there is a <i>force majeure</i>in there that Deputy Doherty has raised previously with me.  I have had a look at it.  It is standard to that particular system.  It has been in existence for quite a period.  I understand we highlighted it to customers when we made the change.  I am not sure whether that is the term to which the Chairman is referring but yes, in answer to his question, there was that change.</p></speech>

If the question is, with regard to customers who went to AIB but were not on a tracker with AIB and had been on a tracker with us and they were impacted, whether we would refund them the difference between whatever rate they were on in AIB and should have been on from a tracker perspective, the answer is "yes".

Again, in the context of that meeting, we spoke to the Vice-President about the number of loans that have been sold already to vulture funds, and banks using vulture funds to reduce their non-performing loans.  I again express our concerns to the witnesses that these vulture funds, as in the case I mentioned to Ms Arnett, behave in a way that would lead one to believe there was no law and order in this country.  It is disgraceful what they have got away with, particularly on our side of it in terms of their transparency and accountability to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p><p> In terms of their business dealings and treatment of customers, the vulture funds have completely ignored the fact that they have an obligation to honour-----</p></speech>

I have given an example already in terms of the case concerning the individual who wrote to us.</p> <p>  All of this brings me to the global restructuring group, GRG, and I know Mr. Stanley may not wish to comment.  Of all of the banks to have come before the committee, Ulster Bank has offered the excuse of the closed period more than any other bank when answering questions.  Fair enough, Ulster Bank has adopted that stance.  Earlier this week, Mr. Stanley's RBS boss somewhat acknowledged that the global restructuring unit did not treat customers fairly, while being grilled by a committee in the UK.  This is an overview of what he said but that seems to have been the case.  We have heard from a number of customers who have been involved with the global restructuring group.  Arising from Mr. McEwan's comments at the UK committee hearing, is it within the remit of Ulster Bank here in Dublin to state at the very least that something seems to have gone wrong and it will conduct an inquiry into the customer base that may have been affected here in Ireland?  Can Ulster Bank here make that decision? </p></speech>

I am sure the committee is aware, and we have said it before that the vast majority of what GRG then had in Ireland comprised a large property element rather than an ongoing trading cashflow business element.  Everybody in the room here is well aware of what happened in the property sector in Ireland and how stressed those loans became.  For the most part we put on-----</p></speech>

Most of the GRG loans were put for a period into forbearance arrangements to see whether there was a potential to work out.  We were quite clear at our previous meeting that our success in that regard was limited.  In effect, only 100 recovered, which is the number we gave the committee before, in terms of the population that went in there.  A large amount of the 2,100 customers who went in initially were sold on as part of the process.  To date, our investigation has been on one area, as part of the RBS umbrella, which was around the complex fees element.</p> <p>  In terms of any further investigation, that would be a discussion with the parent bank as to what it is doing and, indeed, what is appropriate.  </p></speech>

The committee has raised this issue and will continue to do so.  Last year, I raised it with the Taoiseach and called on everyone to get to grips with this matter because it is the new tracker mortgage scandal.</p><p>These businesses had numerous employees and the potential to deliver for the economy.  Some may have gone out of business but not at the scale at which they went.  There was obviously an orchestrated default.  A company was set up that benefited from this.  We talk about vulture funds.  The bank was the vulture to its own customers.  It orchestrated defaults and picked from the carcases of those who lost.</p></speech>

I think the Deputy is going back to the West Register point that he raised before.  Some 15 properties went into that.  The Deputy might look into the accounts of that company.  They show that the business made a profit.  If the Deputy looks at what those properties were valued at when they were taken by the bank, they went at written-down value when they went to West Register.  The bank had already taken a loss on those.  I do not accept that the bank made wholesale profits on those activities.</p></speech>

Will the committee, the Government and the Central Bank have to do a pincer movement on Ulster Bank or will Ulster Bank learn the lesson and carry out its own investigation?  The Financial Conduct Authority, FCA, will publish its report.  The pressure is coming on.  I would argue that the game is up.  If Mr. Stanley genuinely wants to restore confidence in Ulster Bank, having been tipped as being the CEO in-waiting last time and missing out, this could be his turn.  I am sure Mr. Stanley does not want this hanging over him if he is in the top job.</p></speech>

Part of the challenge of coming in here on this date before year end is that we could have talked about that a little more fully later.  Maybe we can pick up again after year end results.  I am a little conflicted about having the detail of the discussion today.  Based on what has happened with the parent and the focus, both internally and from the Central Bank, it is a sector which we are looking at with regard to what has happened in our book.</p></speech>

I apologise to everybody who has contacted us with regard to this but we would be here for the next week if we did that.  I will ask Mr. Stanley about a case where an individual took out a tracker mortgage and, when the European Central Bank, ECB, interest rate increased, that person's rate increased.  However, when the ECB reduced its rates, Ulster Bank wrote to the customer to say that the new minimum monthly payment was a certain amount but as the customer was already due to pay more than that, the bank had not made any changes to the amount it collected from the person's bank account.  That effectively meant that the bank held the interest rate at a higher level which obviously shortened the term of the mortgage but did not reduce in line with the ECB's reduction.  This customer wrote to the bank to instruct it that only the minimum amount should be deducted but the letter was ignored.  Was this common practice within the bank, that when the ECB's rate reduced, it did not automatically involve a reduction in the tracker mortgage customer's account?  This individual was aware of his rights even though the bank did not afford him his rights when he asked for the rate to be reduced because the payment would still be above the minimum.  Was this policy within the bank?  Has Mr. Stanley come across this?</p></speech>

The norm in the bank is that the payment should reduce in line with the change of interest rates.  The Deputy probably does not know the circumstances of the customer.  Was that customer in arrears or otherwise?  That could be a possible reason but I do not know without looking at the detail.  The norm should be that as interest rates go up or down, the payment levels should change accordingly.  It may be a case that communications come from the bank to offer the customer the option to keep repayment levels at a higher level to pay down earlier but that should be the customer's option, not the bank's.</p></speech>

I have had much correspondence about this.  It relates to customers' own documentation.  The bank has a 40 day SAR deadline for customers.  I will give a snippet of one email, which states that the customer requested details through a SAR on a certain date and was told 40 days later, after chasing it, that the bank could not fulfil the request as the customer was on a tracker mortgage and had to call the tracker team in Dublin.  The customer sent back the &euro;6.35 with a letter called a tracker closure letter and a number to ring that did not work.  The tracker team in Dublin said the customer's account was included in the Central Bank review but advised that it was the SAR team's responsibility to get the data to the customer.  The customer made numerous calls, week after week, to the UK SAR team, the tracker mortgage examination, TME, team, the complaints team and the mortgage operations team.  They all promised to help the customer but no one has.  The customer received a letter offering a small sum of money but does not want this, rather when his or her data will be received.</p></speech>

The bank has a legal responsibility to provide the data.  Going back to my earlier point, I believe the bank is in breach of the law, not just on issues with data but probably on more serious issues.  There are other emails but the language is quite unparliamentary so I may refrain from reading some of those out.  It comes out from that frustration which that individual has talked about, being sent from pillar to post and so on.  One of the customers who came before the committee was an Ulster Bank customer.  Did the bank ever meet with that customer?</p></speech>

I went back to the customers and said they would be contacted and know where they stood, at the very latest, within six weeks.  That did not happen.</p> <p>  The witness indicates that if a customer requests a meeting, the bank will engage with the person and make the necessary arrangements to suit the customer.  Is he giving that commitment today?  Will he reiterate it?  If somebody asks for a meeting with the bank, it will engage with the customer.</p></speech>

That is the standard we endeavour to meet, especially for customers particularly impacted by the tracker mortgage examination.  As we said, for customers who have lost their homes we would assign an individual who would work with them through the entire process.  They would have an individual case handler whom they could meet whenever they need to.  We get requests from customers all the time for meetings and we endeavour to meet those requests as soon as possible.</p></speech>

It is important to emphasise the point.  We look at customer communication and listen to calls and much frustration comes from a lack of certainty.  We have exacerbated that position by not being able to give customers certainty in terms of when they will know and get paid.  As soon as we are through the phase two process, we will be able to very clearly say to customers whether they are impacted or not.  We can only confirm the 3,500 impacted and we cannot confirm the non-impacted until we are through the phase two process.  As soon as we are, will be in a position to confirm that.</p></speech>

I am really concerned about the levels of compensation relative to the other banks.  Bank of Ireland has told us the average rate for those denied a tracker is 20% and AIB gave us figures as well around 20% for those with a private dwelling home mortgage no longer on a tracker, or 23% for those on the higher margin.  The witnesses have said the compensation will be a maximum of 20%.</p></speech>

If impacted customers were previously in arrears, it is 13.5%.  Likewise, with customers in financial difficulty and entering the process of restructuring arrangements, it is 13.5%.  If the impacted customers have previously engaged with us in legal proceedings, it goes to 15.5% and for impacted customers who have lost ownership of their property, it is bespoke and it is &euro;50,000.</p></speech>
