Apologies have been received from Deputy Mary Lou McDonald.</p><p>The minutes of the meeting of 25 January 2018 have been circulated.  Are they agreed?  Agreed.  Any matters arising from the minutes will be dealt with shortly.</p><p>The next item is correspondence received since the committee's last meeting.  In category A correspondence are Nos. 1049 and 1050, which are the briefing document and opening statement received<b></b>from Ms Hilary Murphy-Fagan, chief executive of the National Shared Services Office, for today's meeting.  This has been published.  </p><p>In category B correspondence, from Accounting Officers and Ministers and follow up to PAC meetings, we have received correspondence from John O'Sullivan, commissioner of valuation, dated 26 January 2018, which provides a briefing note on the dates of Laois valuations.  </p><p>One request for follow-up information was made at the meeting last week and the secretariat has followed up on a number of other matters which we should receive in the next two weeks.  We will note and publish that. </p><p>Category C relates to correspondence from private individuals and any other correspondence.  Item Nos. 1038(i) to (ii)<b></b>was received<b></b>from an individual dated 23 January 2018 in relation to alleged Tusla misuse of public moneys.  A copy of a letter from Tusla to the individual in relation to a report mentioned is attached to it.  I propose in the first instance that we write to Tusla for a response to the key items raised in the correspondence.  Tusla seems to have written directly to the person on 12 January and the individual who wrote to us has reverted to the committee with further queries.  We will ask Tusla for a response in so far as it can give it, as it relates in part to individual staff members.</p><p>The next item is No. 1042 received<b></b>from Deputy Catherine Murphy in relation to the funding model for local authorities and population changes.  Does the Deputy wish to speak to the item?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-01a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018020100002#A00400"><p>I should say at the outset that this does not fundamentally refer to local property tax, so I do not believe it falls within the rubric of Government policy.  It refers to the allocation of funding to local government, as it relates formally to the local government fund.  The information was gathered around 2000 based on what was known as the needs and resources model.  It counted what was there historically and the benchmark was that no local authority was to lose out.</p> <p>  There was no future-proofing of the model and no counting of population.  There have been several censuses of population since then.  The baselines which were set originally around 2000 or 2001 are not very different from what is used now.  There would have been changes relating to Irish Water and the associated transfer of staff, resources and liabilities and there was a change last year related to how pensions were calculated, but otherwise the baselines have not changed.</p><p>I have examined a number of comparators between counties that are growing rapidly and some that are not growing as quickly.  In all cases where there has been a population increase, I have tried to match them with counties of comparable sizes.  For example, Mayo has a baseline of &euro;17 million whereas Wicklow has a baseline of &euro;6 million.  If one considers how the local property tax, LPT, is impacted by the baseline, one will see that Mayo receives a sizable transfer of funds whereas Wicklow contributes to the LPT fund.  In terms of gross expenditure by counties that are not dissimilar, however, Mayo actually has a great deal more money to spend.</p><p> Other pairs show the same trends.  Where Limerick City and County Council is concerned, the city has a decent commercial rates base.  Fingal has the lowest baseline in the country, but it has been the most rapidly growing area.  Parts of Fingal did not even exist when the resourcing model was established.</p><p> The baseline is influencing how much of the money that must be spent is self-funded, effectively replacing the grants that would otherwise have been paid from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport or Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The baselines need to be amended and account must be taken of population changes in any calculation if there is to be a fair allocation and value for money around the country.</p><p> I wrote to determine whether the committee would consider this matter.  What is being examined at the moment is exclusively a revaluation of LPT.  Projecting that revaluation forward, the areas with stronger population growth will recover better and, due to the baselines, far more authorities will fall into the self-funded category and will have less discretion with the overall take.  The LPT will be undermined by the baselines.</p><p> I wrote because I was unsure as to whether this matter fell within our remit, but it is problematic.</p></speech>

Examining the current figures in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report is all well and good, but we need to know where the baseline is coming from, so it is relevant.</p></speech>

I do not believe Deputy Murphy meant that.</p></speech>

Galway County Council is third from the bottom in the league and the second largest county in the country.  We had two emergency meetings with departmental officials last week and the week before regarding this underfunding.  The officials have put on the record that they do not have money to do the roads.  Deputy Murphy referred to falling.  Without exaggerating, the roads are falling apart, but Galway is the third last.  It is a major problem.</p></speech>

We were called to an urgent meeting by the acting county manager, such is the situation on the ground.  I am just balancing what has been said.  Something is amiss.</p></speech>

While this is not the forum for the discussion, we can get into it in the March sitting.  There is capacity for local authorities to raise funding themselves.  In many cases, they reduce funding.  We cannot ignore the fact that the capacity exists and is often not used for other reasons.  There needs to be balance in this argument.</p></speech>

We will alert the Department to send a detailed briefing note to us on this topic well in advance of that so that we can be well armed with information when the issue is raised.</p> <p>  The next correspondence is No. 1046 from an individual dated 9 January 2018 regarding an alleged co-ordinated sabotage of a research programme focused on developing a comprehensive blueprint for the delivery of acute hospital health care in Ireland.  We have received earlier correspondence from this individual, with whom the Department of Health has also been in direct contact.  The essential matter appears to be related to policy and not within our remit.  I propose that we write to the individual explaining this and that the committee's consideration of the matter is now closed.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  To be straight up with members, I met this man at my constituency clinic last summer.  I was not able to progress the issue because I had difficulty with it.  Essentially, it is a health policy issue, so our committee does not have a role.  We will write to him with that response.</p> <p>  Next are Nos. 1048(i) and 1048(ii), received from Ms Laura Burke, director general of the Environmental Protection Agency, dated 24 January 2018, providing a response to our request for an explanatory note on an item of correspondence received by us from the Irish Environmental Forum.  The correspondence from the EPA refers to a report by the European Environment Agency in 2011 as well as other matters, including the review of the EPA in 2010.  The EPA has responded directly to the individual.  It attached in our correspondence a letter that it sent to the then Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht on 2 May 2013 regarding the same issue raised by the same individual.  If an issue arises, it is for that-----</p></speech>

Members have received a dossier that came from them also.  Some of these questions have been put to a Minister in the D&aacute;il but the unions involved are not content with the answers received.  There are issues regarding the underfunding of the pension scheme.  There is also an allegation that a ministerial order was disregarded.  They are calling for an independent investigation into the governance of the two CI&Eacute; pension schemes.  The issues appear to concern governance.  They are also seeking funding for independent legal advice.  There is a lot contained in the dossier members received.  I am seeking guidance from the Chairman as to how or if we can address this issue.  If we cannot do it, is there another mechanism by which this matter can be raised?</p></speech>

We have three reports before us today, the first of which is the accounts of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board for 2016.  This is a small operation with a clear audited opinion.  The other report is the 2015-2016 accounts for Mary Immaculate College in Limerick, which have a clear audited opinion and attention is drawn to recognition of the deferred pension funding and a standard for all universities and colleges.</p> <p>  The committee has received the financial statement for 2016 from the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.  This organisation maintains the register of tenancies and provides dispute resolution services for tenants and landlords.  The turnover of the organisation is &euro;10.2 million.  It is clear audited report but the Comptroller and Auditor General has drawn attention to &euro;2.1 million of legal fees where the relevant services had not been procured by way of competitive processes since 2011.  Before I came to the committee today I had a quick look at the accounts for the RTB.  The expenditure of the year 2016 was &euro;10.3 million and the single biggest cost was legal and professional fees of &euro;2.147 million.  The salary costs were only &euro;1.5 million.  That an organisation can spend 20% of its total income in one heading without going to a competitive tender, for the last seven years, is utterly unacceptable.  The committee will write to the RTB for a detailed note.  We will ask for a detailed note, company by company, to provide the total payments that were made in the financial statements of 2016, legal firm by legal firm as the case may be, or the other professional advisers.  I am sure we could include valuers also.  We will ask why there was not a competitive tendering process in recent times.  When we get this information, the committee will scrutinise it further.  The scale of this non-procurement relative to the size of the organisation is extraordinary. </p></speech>

I can read that paragraph for the committee, which states:</p><blockquote>In 2016 the RTB incurred expenditure totalling &euro;2.1 million in legal fees to a firm of solicitors where the relevant service had not been procured by way of a competitive process since 2011.  The service wasn't put out to tender in 2016 because substantial legislative change in 2015 and 2016, and our use of insourced legal staff from the firm to work alongside RTB staff, created the risk that we would lose accumulated knowledge by changing supplier at a time when we had significant operational deliverables such as the roll out of Rent Pressure Zones.<br /><br />The RTB is aware that this contract does not comply with guidelines and in 2017 intends to publish a request for tender under the Office for Government Procurement's legal services framework.</blockquote></speech>

It is an explanation, but a weak one to say that the board wants to stick with the professional advisers it has because of changes in legislation.  These advisers are almost embedded in the organisation at this stage, they have been working alongside it for so long.  We have covered it.  We will get the note.</p></speech>

It looks as if there are people from the particular firm effectively working with the board permanently and dealing with various issues on an ongoing basis.  We will come back to that.  That is agreed.</p> <p>  The next item is the current work programme.  Members have a copy.  We agreed to some of it at the last meeting.  When we go into private session I want to talk about the presentation from Brian Keenan on corporation tax receipts.  We will talk about that topic in private session in a moment, before the witnesses come in.  We will hold that over.  On the rest of the programme, there is a full meeting on the topic of public private partnerships, PPPs, alone on Thursday, 22 March.  I suggest that we bring in the Department of Education and Skills, Transport Infrastructure Ireland and the National Development Finance Agency, which manages these partnerships.  It is a subsidiary of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA.  There are some smaller PPPs under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality and the odd other small project, but the two big users of PPPs are the Department of Education and Skills and Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  We need a full meeting on PPPs.  We will have to rearrange the other items for a later date.</p></speech>

As the Chairman knows, Carillion has collapsed and the construction of a number of schools is on hold as a result.  In advance of that sitting and that hearing, can I ask Mr. McCarthy whether the Comptroller and Auditor General's office has done any work on public private partnerships in the past?  Does it have a document that it might be able to present to us?  We had some discussion on the issue before in respect of different Departments.  When the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform were before the committee there was some discussion on whether the processes in place to evaluate the effectiveness and value for money of public private partnerships are what they should be.  Obviously that will inform the questions which we put, but if there were any reports produced or research carried out in the past which would help us it would be useful if they were given to the committee.  I am not sure whether any special reports or reporting on PPPs were carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General's office, but if there were-----</p></speech>

It is necessary and timely.  Those two areas specifically are the most important in that regard.  Can we reverse into the whole issue of national procurement guidelines, tendering and so on in some way?  It is a topic which keeps surfacing but which we never delve into.  There are issues here in respect of costs to the taxpayer.  I do not think they are smooth.  They need to be changed.  "Tweaked" would not be a big enough word for me; they need to be changed substantially.  This one-size-fits-all approach with regard to national procurement rules is not working.  It is causing issues in some sectors, especially given the developing economy and the capital plan which is supposed to be announced every week.  Given the way the national planning framework is progressing that will not be announced for another year.  It is an apt time for us to discuss this issue in this format.  The Chairman might come back to me on that.</p></speech>

The second thing I will mention, so that it can be put on the schedule for some time in late March or early April, is that we must come back to the issue of the IT contracts in an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Some of the information which has come out is completely contrary to the evidence which we were given in this committee.  I have read the transcripts of our committee deliberations on this topic and, frankly speaking, some of the information which has come out in the D&aacute;il, which has come back to myself and other Deputies in replies to parliamentary questions, and which is now out in the public indicates that the scale of this issue is pretty huge.  We are dealing with large amounts of money.  We are dealing with a certain supplier.  This issue needs to be opened up and there needs to be accountability on it not just in respect of what is going on, but also in respect of why we were given certain answers in this room over which I would now have very serious questions.</p></speech>

We will have a few Accounting Officers here that day.  I have one question for the Comptroller and Auditor General.  A large proportion of the PPPs entered into in the past, and which are still in place, were in the area of water services under the local authorities.  They have now gone to Irish Water.  Can we get at that through this committee?  They were under the Department but are now under Irish Water.</p></speech>

The National Shared Services Office was set up in 2014 as an administrative office within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  From the beginning of this year, 2018, it has been a stand-alone office with its own Accounting Officer.  It is responsible for delivering suitable business services on a shared basis, mainly for other central Government Departments and offices.<br/><br/>The shared services office currently provides two main services: PeoplePoint,<b></b>which provides a human resources and pensions administration service; and the Payroll Shared Service Centre,<b></b>which provides a payroll and pension payment service.</p><p>A shared services financial management system is in development.  At the end of 2016, 39 departments had transferred HR functions to PeoplePoint and 43 had transferred their payroll functions to the Payroll Shared Services Centre, PSCC.</p><p> The 2016 appropriation account for the Vote for shared services records gross expenditure totalling &euro;36.4 million.  There was an underspend in the year of &euro;7.35 million.  That was 17% relative to the gross estimate.  This was primarily due to delays in planned transfers of staff from departmental payroll centres to PSSC, and delays in staff recruitment.  There has been a change in the presentation of the Vote for 2016.  In previous years, each of the main shared services was reported on as a separate expenditure programme.  For 2016, only a global programme is presented.  Pay costs totalling &euro;21.1 million accounted for 58% of the expenditure.</p><p> Turning to the chapter on the management of salary overpayments, acting as the agent for the bodies it serves, the shared services office processed payments of &euro;3.2 billion relating to 102,400 employees in 2016.  This involved running 2,438 weekly, 1,482 fortnightly and 192 monthly payment runs.  It should be noted that the payments made for the bodies concerned are charged back to the relevant appropriation account or financial statements of the bodies concerned, and are not a charge on the Vote for shared services.  During the audits of appropriation accounts for 2015, we noted a general increase in the level of salary overpayments being reported.  I decided to examine the matter across the board for 2016, focusing on how the shared services office managed and recovered salary overpayments.  The examination found that the office notified its client departments that overpayments totalling &euro;4.6 million were outstanding at the end of 2016.</p><p> In any large and complex payroll system, it is likely that some salary overpayments will occur, usually because it is necessary to process the payroll to meet pay day commitments before all information that might require a salary adjustment is available.  The examination found that late notification was the cause of the overpayment in the majority of cases reviewed.  In a sample examined, this mainly occurred because the PSSC were only notified weeks, and, in some cases, months, after an employee should have been put on a zero rate or a reduced rate of pay, for example, due to extended sick leave.  There can be late notification by the relevant employer department to PeoplePoint, and-or by PeoplePoint to PSSC.  Like any debt, it is important that salary overpayments are managed effectively, and repayment arrangements put in place promptly.  In figure 10.2, the chapter presents an overview of a framework for the effective management of overpayments.  The examination found scope for improvement in each aspect of this framework.</p><p> We found that, at the end of 2016, there were almost 650 identified overpayment cases where the amount of the overpayment had not yet been recorded.  The overpayment had arisen more than six months previously in a quarter of these cases.  Delays in identifying the value means the recovery process cannot begin, which may ultimately make it more difficult to recover the overpayment.  We also identified two ways in which overpayments arose, but which were not being correctly captured by shared services.</p><p> Even in cases where the overpayment amount had been calculated, there was evidence of delays in commencing recovery action.  At end 2016, there were more than 380 cases with an overpayment value of &euro;1.1 million outstanding for more than a year, with no recovery plan in place.  Based on the examination of a sample of cases, the average time taken to issue the first letter requesting repayment was 13 weeks.  We also found there was a lack of clarity between the NSSO and the departments being served around the division of responsibility for management of identified overpayment cases.</p><p> Recovery of overpayments is often by means of regular deduction from future pay.  There is no system in place to identify cases where deductions have ceased but the full amount of the overpayment has not yet been recovered.  The examination identified overpayments to four individuals where this had happened.</p><p> Overall, it was found that the systems in place did not provide the necessary information to allow for the effective management of overpayments.  It was not possible to readily generate an aged analysis of overpayments or to quantify the level of recovery.  Extensive manual intervention was required to calculate the amount outstanding at year end and the examination identified a number of errors in this calculation.  In addition, the reported year end figure did not include all overpayments, mainly due to a lack of clarity between the NSSO and client departments as to the respective responsibilities for particular types of cases.  The chapter makes a number of recommendations to improve systems and recovery processes, and to clarify responsibilities.  I am glad that the Accounting Officer accepted all of the recommendations, and will provide an update on their implementation.</p></speech>

I thank the committee also for the opportunity to make an opening statement.  As we have provided the committee with briefing material, I will endeavour to provide a relevant overview in my statement to make best use of the committee&rsquo;s time.</p> <p>  The matters being examined are chapter 10 of the Comptroller and Auditor General report 2016; which is titled Shared Services &ndash; Management of Salary Overpayments, and the Appropriation Account 2016, Vote 18, which is the Vote for the NSSO.  Before I give an outline of these matters, and as this is my first appearance before the committee as the Accounting Officer for the NSSO, I would like to set out the background of the office and the progress we have made in delivering our objectives in recent years.</p> <p>  The NSSO is a statutory office, established under the National Shared Services Office Act 2017, on 1 January 2018, when it became a separate Civil Service office, under the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The NSSO is contributing to the modernisation of corporate administration and professionalisation of these functions across the civil and public service.  The office is responsible for shared services provision across the entire Civil Service . This allows Departments and offices to focus on their core purpose of effective front-line service delivery.  While each sector in the public service has responsibility for implementing shared services, the NSSO supports the progression of the strategy across the public service by providing advice and guidance on best practice, creating professional communities for learning about shared services standards, policy development and research.</p> <p>  The Chairman will be familiar with MyPay in County Laois, which administers payroll for 28 local authorities and pensions for 15 local authorities, and HAP in Limerick, a housing assistance payment scheme.  A new multifunctional shared services centre for higher education is being established in Dublin.  Athlone has an administration centre for schools, and SUSI's data centre in Cork and its operation in Dublin administers the grant payment shared service for students.  The HBS is the provider of multiple shared services to the HSE and it has plans to consolidate administration further.</p> <p>  The NSSO has two shared services operations in four locations - Clonskeagh, Tullamore, Killarney and Galway - which comprise HR shared services, providing HR and pensions administration services to 34,500 civil and public servants, and payroll shared services, administering payroll, travel and expense, and pension payments to 124,500 civil and public servants.  A project is well under way to develop the shared services model for financial management and this will go live in mid-2018.  As articulated by Secretary General, Mr. Robert Watt, during previous sessions with the committee, the Government must invest to deliver cost and efficiency benefits, and shared services is an intrinsic part of that transformation of strategy.</p><p>Since 2012, the Government has invested &euro;32.3 million capital funding in technology, facilities and consulting costs for HR and payroll shared services.  While this is still at an early stage of maturity, the savings estimated for HR and payroll shared services to date are &euro;21 million and it is expected to deliver &euro;13 million annually, as these centres are fully established.</p><p> In addition to cost savings and improved effectiveness arising from standardised processes across the Civil Service, other benefits include the following.  Payroll shared services has replaced 18 payroll offices around the country that had different licensing and versions of payroll systems with one shared service centre on a single technology platform administering payroll, pensions, and travel and expenses one way across Government.  In 2016, payroll shared services made 2.7 million payments to the value of &euro;3.24 billion.  This increased to &euro;4.7 billion in 2017 and will increase further in 2018 now that all in-scope public service bodies have transitioned their payroll and expenses to the NSSO.  HR shared services responded to 77,466 calls and closed 215,268 cases in 2016.  In 2017, this increased to 86,028 calls and 231,289 closed cases.  This level of service delivery was acknowledged with the awarding of the CCMA 2015 Shared Services Award to PeoplePoint while the Civil Service Innovation Award went to the PSSC in the same year.</p><p> A further &euro;42.7 million is the estimated capital investment required to establish finance shared services.  The development of a new finance technology solution for Government is well under way.  A single finance technology platform will replace 31 financial management and reporting systems across Government Departments and offices and facilitate transaction processing in the new finance shared services operation in the NSSO.  When fully established, finance shared services will deliver a sustainable reduction in the annual cost of Government financial management of approximately &euro;15.4 million annually from 2021 through a reduction in the cost of support for finance technology, and a reduction in the resources required to provide financial management processing.</p><p> Since 2014, the NSSO has delivered many benefits for the Civil Service.  These include the introduction of one set of standard HR and pension processes, applied consistently, based on common HR policies.  These standard processes are eliminating local interpretation and thereby increasing fairness for employees.  Civil servants can access HR and pension services through a much wider range of channels, including the first online system, giving them easier and faster access to important information on entitlements and services.  For example, the HR portal receives over 300,000 visits per month.  HR data analytics are more readily available to management on a Civil Service-wide basis.  The first online system for public service travel and expenses claims was introduced, with payments processed within a week.  Online payslips are provided to all payees and there is immediate access to payroll information, including downloadable P60 forms.  This is a significant change to the hard-copy payslips and paper-based receipts of the past.</p><p> Insights gained through shared services informed the development of Government policies, such as absence, leave and the recoupment of overpayments.  Improved technology has resulted in automation in several areas, including the updating of personal information, for example annual leave, removing the need for repeated manual entry on the HR system.  Almost 1.5 million annual leave updates have been recorded in four years and further automation is on the way.  A single definitive source of information can be utilised for many purposes that can help the Government with the implementation of strategic changes and the development of data driven, evidence-based policy formulation.  Shared services continues to have a positive impact by creating dedicated specialist teams whose focus is solely on service quality through process improvement, technology and digitisation.  Our team is building expertise and competencies in complex large-scale transformation programme management, service and quality management, lean thinking and digital and technology innovation.</p><p> As with any organisation on this scale and at such an early stage of maturity, progress has not been without its issues.  It is reasonable to expect that challenges and corrections are needed as part of the set-up and stabilisation period.  As with other shared service organisations in the public and private sectors, this has also been the case for the NSSO.  We have encountered and solved a number of issues and learned some lessons.</p><p> I turn now to address the Comptroller and Auditor General Report 2016, Chapter 10 - Shared Services &ndash; Management of Salary Overpayments.  I start by thanking the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General for its valuable assistance in preparing this report to deal with complex issues, which I will now articulate as follows.  The committee should note that the Comptroller and Auditor General report accepted the inevitability of salary overpayments, given the scale and complexity of the payments involved and it acknowledged that there are many causes for overpayments.  I stress that the NSSO is very aware of its responsibility for the stewardship of public moneys.  When any overpayment occurs, the NSSO pursues the recovery of those moneys as soon as possible in a standard way for all staff.  In the response to the Comptroller and Auditor General report, it was noted that the value of overpayments in 2016 represents just 0.3% of the pay bill, confirming that 99.7% of the pay bill is being administered effectively.  I also welcome that the Comptroller and Auditor General noted in his report that the audits of those bodies did not find any material errors in the payroll charges.  Of course we would like to eliminate all overpayments, but we do not operate in a perfect world where every pay impact is notified in time to administer prior to the payroll run.  Adjustments to salaries are always needed, be it public or private sector.  An overpayment occurs when a staff member is paid more than his or her entitlement.  Overpayments to staff of salary, allowances and expenses can and do occur because of late notification, after the payroll closed and the file has issued to the bank for payment.</p><p> I confirm that the NSSO agreed to all the recommendations in the report from the Comptroller and Auditor General on the overpayment of salaries to civil and public servants and has commenced implementation of actions required.  As well as accepting all recommendations in the report, we outlined that a number of actions would be taken.  Since the last quarter of 2017, a monthly report on overpayments issues to each finance officer.  This shows the current balance outstanding on plans in recoupment, the value collected on all plans "year to date", and the list of all active overpayment cases.  This provides the finance officer with all the information required.  The decision for off pay cases remains with each Accounting Officer.  Responsibility for legacy cases is being progressed and a statement on responsibility will be inserted into the service management agreement for 2018.  In the Comptroller and Auditor General report it was noted that there was a delay in recovering overpayments.  I confirm to the committee that just over &euro;2 million was collected in 2016 and the estimate for 2017 is higher.  A revision to the recoupment circular in May 2017 allows for recovery of the full value of an overpayment within a month in circumstances where a staff member has been overpaid for a period of five days or less.  This has resulted in a reduction in the time taken to process overpayments.</p><p> The reform of sick leave in the public service, while creating significant savings and standardisation of administration and elimination of legacy issues, has meant that staff are reaching sick leave thresholds earlier which increases the risk of a pay adjustment not being notified in a timely manner.  Shared services is reliant on employees and managers notifying sick leave on the first day of occurrence.  Late or delayed notification results in overpayments.  Regular communications were issued by the NSSO to Civil Service staff to notify them of their obligations and an intensified information campaign is also planned for 2018 with local HR.  Following a comprehensive analysis of the root cause of overpayments in 2017, a review of pay impact processes in the NSSO including greater automation is under way.  This will help to reduce and eliminate any delays in the NSSO.</p><p>Furthermore, internal organisation changes are planned for the end of the second quarter of 2018 to centralise the calculation of overpayment values, in order to shorten the time taken to agree the recoupment plan and start to recover the money.  Consequently, I believe the NSSO will reduce the number and value of overpayments further in 2018.</p><p> On the appropriation account published in 2017, I welcome the clear audit opinion given by the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of Vote 18 for shared services, which is subject to review today.  Since the NSSO was established on an administrative basis in 2014, I have worked to ensure that the NSSO operates effectively and efficiently and that the use of public resources is scrutinised and optimised to ensure best value for money for the Exchequer.</p><p> Notwithstanding that, there is an issue with under-expenditure in the Vote.  The reasons relate mainly to the ongoing project work we are delivering.  These projects are very significant.  The NSSO is leading a very significant transformation programme across Government.  There is a balance between maintaining the project pace within an acceptable level of risk while ensuring delivery and value for money.  Our best attempt to forecast may require adjustment if a risk arises.  In 2016, the underspend was declared and surrendered to the Exchequer in a timely manner.  We are aware that, for 2016, there was a significant underspend as set out in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  As an office, we are very conscious of ensuring we set realistic forecasts and adjust as soon as possible on an ongoing basis, consistent with public financial procedures.</p><p> Shared services contribute to the modernisation of the civil and public service.  They create capacity to build a clear strategy for HR, payroll and finance and improve the capability and professional skills of our staff.  By operating a single standard way of working, the NSSO is able to contribute strategically and respond quickly to new and emerging requirements such as when a new Government Department is created.  Shared services are about standard processes supported by self-service technology.  It is a balancing act, investing to reduce costs and demonstrating efficiencies and improvements while at the same time changing responsibilities and accountabilities.  While making these changes, issues such as overpayments are amplified by the centralisation of data and the transparency that shared services bring to such matters.</p><p> Before I conclude, I acknowledge and thank my staff who have really got behind this major change programme and worked hard and long hours to deliver it.  Without their dedication and focus, the NSSO could not have achieved these milestones reached so far.  I also thank past members of the shared services steering board and programme boards for providing their support and time to assist the delivery of this ambitious programme of change.  I am confident that further improvements currently underway will result in a positive impact on managing overpayments more effectively.  I will answer any question the Chairman or members of the committee may have.</p></speech>

I think it is their first time here.  From a general point of view, it is a first for us too.  I have a number of questions.  In Ms Murphy-Fagan's contribution, she said that the organisation and its process is pretty new.  She said a number of lessons have been learned but did not outline what they are.  What are they, in order of priority?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-01a.129" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Hilary Murphy-Fagan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018020100002#H00600"><p>Having implemented two of the three major programmes, we have learned and done well with strong governance for the programmes and delivery of the change.  One of the biggest lessons was the impact of the change and the requirement to support the change management in each public service bodies, PSBs, and to support users with the system.  While we have communicated and developed communication materials that were disseminated in various PSBs, we have learned that we need to do even more of that in the future.  We have taken that lesson as it relates to financial management shared services and really increased the level of engagement, communication and awareness for financial management.  That has been a big lesson because there is an impact on the end user when one moves to a shared services model, particularly with the difference in responsibilities and accountabilities because they change when one moves to a shared services model.</p> <p>  The second lesson is that we have robust business cases in every case.  That was a requirement for the Government to make a decision to implement this change.  We did not start the benefits management and tracking as early as we could have.  We now track our benefits which I was able to insert into my opening statement.  When it comes to financial management, we will have a benefits statement which will be signed and agreed with each Accounting Officer before we start the transition to the final shared services.  We will make sure that we monitor that.  A last point, despite the best attempts, efforts and experience of my staff and the competencies and capabilities they have gained in the past year, is that with any large-scale transformation programme, while there are significant benefits, there are also risks.  We have to consider how we manage those risks and look for certain risks that maybe, with the wisdom of hindsight, we could have dealt with sooner.  We will certainly look at that in the future.</p></speech>

We constantly monitor and report on our performance against service level targets.  We have a service management agreement in place with each body.</p><p>We monitor our customer service through satisfaction and we have a complaints procedure that we monitor for complaints as well but, as with any service organisation, and particularly at our very early stage of maturity, we can always do better.

Two years later, overpayments amounted to &euro;4.6 million.  Ms Murphy-Fagan stated overpayments will reduce in 2018 but they have the opposite trajectory.  Given such a trajectory, why is Ms Murphy-Fagan confident that she will be able to turn the ship around?  What has changed?</p> <p>  For example, I was contacted by somebody on a matter of no real issue in which there was a very small sum involved.  Before the last election, there was a private secretary who, obviously, received an allowance for that role.  Two years later, he was contacted to pay back a small amount of money.  That is not the issue.  The issue was it took two years.  He did not even realise he was overpaid.  In fact, he was only contacted recently.</p></speech>

The data is not comparable in that we were servicing a much smaller number of client bodies in 2014 than at the end of 2017.  For the Departments that transitioned later during that phase, they themselves continue to manage their overpayments and they also had their payrolls - they themselves were processing payrolls and administering payroll.  When one looks at the data, I can understand the question.  However, it is a moving target because the number of bodies we service is different now.</p></speech>

One was implemented then.  Then, in May of 2017, further revisions to that were made, following the experience from the NSSO of recovering the money and following feedback from the client bodies and the staff who received overpayments themselves.  That has brought a number of clarifications which is helping to eliminate any disputes because it is very clear on what the responsibility of the NSSO is and what the responsibility of the individual employee, if he or she received an overpayment, is.</p></speech>

Assuming that the local HR agrees that the recoupment should proceed, there is then a notification process to the individual.  There are two letters that issue to the individual in that regard which provide an opportunity for the person, I suppose, if he or she has a query on the amount or a question around the speed or otherwise of the recovery plan, to engage with shared services.  It does afford that opportunity for engagement by the individual to agree the recoupment plan.  Our policy is for 8% of gross pay to be recouped within a 12 month period at the outset.  Most of our overpayments fall within a band of &euro;1,000 or less.  I suppose the incidence of dispute within individual cases probably is relatively low but it could happen.</p></speech>

There is confusion over who is doing what.</p></speech>

Certainly, there was confusion at a point in time, particularly for the bodies that transferred earlier.  Those cases came across to the NSSO.  For Departments that transferred more recently to us, first of all, we have clarified in the service management agreement exactly what the responsibilities are in relation to legacy cases.  Second, for those cases that may be sitting with a payroll office in a Department if they are transitioning in, they are clear that it is their responsibility to calculate the value of the overpayment.  Given that earlier I stated that all of the Departments in scope have now transitioned in to us, the issue of legacy cases is a very small one at this stage.  We have a small number of legacy cases.</p></speech>

To be honest, it was not a good experience in that they felt many of the staff were demoralised in respect of a number of issues.  I will outline them to the witness and she can respond because, obviously, we must have both sides of the equation.  They had difficulty explaining a number of issues for many of the people the office serves.  There were issues relating to overpayments, delays and mistakes with pension payments, which had not happened previously, delays of two to three months with the payment of increments, which had not happened previously, delays with leave applications, particularly applications for parental leave for some reason, and mistakes and misunderstandings regarding starting pay when people get promoted or moved.  A specific issue raised with me, which is quite unique, relates to the early shutdown of payroll before Christmas, which meant some people on lower wages did not get the overtime payments they were depending on for Christmas.  Another relates to delays in issuing P60s.  The Chairman asked about that earlier, probably for the same reason.  Does the witness wish to comment on those issues?  Are they accurate?</p></speech>

Obviously, as another stakeholder I would always welcome any evidence they might be able to provide regarding how we could improve our service.  I said at the outset that this is a very large-scale shared service operation and it is still relatively immature.  Second, service is utterly important to us.  It is our reputation and we are constantly striving to improve it.  We have a very strong governance process.  We have a customer services group which has representation from HR managers and finance officers from the various Departments we service.  My colleague, Ms Lyons, is on that customer services group and it is chaired by the chief human resources officer for the Civil Service because shared services are part of that HR strategy.  The group meets monthly to look at what the top issues are.  Service management meetings are held very regularly to examine what issues are arising for staff or management, to understand the root cause of those issues and to see how we can improve those.  We keep a log or record of everything.  We look at what issues we are able to resolve and close and what issues remain open.  It is really quite a robust system around service management.  We report on our performance against service targets so it is very transparent.  We do not hide anything.  It is very transparent for everybody on how we are doing.</p></speech>

Given the number of people the office is dealing with, we are bound to get information from them.  When one centralises a system such as this, particularly with regard to HR, it is a system and process where one must follow rules and logic.  I am a former IT manager so I understand the process by which it all must work.  I had to centralise systems in my time.  When one is dealing with HR issues and financial payments, particularly HR issues, there seems to be an almost impersonal element to it that needs to be flagged or dealt with in some way from one occasion to the next.  I suggest that some pathway is created whereby individuals who have a personal or a once or twice in a work career issue, instead of just being identified as a case number, have a way in which the issue can be pushed up the line and processed relatively quickly through the HR functions and the organisations.  I have heard that cases involving an exceptional issue are not being dealt with quickly enough.  The witness might accept my suggestion.  Trust me, I am hearing that from the people to whom I have been talking.</p> <p>  I have a final couple of questions.  One of them is somewhat out of left field.  Obviously, there are capital outlays relating to where the office is going in respect of the financial management of bodies.  Financial management is going to be the third leg of the organisation.  Personally, I believe the office should consolidate what it is doing first.</p><p>Moving into that space is probably the right thing to do.  I have rolled out massive large-scale projects in a previous life.  The NSSO needs to bed down and then move on again.</p><p> As regards underspend, it would be preferable for an organisation such as the NSSO not to have an underspend, given the scale of its operations, because it will be fighting for money for the financial management leg of its work.  Why was there a significant underspend?</p></speech>

The first is that a plan for the transition migration of a payroll into my office is only a plan and, as we get deeper into the preparation and level of readiness for transfer, things may arise such that we have to change the sequencing of Departments.  A Department may have to come ahead of one that was in the original plan, and that is always open to change, or things may have to be slowed down to ensure we manage any risks we identify.  A delay of transition or migration creates an underspend on our vote because we do not recruit the staff we intended to or transfer staff to our office who were doing that work previously, for example.  However, the corollary is that where we have an underspend, that pay bill spend is on the corresponding Vote and, therefore, is neutral overall but it shows up in my Vote if we have a delay.</p> <p>  On the capital expenditure side, the underspend is primarily due to the very large finance shared services programme.  Approximately 50% of the capital cost has already been spent for that programme but there have been delays.  Having followed due process in respect of procurement, there was an initial delay in finalising the contract with the provider or system integrator, which delay had a knock-on effect in respect of our Estimate for the following year, which had already been created.  It is not a matter of an overall overspend but rather is more of a timing issue because we will actually spend-----</p></speech>

The responsibility as to how that happens and the break-off point between the organisation and the service provision by the NSSO needs to be very clearly defined because one could end up with a "who is blaming who" situation.</p> <p>  The service that is provided in the Chairman's constituency, which I opened while Minister-----</p></speech>

Late notification of requests for payment reductions was one of the main reasons for the majority of overpayments.  Officers appointed at a grade of assistant principal or higher are entitled to 30 days annual leave but PeoplePoint is currently allocating 32 days leave to them.

Prior to 2011 for staff at those grades, the entitlement was for 32 days.  That has changed to 30 days.  Our detailed analysis has demonstrated that a small percentage, not a large percentage, had been given more annual leave than they were entitled to.  It was approximately 4% to 5% and less at principal officer grade.  The National Shared Services Office, NSSO, has been in contact with those staff and local human resources to rectify that.  It applies to a small number of people.</p></speech>

In this case, we are looking to rectify the annual leave balance.  We have already done that on the system.  It was done straight away.  We now need to focus on where we recover those balances where people had too much.  We do that in a very collaborative way with the individuals involved.</p></speech>

It would generally be an agreed amount per pay cycle.  Most of our overpayments are of a value of less than &euro;1,000, so it would generally be recouped within 12 months.</p> <p>  I wish to assist on the matter of annual leave.  A certain number of those cases were found to be correctly entitled to the level of leave because of arrangements on secondment for various organisations.  Local human resource personnel confirmed that a certain percentage were correct.  As Ms Murphy-Fagan indicates, the other cases are recouping through annual leave arrangements the excessive annual leave.</p></speech>

Part of what we do now is to focus on how to prevent overpayments happening in the first place.  This concerns awareness of what late notification can mean.  As we mentioned, we intend to re-run a campaign with individual employees and within our shared service centre.  There will a full process review of any procedures that are pay-impacted to ensure we reduce any cause of delay or error within our own shared service operation.</p></speech>

This perhaps links to the Deputy's question about whether somebody has a dispute on the amount of overpayment, as we must be able to show the calculation of how the overpayment amount was arrived at.  We know we have had delays in reaching those values and that is one area of improvement we are working on.  We are seeking to centralise how we calculate those values to speed up the process internally.  Once the value is identified, we are into the process I outlined earlier of going back to a local HR person to confirm that the recoupment is in order for proceeding and notification with employees.  There is a two-letter notification process with employees.  We are very much focused on how to cut out any of the delaying steps along the way.</p> <p>  We have much improved internal reporting.  Ms Murphy-Fagan referred to reports going externally to our client base, but within our own walls, we have significantly improved reporting for ourselves for management information.  On a weekly basis we can see how cases are moving through the system and at each stage, from value assessment through to notification and a recoupment plan being put in place, along with the targeting of possible delays.  We can give the committee assurance on what we have done since the results of 2016 and through 2017 in terms of sharpening and improving our process.</p></speech>

I reiterate for the reassurance of the committee that we are very much focused on a weekly basis on reviewing exactly where cases are at for different statuses and ensuring they are moving forward.

We put a plan in place and scheduled Departments to migrate to us at certain times each year.  We have completed all the migrations at this stage, so we are talking about this after the fact.  The surrender, in terms of HR and payroll, will not happen again because all the Departments have now transitioned across to us.  However, from time to time we have to review the plan to make sure that the pace is correct and to make sure that there are no risks.  If there is a bigger risk we may have to change the sequence and bring a different Department forward instead.  We may have planned to take in a Department and transfer the staff who carried out the work in that Department to us, but if the sequence changes we do not take those staff in.  We planned for that in our forecast.  That might create an underspend on the pay bill.  However, the corresponding Department will still have to pay those staff.  That is why I say that we do not pay them, but those staff may still be paid.</p> <p>  We may delay recruiting staff, if we do not need them until a certain date, because of the change in the plan.  We may not get the staff in on time, which would create an underspend in the pay bill.  At the end of each year, before the start of the next year, we try to give our very best estimate of the level of work, the timing of it and the transitioning.  From time to time that has had to change for risk management purposes.  That is now complete for HR and payroll.</p></speech>

We make sure that we have very robust programme management.  Both Accounting Officers - myself and the Accounting Officer for the relevant Department - have to sign off on gateway controls each and every month before we go live.  If for any reason something significant arises which would create a risk for us to proceed then we may have to stall, but at this stage I have no reason to believe that we will not go live and on time this year, as planned.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Finance, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the President's establishment, the Exchequer accounting and superannuation accounting is all coming to us mid-year, and represents the beginning of our finance shared services centre.

In the course of that transition there was an arrangement made between their union and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine that they would be available to take the voluntary redundancy.  They had transitioned to the NSSO and were now on our payroll so it was agreed that we would process the administrative arrangements around that redundancy and then make a recoupment request to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  That happened after year-end, so the cost is represented in our 2016 account, with the subsequent recoupment to appear in later accounts.</p></speech>

Looking at the cost saving side of the business case, those costs primarily arise from either savings on technology and the IT side, bearing in mind that there are 31 financial management and reporting systems across all the bodies that we will provide finance shared services to on one single platform.  All those systems are currently being maintained.  When finance shared services goes live, the savings will come partly from the savings on the IT and technology side and also by savings in the numbers of staff required to carry out the finance administration.  Those staff will be reabsorbed within their own Departments to do different work and other work.</p></speech>

On finance shared services we have not started.  On the HR side, through the benefits realisation assessment, we were able to establish that we have made savings.  Staff who previously carried out that work have been redeployed to do different work.  If the Department had a new resource requirement, instead of going to recruit somebody, those staff could move in and fill those positions.  The staff are redeployed either to new roles or to existing roles elsewhere.</p></speech>

It is something that I would certainly consider doing in the future.

In some instances, it is not.  I would like to mention another issue that comes up.  I know we are all in a modern world now.  The NSSO deals with pensions for retired civil servants.  Some of them may be of a particular age.  They might not have the level of computer literacy needed to print off P60s and payslips.  Do elderly people have the option of continuing to receive payslips and other information in hard copy?</p></speech>

There was a very small project team in 2013, when the operation started to deliver services in Clonskeagh in Dublin, but staff numbers started to grow when payroll services commenced at the end of 2014.  As we expanded the service offering to new Departments, the number of staff working in shared services increased.  Shared services is a specialism that requires clear accountability for all the people who receive the services and the Departments that are served.  It also requires clear funding arrangements, a very strong customer focus and a continuous improvement focus on operations and technology.  I suppose that is different from the business of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which is primarily a policy Department.  The NSSO is more than twice the size of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We always envisaged that when the shared services centres got up and running, it would not make much sense to stay within the Department in light of the lack of synergy.  We are the administration office.</p></speech>

I do not have a difficulty with the use of the word "corporate" but it suggests something that is not normally used in the world of public services.  I am looking then at what happened in Britain where the services were put into a shared service office to centralise HR, payroll and related services and that was then outsourced and, in essence, privatised.  It became profitable to do it then.  Once one has set up a unit like that, has shared services and does what Ms Murphy-Fagan says she wants to do, namely modernise corporate administration, the next logical step for some is to outsource and privatise the service.  Is that something that could be envisaged in this State if we follow the logic of what happened in Britain?  I am trying to understand Ms Murphy-Fagan saying we are behind the curve while looking at what has happened in most European countries.  Where these service offices were set up, almost all of them were outsourced over time.</p><p>If my comment is there, it is around the use of shared service models.  I was not referring to outsourcing.</p><p> The Deputy is asking me to comment on a policy matter that at some point of time in the future but that is not necessarily within my own-----</p></speech>

I am making an observation from my own perspective.  I think I am being logical when I say that if this has happened in other European member states, and in fact one newspaper report states: "Government, SSCL and arvato, which is the company that got the contract, are all to blame for shared services centres failing to achieve value for money."  So far from achieving savings in Britain, it cost them more and eventually the government privatised them.</p> <p>  The reason that I raise this is that it is a matter for policy makers.  Obviously it is a matter for the Minister.  I am not going to put Ms Murphy-Fagan in the position to comment on policy.  We have come through a number of  meetings where services have been outsourced and there is an arm's length between us who hold those who spend taxpayer's money to account and Accounting Officers.  The Accounting Officers will tell us that there is a service level agreement.</p></speech>

Each business case was evaluated on its own merit.  If it did not make sense it did not go ahead.  In fact there was one service area that was looked at with the Department of Finance for banking shared services, and we did a feasibility study but we found that the cost benefit did not stack up so we did not proceed with it.  In each case we look at what services could be in the scope and if those services could be provided in a shared services environment with technology, what would the service quality be and what would be the cost savings to the taxpayer if we proceeded.  In each and every case, we go through that process.  It is a very rigorous, robust evaluation process.</p></speech>

The report by the Comptroller and Auditor General focused on the need for action and activity in particular areas.  Reporting was one area that the overpayments working group had recommended along with a more robust root cause analysis of what causes overpayments.

What we are looking at is a reorganisation internally to centralise the calculation of values.  It has been a distributed function within our payroll shared services centre.  We recognise that it can cause delay where it is spread across a number of different functions.  We intend to centralise it so that we reduce and eliminate delay in the calculation of values.  That is key to the recoupment process commencing.  Until a value is confirmed, the recoupment process cannot commence.</p></speech>

We do not need an IT system to tell us all that.  There has to be a value before it can be recouped.</p> <p>  The weakness identified was the IT system as I understand it - the Chairman is shaking his head.  I will just put my question.  It showed a snapshot in time as opposed to the history.  For example, cases were closed and nobody knew if the repayments had stopped or not.  The snapshot in time was a problem.  It was not giving an overall picture.  I would have thought that as the office went for a very expensive IT system, one should be able to see that.</p> <p>  Another thing is the confusion.  Ms Lyons has told me the confusion is gone.  Certain Departments thought the office was looking at the legacy cases and other Departments thought it was their role, for different reasons.  That confusion is gone, is it?  They all know what they are doing now.  Going back, then, to the snapshot in time, the IT system required a lot of physical inputting of data.  Can Ms Lyons clarify whether that has changed?</p></speech>

One is picked up by what the Deputy referred to earlier in terms of improved reporting, looking at where cases are in terms of status and balances outstanding.  That will improve that picture and it will be an improvement for finance officers to be able to track as well.</p> <p>  The other thing to remember is that not all the payrolls were within the shared service centres.  The reconciliation between what was being recouped in a Department and not necessarily through a payroll that was being administered by the shared service caused another layer of reconciliation challenge.  Now we have all the payrolls within the shared service so we have a better view end to end.  We would, therefore, be able to see where a recoupment stopped and why, and to follow it up fairly quickly.  The situation in 2016 certainly presented more challenge in trying to manage it as an end to end process.  The full migration of payrolls will improve that.</p></speech>

On the cases that were closed - I am reading from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on page 148 - in 2016, 4,419 overpayment cases with a value of &euro;4.4 million were closed.  However, due to the limitations on the information available, the examination cannot quantify how much of this amount had been recovered at the year end.</p></speech>

When we get to this point in the meeting, a lot of the questions will have been asked.  I am generally supportive of shared services and consolidation rather than fragmentation.  It always comes with a health warning, however.  We want it to be effective as well.  Some of the examples Ms Lyons has drawn attention to where there is consolidation, such as the likes of the housing assistance payment, HAP, shared service centre in Limerick - I think it should have been left out.  Sometimes they do not work very effectively.</p> <p>  There is a customer services group and obviously that gives some sort of indication of how well the service is working.

We get feedback through that survey.  We also have a complaints procedure.  We prefer to hear that we are doing well - and we get feedback to say we are providing a very good service - but in those cases where we do not satisfy or make people happy, we have a complaints procedure which is used.  However, the volume is very small.  I think last year I looked at 80 complaints into the HR shared service centre, of which 50 were upheld and 30 were not.  We also have the contact centres so staff can call in if they are not happy.  They can give the case reference.  They can also talk to somebody on the phone who is really quite knowledgeable about the issues to see can we help them.</p></speech>

If they were physically located in the same building, they might have gone down the corridor and handed in a piece of paper and asked for something to be done for them.  It is the model of shared services, I suppose, in that we are very much part of the Civil Service.  We are civil servants providing this service to everybody.  We are just remote.  People cannot see us but we actually have people coming to visit our offices on a very regular basis.  Our doors are open to showing people what our offices look like.</p></speech>

It was a greenfield site in Clonskeagh in Dublin.  It opened its doors in 2013, a time when there was a lot of pressure on resources everywhere.  A decision was taken that we would recruit on a voluntary basis from the Civil Service.</p></speech>

The line manager still approves certain things so if I want to apply to take parental leave, I would put that message online and the system will automatically route it through workflow to my line manager who will give approval.

We are looking at the next generation of technology that will give much more self-service functionality to users of the system.  The technology landscape is moving to mobile devices and the cloud.  We know we will have to upgrade and change the systems we have today, as users demand different things.  The system we are using is a HR management system that was procured in 2004.  Each Department used it previously but we have reconfigured it to work in a shared services environment.  We did not put in new technology for HR.  We had to put in technology for document management, case management, the contact centre, and the telephony system but the core HR system was not new.</p> <p>  When it came to payroll, most of the payroll offices were already using a similar system albeit on different versions.  We deployed the latest version with self-service technology features.  That is the system we are using in the payroll but it is different.  They are not one and the same.</p></speech>

I cannot give the Deputy the 2016 figure.  On the 2017 figure, I think some 5% of staff left us during the year to go outside the Civil Service.  Other staff moved because they got promoted to other roles, either within our office or in other Departments across the Civil Service.  Those are 2017 data.  I do not actually have the data in front of me.  We do have a level of churn but that is also not unusual for our business.  The Civil Service had a level of churn also so we just monitor the situation.

Everyone gives an estimate, which is subject to verification, after the end of the year.  I believe Ms Murphy-Fagan has said she has already sent information to the Departments.  She is reasonably confident about what has been produced.  I am sure she had a health warning on her statement and that it was not absolute.  Could she just outline what her office has done because it has produced some information?</p> <p>  That leads to my next question.  Given that the office will be getting its Estimate of expenditure approved for 2018 any day now, I expect that, in calculating that figure, the NSSO should be able to estimate what it believes the figure for outstanding payments will be at the end of 2018.  I am now moving on much further.  If one is coming in to get the group of Votes for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform next month, this month or on another occasion, it is logical to be asked about this.  I refer to where one is looking for the Estimate figure for the office for the coming year - the Estimate for its Vote.  A level of overpayments will be in place for last year and one will have to know, in one's working papers, the estimated figure for 2018.  That is relevant to the Vote the office requires.  Therefore, I presume it will be possible for the office to give us some estimate.  I stress that it will be an estimate.  Ms Murphy-Fagan spoke about planning.  In my opinion, one cannot calculate one's Estimate for this year properly if one has not estimated where one believes one will be at the end of December.  Am I jumping the gun?</p></speech>

Service quality and accuracy is fundamental to our business.  Under our system, dedicated people take random cases that are closed every week and test 5% of all cases to check for accuracy, and whether they were processed correctly, whether all the procedural steps were taken, and whether they were uploaded to the correct document or system.  That is an important measure for us because it tells us about the quality of the service we provide.  Earlier I mentioned the ISAE 3402 international assurance standard of quality, which is the internal audit control test.  Our quality management data are consistent with what the external tests show and, therefore, we have a constant, reasonably high level of quality.  I do not say we fail to make errors but we have a fairly consistently high level of quality, which is important because our staff work hard on that</p></speech>

If a Department or an office transfers the function to the NSSO and 30 of its staff were involved in payroll and HR services, how do we know some of those posts have not been suppressed?  Some staff, for example, may be redeployed but if there is no redeployment and there is no work in the Department, some posts could be suppressed.  It is not up to the NSSO to check on the suppressed posts but this is one way of knowing whether the savings happen.  If the NSSO takes on numbers, there should be a reduction somewhere else.</p></speech>

Where staff used to do that work in a location and they cannot, or do not want, to transfer or it is a remote location such as Dundalk to Galway, we would look at the original pay bill for them and work out how many staff are still in that payroll function.
