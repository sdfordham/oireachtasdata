He is joined today by Ms Olivia Somers, senior auditor.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Kelly.</p> <p>  Are the minutes of the meeting of 29 March agreed?  Agreed.  No matters arise from them that will not also arise by way of correspondence or in the course of the meeting.</p> <p>  I want to move straight on to correspondence received since our last meeting.  There are three categories of correspondence, the first of which, category A, relates to briefing documents and opening statements and covers correspondence items Nos. 1226 and 1235 from Mr. Derek Moran, Secretary General of the Department of Finance, which enclose a briefing as well as an opening statement for today's meeting.  We will note and publish that.</p> <p>  Next is category B, correspondence from Accounting Officers following up on previous meetings of this committee.  The first item of correspondence is No. 1204B from Mr. William Beausang, assistant secretary at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, enclosing the circular requested by the committee regarding the publication of post-project reviews.  This also refers to public-private partnerships.  We had a brief discussion on this matter previously.  We will note and publish this correspondence.  All Departments have been instructed to carry out such reviews.</p> <p>  Next is No. 1207B from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, enclosing information requested by the committee regarding the waste directive and a judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union dated 26 April 2005.  It is a voluminous document at 68 pages.  We will note and publish it, and if anyone wishes to comment, he or she is free to do so.  It is an old document and members are free to use it in any way they choose after the meeting.</p> <p>  Next is No. 1209B from Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, dated 29 March, providing follow-up information requested by the committee on the funding of local authorities, matters related to housing and the cost of producing the national planning framework.  There is a substantial briefing document in this regard.  Deputies Cassells and Murphy wish to contribute.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-19a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1218" speakername="Shane Cassells" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018041900002#B00300"><p>The Chairman is quite right about this being a significant document.  It is a pity that much of this information was not provided at the time of the hearing, given that it was easily accessible to the officials concerned and would have been helpful in the course of the discussion on the day, since the questions posed could have been anticipated.</p><p>There is an overdependency on our rates system, as illustrated in the pie charts.  Now, 36% of local authority funding is dependent on commercial rates.  Due to the combination of the revaluation process that is taking place across the country and the equalisation process, whereby many urban areas are being brought up to county rates, major pressure is being placed on small businesses, yet these statistics show that this crutch is growing even larger.  I asked repeatedly on the day whether that was sustainable, but it is not.</p><p>Along with other Deputies, I asked about the <i>per capita</i>funding.  The graphs are very illuminating in this regard.  My county of Meath has one of the largest populations in the Dublin commuter area with nearly 200,000 people, yet we have the lowest <i>per capita</i>spend by a long way at &euro;522.  We are also the least staffed county.  These statistics are damning of the system and how it is funded and structured.  It is structured on an historical basis and did not keep pace with the population explosions of the 2000s.  It is a sad indictment of the Department as an institution that it has not been able to react to this situation.  It is an outdated Department when it comes to reacting to the pressures facing counties like Meath, Louth, Wicklow and Kildare.  The statistics show that.  If they had been available to us on the day, they would have given more credence to the arguments that we were making.  A spend of &euro;522 <i>per capita</i>is a sad indictment of the manner in which local government in County Meath and, indeed, other counties is structured.</p><p>Section 4 relates to direct build provision.  We debate the issue of housing day in, day out in the Chamber.  The statistics show that the level of provision is not meeting the crisis.  The front page of today's <i>Irish Independent</i>highlights this.  Some 2,100 homes have received full or partial approval from the Department and have still not proceeded.  That front page story is a sad indictment of where we are.</p><p>These statistics paint a very different picture than the spin and bluster with which the committee is being presented.  I reiterate the point that, when we deal with Departments, the full suite of statistics must be available to us so that we can do our job properly and hold people to account.  The statistics tell a different story of what is happening.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-19a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018041900002#B00400"><p>I echo many of those comments.  The counties of Meath, Kildare and Wicklow have a greater combined population than the whole county of Cork.  That is not appreciated.  The model for distributing resources dates back to four censuses ago and does not factor in more recent ones.  We were told on the day that questions could not be answered because the Minister was imminently going to make an announcement about a rebalancing and a more transparent approach to how local government funding would be allocated, but there has been no announcement.  Obviously, this is a critical point.</p> <p>  The document relates to a number of issues and we should probably hold it over.  For example, it has useful information on Irish Water and the 2015-21 business plan.</p><p>As we cannot interrogate Irish Water directly, we must have time to consider the information we have been given.</p><p> On the funding allocation to local authorities for unfinished estates, some of that money was to be recouped once the ghost estates were finished and sold and so on.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-19a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018041900002#C00900"><p>I wish to raise a more fundamental point in regard to this correspondence.  It is fair to say that when Accounting Officers come in and we put very detailed and specific questions to them, they will not always have the necessary information at their fingertips, so it is reasonable that follow-on information is sometimes needed.  Most are very helpful in that regard and we get the information very quickly.  There is a difference between such situations and Accounting Officers having basic information prior to meetings or, sometimes, purposely not having it so that we cannot discuss certain issues.  That makes the work of the committee very difficult.  This is not the first time for very simple, basic questions to be put on issues that the Accounting Officer should know and have anticipated or been given a heads-up are the type of issues we want to discuss.  However, when we ask the questions, the information is not available but we get a very comprehensive document afterwards.  As I have said previously, there is no point getting a comprehensive document afterwards when the issue is to be discussed on the day.  That is unfair to the committee.  Perhaps we should consider seeking more detailed notes in advance on key issues we know will be topical and the basis of the discussion.  That would be of assistance to the committee.  We receive many such documents afterwards, many of which answer the questions we want answered but not in a way whereby we can probe the Accounting Officers.  They leave the committee meeting and send on a detailed report.  We then read the report, criticise the officer and are upset and that is the end of it; we move on and the same thing happens again.  It is in our power to change that if we wish to do so.  If an Accounting Officer does not have the required information, he or she should be told to return to the committee the following week or whenever.  We may have to make examples of some Accounting Officers.  In fairness, most have the necessary information and there have been some recent examples of very good exchanges.  We need to manage the meetings a bit more and do more planning before witnesses come in.  This document from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is fantastic but it would have been great to have had the information before the meeting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-19a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1297" speakername="Kate O'Connell" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018041900002#C01000"><p>I support the comments made by Deputy Cassells on rates.  I am aware from my time on Dublin City Council that the over-reliance on commercial rates to fund the city's business has always been an issue.  There has been a lack of understanding of the pressures on small fledgling businesses.  Many of the vacant units in our large urban centres have been taken over by large multinationals rather than small indigenous artisan businesses because the rates bill in the first few years is an unwelcome bill which people cannot afford.  The emergence of many rates-exempt charity shops in smaller towns in rural Ireland shows that the cost of rates is a fundamental part of starting up a new business.  While I was on Dublin City Council, many were of the view that businesses would suck it up and get over it and that everyone in small business had plenty of money to pay bills.  We must be very conscious that if we continue on this trajectory, businesses such as Waltons will move online, leaving vacant units.  It is a bit late to have waited ten years to act.  One can see the evidence of it in the large urban centres.  I was recently in Tullamore, in which there has been an emergence of charity shops.  It is too late to act when the horse has bolted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-19a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018041900002#C01100"><p>I will not repeat points already made but I concur with my colleagues that the chapter is excellent and we must consider it.  On page 20 it states that a final breakdown of the direct build for 2017 is not yet available; it is currently being finalised and will be published.  We should seek that information before making any decision relating to the chapter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-19a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018041900002#C01200"><p>Members have raised a fundamental issue.  There have been a couple of examples of Departments sending us information a month after the meeting which should perhaps have been included in the briefing material made available prior to the meeting.  It was well flagged that we wanted to know the funding model for local authorities and local property tax, LPT, equalisation.  That information should have been in the original briefing note such that we could have debated it rather than it being sent to us some time later.  We have now been provided with the information.</p> <p>   A similar situation pertained at the meeting on public private partnerships, PPPs.  The witnesses had no information at the time but we are now receiving reams of pages.  How much of it is relevant is another point.  However, everything that has been sent to us to date on PPPs should have been available to us prior to the meeting.  We will come to that later on.</p> <p>  We have received a reply from the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, in respect of a report on our earlier committee report following our complaint that we were unhappy with the initial reply and would discuss it in detail.  We have now been provided with a huge amount of information.</p> <p>  As Chairman of the committee, I propose that we request the secretariat to examine information received after a meeting to see if it could reasonably have been provided before the meeting.  Issues will always emerge during the course of a meeting which could not have been foreseen.  Perhaps members could flag potential issues of interest to the secretariat in advance.  We might put in place a system to identify two or three topics which should be addressed in briefing material.  We may do that in regard to our work programme.  It is a point to which we must return.</p> <p>  As regards the document received from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, members have asked for further information on direct build.  Deputy Catherine Murphy asked about ghost estates and wants more information about recoupable money and whether that has been recouped.</p> <p>  I wish to have a more extensive note on the mortgage arrears resolution process and information on how many houses have been repossessed by each local authority.  Laois County Council has repossessed more houses in County Laois than banks have.  Most were voluntary surrenders whereby the occupants handed in the key but they still had to go through a legal process to complete that.  It is very widespread and involves people in social or affordable housing and various issues.  We must have those figures for each local authority.</p> <p>  I also wish to have information on the mortgage protection insurance charge to local authority borrowers for each local authority.  I have this week submitted a parliamentary question on that issue and have looked at it in the past.  The charge is several times more expensive than similar insurance available from the private sector.  I wish to have a full breakdown of the current arrangements in that regard and a comparison to the private sector offerings.</p> <p>  To follow on from Deputy Catherine Murphy's comment on ghost or unfinished estates, unfinished housing developments are dealt with on page 24.  Members may find it instructive that at 9 a.m. yesterday morning, I went into my local authority because Laois fared particularly badly in a report on the number of housing units in unfinished estates issued last week by the Department.  I went into my local authority to run through the report.  This is not about Laois; it is a general comment.  I told the director of services that it was the first time I had left a council building more confused than I was when I went in.  My confusion was caused by the different definitions of what constitutes an unfinished housing estate.</p><p>Sometimes, several different descriptions are used.  If an estate is half built and nobody has occupied a unit, and it is just fenced off, it is not included in the statistics because there is nobody in it.  If unfinished houses are fenced off on an estate in which units are occupied, that is not considered an estate unfinished because remedial work has been done, to which the Deputy referred.  Houses are almost complete on some estates but a number of local authorities take the view that they are only waiting to be sold and, therefore, the estates are finished, even though they are not.  We need a clear definition and explanation regarding what an unfinished estate means.  It means something different every time the question is asked.  The committee wants a detailed note on this.  There are myriad descriptions such as ghost estates, unfinished estates and incomplete estates which confuses the public.</p></speech>

That applies both to performance and the financial information that they provide.  It touches on what we will talk about later in respect of fiscal transparency and so on.  Having good information in accessible forms that means something to users of the information is probably a legitimate and reasonable concern of the committee.</p></speech>

Mr. O Foghl&uacute; believes that his treatment by Deputy MacSharry at the meeting was unfair and it was suggested that Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; had not honoured a commitment in 2014 to revert to the committee on matters relating CIT discussed at a meeting in May 2014.  No. 1127, dated 12 April 2018, is also correspondence from Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, which includes a copy of the letter sent to the committee in 2014 in which he addresses the matters relating to CIT.  Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; asks the Deputy to acknowledge that his remarks in relation to an alleged non-response by Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; were not accurate and that the remarks about his attendance at a particular party were unwarranted.  Does the Deputy wish to respond?</p></speech>

We tend to qualify an apology in advance if anybody feels threatened by that.  All questions at the meeting were relevant to the subject of the day, which was public private partnerships, PPS.  I asked about two PPPs at CIT, including the national maritime college.  I wanted to know specifically about the contract manager and his qualifications.  From my research, when a question was asked about this at the committee in 2014, an answer had not come back.  My search did not show that.  I appreciate that Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; did send it in.  Now that I have seen it, it makes the relevant questions all the more pertinent because that document was prepared following the meeting in 2014 and it alluded to the 37 years' experience of the particular individual specifically relevant to PPPs.  That is simply not the case.  This person was appointed as a department head in 2004 and had a science background.</p> <p>  With regard to the questioning, we had established the last day that there were serious problems with that particular building.  That is the reason we were asking about contact managers.  We established that if they were looking for a contract manager with expertise, they would not be looking for a scientist.  They would be looking for architects, mechanical and electrical engineers with a suitable background.  This person did not have this and that is pertinent to the fact that we were dealing with &euro;110 million of the people's money and, as it happens, the project did not go that well.</p> <p>  I also specifically mentioned the fact that there was a whistleblower's report, which was produced after an investigation with terms of references set by the Department.  We were concerned about it last June when it came up.  When we get to the work programme later, I will seek to have CIT included again because it is not included currently.  There are serious governance questions in the college.</p> <p>  On the PPP, I mentioned that the individual did not have the appropriate background, expertise and professional qualifications.  That seems to be confirmed by the document, which I accept was sent in.  It did not come up in my search but Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; clearly responded in June 2014.  I also had a concern that this person and another person had retired and come back a couple of days later as consultants.  That was not done in the normal way and only retrospective approval was given by the HEA and the Department of Education and Skills, which, again, is not good practice.  It is bad governance and raises the question as to why were they brought back and in what role.  The Secretary General was not in a position to tell me the role.  Was it connected to the PPP because there was such a good job being done on it or was it connected to another area?  I happened to know from my own research that a retirement function was held for this individual.  I simply asked Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; whether he attended it because we have a precedent where he attended one for the president of CIT, which came up briefly last June, and, hopefully, it will be dealt with when we get to CIT again.  However, I wanted to get a picture of this.  There was a retirement function and the following Monday, the person was back in at &euro;21,000 a year.  The expertise that he was allegedly supposed to have did not play out that well when it came to the marine college.</p><p>The Chairman misunderstood me by thinking that I wanted to return to discussing the retirement function for the CIT president that made all the headlines, including a reference to ice sculptures and so on.  That was not my intention at the time.</p><p> Let me outline another thing that I said.  The KPMG report referred to a missing page of the documentation that was-----</p></speech>

I asked Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; whether he had the missing page 14.  He said that he did not have the stuff with him and was unsure.  I think that is what he indicated.  I replied that I had page 14, which specifically alluded to things to do with the PPP, the lack of succession which, in fairness, the Comptroller and Auditor General had identified as well, and some other issues.  I offered to make the page available to the Department if the officials did not already have the page.  I have it here and they can have same.</p> <p>  While there is no questions in this regard, I am happy to say "Sorry" but I looked for the report on the qualifications of the individual but could not find it, which suggested to me that there was no response.  I fully accept that there was a response at that time.  The response now, having read it, looks like it was written, following the meeting in 2014, to facilitate the end of the story.  It does not and it creates more questions.  Clearly, Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, and I am sad to say we were very frustrated that day, and another Secretary General who was present did not like the robust questioning.  They did not like the adversarial style.  I pointed out that I was not here to make up numbers but ask questions about public money, and sometimes I must ask difficult questions.  I am paid a lot of money to do so and the officials are paid even more to do their jobs.  The precious reaction to the style of questioning is endemic and characteristic of the sort of stonewalling that we get here on a consistent basis.  Whether that is the garda&iacute;, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Education and Skills, or whatever, there is a culture of containment and the approach adopted is there is nothing to see here and shutters are pulled down.  Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; was more interested in getting an apology from me as to the style, delivery and presentation of my questions instead of approaching me immediately after the meeting and asking for the missing page.  Nobody has asked me for the page but maybe he has it already.</p> <p>  I asked a number of questions on the last day.  I suggested that the officials could come back to me on some matters, and specifically why the consultant was brought back on the following Monday.  Has Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; supplied the information?      </p></speech>

We are all in here to do the best job that we can.  I have to say in the two years that I have been a member of this committee the precious nature of certain people in certain State bodies is inconsistent with their responsibilities to the people.  I could equally write to the Secretary General or the head of many a State agency who has been in here over the past two years and take issue with their lack of candour, presentation and answering questions on pertinent issues regarding taxpayers' money.  Again, I say there is no question, including in regard to my reference to the retirement party for somebody who returned the following Monday as a consultant.  My question was totally relevant to the PPPs.  Again, the Chairman misunderstood and thought that I was referring to the meeting with the CIT president.</p></speech>

I know there was a response but I could not find it.  Beyond that, I hope that the same enthusiasm and attention is put into dealing with the issues that we raise here.  Our questions are not personal; it is just business on behalf of the people.  When &euro;110 million is dished our for a building that is falling down and when a scientist oversaw that, it causes concern.</p> <p>  We need to be conscious that a big portion of the exchange was on the fact that we cannot identify somebody.  I did not name anybody.  Why can a person who is in charge of public money not be identified?  I did not use the person's name.  I asked probing questions to find out what went on and it is quite likely that people will be able to identify the person involved.  What is the problem?  The person works in the public sector and is paid public money.  The details of my salary and expenses are available for everyone to see on the Internet.  I imagine that the same applies to the salaries paid to Secretary Generals and so on.  We are not talking about Joe Blogs or a private citizen.

This is a letter from a very senior person in the Department of Education and Skills.  He states on paper that he has received unfair treatment.  That is serious.  He has told us that and we heard Deputy MacSharry's response.  I think we should take this matter seriously.</p> <p>  I am concerned about the last line in the letter which states that he would be happy to meet the Chair and the clerk to discuss how this might be achieved.  I do not think that should happen.  We need to decide independently, as a committee, that we are satisfied with the way we question people, and it should not be as a result of meeting someone outside of that.  That is my only comment on that sentence but I certainly think it is a serious letter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-19a.78" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018041900002#E04200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  </p> <p>  I have listened to Deputy MacSharry.  We have the letter from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, which will be published and put on the public record.  I will make a few observations.  First, I agree with the Deputies.  I do not intend to meet the Secretary General to discuss the particular issue as I accept it is a broader issue for the committee.  We must acknowledge that the witness believed that there was unfair treatment, as an invited witness to the committee.  He has stated that in his letter.</p> <p>  My concern the last day was that we might have, in some way, reflected not on the qualifications but on the competence of the particular PPP contract manager in CIT.  That is a comment on his personal character rather than his professional character in terms of his ability.  I want to make the point that we have not yet established whether the faults were the fault of the PPP contractor and whether the PPP contractor is obliged to correct the faults.  Perhaps the faults in the building are all attributable to the contractor who may have to deal with the matter out of the PPP contractor's own costs, and not from the Exchequer.  I would be more concerned if the costs of the difficulties in the building were to fall back on the taxpayer.</p> <p>  If the contract drawn up, which was overseen by a contract manager, was robust enough to ensure that any faults would have to be met in full by the PPP contractor, then I would say that is an indication of good competence by the person, on the public side, to make sure that anything that went wrong would have to be dealt with.  I want to deal with that one point.  Let the Comptroller and Auditor General come in on that point.  Does he get my point?</p></speech>

It was not established as to who was incompetent.</p></speech>

As the Chairman has said, that is what one would expect a contract negotiator to achieve, namely, that where there are defects, they will be rectified by the supplier.  It has happened in other PPPs, not necessarily in this jurisdiction.  I am aware of significant difficulties with school contracts in Edinburgh, where the gable wall of a building fell down and a number of schools were closed.  One of the key issues about getting value in PPPs lies in ensuring that risks are carried by the private sector supplier.</p></speech>

If an Accounting Officer feels that he or she was treated unfairly, we could have correspondence arriving again.  This is unusual and is the first such letter I have seen.  I am not sure if during the lifetime of the previous Public Accounts Committee similar letters were sent.  First, I do not have a difficulty with the Secretary General writing to us.  If he felt that his professional reputation was being called into question then he has an absolute entitlement to say that and in fairness to him, he has put it in writing.  I agree with Deputy Connolly that we should take it seriously.  I have no difficulty whatsoever with robust questioning of witnesses.  I can be robust myself, as can other members of this committee so I have no difficulty with that.  The point I want to make is that it is the job of the Chairman to make sure that a person is treated fairly.  That is why the Chairman is in the seat.  If, on the day, questions are being put and a witness feels that the questions are unfair then-----</p></speech>

That is the only way we can control issues like that.  In fairness, on the day I think that was done.  I am not going to get into the rights or wrongs of what happened.  People can make up their own minds on that but I do not think we can just cheaply dismiss his letter.  It probably took a lot for him to write that letter.  It is very rare that an Accounting Officer would do that so he obviously felt that he was treated very unfairly.  We should take that seriously.  Equally, it is the Chairman's job to mediate meetings.</p> <p>  The final point that Deputy Connolly made is very important.  If one goes through the letter, it almost suggests that if he is treated like that again, he may not come before this committee in future.  We need to be careful in terms of how we respond to that.  My main point is that it is the Chairman's job to make sure that witnesses are treated fairly and by and large, he does that job well.  I do not see any difficulty-----</p></speech>

He feels that it was unfair to the extent that I did stop the conversation.  As Chairman, I will be more strict.  I will require two things.  I will want witnesses to answer questions but I will also want committee members to treat witnesses with respect.  We cannot be haranguing witnesses although I am not saying that happened on any particular occasion.  We will expect answers to straightforward questions and at the same time we will treat witnesses with respect.  It is my job, as Chairman, to ensure that happens.  We will expect a level of candour.

We have discussed this PPP contract manager situation at length and I must put this on the public record in the interests of fairness.  I am now going to read from a letter that was sent to this committee on 10 June 2014 and resent to us last week.  There has been a lot of talk about the PPP contract manager and I believe that as Chairman, I must be fair and balanced on this.  I will now read Appendix Two of the aforementioned letter which details the qualifications of the PPP contracts manager in CIT, as follows:</p><blockquote>Academic Qualifications<br /><br />B.Sc (1st Hons) - NUIG <br /><br />H. Dip. Ed (1st Hons) - NUIG<br /><br />M. Sc (Research) - NUIG<br /><br />M. Ed (1st Hons) - UCC<br /><br />Relevant Experience<br /><br />The PPP Contract Manager at CIT has 37 years experience in third-level education.  He was Head of a Science Department at CIT for 14 years and has been Vice President for Development since 1996.  He has extensive experience in public sector procurement and the development of major infrastructure at the Institute over that period.  <br /><br />Specific Experience of PPP Contracts<br /><br />The Contract Manager led CIT's input into the contract negotiations for both PPP projects at CIT (the National Maritime College of Ireland and the CIT Cork School of Music) from the outset, and worked closely with the DoES officials, the NDFA and their advisors in developing the detailed brief and specifications for each of these projects.  <br /><br />Of particular relevance to the current role as a Contract Manager, is the fact that he had a major input into the User Requirements, Output Specification, Service Requirements and Facilities Management Agreements for both projects.  This understanding of the Project Deliverables left him very well placed to monitor the Operators' delivery and compliance with the requirements of these contracts during their Operational phases following the Service's Commencement date at project handover.  <br /><br />The Contract Manager is also supported in his role by the Building &amp;amp; Estates Office and the Finance Office at CIT.<br /><br />Within CIT, this individual also led the development of CIT's very successful Rubicon (Innovation) Centre - currently housing 55 start-up companies - and a number of significant R&amp;amp;D facilities funded under the HEA's Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions (PRTLI) among other infrastructure projects.</blockquote> <p>There is also a detailed schedule running to one and a half pages outlining the duties and responsibilities of the Minister's contract manager but I do not propose to read that out now.  These duties and responsibilities were approved by the line Minister at the time.  The document I have just read out indicates that the contract manager was fully competent in respect of those duties and responsibilities.  I just wanted to put that information on the public record, in fairness to the contract manager.  People felt that there were questions around this and the aforementioned letter provides the answer to those questions and needed to be put on the public record.  I will close this topic now-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-19a.110" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018041900002#G00800"><p>There is zero prospect of that.  As Chairman, I have to point out that the Accounting Officer is obliged to come here.  He is normally accompanied by several members of staff to assist him.  None of those staff is obliged to come here.  The only person who is obliged to come here is the Accounting Officer.  I have seen some of the more junior staff members who have presented here, having been under no obligation at all to come here, being put severely and unfairly under pressure by certain members of the committee.  We had to stop it on a previous occasion.  There is no question about the Accounting Officer.  We want full co-operation from all departmental staff.  I am making the point that there is a distinction in this regard.</p> <p>  As Chairman, I will consider the opening note I read at the beginning of each meeting.  I will discuss it with the secretariat.  I will probably put in a paragraph to the effect that we expect answers to questions and candour from the witnesses who appear before the committee, and that they can be assured they will be treated with respect by members of the committee when they are here.  That is the jist of it.  The topic is closed.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 1217B from Mr. Jerry Grant, who is the managing director of Irish Water, enclosing a note requested by the committee regarding the public private partnership post-project reviews that have been undertaken by Irish Water.  I suspect people can note and consider that.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 1122B from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, providing additional documentation in respect of the Minister's minute in response to the Committee of Public Accounts report on the examination of financial statements in the third level sector.  There is a considerable amount of information in this correspondence.  I suggest we note it.  I have a few observations to make on this issue at this point.  It ties into our earlier discussion.  When the Committee of Public Accounts issued a formal report on third level education, the Minister was obliged to give a formal reply to the committee.  We were dissatisfied with the reply we received and we wrote back to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to say we did not accept some of what was in it.  This committee challenged the response that was received from the Minister with voluminous documentation.  I want to refer to that documentation in public, but I have no intention of reading it.  We talked about the commercialisation of intellectual property, public investment in spin-out companies and the number of spin-out companies planned in 2008.  The Minister has provided a detailed note on each of those topics.  We also raised the obligations of third level institutions under the Standards in Public Office Act and the non-compliance with procurement guidelines referred to in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p> <p>  In response, the Minister has provided detailed statistical classification of the universities from the Central Statistics Office, detailed information regarding the severance arrangement circulars, the updated code of governance for the higher education sector and the revised reporting framework for 2016 and 2017.  Appendix 1 contains detailed information about the Enterprise Ireland commercialisation fund in respect of every one of the third level institutions for each of 2015, 2016 and 2017.  The figure runs to &euro;44.286 million.  All of that information should have been provided to us long before now.  We should not have had to reject the earlier reply.  This information was in the system.  It should have been given to us on day 1.  If we had glanced over the initial reply, we would be none the wiser today.  I understand the Comptroller and Auditor General is looking at spin-out companies.  I hope he has all this information.  As Chairman, I believe we should have received this comprehensive and useful information on day 1, rather than at this late stage.</p> <p>  Before I call Deputies on this issue, I want to refer to two other documents that came with the documentation: a document reviewing intellectual property management and conflict of interest, which was printed in November; and a letter sent by the Higher Education Authority to all the higher education institutions about this committee's report on the higher education sector.  An assessment of the sectoral classification of universities in Ireland under the EUROSTAT rules was mentioned the last day.  The CSO has assessed that the seven universities should be classified as publicly controlled market producers outside the general government sector.  That is the decision.</p> <p>  I would like to mention something intriguing that I was delighted to receive.  We had a lot of meetings on the institutes of technology.  We asked about corporate governance.  We received a report from the Technological Higher Education Association of Ireland.  Its code of governance for the institutes of technology was published on 1 January 2018.  It sets out the codes of governance for all the third level institutions.  A reporting note in respect of universities was also provided to us.  They are all obliged to confirm that foundations and trusts have been or will be incorporated in financial statements in the future.  I will explain what I found interesting about that.  I ask Deputies to bear with me for a moment.  I had never heard of the Technological Higher Education Association of Ireland.  It seems that the association sets out the corporate governance rules for the institutes of technology sector.  The existence of this organisation was never mentioned during our discussions on corporate governance.  I immediately arranged for a search to be done to ascertain what this organisation is.  I found out that the Technological Higher Education Association of Ireland essentially comprises direct representatives of the institutes themselves, which is fine.  I have no issue with that information.  I do not think it is widely known among the public.  The institutes of technology provide the members of the board of the association.  In effect, they write their own corporate governance rules.</p></speech>

It helps with corporate governance.  It is a private company listed as a charity.  We have received its accounts from the Companies Registration Office.  I want to move on to my next point.  When I heard that this organisation provides corporate governance guidance to the institutes of technology, I asked whether there is a similar organisation for the universities and - lo and behold - I found out that there is an organisation called the Irish Universities Association, which I understand comprises the presidents of the various universities.

It has a corporate governance role.  It was not mentioned to us at all.  We have spoken about this issue at length.  This organisation mirrors the organisation for the education and training boards, Education and Training Boards Ireland, which receives &euro;1.6 million.  The organisation for the institutes of technology, the Technological Higher Education Association of Ireland, receives &euro;1.1 million.  The organisation for the universities, the Irish Universities Association, receives &euro;2.7 million.  This means that &euro;5.4 million in public funding is going directly to organisations that are listed as private charities and are outside our remit.  They have a fundamental role in establishing corporate governance for the entire third level sector - the education and training boards, the institutes of technology and the universities.</p><p>In all of our discussion with the people we have had in from the Department of Education and Skills, nobody saw fit to alert us that there was another group dealing with corporate governance.  This is one of the issues in the Department of Education and Skills.  The colleges and universities are financially independent but now this other tier has been established between the colleges, universities, ETBs and the Department.  The Department is creating a hands-off situation by putting an intermediary body between us.  Then there is the Higher Education Authority as well.  We are not here to deal with policy.  However, the &euro;5.4 million has been spent by all these public bodies - all of it taxpayers' money - to put a cloak or a shield between them and the Department.  This is one of the problems we have.  They refer to their own organisation for corporate governance.  The Department tells us it has no role.  </p><p> I make this point by way of information for the public.  It was interesting for me to come on it this week.  It is a point we cannot ignore but we do not have to decide now how to deal with it.  It is probably a good organisations but not a good staff.  They seem to have an invisible hand in the education sector and no light seems to have been shone on it yet.  I call Deputy Cullinane.  Forgive me for talking for a few minutes but it can be seen where our work leads us.  It was purely by accident, when I saw this report, that I wondered what this organisation was.  I am thankful for the report but it would have been nice to have been told about these organisations in all the sessions we had up to now.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-19a.122" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018041900002#H00200"><p>It has been fascinating for me and, I imagine, for the committee to shine a spotlight on this whole area of intellectual property in institutes of technology and universities.  I think the Chair is right about the Technological Higher Education Association, THEA, because we had a global report from the HEA that looked at governance of intellectual property.  I have to go back over the report again.  It may have mentioned the THEA.  I do not, however, remember or recall it being in it.  I was interested in this issue and I read the document.  It may have been mentioned, but it certainly was not prominent.  There was not much public scrutiny in this whole area anyway.  For the first time this committee shone a spotlight on it.</p> <p>  If we recall, a number of media reports and press releases went out from organisations working in this world that called into question our competence in and our understanding of this whole area.  That was disingenuous because the subtext of what was being said was that we were against commercialising intellectual property.  However, there was a complete lack of awareness of our role which is to focus on processes and procedures and then make sure that taxpayers, institutes of technology and universities are protected.  The problem with this whole area is that there is a mix of public money and private money.  That it not the problem in itself.  The issue is how to follow the public money.  How much public money goes in to supporting those companies from incubation and conception onwards, as opposed to what the institutes and universities get at the end of it.  Getting information was like pulling teeth.  We were being pushed back on this issue an awful lot for a while.  That concerned me and that is why I kept at this.  It is important we get it right.  </p> <p>  In regard to governance, there is the HEA, SFI, the THEA - which is the first time I have seen that and I was going to raise it myself anyway - and the policies of the different institutes and universities.  The policy was different depending on the institute.  Some had robust policies and some had less robust policies.  The document that we got from the Minister of Finance, Deputy Donohue, is interesting.  Some of it might be okay because it deals with the policy side of it and refers to publishing common national principles.  The difficulty I have is that it depends on whether those principles are robust and can be enforced.  I am concerned we will gloss over this, make a few cosmetic changes and nothing will really change.  I have substantive concerns.  </p> <p>  I propose that we hold over any correspondence we have, including from the Minister and the HEA, in regard to intellectual property, and that we come back to it when we decide we will come back to it.  We will be in a better position to put questions with as much information as possible.  I remember the first day I raised this issue with Dr. Graham Love, the head of the HEA.  There were no plans whatsoever to review this area.  He was talking about the HEA's work programme on reviewing governance across a range of different areas in the third and fourth level sectors.  Commercialising intellectual property was nowhere to be seen.  </p> <p>  To be fair to this committee, we have at least shone a spotlight.  It has brought us a place where there are more questions than answers.  We need to come back to it.  I find all of the information we have and the clear sense of what is happening - and all of the different layers to it - fascinating.  We will go into private session later to deal with a specific issue in relation to spin-out companies as well as reports we are still waiting on.  I know Mr. McCarthy is working on a report on this topic in an institute which we will talk about later.  It is fascinating but it has also been an experience in respect of it being almost like pulling teeth to get information.  It is unreal. </p></speech>

I want to place this in context.  We have had repeated calls for fees - we actually have them for universities but they are called registration charges - and claims that universities are starved of money.  To make a judgment, we need all the information.  We have never gotten that.  However, the one-sided mantra has gone out that they need money and are starved of funding.  There has been no open public discussion on the use of public facilities for private gain.  What is the public getting back?  I am no expert.  All we can do here is simply seek to highlight it with the help of the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of value for money.  However, there is a role for other people in our civic society, including journalists.  Our committee does not have enough support.  I do not know how the staff manage all of this.</p> <p>  It is a work in itself to read the stuff never mind where we are going with it.  One of the key issues for me are the foundations - they have come up repeatedly and those accounts have still not been consolidated or given in a manner the HEA would agree with.  We also need a discussion at this level, and outside of here, on the use of public land, public money and public facilities for private gain.  I refer to seeing where the gain comes back to the public.  I have a final point about the spin-out companies.  It comes as a surprise to me that Galway comes top of the list I have looked at.  It certainly did not come out when we had one of the magnificent seven before us.</p></speech>

I am aware of Institutes of Technology Ireland but I think it changed its name.  That is just incidental.  Perhaps in earlier documents there may have been a reference to it.</p> <p>  The Chair is correct.   There are these three entities.  We do not audit them.  We do have engagement with them from time to time.  I refer, in particular, to when there are issues around the financial statements of institutes of technology, universities or ETBs.  We engage with them in the interest of ensuring that our requirements are met when we come to audit and that published financial statements are as comprehensive and compliant as possible.  The codes of governance that they produce are reacting to the revised code of practice for the governance of State bodies which was published in 2016.  It was a significant document.  It touches on the point that there are these kinds of significant documents, that turn on how public bodies account for their performance.</p><p>The committee should be alerted to that and have the opportunity to understand what changes are happening and why and ensure that all matters of significance to members are addressed in them.  There is a bit of tailoring going on with the code of practice to take account of the specific terminology and issues that arise for institutes of technology and universities.  It is a matter which is significant.  There are contributors to the system and framework in which third-level bodies account for their performance and it would be better if there was more involvement of those and greater visibility of them to committees like this.</p></speech>

It is a bit like section 38 and 39 bodies to which the HSE provides funding.  We have got a copy of all of their financial statements from the Companies Registration Office.  The companies are limited by guarantee, have private auditors and are listed as charities.  We have them.  It is a point.  It is all public money but at one step's remove.  They cannot make any case that it is private money or anything like that.  It is something we will come back to.</p></speech>

This document is the response to further information requested on 22 March.  It is from TII.  On page 4, there is an analysis of one PPP project and, basically, it sets out that traditional procurement with tolling would cost the State &euro;227.780 million, whereas the preferred tender option would cost &euro;10 million.  With respect, here is a bit of sleight of hand going on here and, potentially, voodoo economics in that it pretends the State would have to come up with the money upfront if it were to proceed by way of traditional procurement.  In fact, most of this would come from borrowing and the money would be paid over time in any event.  It seems odd, to say the least, that TII says the total risk-adjusted cost to the public sector would have been &euro;227 million, had it proceeded the traditional way, as opposed to &euro;10 million.  There are a lot of other issues with this document that also concern me.  I would definitely hold it over.</p> <p>  There is a great deal of information before us now.  As the Chairman said, an encyclopedia of information has come back on PPPs.  This is the point we were making to the Accounting Officers when they were before us.  Notwithstanding the issues around post-project reviews not being published, or even carried out in the case of the Department of Education and Skills, they have been published since and we now have information overload.  We have to go through it all.  This is an issue we have to come back to, with respect.  This was a day on which a number of Accounting Officers from a number of organisations were before us.  We were not in a position, however, to get to the bottom of most of the issues because we did not have the information.  Now we have it, but they are gone.  I would be in favour of bringing them back on the basis of the information we have now.  I do not want to be unfair to any individual; this is a general observation.</p> <p>  I have real issues with this document.  I have read it several times and have fundamental difficulties with the analysis and what it suggests to the committee about PPPs and I would love an opportunity to put these questions to TII.  We need to come back to it as part of the work programme.</p></speech>

It is the third or fourth point.  The meeting with those Secretaries General was on one specific issue, namely, PPPs.  They should have provided this information to us in advance of the meeting.  There was no other item on the agenda that day.  Yet, it is now that we are getting most of the information.  We note it.</p></speech>

On the Gort-Tuam scheme, there was a question of a particular body in Europe examining that among other schemes.  Documentation was not given over because it was asserted that there was no obligation to provide it.</p></speech>

EU funding was provided, however, from a funding source to the private sector partner.  It was a lender to the private sector partner for the project.  The Court of Auditors wanted to get information from TII on the project from TII's perspective.  However, it did not have an audit remit to do so and it was therefore decided not to co-operate with the audit.</p></speech>

As is normal for the Accounting Officer of a Department, he is coming in to speak to us that day and will be accompanied by officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform who have responsibility in that area.  I suggest we follow our normal procedures and refrain from inviting a second Secretary General.  We do not normally bring in the Secretary General of a different Department.  We will proceed as we normally do.  The Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach is fully answerable to the committee and he will be accompanied by officials from his Department as well as from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Officials from the latter are always here.  There is no specific need to go any further than that.  We will reserve the option of inviting the Taoiseach.  We can come back to that.</p><p>The Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will appearing before us the following week, on 10 May, in any event so we can put any questions that arise to him on that day.  We will give him notice if that arises.</p></speech>

This relates to a specific case.  It is not a matter for the committee to deal with a specific case.  We will just note it.</p> <p>  The next item, No. 1197, is from Professor Patrick O'Shea, University College Cork, in response to information sought by the committee in respect of Cork Opera House.  Deputy Alan Kelly, the Vice Chairman, who raised this issue, asked that the matter be held over until the next meeting because he cannot be here today.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 1208, from Mr. Brendan Ryan, CEO of the Courts Service, concerns information provided in respect of the management accounts associated with the court poor box.  The committee had written suggesting the payments made directly to the charity or payments made via the Probation Service be accounted for.  The Courts Service points out that this is an area where a judge exercises control and it has no role in the matter.  The CEO points out that legislation is expected in this area to bring about consistency or uniformity, or a total reassessment of the court poor box system.  That is an issue members can raise at the time in question.  We shall note and publish the correspondence.</p></speech>

The matter was dealt with on several occasions.  The Department has stated that the mandatory tests in respect of St. Conleth's were provided and the Health and Safety Authority has verified that all concerns have been addressed by the contractor.  It appears that this matter is subject to a High Court action and a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na investigation.  I propose that we forward the correspondence to the Department for its consideration and further action, if any is required by it.  We should ask the company to deal directly with the Garda and Department on any future concerns.  It is not for this committee to get involved.</p> <p>  No. 1212 is from Donal McElwain, municipal district co-ordinator, Monaghan County Council, requesting the committee to make inquiries regarding malpractice regarding providers of private pensions.  Private pension providers do not fall within the remit of the committee.  I propose we forward the correspondence to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach for any action it deems necessary.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We will tell Monaghan County Council that also.</p> <p>  No. 1213, dated 5 April, is from an individual in response to requests from the committee for further information regarding PRSI misclassification of employees.  The individual provided considerable documentation earlier, which was considered at our meeting on 29 March.  The matter is complex.  However, I propose that we write to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection enclosing a copy of the material and ask for an initial response.

Their underlying objectives are that fiscal reports should provide a comprehensive, timely, reliable, comparable and accessible summary of a government&rsquo;s financial performance and position.  In 2013 a team from the IMF visited Ireland, at the request of the Secretaries General of the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, to review and assess Ireland's fiscal system against the standards.  The report concluded that Ireland's fiscal reporting was relatively comprehensive, frequent and reliable but quite fragmented.  The team made 35 recommendations for change, with a view to full implementation by 2017.  The Government referred the report and action plan to a steering group for implementation, as appropriate.  I carried out a review last year to assess progress in that regard.<br/><br/>As outlined in the chapter, the recommendations can usefully be grouped together under three broad headings.  They relate to the budget process, in respect of which there were 13 recommendations; the need to recognise and value a wider range of State assets and liabilities in fiscal budgeting and reporting, in respect of which there were nine recommendations; and financial reporting, in respect of which there were 13 recommendations.  The chapter includes an annex listing the recommended actions individually and outlining the status <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>each one as at mid-2017.  Figure 5.1 in the chapter which can be shown on screen for Deputies summarises the position.  It indicates that most progress has been made in implementing the recommendations related to the budgetary process.  Progress was more mixed in recognising a wider range of assets and liabilities, while least progress was made in implementing recommendations related to financial reporting.</p></speech>

A range of issues would give rise to a need if we were to make such a move.  The fundamental objective or purpose of the IMF's report is to point to the adoption of accrual accounting as an appropriate way in which to report on government accounts and move away from the current basis of cash accounting.  It would be a significant change in reporting on the public finances.  Notwithstanding the fact that the IMF was obviously very strong in thinking this measure could bring significant-----</p></speech>

We cannot see pension obligations or many other liabilities that may be contingent in that regard.  The United Kingdom has made a lot of progress in that regard, but we seem to be lagging behind.  The Chairman is always very eager to have accounts in on time and the committee sees various bodies.  I am not confidence that this is something that is being actioned or prioritised by the Department or that legislation is in the offing to try to make it clear that this information should be available by June.</p></speech>

It is really in the area of financial reporting about which I am speaking, where a Government decision needs to be made on whether we should move to accrual accounting as set out in the presentation of the Comptroller and Auditor General, where progress has been slowest.  Internationally, when people look at the move from cash to accrual accounting in reporting on the fiscal accounts, an authoritative international organisation such as the OECD states the value of accrual accounting is unclear and even disputed in some instances.  In the light of the costs and implications of a move to full accrual accounting for reporting purposes, from the perspectives of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Finance, we need to be very clear that the benefits should outweigh the costs.  Countries have been at this process for up to ten years and when they report on progress, they state they have only realised half of the benefits in terms of transparency and accountability they expected to see.</p> <p>  To explain very quickly to the Deputy, the financial management shared services project is under way.  It will integrate 31 financial systems into a single financial system in the coming years.  The decisions made in looking at the IMF's report on fiscal transparency and the implementation of the recommendations on reporting were that we had to move to that single system before we would be able to consider a move to accrual accounting.  Fundamentally, that is where we are.</p><p>A huge amount of work is being undertaken in making the move to the single financial system and establishing the single financial management shared service.</p></speech>

There are shocks and liabilities.  One can see that in recognising the valuation for fixed asset holdings and contingent liabilities that might be associated with them, when one tries forensically to go through notes attached to different appropriation accounts.  In adopting an accrual base, I would like to hear more confidence from the Department that progress is being made on this.  Is there an implementation group which is looking at this, both in bringing the date forward and changing the scope to ensure that more data and information are available?</p></speech>

Colleagues from the Department of Finance may be able to expand on this, but much progress has been made in the presentation of our fiscal accounts and improving the institutional coverage.  As far as public expenditure matters are concerned, the IMF raised two specific matters, namely, the recording of pension liabilities and the recording of public private partnership, PPP, liabilities.  Although they are not formally integrated into our accounts, there is much more information provided on those aspects of the public finances than there was in the past.  Finance has led on a particular initiative in capturing our fiscal risks, which is a very important response to the issue raised in the IMF report and is a very important part of the fiscal documentation.  Mr. McCarthy might wish to add to that.</p></speech>

We set out a table outlining the contingent liabilities, trying to get a wider assessment of the risks to public finances.  Contingent liabilities have fallen dramatically, the bulk of which relate to the financial sector.  For instance, NAMA is no longer a contingent liability on the State, but there are other contingent liabilities.  These are set out in the table in the stability programme.  Additional information from both Departments is there.</p></speech>

My concerns if I were reading this as a report card, which would form the kernel of the issue and which are highlighted by the key red symbols, would be transparency in reporting requirements, trying to ensure that contingent liabilities are reflected, and trying to ensure the information is available in a timely manner.  That is where my concerns lie.  Irrespective of what the officials are saying, the red dots on this report are on those key issues.  I want to be more confident that the Department is looking at improving this and that it has an implementation process which is under way or that some sort of legislation is progressing in this area.</p></speech>

The decision needs to be made on whether we continue with our current basis of reporting, taking on board the innovations and improvements that have been introduced in recent years and whether there is a move to full accrual accounting.  This year, with the assistance of funding from the European Commission's structural reform support programme and OECD expertise, we will undertake a very detailed due diligence on our fiscal reporting to map the information we provide against international best practice.  This is with a view to identifying the gaps so that when we move forward on FMSS, we will be in a position to assess how we can best ensure that when decisions are made on how future financial reporting will be carried out, it is based on international best practice and standards.</p> <p>  From a policy perspective, rather than the work done on moving to the single financial system, a very active work programme is planned for 2018.  Responding to Deputy Burke's comments, that demonstrates that the Department and our colleagues in the Department of Finance are very committed to continuing to engage with the transparency agenda, as we have done in the past.</p></speech>

It is probably one of the countries which has had the longest and most intense experience of making changes in its approach to financial reporting.  Even where it reports on progress itself, it is not claiming to have realised all the benefits.  When one looks at Europe, countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, and Norway have decided they will not move to accrual accounting.  Alongside that, they are making every effort to improve the transparency of their fiscal reporting.  As we look at our options, we have the choice between moving to accrual accounting or, if Government decides to stick to cash accounting, that we engage with and address the weaknesses that can give rise to in fiscal reporting in areas such as liabilities and so on, as the Deputy raised.</p></speech>

The UK is providing more information and, as an accountant, I am fearful when dealing with cash accounting or a central fund that not all the data is there and that there are significant liabilities.  Sometimes, when the appropriation accounts come to us, we find ourselves searching through notes within those accounts to assess contingent liabilities.  That poses risks in terms of transparency and assessing how the State is doing.  We have a lot of improvement to make in those key reporting requirements.</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General or one of his officials wrote to the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in November about how, within the existing framework, we could improve reporting in the appropriation account.  The office of the Comptroller and Auditor General recommended a number of changes to the appropriation account that could be undertaken in the short-term and medium-term issues.  Arising from that, the Secretary General of my Department wrote back proposing the establishment of a working group composed of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Office of Financial Management and Shared Services and other Departments to move on those weaknesses in the appropriation accounts which the Deputy highlighted, which were highlighted by the Comptroller and Auditor General and which are reflected in a recent periodic report of the Committee on Public Accounts.</p></speech>

Has the Department mapped out the outcomes of this?  What can we expect to see in 2018 and 2019?</p> <p>  Mr. Beausang spoke of the cost.  Can he indicate what sums are involved and over what period?  Where does this fall within the pecking order of the Department's work?  Is it high priority?  Are other things ahead of it which are regarded as higher priority?  Without transparency, there cannot be accountability.  We have a different dynamic in the D&aacute;il now that there is a Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  The quality of information available to us, including internationally, enhances our reputation.  The more transparent our systems are, the better it is for all of us.</p></speech>

In the area of public expenditure, we fully understand, including from our own work, the importance of a presentation of the Government's fiscal accounts that is as clear, transparent and simple as possible.  If that information is not available, it represents a significant obstacle to understanding and accountability.</p> <p>  On the pecking order, it is fair to say that arising from the OECD's work, which is featured in its report on improving parliamentary scrutiny of the budget, we have prioritised many of the measures arising from that.  The publication of a performance report, expected later this month, will allow sectoral committees to examine the performance of Departments relative to the allocations made to them.</p><p>That is an important innovation.  On our side, the mid-year expenditure report is a very important stocktaking in the middle of the year in terms of where spending has got to and our projections as to what spending will look like for the remainder of the year.  It is also very important in setting up the position for the budget for the next year.  We have done a lot of work.  The work on implementing the IMF fiscal transparency report came to a point where we understood that we could not do more until we had progressed things like the financial management shared service.  We have moved, as a result, our emphasis and focus to the issues that were highlighted in the OECD report on parliamentary scrutiny of the budget.</p><p> In terms of the specific outcomes from the European project, members will understand that when Europe provides very significant resources, given that we do not know exactly how much the project will cost, it is very focused on what the outcomes should be.</p></speech>

I will not put a price on a project like this, but if we were undertaking it ourselves, it would consume a significant amount of the resources that are available to us for things like consultancy.  There is, or there will be soon, a full statement of the scope of the project and the outcomes that are expected from it.  I am happy to share that with the committee once it is finalised.</p> <p>  In terms of the cost of moving to accrual accounting, I have not seen that quantified formally in any way other than in a research paper where the authors referred to France having spent perhaps up to &euro;1.5 billion on budgetary reforms and other reforms leading to the introduction of accrual accounting.  The other figure that was quoted there, but without any particular reference or source, was the assessment that a move to accrual accounting could cost a medium-sized country up to &euro;50 million, but I am not sure of the provenance of those figures or how accurate they are otherwise.  Going back to the OECD work that I mentioned, the point is that countries have spent ten years moving from cash-based to accrual accounting, and I am sure they have consumed a lot of resources in doing that.  The question is whether they have seen the benefits of that investment.  It is the OECD's assessment rather than ours but it is fair to say that the jury is out on that.</p></speech>

That was something that we had in our mind as we looked at the way forward.  That is a very significant response to the deficits in financial reporting that the Comptroller and Auditor General highlights in this report, and it will be an important and, indeed, critical part of our response to that issue.</p> <p>  While I am not criticising the IMF's work, typically, it has a team over for a week or two, it is high level, it looks at best practice and says this is the direction of travel of what we should be trying to do in terms of fiscal transparency and fiscal reporting.  For a system as complex and as large as the Government accounting system, we need a deep-dive, granular analysis to come to a clearer view of what is involved in mapping what we do currently against detailed international accounting standards to find the gaps with a view to following through on those.</p></speech>

That was reported on late last year.  It is work that is done every couple of years but now there is a more recent statement of accrued pension liabilities for public servants, which responds to this issue that the IMF highlighted that we did not have as good a handle on it as we should have.</p> <p>  The other issue that arose was the recognition of liabilities associated with PPPs, and although under EUROSTAT rules we are not required to report - EUROSTAT guides how we report in terms of PPPs - there is significantly more information available now on the liabilities that arise from PPPs and that is published and is in the public domain.  Those are two gaps that the IMF identified, namely, PPPs and pension liabilities.</p></speech>

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Finance will come in under the system at that time.

Then there will be five waves in total, I think, thereafter over a period of about 18 months, bringing in a lot of the larger spending Departments.</p></speech>

It concluded - in retrospect, because it is also learning as it undertakes this work - that Ireland is one of the stronger performers internationally in terms of fiscal transparency.

It was a very collaborative and collegial exercise.  When the Deputy talks about it, they made recommendations and those recommendations relate to very important parts of public financial management.

He believes that the reporting is fragmented at present.  In the context of updating the legislative framework more generally as we look at improving fiscal transparency, I think certainly more consolidation - our experience to date is that the more we consolidate to the extent we can, the better it is - is very much a recommendation.  That financial reporting would be regarded as fragmented does not suit our purposes and certainly does not suit the accountability and transparency objectives that we have.</p></speech>

It is an extra presentation, as it were.  Recommendation 1b on page 74 is to "combine the Finance and Appropriation Accounts into a consolidated central government financial statement".  There are other accounts which might be comprehended in that as well, for instance, the Social Insurance Fund, Local Government Fund, National Training Fund and possibly the Revenue accounts as well, depending on the level of information required.  The point is that none of these on its own gives a comprehensive picture of what the State is taking in and spending.  There is scope to produce a consolidated statement, which would be subject to audit and so on.  I do not think it is absolutely necessary that there would be a statutory underpinning of that.  It could be done in the context of producing the Central Fund of the Exchequer.  There could be other consolidated information presented with that which would be helpful and useful for the committee and others who want to get a snapshot of the position.</p></speech>

As the Deputy can see from the response to that recommendation, there was an exercise carried out at a point to see on an administrative basis what a consolidated statement would look like.  Against the backdrop of the ongoing work with colleagues in the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, we can see what scope there is for revisiting that work.</p></speech>

We do not have the balance sheet, either.  It is a point I will be making later when we come to talk about the Finance accounts, the account of the Central Fund of the Exchequer.  There is no balance sheet or statement of assets and liabilities associated with it.  That to me leaves a gap in knowledge about our position.</p></speech>

The issue of standard setting, when one is taking into account the different issues that kick in when one looks at different elements of the public finances, is the issue that we are engaging with here.  That is the area we are trying to address.</p> <p>  Sometimes there is an inevitability to diversity because if one tries to harmonise, the one-size-fits-all means that one is losing things in terms of the financial reporting.  Not being intimately familiar with the specific issues that arise in relation to those four recommendations, it is presumably the case that there is a sort of diversity there that is hard to corral under one single set of rules.  The experience more generally, as we look at it in accounting standards, is that a uniform and standardised approach sometimes can cause real difficulties and there can be very significant unintended consequences from saying, "That is the rule and everybody has to hold to that rule", if that process is not worked through in a way that takes all the individual relevant factors into account.</p></speech>

If one does not have uniformity, it is difficult for those who do not have accounting backgrounds, such as myself and members of the Committee of Public Accounts, to understand what is happening and get an accurate reflection.</p></speech>

At present, in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform the rules for appropriation accounting are made.  It is completely a matter for the Department of Finance how the finance accounts will be structured and presented.  One has the Department of Education and Skills making determinations in relation to the third level bodies we were talking about this morning and education and training boards, and one has the Minister for Health making determinations in relation to how health bodies will do their financial reporting.  Anybody who does not fit into such categories comes under FRS 102, which is accrual-based accounting.  We have a lot of different things happening in an unco-ordinated fashion.  That was a core view of the IMF, that there needs to be more coherence around it.</p> <p>  One point I would make is that we have talked this morning about a cash accounting basis or an accrual accounting basis.  In fact, what we have is not a pure cash accounting basis.  It is a modified cash accounting.  If one looks at an appropriation account, one can see that there is a statement of assets and liabilities in it.  That is an accrual based concept and the aim is to provide a certain amount of information on an accruals basis.  It is not as simple as saying we will do it on a cash basis or we will do it on an accrual basis; there is an intermediate space.  What one really needs is a central view on what is appropriate.</p></speech>

My question is that I am looking at a report the summary of which states that four recommendations were made to ensure that we have some level of uniformity in terms of accounting rules and procedures.  We have heard from the Comptroller and Auditor General the rationale for that.  It is a reasonable question and a straightforward answer would be welcome.  Has he a responsibility to implement any of those four recommendations?  The answer is "Yes" or "No".  If he has a responsibility and they have not been implemented, why have they not been implemented?  Am I correct in reading from what he is saying that he has not implemented them, if he does have a responsibility, because of lack of capacity?</p></speech>

That falls to be progressed on the basis of the professionalisation agenda that is set out in the Civil Service renewal plan.  Work has been ongoing on scoping out what a chief financial officer role in Government would look like.  Obviously, that person would be absolutely vital to driving forward on that standardisation, harmonisation and uniformity, that the Deputy has referred to and that is picked up on as a weakness in the IMF report.</p> <p>  In terms of financial reporting standards, we in DPER are engaged in the European process.  There are international public sector accounting standards.  Europe is looking at how they might be tailored to a European context through the development of a European public sector accounting standard.  We participate in that work.  The discussions are complex.  I should say there are very significant issues that come through for each country in terms of translating the international standard into a workable European system and there has to be a decision at the European level as to whether there will be a standard which all countries will then have to comply with.  That is work in progress.  It is a project that will run over a number of years.  It is not something that will come to an end in the short term, given the complexity of the issues that it gives rise to.</p></speech>

It reads: "A team from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) visited Ireland in March 2013, at the request of the Secretaries General of the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, to evaluate".  The witnesses invited them to give us some help.  There was no mandatory requirement.  It is important that it was just a case of them coming, looking at it and giving us some good suggestions and help.  As Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, I do not see any legislative requirement to implement all of them.  Some might have been good; some might have been excellent; some might just not work out and some might require consultation at EU level so as not to be inconsistent with EUROSTAT and other things.  It is a helpful document, but it is not gospel.</p></speech>

It has come up before.  I will ask the witnesses from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or the Department of Finance or somebody else to give me the definitive document.  A couple of paragraphs from the bottom of the page it reads: "Accrual accounting is already the norm for most of the public sector with the exception of central government, and the Education and Training Boards.  Most public sector bodies prepare their financial statements in accordance with" financial reporting standard, FRS, 102.  Will the witnesses prepare a list of the public bodies that do not meet the financial reporting standards?  We know that some have.  We know that some of them are healthy and that the HSE is the big one.  Suddenly, we have a statement produced and there is a little note on one of the 158 pages referring to accounting policies as directed by the Minister.  It crops up in a few places.  We want the list.  The Comptroller and Auditor General may have it, but the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or somebody else should have it.  Will they, please, send it to us in order that we will know when we are looking at the accounts in the future that there are gaps in them compared to the normal financial reports one would expect.  We will conclude the discussion on the section on fiscal transparency.  Now that we have concluded our examination of it, we will note the chapter.  I thank Mr. Beausang from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  He is free to leave.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-19a.370" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018041900002#R02200"><p>The annual finance accounts present the receipts into and issues from the Central Fund of the Exchequer, together with a set of statements and schedules that itemise the transactions.  The financial statements on the national debt which are prepared by the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, are presented in full as Part 2 of the finance accounts.</p> <p>  Chapter 1 of my report on the accounts of public services is a recurring chapter, designed to summarise the transactions under the Central Fund in an accessible format and highlight relevant trends over time.  In addition, because the finance accounts do not include any kind of balance sheet, the summary position on key assets and liabilities at year-end is also set out.  Exchequer receipts in 2016 totalled &euro;55.1 billion, which represented a decrease of &euro;3.5 billion, or 6%, compared to 2015.  Issues from the Central Fund in 2016 amounted to &euro;56.1 billion, a year-on-year decrease of &euro;2.6 billion, or 4%.  The deficit in receipts relative to issues for the year was just over &euro;1 billion.  The chapter provides an overview of the public funding provided for Irish Water from all sources up to the end of 2016, which totalled &euro;2.53 billion.  This included a capital contribution of &euro;184 million provided from the Central Fund for Irish Water in 2016.  In addition, a &euro;96 million working capital loan to Irish Water provided from the Central Fund in 2015 was converted into a capital contribution in 2016.  The chapter also refers briefly to the European Commission's state aid ruling on the Apple Group.  The Accounting Officer will be able to update the committee on developments in that regard.</p> <p>  Chapter 2 of my report outlines the trends and composition of Government debt and the cost of debt servicing.  At the end of 2016, the general Government debt stood at just under &euro;201 billion.  This was marginally lower than at the end of 2015.  While the ratio of general Government debt to gross domestic product continued to fall in 2016, international comparisons indicate that Ireland still has a relatively high debt burden.  The cost to the Exchequer of servicing the national debt fell from &euro;7.1 billion in 2015 to &euro;6.8 billion in 2016, reflecting the impact of the refinancing of debt by the National Treasury Management Agency.  The cost of servicing the national debt relative to the debt level dropped from an estimated 3.5% at the end of 2015 to 3.2% at the end of 2016.</p> <p>  The 2016 appropriation account for the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Finance records gross expenditure of &euro;31.2 million.  This was a net underspend of &euro;10.63 million relative to the Estimate.  The appropriation account presents expenditure under three expenditure programmes.  They relate to the costs incurred in 2016 in respect of economic and fiscal policy, on which the Department spent &euro;15.8 million; banking and financial services policy, on which the Department spent &euro;6.8 million; and the provision of shared services, on which the Department spent &euro;8.6 million.  The expenditure on banking and financial services policy recorded in the appropriation account does not include costs associated with staff seconded to the Department from the NTMA to deal with banking sector issues and certain related consultancy costs.  These costs are borne by the NTMA and not recouped from the Department.</p> <p>  The Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012 requires me to report to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on the correctness of the sums brought to account by the Fiscal Advisory Council each year.  Chapter 24 is my report for 2016.  I gave a clear audit opinion on the council's financial statements for 2016 when it incurred expenditure of &euro;633,000.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-19a.371" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Derek Moran" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018041900002#R02300"><p>I thank the Chairman for giving me the opportunity to address the committee.  With me are Mr. John McCarthy, our chief economist; Mr. Gary Tobin, head of banking; Ms Mary McSharry, head of corporate affairs; and Mr. Fiachra Quinlan from our finance unit.  Our colleague, Mr. William Beausang, from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was here.  </p> <p>  The agenda covers chapters 1, 2, 5 and 24 of the 2016 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the accounts of public services; the appropriation accounts for 2016 - Vote 7 - and the 2016 finance accounts.  The 2016 gross budget for the Department was &euro;40.994 million, or &euro;39.6 million net of appropriations in aid, including a capital carryover from 2015 of &euro;115,000.</p><p>There were three key categories of operational budget, namely, pay bill, at &euro;18.5 million; administration, at &euro;5.9 million; and programme consultancies, at &euro;6.1 million.  The gross spend for the year was &euro;31.2 million which was &euro;9.8 million or 23.8% under the budget estimate of &euro;40.994 million.  With higher appropriations-in-aid, this left a &euro;10.4 million surrender figure at the end of the year.  This surplus arose for a number of reasons.  There was an underspend of approximately &euro;4.6 million on programme expenditure related costs arising from the completion of some consultancy work using in-house resources and lower costs in the defence of certain legal cases and their timing in court.  There were also savings of &euro;2.1 million in relation to the fuel grants scheme.  Recruitment did not progress at the pace anticipated during 2016, resulting in a pay bill underspend of &euro;1.9 million.  This situation was addressed in 2017, which saw the pay bill underspend reduced to about &euro;600,000.  There were further savings of &euro;1.1 million on non-pay administration expenses.  Certain information technology and capital projects did not take place during the year, accounting for most of this saving.  The Department also recouped an additional &euro;900,000 in respect of costs associated with the stabilisation of the banking sector.</p><p> The fuel grant constituted a new service in the context of the finance Vote in 2016.  A sum of &euro;10 million was provided for the new fuel grant under the disabled drivers and passengers (tax concessions) scheme to replace the excise repayment on the fuel element of the scheme.  Spending under the scheme in 2017 amounted to &euro;9.6 million, which was much more in line with the original estimates. </p><p> As regards the Exchequer financial outturn for 2016, I draw the committee's attention to the following key points.  Tax revenues for 2016, at &euro;47.8 billion, were up by &euro;2.3 billion or 5% year on year and &euro;600 million or 1.4% above profile.  In relation to income tax, the largest tax head, the performance in 2016 was solid, with receipts finishing the year 0.9% or &euro;174 million above profile.  This represented an annual increase of 4.4% or &euro;810 million.  Corporation tax receipts in 2016 of &euro;7.4 billion were &euro;700 million above the budget 2016 forecast.  The major consumption tax heading, VAT, was up 4% or &euro;476 million in annual terms in 2016, at &euro;12.4 billion, albeit some 3.4% or &euro;439 million below expectations.  This underperformance can be partially attributed to stronger than expected repayments and muted price pressures.</p><p> On the expenditure side, total expenditure, at &euro;68.065 billion, was down &euro;2.393 billion or 3.4%.  This was due to a reduction year on year in short-term loans to the Social Insurance Fund for cashflow purposes.  When the impact of loans to the Social Insurance Fund are removed, gross expenditure for 2016 amounted to &euro;66.695 billion. This is a year on year increase of &euro;602 million or 0.9%, driven by an increase in gross voted expenditure of &euro;1.311 billion or 2.4%, partially offset by a reduction in debt servicing costs of &euro;269 million and non-voted expenditure of &euro;503 million. </p><p> The general Government debt for 2016 was &euro;200.6 billion.  General Government debt as a percentage of GDP fell to 73% in 2016 from a peak of 120% in 2012.  The decline in the general Government debt to GDP ratio since 2013 has been influenced by the growth in GDP, rather than the reduction in nominal debt.  This downward trend is projected to continue, with a debt to GDP ratio of 60%, the target set by the Stability and Growth Pact, forecast in the early part of the next decade.</p><p> As members are aware, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council was established under the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012 to provide independent assessments of the Government's budgetary plans and projections and inform public discussion of economic and fiscal matters.  There is a joint memorandum of understanding between the council and the Department underpinning the endorsement process of the macroeconomic forecasts prepared by the Department on which the budget and stability programme updates are based. </p><p> The robust pace of recovery in the economy continued in 2017, with GDP increasing by 7.8%.  The increase in economic activity is broadly based and the economic fundamentals are strong.  Ireland has been one of the fastest growing economies in the European Union in the past four years.  The recovery was most clearly evident in 2017 in the labour market, with approximately 2.2 million people in employment.  This reflects the creation of 318,000 additional jobs since the low point in 2011.  Strong employment gains have driven a substantial turnaround in unemployment which has fallen from a peak of more than 16% in 2012 to slightly more than 6% in March 2018.  As set out in the stability programme update yesterday, it is anticipated that employment levels will get back to pre-crisis levels in the first half of this year.</p><p> Both domestic demand and exports are making positive contributions to growth.  Key economic indicators point to continued solid growth this year.  The Department is forecasting growth of 5.6% this year and 4% next year.  However, the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union will have a substantial impact on the economy.  At this stage, the most likely scenario involves a transition period for 2019 and 2020. </p><p> In December 2017 Ireland repaid its remaining programme related loans to the International Monetary Fund, together with the bilateral loans from Sweden and Denmark, early and in full.  Ireland has maintained its A grade rating with each of the three major credit rating agencies.</p><p> A key focus for the Department in the past year has been the part disposal of the State's investment in Allied Irish Banks.  The successful initial public offering, IPO, of AIB in June 2017 was the second biggest in the world last year, raising &euro;3.4 billion for the taxpayer.  This has created a strong platform for the State to recover over time all of the money it has invested in AIB.</p><p> The National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, is also making continued progress, with 100% of senior debt now repaid, while the Department is working towards the introduction of the new Home Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, which will help to increase the supply of funding for residential developments.</p><p> Brexit is a serious challenge for the economy.  As members are aware, the Government has increased its strategic oversight of Brexit by assigning the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade with special responsibility for co-ordinating the whole-of-government response.  Brexit issues are mainstreamed into the Department's work in all areas, including economic analysis, financial services and taxation.</p><p> Intensive negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the phase one issues culminated on 8 December 2017 when an agreement was reached on all three exit issues, reflected in an EU-UK joint progress report.  Based on the report, the European Council, on 15 December 2017, concluded that "sufficient progress" on all phase one issues had been achieved and negotiations could move to the second phase.  This work is progressing. </p><p> I take the opportunity to express my appreciation to the staff at the Department for their ongoing hard work.  It is through their efforts and dedication that we deliver on our objectives.  In turn, we try to support our staff by providing the training and skills necessary for the job.  Our efforts in that regard were acknowledged last year when the Department was awarded a national training award as best learning and development organisation by the Irish Institute of Training and Development.  We have been short-listed again for 2018.  </p><p> I thank the Chairman and members for their attention and would welcome questions.</p></speech>

How do we relate in terms of GNI and our profile?  There is quite a lot of movement by multinationals.  There was an onshoring of IP.  As a result of how we account for things, are we paying more than we would if we did not have the abnormal situation we have in this country?</p></speech>

This is not affected that much by the multinationals.  We would have a big difficulty if it was done on the basis of GDP because the latter includes all the massive profits of the multinationals but GNI takes them out because the profits do not accrue to Irish people, so Irish living standards are better assessed on a GNP or GNI basis.  Yes, there is an issue with GDP overinflating living standards.  In terms of the EU contribution, however, it works its way out.  We have a new measure - GNI* - which removes even more of the multinational activity.  The Deputy mentioned the onshoring of IP, which would be excluded from GNI*.  We do not have the 2017 figure yet but in 2016, the ballpark figure for GDP was &euro;275 billion whereas the figure for GNI* was just south of &euro;190 billion.  There is quite a substantial difference between the two.</p></speech>

I was very conscious of local authorities having very sizeable amounts of cash in hand from development contributions that they were not permitted to spend.  They were only permitted to spend what they took in during a particular year.  Does that still apply?  Does it apply to sectors other than the local government sector?</p></speech>

Up to the crash I believe it was some &euro;200 million a year.  During the crash it moved to a balanced budget situation.  It is about giving visibility and knowing there are no shocks to the system.  It is a very small part of the overall, as Mr. McCarthy has said.</p></speech>

We had the conversation last year about the ratio of debt.  That ratio changed because of a quite dramatic increase in GDP.  If I remember correctly the Department expressed surprise at that.  Has the Department figured out what really happened? The Central Statistics Office is responsible for producing the figures.  Is this change accounted for and does the Department understand why it happened? Is there a risk of the reverse happening? Is it on the Department's risk register with regard to the stability of the economy?</p></speech>

It could happen that there is a risk IP could be taken offshore in the opposite direction.  It did not accrue any benefit for Ireland on the way in and it is unlikely to cost us anything on the way out, if that was to happen.  As Mr. McCarthy has already referred to, the important point on the metrics is that Ireland needs to take great care when using IP in our measure of GDP.  Our real level of indebtedness is somewhat higher than the 70% suggested by the GDP.</p></speech>

The current Governor and Mr. McCarthy worked on this with a statistical group some years ago.  They looked at the concept of GNI*, which puts the debt ratio in 2016 at 106% rather than the 70%.  Another aspect, which the Minister spoke about this week, is how much money we have borrowed based on every man, woman and child in the State, which is nearly &euro;40,000 per head.  This is an extraordinary number.  It gives some context of where we stand.</p></speech>

Obviously, Ireland's ability to borrow for capital projects, for example, is determined by our debt to GDP ratio.  Is this the case?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-19a.443" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018041900002#U00900"><p>That is absolutely correct and I believe the point made by Deputy Murphy relates to GDP.  It has fallen by 50 percentage points.  The only reason it is falling, however, is because GDP has gone up by 26% in 2015, as the Deputy has already referred to.  The money amount of debt actually continues to rise.  At the moment it is &euro;200 billion but it will go up to some &euro;210 billion over the forecast horizon, and if we look at it on a range of other metrics to get to GNI* it is about 100% at the moment.  In order for the analysis not to focus on some of the green dots - and on foot of the IMF recommendations - last year we started publishing an annual debt report, which we will update in June this year.  In this we look at debt across seven or eight different indicators and at interest payments as a percentage of revenue on a <i>per capita</i>basis.  They all show that Ireland is an outlier and that while the debt is manageable it certainly needs to be managed and that the debt to GDP ratio is an irrelevant metric for Ireland.</p></speech>

It is &euro;500 million euro to service the debt.  This is a very sizeable amount of money and it limits the State's scope to do other things.  When it goes from 3% to 3.5% the 0.5% makes quite a bit of difference.</p> <p>  These accounts tell us that the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, has paid off the Danish and the Swedish bilateral debts.  The UK debt remains.  Is that &euro;7 billion?</p></speech>

This is the cost of running the Department of Education and Skills, or maybe just a little bit more, from pre-school services right through to third-level funding.

I am aware that we are looking at the 2016 accounts today but if debt interest, for example, in 2018 is forecast to be &euro;5.9 billion it reflects the fact that interest rates generally are very low.  The NTMA is able to retire more expensive debt and then refinance at lower rates.  To answer the Deputy's point, it is still a very high amount of money.</p></speech>

The Central Bank has a minimum schedule of disposals on floating rate notes, FRNs.  The schedule says that between 2014 and 2018 they would retire about &euro;500 million, and then from 2019 to 2023 they would retire &euro;1 billion.  That was the original schedule but the actual sales are well ahead of that.  By the end of March the Central Bank has disposed of &euro;10.5 billion of the floating rate notes.  This is &euro;10.5 billion of the &euro;25 billion.  The timing of the trigger for disposal of the floating rate notes is completely at the discretion of the Central Bank.</p><p>At the moment, there is a low interest environment so the NTMA can pay these off with cheap money.</p></speech>

Single transactions can have a profound effect on GDP, with a dramatic uplift.  2015 was a case in point.  We have not witnessed those dramatic changes in the intervening period but we are vulnerable to them.  The Deputy is correct that in terms of the legal requirement, GDP is the measure.  When we report to the EU around the fiscal rules and the fiscal compact, it is debt as a proportion of GDP and the deficit as a proportion of GDP.</p></speech>

They are, at least, made to appear complicated but one of the measurements used to work out the fiscal space under the fiscal rules is debt-to-GDP ratio.

When I talk about debt-to-GDP being irrelevant, I am not talking about the rules; I am talking in terms of assessing debt sustainability in Ireland.</p><p>To elaborate on the point made by the Secretary General, in practically every other country in Europe there is virtually no difference between GDP and GNI.  We are the outlier because of the size of the multinational sector in the Irish context.  We have a situation where there are approximately 190,000 firms in Ireland and five of them account for one third of our exports.  We have a very small economy with a very large multinational sector that distorts our GDP.  This means that one must look below the bonnet in order to get a better indication of what is happening, including with regard to debt sustainability.

None of that answered my questions.  However, it provided more clarity.  I wish to break this down into layman's terms because it can bamboozle people who are not economists and who do not understand how it works.  They hear terms such as "debt-to-GDP" and now there is GNI*.  We use a host of measurements and we have to figure out which ones are the most accurate.  We know for certain that, legally and in terms of implementing the fiscal rules, GDP and debt-to-GDP are used.  GDP is, essentially, a measurement of all goods and services in the economy over a year in the State.  Does GNI* strip out the multinationals?</p></speech>

We all know they are quite profitable in many cases.  However, there is also a profit inflow from Irish firms abroad that are profitable too, but in net terms it is a net profit outflow.  That is GDP to GNI.  The Philip Lane group came up with the concept of GNI* two years ago.  One goes from GNI to GNI* by removing the depreciation of foreign-owned capital assets in Ireland, especially the depreciation on intellectual property assets.  They depreciate quite rapidly so that is a huge amount in the difference.  The second major adjustment is to exclude the profit inflows of firms that have redomiciled to Ireland.  This is the so-called inversion issue.  The profits of these firms do not accrue to Irish residents.  They are ultimately paid in the form of dividends to their foreign owners.  That is not Irish income so that is the second adjustment.  The biggest one, however, is the depreciation of foreign owned capital assets.</p></speech>

We hear about a recovering economy but would Mr. Moran agree that we have to be careful in terms of how we spend money?  At budget time we have debates in the political sphere regarding how we spend money on cutting taxes and so forth, but as we still have a high level of debt compared with other countries would he agree that we need to be cautious?</p></speech>

This is why so much effort is put into the production of things such as the annual debt report.  We need to do that because debt to GDP, which is the legally required measure, is a misleading indicator of our position regarding our national indebtedness.  One is better off looking at different ones, which include GNI*, and metrics such as borrowings <i>per capita</i>or whatever, because our nominal debt of over &euro;200 billion has not gone down.  It has only gone down in terms of growth and, indeed, by reference to one piece of exceptional growth in 2015.  Debt should be one of the things we keep the closest eye on in terms of making plans for the future, certainly minimising what we add to it on an annual basis or ideally reducing it over time.</p></speech>

There was a referendum on the fiscal compact rules.  That is the framework under which we are working.

If it was just for reporting purposes, that would be fine because in a report one can have debt-to-GDP, debt-to-GNI, debt-to-GNI* and so on.  That is fine.  However, it is not just for reporting; it is for the implementation of rules which have an impact on my job and that of Deputies Catherine Murphy and Catherine Connolly, as legislators, in terms of the fiscal space which is available.  It is not just the fiscal space, it is whether or not we meet the mid-term review and the targets that are being set.  It has implications for the State implementing fiscal rules which have an impact on our ability to spend and borrow.</p></speech>

There must be a more complex consideration of the underlying performance of the economy and the metrics rather than a reliance on that potentially misleading figure.</p></speech>

However, there is huge interest at academic conferences and among policy makers across Europe and at the IMF and so on because issues such as contract manufacturing and intellectual property, IP, onshoring are beginning to affect other countries.  We are at the coal face but other countries are beginning to come to us to discuss these metrics because although they are not affected to the same extent, it is coming down the line.  The globalisation of the economy is increasing and IP is very mobile.  Although we are at the coal face, it is an issue for all advanced economies and other countries will have to deal with it at some stage.</p></speech>

I wish academics well and I am sure it is very interesting for them.  However, policy makers are key to this issue.  Has there been any interaction between the Department of Finance or the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the European Commission in regard to using GNI*?  If it is the accepted position of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and the Secretary General of the Department of Finance, Mr. Moran, that GDP is, as has been said, irrelevant, unrealistic and not to be depended upon and that GNI* is more appropriate, have we made any recommendations that this is not a one-size-fits-all situation and that debt to GNI, which would be a more accurate reflection of our debt versus what is happening in the economy, be used instead?</p></speech>

If one looks at the launch of the stability programme update, Mr. McCarthy and his colleagues have looked at the measurement issue in terms of where we are in the cycle and, importantly, whether we are in a healthy position, and have developed alternative methodologies which strongly support an endorsement by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council of being a far better tool for determining where we are in the cycle and, therefore, being far more germane to policy making.</p></speech>

I understand Deputy Cullinane's argument on GDP.  Having this bespoke measurement is well and good at official level.  However, has it been discussed at Council of Ministers meetings?  Have they agreed that GDP is the official position but the GNI* figure will also be considered because Ireland is a unique case?  Has that been discussed at the Council of Ministers?</p><p>Yes.</p></speech>

It is only available at the moment in nominal terms so we do not know what the real growth rate of GNI* was, even last year or the year before, because the figures are not available yet because it is difficult to deflate and so forth.  We use GNI* for domestic purposes and because we think it is more relevant to assess fiscal variables on that basis.  It has no legal standing at a European level.  However, where it is discussed at a European level is when the Commission does its post-programme surveillance reports on Ireland every six months.  It will get to GDP, on which Ireland complies, and then get to GNI* where Ireland has still high indebtedness and that is discussed by Ministers.  I stress that there is no legal basis for GNI*.  EUROSTAT has a legal basis for GDP and GNI but not for GNI*.</p></speech>

To address the issue of the IBRC, there is an ongoing case and the witness was not in a position to appear before the committee when we last discussed the matter.  I was extremely frustrated by the way in which the issue was handled at that meeting because we were essentially told by the relevant officials that, on account of the ongoing case, they had been legally advised not to answer questions.  This was not much different from the answers given to parliamentary questions on 7 and 11 September 2017, which pre-dated the legal case, in terms of the level of scrutiny of the IBRC liquidation.  The statement of claim had not been made at that stage as it occurred only a few days before the meeting took place.  However, the statement of claim would have issues now.</p><p>I do not have the transcript with me for that section of the meeting.

Obviously this is going to cost money.  May I ask formally would the Department consider allowing this committee to make contact with the plaintiff's representatives and see if questions we can put in this forum might satisfy and avoid litigation?  It would cost the State very substantially less to do it in this forum if those questions could be asked.  It seems to me that the questions I was posing the last day to Mr. Carville would be precisely the ones that somebody would be getting ten grand a day to ask down in the Law Library.</p></speech>

Before we suspended we were talking about the stuff that came up when Mr. Carville was in the last day and I made a number of suggestions.  In particular, I asked if we could see the contract with the special liquidator even in private session.  The Chairman pointed out it was possible for us to view documents in private session which would not be published.  Mr. Carville said he would check it out and come back to us.  We also asked for the minutes of meetings on the updates.  In 2016, there were eight such update meetings.  At that stage in December, there had only been three in 2017.  The commentary around that was it was up and running so there was less of a need for meetings.  I asked for the minutes of those and minutes of meetings between the Minister and any officials to do with the costings or fees.  Mr. Carville was going to check all of those.  Speaking outside the ring, the secretariat has said it was an oversight not to include it in the letter that went to the Department but it said to look at the transcript.  Mr. Moran and others must have missed it when they were looking at the transcript.</p></speech>

It is hugely frustrating that in parliamentary questions and committee meetings two reasons are given.  One is legal advice and the other is commercial sensitivity.  We all have our individual definitions of commercial sensitivity.  It seems to be the Department can procure whatever legal advice it is looking for.  If I want legal advice to say the Department is able to tell me that, I am sure I can get a solicitor to give it to me because it is an arguable thing.  It is very frustrating from our point of view.  In our report of activity, which was published at the end of the year, Mr. Moran will no doubt have noted we made a recommendation on the establishment of a committee of inspection, which would have been similar.  What is the Department's position on that recommendation?</p></speech>

My concern with a committee of inspection - I appreciate Mr. Moran will say he cannot answer this but I want to put it on the record again - is there are a number of people in the Department responsible for the liquidation.</p><p>This was the biggest liquidation in the history of the State and it probably compares reasonably well in size to some of the biggest funds in Europe, if not the world.  I ask the witnesses to tell me if they cannot answer this question.  When we worked on the Act we extracted the need for a committee of inspection that would have overseen fees, who got paid when and how many hours were being put into what task.  It could have questioned matters and if there was a dispute it could have gone to the High Court.  Is this the procedure in regular liquidations?</p></speech>

We just have a situation whereby the Minister has powers to issue directions.  However, we established the last day that no such directions have been issued, and Mr. Carville suggested I was stretching it to conclude this did not mean there were any queries on fees or numbers of hours.  One of my key questions the last day was if the Department is being billed for three accountants doing repetitive relatively menial work, who is saying that only a junior is needed to do this or are there people saying this?  Mr. Carville said he could not answer that because it was very specific to the case.  It is obviously a huge concern that we have a level of expertise.  This is not to impugn the qualifications or efforts of anybody in the Department, but the fear here is there might be a level of autopilot.  Liquidators pay themselves in the normal way, through recoveries and sales, and this is retrospectively approved by the Department or the Minister.  With such huge amounts of money at stake this is the concern.</p></speech>

In a minute I will come to Mr. Moran's statement and try to get to the heart of what constitutes a thriving economy.  I have made this point before and I will make it again today, and if I see Mr. Moran before me again I will make it again.  He made an opening statement to say the key economic indicators point to continued solid growth this year, and there are almost two pages on this.  He stated the robust pace of the recovery in the Irish economy continued in 2017, that it is broadly based and that the economic fundamentals are strong.  On a practical level I have a great problem with this.  I have mentioned the housing figures previously.</p><p>How could an economy be thriving when we have a housing crisis?  The word "crisis" no longer covers it.  Would Mr. Moran accept that more than 10,000 people are homeless, and that the figure is rising?  Can he explain to me how he can say that the figures are fundamentally correct?  Are the more than 10,000 who are homeless just collateral damage?</p></speech>

If she notes what I said, I believe I refer to GDP just once and then point to the real indicators of economic wellbeing including more people at work, underlying demand on the economy and falling unemployment.

Until now, we were not allowed spend money on housing because that was throwing money at the economy or inflating the economy; all of those words were used.

I am trying to get my head around it.  What type of economy do we have when we have a major housing crisis in Galway?  Dublin is mentioned frequently but in Galway, people are on a waiting list since 2002 because we have not built a single social house since 2009.  I prefer to use the term "public house" because public housing should be available for everybody.  Is it good economics that not one social house has been built in Galway when in 2017 we gave &euro;152 million for the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme?  We increased that up to &euro;301 million in 2018.  Is that not throwing money at private landlords and vulture funds and overheating the rental market?</p></speech>

Economists and financial people talk about not overheating the market or throwing money into the market and making a bad situation worse but I am looking at a figure of &euro;301 million going into a rental market that clearly is not sustainable.  It continues to rise.  Most people are evicted for non-payment of rent, as I understand the figures, and not for non-payment of a mortgage, which is also big, but has a huge focus.  They are evicted for non-payment of rent and we are now putting &euro;301 million into the private landlord market.  Is that not overheating the market?  Mr. Moran can disagree with me; I do not mind.</p></speech>

It is lifting off a very low base and coming on again.</p> <p>  On the social housing side, the increase in money available for capital housing has grown from about &euro;800 million a year to &euro;1.8 billion between 2016 and 2018.  The resources are there, and part of the budget is about having the money and making the choices about where we put it and there are strong indications that very strong choices have been made in terms of putting it into social housing and addressing these problems.</p> <p>  When people talk about overheating, they talk about the economy at large.  They are not picking one sector.  One cannot put money in everywhere.  One prioritises, and if the priority is housing then the money is put into housing but one chooses not to put money elsewhere.</p></speech>

Mr. Moran is using the market language to justify something yet when it comes to the GDP, it is a very serious game.  I am not saying Mr. Moran is playing a game but he is being forced to play a game.  He is actually not complying with the law in regard to GDP.  As a country we are not complying with our obligations yet when it comes to housing, it is not put into Mr. Moran's statement that housing is a huge risk.  It is not put in anywhere in his statement.  I might have missed it because I have been in and out of the room.  Is it a good economic indicator to put that much money into the private system that is already overheated in my opinion?  It is a simple question.</p></speech>

One is the level of GNI*, which has been discussed before.  It is like GNP, it is not distorted as much as GDP.  The level of GNI* goes in and there is a complex calculation which relates to harmonised VAT to calculate our contribution, but that is a much smaller input into the overall formula.  GNI* per capita is the most important metric, which is an indication of how wealthy each individual is.  We put a lot in whereas some of the less wealthy eastern European companies would put in less.</p></speech>

Let us face it, neither the Deputy's income nor my own went up by 26% which is what GDP is supposed to measure in theory.  That is why we had a group under the Governor of the Central Bank looking at what would be a better measure of income per capita - I sat on the group - and that is where we came up with GNI*.  I do not know if it is in the figures that the Deputy is looking at but they do not go up by anything like those rates.</p></speech>

However, we are seeing a number of other issues going on now.  The Deputy may have heard of the concept of contract manufacturing to which the Minister has referred several times.  That is production which takes place in China but for statistical reasons is included in the Irish national accounts, and correctly so because, I stress, GDP is compiled in lines with best standards.  There are quite a lot of distortions in the number which is why we have had the discussions with Deputies Cullinane and Connolly about GDP being problematic.  It is compiled properly but as an indicator of how our living standards are changing, it is not particularly good and has not been for the past five or six years.</p></speech>

Our corporation tax of 12.5% is under pressure.  The EU has been at it this week too.  The President of France wanted to change the rules and regulations and that would have an effect on us.</p> <p>  What is the officials' opinion on how we can protect our rate of 12.5 %?  Will we be able to hold out against the big powers in Europe to protect the 12.5% corporation tax?  I would be happy if everyone paid 12.5% but some pay only 3%, 4% or 5% with sweetheart deals.  They can invest in education or other things to offset the money they should pay. </p></speech>

We came under our biggest pressure on the corporation tax rate at the start of the crisis when, I will not call it a threat, but there was an observation that if we wanted help that this might have been a price to pay.</p><p>One of the fundamentals of the Irish economic model is that it is an exporting economy that relies on foreign direct investment and exports to the world.  If we were going to recover, this had to be part and parcel of the formula.  We have seen various tax harmonisation proposals that have come around, most notably the common consolidated corporate tax base proposal.

To be honest, this is far less about the rate than it is about other factors.  The US has introduced its first piece of reform since 1986 or 1987.  It has reduced its rate to 21% or 23%.  It has provided for the repatriation of profits from abroad.  US multinationals were not obliged to bring their profits back to the US.  They were expected to do so at one stage, but they were entitled to defer it.  The money would come and we would tax the proportion of income that applied to Ireland.  Then the money was just out there.  Some major companies with tens of billions of statements are now saying they have a liability to the US Internal Revenue Service and will be repatriating that money to the US.  That is a good thing for the international tax environment.</p></speech>

Many international tax rules have stayed pretty much the same for the past 50 years.  Many of them were developed by the OECD when someone who wanted to have a business in a country needed to have a bricks-and-mortar building in that country.  With the advent of digitalisation and the Internet, there is no need to have a physical presence in a country in order to trade in that country.  Many of the international tax rules that were designed by the OECD have been under discussion and debate at international level for many years.  Deputies may have heard of the base erosion and profit shifting project, which is all about trying to get an international consensus on how international tax rules can be changed to reflect that fact that business has changed so dramatically.  Ireland is very important in that context because there are so many Internet companies, etc., based here.  Our colleagues in the Revenue Commissioners and some of our own tax colleagues in the Department have been influencing those discussions at OECD level.  In general, we are reasonably happy with the way the OECD discussions have been going, although there are times when we do not agree with what is said.</p></speech>

We believe the world is changing, particularly with regard to digitisation.  The best way to proceed is by means of multilateral action in which all countries move together internationally.  Action should not be taken by one group, one region or an individual country.  That would cause a huge amount of concern.

The finger is being pointed at us.  Many international companies were coming here, selling into Europe and bringing their profits here.  It was suggested that Ireland was a low-tax destination.

The advantage this offers to multinationals is at least comparable to, if not more important than, the tax status of this country.  The position is changing all the time.  I would not be unduly pessimistic.</p></speech>

It was unavoidable.  I want to mention two issues that have been touched on in the last few minutes while I have been in attendance.  Mr. Moran spoke about the capacity of the State to defend its position with regard to our robust tax system, among other things.  I want to focus on the digital taxation proposal.  I am fairly confident that despite international pressures, we will not have a difficulty with adjusting our corporation tax rate.  I figure that we have been through the worst of it.  Although that pressure may be sustained, it is highly likely that it is lessening somewhat.  Deputy Aylward hit the nail on the head when he said the potential exists for digital taxation and transactional taxation to have an impact on us.  Have we done any studies on that?  Has the Department or any other State body looked at the potential impacts on our economy?</p></speech>

The Revenue Commissioners, in conjunction with the Department, will look at the negative impact this would have if it were to become a reality.  We will work our way through that bit by bit.  The nature of the way these things are done at European level means there could well be considerable differences between the proposal we go in with and the proposal we come out with.  The real risk with this goes beyond taxation.  There is a view in the US that if a threshold of &euro;750 million of turnover applies to the charge on digital companies advertising in countries, that will confine this measure to American companies.  There is a real risk of a retaliatory response from the US if this were to happen.</p></speech>

Europe is very wary of the US on trade and the US is very sceptical of Europe on tax.  There is a long way to go on this.  It is not remotely straightforward.  The 3% levy that is being proposed as a turnover tax is based on a global turnover of &euro;750 million.</p><p>This tends to bring it down to very specific companies and they tend to be US owned.

The potential knock-on effects of what they propose - Mr. Macron in particular - will not be beneficial to the EU.  It will be beneficial to France and Germany.  Part of me is very much in favour of what the EU does and how it does it but parts of this discussion trouble me because it is clearly national protectionist and it does not benefit the EU as a whole.  It would have a considerable impact if the model Emmanuel Macron, in particular, was looking at were introduced.</p></speech>

I refer to the management of the national debt.  What do we do in the event of an international downturn or an all out trade war between China and the US and its implications for the EU and Ireland?  We like to say we are in the heart of Europe but we are a small island off the edge of it.  That is a problem in these potential scenarios.  I refer to protecting Irish taxpayers and the ability of the State to meet its multi-annual demands over a generation to get from that figure of &euro;206 billion.  Some of the figures I was looking at are fairly static over the last few years.  I refer to page one on the Government debt.  It shows that figure plateauing in or around &euro;200 billion since 2013.  It was not far off it in 2012.  What projections have the witnesses made in respect of the ability of the State, on an ongoing multi-annual basis, to not just meet its minimum payment but to be able to reduce it in any kind of meaningful way?  What sort of net impact is it foreseen to have on the domestic economy?</p></speech>

We have replaced it with much cheaper debt.  We have been trying to take those opportunities every time they have arisen.  The best thing for us is managing a sensible budgetary position over a period of time to make sure debt is not increasing.  It is ticking up over the forecast horizon to &euro;208 billion or &euro;209 billion, there or thereabouts.</p></speech>

That is a real domestic threat.  We are approaching the top of the current economic cycle and there will be a place on the way down on the other side where pressures will come on spending on employment, unemployment and all those sorts of things which will add to this debt.  That is why last year we produced for the first time an annual debt report.  We do think it is one of the more important things and we should not lose focus on it.  If we go back to the very long conversations, we have had GDP as a benchmark.  If we take debt as a proportion of GDP it all looks very healthy.  That is because of distortions in the level of GDP.</p> <p>  However, the reality is - and the Deputy is absolutely right - the nominal level of debt is not changing.  It is slightly ticking upwards.  It is not going up alarmingly but it is going up.  Mr. McCarthy ran three scenarios last year.  I refer to a GDP shock and a slow down in the world economy, an interest rate shock and then a combination of the two.  They show the debt to be sustainable on either of the first two but we really come under pressure if we get both an interest rate shock and a GDP shock.  We would come under pressure and the debt ratio would start to go back up again.  </p></speech>

If there is a shock to what is going on in the economy, we do not have much exposure to an interest rate shock.  That is because between 80% and 90% of the debt, taking into account interest rate hedging, is at fixed rates.  The National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, has been able to lock in money at very low rates.  It is something we identify and the Minister has spoken about it on numerous occasions.  He mentioned a figure, as the Deputy said, of about &euro;40,000 for every man, woman and child in the State.  What is positive, if we can take anything positive from this, is that because of the NTMA debt management operations, the average interest rate on the debt is down to 2.7%.  The debt maturity profile has been pushed out quite a bit.  The weighted average maturity is about 11 or 12 years.  The norm in the Euro area is about six or seven years.<br/><br/>Debt is manageable but I stress it has to be managed.  What does that mean?  It means not adding any more debt.  It means continuing to keep the interest rate down.  Even when the interest rate cycle turns, we need to keep our spread <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>the bund to an absolute minimum.  I do not want to stray into policy here but we have published this report.  It also means we need structural reforms to improve the growth potential of the economy so that the denominator - GDP, GNI* or whatever - can do some of the heavy lifting as well.  <br/><br/>When we talk about the &euro;206 billion, the NTMA has accumulated about &euro;25 billion or &euro;30 billion in liquid cash assets to meet various amortisation humps that will arise over the next couple of years.  Therefore, for our net debt, about ten percentage points of GDP have to be taken off to get the underlying position.  All debt management offices across Europe will hold debt because it is not possible to go to the market with nothing in one's back pocket.  However, we have quite an amount of cash.  That is a mitigating factor. </p></speech>

We did not manage the debt.  We let our national growth reduce the national debt instead without having paid anything off of it.  Given the level of national debt at the moment, is there a concern, if we continue to grow at significant rates, that debt as a percentage is reduced but not as an actual figure?</p></speech>

In January we published a document on the concentration risks of corporation tax.  We are trying to make sure that people are well informed about whether there is a debt risk, a concentration risk and so on.  At the moment growth means that contributions are coming from every sector.  There is no sign of overheating.  There is no sector dominating us in the way that occurred in the noughties when construction essentially drove the economy.  That is not the case.</p></speech>

Mr McCarthy has been very helpful to the committee.  His knowledge of the issues is quite impressive, and I thank him for sharing.  However, I have concerns, and I hope that someone with his knowledge can help someone like me, a layperson, to understand exactly what is happening here.  I am looking at page 20 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, which says that GNI* is defined by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, as gross national income.  It then discusses the adjustments.  The witness earlier said that the difference between GDP and GNI* is that there are a number of adjustments or exclusions made that would not be included in GDP but that are included in GNI*.  This section seems to suggest that profits of redomiciled firms - where profits go out of the country - is a concern, as are the depreciation of research and development related to intellectual property imports and aircraft leasing.  Do those areas have a distorting impact on GDP?</p></speech>

I asked a parliamentary question on 24 May 2016 and received a response from the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, which I am sure was compiled by civil servants.  I dealt specifically with intangible assets and growth-fixed capital formation and the impact it has on GDP.  The response I received from the Minister stated:</p><blockquote>Aircraft investment, as presented in the annual national accounts, at current market prices by the CSO, is entirely GDP neutral, i.e. for every &euro;1 increase in investments there is a corresponding increase in imports.  The exclusion of aircraft investment would therefore have no impact on the debt to GDP ratio.</blockquote> <p>It goes on to say that the majority of intangible investment is imported.  At that point the Department was saying that there was no difficulty with either aircraft leasing or intangible assets, but yet in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report I am looking at, which looks at the difference between GDP and GNI, the disturbing elements are the profits of redomiciled firms, depreciation, research and development, intellectual property and aircraft leasing.</p></speech>

The parliamentary question refers to investment in aircraft leasing and investment in intangible assets.  What is excluded, as can be seen from the CSO note, is not investment in but the depreciation of intellectual property and aircraft.  The reason they are GDP neutral on the investment side is because they are imported.</p></speech>

I would have been able to see that the investment side does not have any impact, that it is neutral and would not have any distorting impact on GDP, but that the depreciation of the assets would have an impact.</p></speech>

In any event, I still think there was a sleight of hand in how the percentage was calculated.  Can I ask a quick question about the profits of re-domiciled firms?  I am trying to understand that as well.  Let us say that company A makes X in profits, and those profits are taxed in Ireland.  The economic activity which underpin those profits, the production of the goods, takes place outside of Ireland.  However, that is counted, and it is having a distorting effect.  Would that be accurate?</p></speech>

It is having a distorting impact on the national accounts, but in the vast majority of cases we do not get any corporation tax.  Essentially what happens is that there is an inversion.

That is it.  It might not make the goods here.  They are made in Belgium, France or Germany, but the company is in Ireland because of our corporation tax rates, availing of the incentives we give them, including at one point the double Irish.

I ask the witnesses to give me a quick response to this.  The finance accounts clearly show the contributions to the EU as &euro;2 billion to &euro;3 billion per annum.  That is fine.  Why are the contributions to the Irish economy from the EU not reflected there?  I know there is a separate account, and we spoke about consolidation of all the various State accounts.  The payments that come to Irish farmers under the various schemes come directly from Europe.  They do not go through the Central Fund and they are not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  They are audited by the EU auditor.  Why do they not they come through this account?  If the payments to the EU go through this account, why do the receipts from the EU, the &euro;1 billion or so, not do the same?</p></speech>

When representatives of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine were here we asked this question.  Where is all the money coming in?  We could not see it in the Vote for that Department.  The official responded that the Comptroller and Auditor General does not audit it, nor does the Accounting Officer.  It is an EU account audited at EU level.  That is another major account, probably with &euro;1.5 billion going through it, that is not remotely integrated into our finances.  The witnesses know the question I am asking.  I ask them to come back to the committee with a detailed note on that issue.</p> <p>  I also wish to address the debt.  The witnesses show that the debt is to increase slightly during the next couple of years, by a couple of billion euro.  I take it that the State is running a current account surplus?</p></speech>

Thereafter, the cruising speed of the economy will be about 3%.  In the medium term our best estimate is that we can probably grow the economy at about 3% per annum.  Therefore, it is sustainable, but there is always the possibility of a surprise, be it positive or negative.  At this time, the economy is in good shape.</p></speech>

The reason for that is - Professor John Fitzgerald and others have written about this and are absolutely correct - their global profits are transferred into Ireland via the profit inflows in a national accounting sense.

Now there are issues about whether we will actually balance the budget in 2018, but the Minister was crystal clear, when he and I were at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight yesterday, that even if we did not, he was going to go ahead and capitalise the rainy day fund with a sum of &euro;500 million.

The Minister now wants to wait until the summer economic statement this year before he will make any statement on that.</p></speech>

When the &euro;2.6 billion that has been committed is taken into account, the deficit for next year is 0.1%.  We are improving from 0.2% this year to 0.1% next year.  It is flat.  This goes back to our discussion on debt and whether one starts to borrow money to spend.  There is a long way between now and a budget set of decisions and the metrics change etc.  It raises the question about whether, on the basis of the set of numbers that are available at this time, we borrow to do more or we make choices around reprioritisation and so on.  There is a way to go on this.</p></speech>

We are talking about the national debt ratio moving down.  When the recession hit, did the countries that had a low debt to GDP ratio fare any better?  At the time we referred to it as GDP before GNI* was introduced.  I understand that there was no real benefit when things fell.  Did the low GDP to debt ratio of certain countries have any positive effect on their outcomes?  I may be wrong on that.  Countries, for example, with astronomical national debt managed fine.</p></speech>

Ireland went in with a debt ratio of 15%, in net terms, of GDP.  The Deputy is quite right to say GDP because we did not have these distortions then.  The headline figure was 25% but we had 10% of GDP in the National Pensions Reserve Fund at the time.  We went in with a low debt ratio, but our outcome was horrendous.  Consider Italy, for example, which went in with a high debt.  On foot of that Italy has had to be very restrictive in its fiscal policies.  It can do nothing.  The Italian GDP is still below its pre-crisis level.  Its debt ratio is now 130% of GDP.  This is because it did not have the fiscal buffers to smooth the shock.  Estonia and Luxembourg, however, had no problems accessing markets because they had debt ratios of 10% to 15%.  They were still able to borrow, in some cases at negative interest rates.  Their GDP did not suffer as much as countries that went in with a high debt ratio.</p></speech>

A lot of bonds will be maturing.  That cash is needed now because when the time comes to repay, for example &euro;10 billion, Ireland will have that money ready rather than going to the market two days before the repayment is due when the markets would charge more.  It would be a "name your price" situation.  This is why the NTMA has built up this cash and it is sitting on deposit in various commercial banks or the Central Bank.  It will be used to refinance the debt that matures.  I believe a big bond is to mature in October of this year.  In 2019 and 2020 a lot of bonds will mature.</p></speech>

It was introduced with symbolic and substantive intentions and seeks to focus attention on the urgent need to increase climate action and ambition, including the need to accelerate the phasing out of fossil fuels if the temperature limits adopted in the Paris Agreement are to be achievable.  It is also a direct response to the commitment signed up to by the Government under Article 2 of the Paris Agreement to bring financial flows into line with decarbonisation commitments.</p><p>The context of the need for a significant increase in ambition in Ireland is worth noting.  Our Climate Change Advisory Council, CCAC, stated in its November 2017 annual report that Ireland was not on a pathway to economy-wide decarbonisation by 2050.  It also stated: &quot;However, to achieve Ireland&rsquo;s objective of decarbonisation, major new policies and measures, along with changes in current practices are required.&quot;</p><p>In November 2017, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, said in a press statement that the overall emission trends were increasing, making the achievement of Ireland's long-term decarbonisation goals more difficult.  In <i>The Irish Times</i>in January, Mr. Joseph Curtin, a senior research fellow at the Institute of International and European Affairs, IIEA, and a member of the CCAC, wrote: &quot;Ireland has failed to get to grips with its climate targets.  Over the past month, the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly, the Climate Change Advisory Council, and the Environmental Protection Agency have all called for urgent new measures to meet Ireland&rsquo;s climate obligations.&quot;</p><p>There are high levels of public and political support and the passage of this Bill on Second Stage received significant international media interest.  There have been a considerable number of high-profile fossil fuel divestment decisions in recent years, including by major universities such as Trinity College Dublin and NUI Galway, and by major cities across the world.  Even the Rockefeller Foundation, a family fortune built on the extraction of fossil fuels, has announced divestment.  In late 2017, the World Bank announced that it would no longer fund upstream oil and gas from 2019.  In January 2018, New York became the most recent major city to announce its intention to divest.  This Bill would make Ireland the first state to divest itself from fossil fuels and secure that commitment in legislation.</p><p>The Bill has never been about questioning the performance of our institutions, the intentions of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, or any Government agency.  It is about the fact that we all need to do much more at all levels if we are to deliver on the commitments that were made in everyone's interests in the Paris Agreement.</p><p>I will take this opportunity to offer my thanks to the Department of Finance officials who were helpful during my negotiations with them in recent weeks - Mr. Eoin Brogan, Mr. Anthony Malone and Mr. Brendan Coogan - and Ms Emma Jane Joyce from the ISIF.  There may be some others whom I have left out, but I thank them all for their work on this matter.  From Tr&oacute;caire, I thank Ms Cliona Sharkey, Ms Niamh Garvey and Ms Selina Donnelly.  From the Global Legal Action Network, GLAN, I thank Mr. Gerry Liston.  All of these people have done Trojan work in getting this Bill ready for Committee Stage.</p><p>Before I forget, I will thank my PA as well for her important work.</p></speech>

(1) In this section--<blockquote>&lsquo;fellow subsidiary undertakings&rsquo;, &lsquo;higher holding undertaking&rsquo;, &lsquo;holding undertaking&rsquo; and &lsquo;undertaking&rsquo; have the same meanings as they have, respectively, in section 275 of the Companies Act 2014;<br /><br />&lsquo;fossil fuel&rsquo; means coal, oil, natural gas, peat or any derivative thereof intended for use in the production of energy by combustion;<br /><br />&lsquo;fossil fuel business&rsquo; means an undertaking which is--<blockquote>(a) engaged, for the time being, in the exploration for or extraction or refinement of a fossil fuel where that activity is not an incidental or marginal part of the business of that undertaking, or<br /><br />(b) a holding undertaking or, as the case may be, a higher holding undertaking of an undertaking or undertakings of the kind referred to in paragraph (a) where the turnover of that undertaking or those undertakings comprises at least 15 percent of relevant turnover;</blockquote>&lsquo;group of undertakings&rsquo; means an undertaking or undertakings of the kind referred to in part (a) of the definition of fossil fuel business together with its fellow subsidiary undertakings;<br /><br />&lsquo;investment&rsquo; includes both debt-based and equity-based investment and cognate words shall be construed accordingly;<br /><br />&lsquo;relevant turnover&rsquo; means the turnover of a group of undertakings in the most recently completed financial year of the holding undertaking or, as the case may be, of the higher holding undertaking thereof;<br /><br />&lsquo;turnover&rsquo; in relation to an undertaking or a group of undertakings means the amounts of revenue derived from the provision of goods and services falling within the undertaking&rsquo;s or group of undertaking&rsquo;s ordinary activities, after deduction of--<blockquote>(a) trade discounts,<br /><br />(b) value-added tax, and<br /><br />(c) any other taxes based on the amounts so derived.</blockquote>(2) The definition of a fossil fuel business in subsection (1) may, by a regulation adopted by the Minister pursuant to this subsection, be expanded to include any type of activity engaged in by an undertaking that relates in any way to the use of a fossil fuel.<br /><br />(3) (a) The Agency shall endeavour to avoid the direct investment of the assets of the Fund in a fossil fuel business.<br /><br />(b) Where the assets of the Fund are directly invested in a business which is or becomes a fossil fuel business, the Agency shall divest itself of its investment in that business at the first point in time at which it becomes possible to do so without causing the Fund to incur a contractual penalty for doing so.<br /><br />(4) The Agency shall avoid making any investment of the assets of the Fund in a collective investment undertaking or investment product at any time after the commencement of this section unless, having exercised due diligence, it is satisfied that there is not a significant probability that the assets of the Fund will be invested in a fossil fuel business.<br /><br />(5) Notwithstanding subsections (3) and (4), the Agency may invest the assets of the Fund in a fossil fuel business or in a collective investment undertaking or investment product which thereafter invests its assets in a fossil fuel business, where--<blockquote>(a) the making of such an investment by the Agency contributes to the achievement by the State of the national transition objective as defined in section 3 of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 (hereafter the &lsquo;national transition objective&rsquo;), the implementation of any existing or future obligations of the State referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 2 of that Act (hereafter the &lsquo;State&rsquo;s climate change obligations&rsquo;) and the implementation of the policy of the Government on climate change,<br /><br />(b) prior to the making of an investment pursuant to this section, the Agency conducts or procures the conducting of an assessment of the extent to which the making of such an investment would contribute to the achievement by the State of the national transition objective, the implementation of the State&rsquo;s climate change obligations and the policy of the Government on climate change or, where such an assessment has been conducted by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the environment, has regard to that assessment, and<br /><br />(c) no later than two months prior to the making of an investment pursuant to this subsection, the Agency publishes on the internet the assessment referred to in paragraph (b).</blockquote>(6) When publishing, in accordance with paragraph (c) of subsection (5), an assessment referred to in paragraph (b) of that subsection, the Agency may redact such part thereof as is necessary, and for such time as is necessary, to ensure the protection of commercially sensitive information or to ensure compliance by the Agency with any other provision of law for the time being in force.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote> <p>This is a substantial amendment, so I will take a few minutes to go through its rationale.  Amendment No. 1 includes the proposal to replace the term &quot;company&quot; with &quot;business&quot; throughout the Bill.  The term &quot;company&quot;, as explicitly provided for by section 37 of the National Treasury Management (Amendment) Act 2014, refers to one particular type of business entity, but there are other types of business arrangement or entity that are excluded from this definition, for example, partnerships.</p><p>In response to concerns raised ahead of and during scrutiny stage about the breadth and definitions of the original Bill, a number of amendments have been made to the definition of &quot;fossil fuel&quot; and &quot;fossil fuel company&quot;.  These definitions and their implications for the scope of the Bill should be viewed together.  The inclusion of &quot;intended for use in the production of energy by combustion&quot; is one of the changes proposed to ensure that companies whose operations involve fossil fuels for non-combustion purposes clearly call outside the scope of the Bill.  Furthermore, the definition of &quot;fossil fuel business&quot; makes it clear that domestic or commercial combustion of fossil fuels falls outside the scope of the Bill except where commercial activities also include exploration, extraction or refining.  The proposed definition of &quot;fossil fuel&quot; covers a closed, comprehensive list, including coal, oil, natural gas and peat.</p><p>The proposed subsection (1)(a) introduces a definition for &quot;fossil fuel business&quot; that has been drafted in co-operation with the Department of Finance, taking into account the committee's discussion and recommendations on scrutiny stage.  The Bill as originally drafted included a definition of &quot;fossil fuel business&quot; as a company whose business either wholly or partly engaged in exploration, extraction, refining, processing or delivery of fossil fuels.  Further to the committee's discussion, I had developed a proposal to replace &quot;partly&quot; with &quot;mainly&quot; and to include a reference to &quot;for the purpose of combustion for energy&quot; in order to tighten the definition to address the concerns raised about the potential administrative burden and unintended consequences of the original broad definition.</p><p>I also proposed the removal of the word &quot;processing&quot; which I recognise could be open to wide interpretation.  I was also open to agreeing a threshold to define the word &quot;mainly&quot;, this being a suggestion put forward on the scrutiny stage by the Department.  Together, these proposals represented a significant tightening of the definition from the outset of engagement.  The threshold of 15% relevant turnover for a holding undertaking in the proposed section 49A1(b) is a proposal from the Department that I was happy to accept.<br/><br/>In subsequent engagement with the Department and the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, it was highlighted that the administrative burden of screening for companies involved in exploration, extraction, refining and delivery would be high and have potential unintended consequences, capturing, for example, many SMEs which are not the target of this Bill.  I have thus accepted significant further tightening of the Bill, restricting the company activities falling under the Bill to &quot;exploration, extraction and refinement&quot;.  This is also reflected in the Government's amendments.<br/><br/>With regard to subsection (2), in light of the significant tightening of the definition of &quot;fossil fuel company&quot; in the original Bill, changing the wording from &quot;exploration, extraction, refining, processing or delivery of fossil fuels&quot; to &quot;exploration, extraction and refining&quot;, this provision allows the Minister to expand this definition as she or he sees fit.  This is part of ensuring that this legislation can remain relevant as the transition advances.  While this legislation can be the first of its kind in the world, in ten or even five years the definition of &quot;fossil fuel company&quot; as currently drafted could be outdated.  To ensure continued momentum, the Minister could have the capacity to expand, and not contract, the definition as he or she considers appropriate.<br/><br/>With regard to subsection (3), the divestment provisions have been amended to make explicitly clear that the fund will not be expected to break contractual obligations or incur costs as a result of breaking contracts.  This formulation highlights these such costs as distinct from normal transaction costs occurring with normal investment cycles.<br/><br/>The indirect provision is worded differently in recognition of the different role and control of ISIF in managing its indirect investments.  It establishes the obligation to pursue fossil fuel-free indirect investment within the scope of the now significantly tightened definition of &quot;fossil fuel business&quot; under the Bill.  It recognises the need to exercise due diligence at the outset of each indirect investment.<br/><br/>With regard to subsection (5), in response to the recommendation in the pre-legislative scrutiny report that the Bill not limit the ability of ISIF to support the transition, my first amendment proposals included two flexibility provisions.  The first provision would allow ISIF to invest in companies captured by the Bill where this is explicitly to support them to transition away from being a fossil fuel business.  The second was a broader provision allowing for investment in fossil fuel companies to continue where this was contributing to the national transition objective, the national climate change policy and the State's climate change obligations.<br/><br/>Based on discussions with the legal division of the Department, it was accepted that one provision should go forward that provided the broader flexibility for ISIF to invest where it contributes to the national transition objective etc.  While we think it would have been a strength of the Bill to have a provision explicitly state that fossil fuel companies seeking to transition away from fossil fuels would be eligible for investment, it was accepted that, given the broader flexibility provided by the second provision, which allows for investment where the end date is unknown, as with gas, it could result in a superfluous provision.  This compromise, to have one broad flexibility provision, is reflected in subsection (5)(b).<br/><br/>To ensure the flexibility provision does not render the divestment provisions meaningless, I had included a provision that would oblige the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment to confirm the extent to which the investment contributes to the national transition objective, the national climate policy and the State's climate change obligations, publishing an assessment to this end three months before the investment decision.  Further to consultation with the Department, it has been understood that this would compromise the governance arrangements of the ISIF and its relationship to public expenditure.  On this basis, I have put forward a similar provision requiring that an assessment be conducted and be made publicly available, but with a focus on ISIF only, excluding political involvement entirely.  It requires ISIF to conduct an assessment of the extent to which the investment would contribute to the delivery of the national transition objective, the State's climate change targets and the Government policy on climate change.  Where relevant assessment has been conducted by the Department, ISIF may have regard to this.<br/><br/>ISIF already conducts <i>ex ante</i>ESG assessments, including on carbon intensity where relevant, for its investments, so the basis for such assessments exists.  With the commitment in the programme for Government for a national dialogue on climate action and the commitment that preceded this in the 2015 energy White Paper for an energy forum to enable citizens to engage in debates on the State's energy future, making this information publicly available in advance of decisions being taken is considered a reasonable objective.  In view of potential commercial sensitivity issues and data protection requirements, publication could be limited to relevant details, with any sensitive information redacted.  That is just an explanation</p></speech>

I am happy to be as facilitating and helpful as I can.</p> <p>  Despite progress made, full agreement on proposed amendments has not been reached, and Deputy Pringle's text contains a number of issues that would make ISIF extremely difficult to operate in terms of investments in Ireland and globally.  The key difficulties with amendment No. 1 can be grouped.  The proposed definition of "fossil fuel" cannot be accepted as it is not sufficiently precise from the Government's viewpoint, with the inclusion of "gas" in the definition not aligned with the State's climate change and energy policy.  Gas is key in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.  The amendment also provides a definition for a "fossil fuel business", which includes the terms "exploration", "extraction" and "refinement".  It is positive that the definition no longer mentions "processing" and "delivery".</p> <p>  When considering these proposed amendments, it is important to consider that the ISIF discretionary portfolio has two key components: first, the Irish portfolio, which includes the direct and indirect investments by ISIF in support of its mandate; and second, the global portfolio, which includes the balance of ISIF in advance of its investment in Ireland.  At present, the funds in the global portfolio are invested in funds to earn a return until the funds are required for investment in projects in Ireland.</p> <p>  In this time of negative interest rates and negative returns, it is a challenge for the global portfolio to earn a sufficient low-risk return to ensure that its funds are protected and remain available for investment in Irish projects.  The proposed amendments would make it very difficult for these investments to continue, thus making it more difficult for the ISIF global portfolio to earn a return to protect and maintain these funds.  The committee needs to consider very carefully any proposed amendments that could lead to a loss of State funds.  That said, the prospect of a money Bill being outlined is not being considered here.  What I would like to do is reach a position on which we can all agree rather than propose that this has a financial impact on the State.</p> <p>  In discussions with Deputy Pringle, it has been highlighted that to make the Bill workable, certain thresholds should be inserted that would serve as a cut-off point for ISIF's exposure.  The amendment in this regard seeks a 15% threshold across the full range of fossil fuel exposures.  However, ISIF has advised, based on international experience, that different threshold levels should be applied to each fossil fuel type.  This would provide for varying thresholds in line with carbon emittance, meaning the worst fuels would have lower thresholds.  It is important to note the setting of the higher 50% statutory threshold does not preclude ISIF from setting lower thresholds within its sustainability and responsible investment policy.</p><p>ISIF already has thresholds of 30% for thermal coal and 10% for oil sands, both of which preclude investment in a number of companies.  The setting of these thresholds through the sustainability and responsible investment policy ensures that ISIF can go to lower thresholds on an operational basis without a risking a statutory breach when the level is set at 15% or above.  A wider and even more serious risk is that, as a result of the proposed statutory requirements relating to a Minister making an order-assessment on individual investments, all of ISIF's investments could be brought on-balance sheet.  This would have a significant impact on public expenditure as any spending by ISIF would require a reduction in wider public spending to meet the expenditure benchmark.</p><p> A further complication arises from the requirement for ISIF to publish an assessment of how an investment contributes to the national transition objective two months prior to making that investment.  While the provision allows for the protection of commercially sensitive information, this is not sufficient.  The release into the public domain of any level of detail regarding an investment in advance of its finalisation could expose ISIF to litigation by co-investors or client companies.</p></speech>

The reference should instead be to section 37 of the Act.  While section 2 of the Act outlines the definitions for the Act as a whole, it is section 37 which outlines the definitions in respect of ISIF.  Therefore, any definitions arising out of this Bill should be inserted in section 37.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 3 is a technical drafting change which is necessary to reflect that I am proposing that a number of new definitions be inserted in the section and not just one.  Therefore, the reference to the plural is necessary.  Amendment No. 4 is a technical drafting change which is necessary to reflect that, as per amendment No. 2, the definitions arising from this Bill should be in section 37 and not section 2.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 5 seeks to address the issue posed by the word "partly" whereby minimal levels of exposure to fossil fuels would be captured by the definition of a fossil fuel company.  The amendment seeks to change the definition to "mainly", which would target companies whose main line of business is based on fossil fuels and which are the target of the Bill's provisions.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 seek to address the issue posed by the broad scope of the definition of "fossil fuel company".  They seek to narrow the scope of the definition on the core aspects of fossil fuel activity, which I understand is the ultimate target of the Bill.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 8 seeks to address the concerns that ISIF investments in SMEs could be captured by the existing Bill because such entities are unlikely to be listed companies.  The insertion of this amendment will ensure that the focus will be on the large international fossil fuel companies, which, we assume, is the intention behind the Bill.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 9 is technical and necessary due to the numbering and ordering conventions of legislative drafting.  The Bill proposes a new subsection.  Due to the ordering of section 39 of the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014, this new subsection must be inserted before section 7.  Therefore, this new subsection must be numbered 6(A).</p> <p>  Amendment No. 10 is necessary as the Bill&rsquo;s reference to "direct" and "indirect" appears intended to capture ISIF's Irish and global investments.  However, the labels of "direct" and "indirect" do not refer to the global and Irish portfolios.  Instead, they are types of investment that can feature in both portfolios.  In order to address this, the amendment seeks to remove any ambiguity by clarifying that the provision applies to fossil fuel investments and complements this by inserting elsewhere an appropriate definition for a fossil fuel investment.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 11 is technical and necessary due to the conventions of legislative drafting.  Amendment No. 12 complements amendment No. 10 and is necessary to ensure clarity and consistency regarding ISIF's Irish and global investments.  In order to address this, the amendment seeks to remove any ambiguity by clarifying that the provision applies to fossil fuel investments.  I think amendment No. 13 in the name of Deputy Michael McGrath is next.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-19a.1174" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018041900002#D01200"><p>Deputy Pearse Doherty has supplied some notes on the legislation to me.  I welcome the Bill and the work done by Deputy Pringle.  We support amendment No. 1.  I also welcome the words from the Minister of State that, in general, he would be supportive of it.  However, when he went into the detail, I felt there was a bit of a drawback from that.  One thing that strikes me immediately is when the Minister refers to small and medium-sized businesses.  We had issues with fracking in the north west.  Licences were issued to small companies that came off the shelves.  The idea was that these would be developed and then taken over by the bigger ones.  That is the trend across the world - never mind in Ireland.  The Minister said that there could be a risk of small companies being negatively affected.  Small companies are simply pawns in this game that is being played by the bigger players.  Anyone who takes an objective view of this will realise that.</p> <p>  Deputy Pringle mentioned that there was a lot of symbolism around the broad thrust of what we are doing but symbolism is very important.  I know that, from the beginning, it was Tr&oacute;caire that basically pushed this with many parties and individuals in order to ensure that Ireland would clearly be seen as a place that is lighting a flame and saying that this is the way forward and that the world needs to move away from fossil fuels and towards renewables.  It is also in line with the UN sustainable development goals and many things to which Ireland has signed up.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 1 in the name of Deputy Pringle is excellent and takes care of many of the issues that were raised previously.  The definition of "fossil fuels", which includes fuels intended for use in the production of energy by combustion, goes a very long way to meet any concerns people might have about unintended consequences.  It must be taken alongside the flexibility criteria that have already been added.  Together, these elements positively and carefully address concerns while maintaining the spirit of the Bill.  We have to wonder if anybody opposing these elements is in fact playing matters tactically in order to neuter the Bill while trying to appear as if they are in favour of it.</p> <p>  It is ironic that the Minister for Finance told the Committee on Budgetary Oversight yesterday that he would come back with figures indicating how large will be the EU will levy in respect of the State failing to meet its emissions targets while, today, this committee is trying to limit the effect of a Bill that is a direct consequence of that.  It is not good economics in the long term if we do not move ahead with this.</p> <p>  We think that many of the Minister of State's and Deputy Michael McGrath's amendments are about limiting the usefulness of the Bill.  Other issues are covered by the new section proposed by Deputy Pringle.  We accept amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 4 because they are technical in nature and concern drafting issues.  In respect of their being compatible with the new section proposed by Deputy Pringle, I am sure changes can be made at a later stage.</p><p> We are openminded about amendment No. 4.  The definition proposed by Deputy Pringle talks about activity that is not an incidental or marginal part of the business while the Minister of State proposes the word "mainly" replacing the word "partly" in the original text.  On balance, Deputy Pringle's amendment seems tighter.  Deputy Pringle's amendment is a substantive one.  Passing it would allow for amendment on further Stages.  Amendment No. 1 covers practically everything, so if we could get it through, we would expect the rest to fall.</p><p> The Minister of State's amendments Nos. 6 to 8, inclusive, are covered by the new definition in amendment No. 1.  Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 are designed to limit the effect of the Bill and we oppose them.  Amendments Nos. 9, 11, 14, 15, 17, 18 and 19 are technical amendments and they are stylistic in their approach.  Amendment No. 10 from the Minister of State seeks to delete the phrase "direct or indirect".  This is putting a horse and cart through the Bill and we are opposed to it.</p><p> We hope amendment No. 1 will pass and that the other amendments will fall as a result of that.  The Minister of State has said he will come back on later Stages if he has better suggestions.</p><p> Deputy McGrath's amendment No. 14 is mainly covered in amendment No. 1 and, in any case, excluding SMEs completely goes too far.  As I said at the outset, SMEs are usually used as a means for big companies to come in under the radar.  Section 16 is covered in amendment No. 1.</p><p> The position is that Deputy Pringle's amendment No. 1 represents a fair attempt for taking on board the suggestions and concerns of all sides, including Sinn F&eacute;in, and it should be supported and all other amendments withdrawn so that there will be a clearer vision on the next Stage.  We ask the Minister of State to continue to engage, not on the basis of trying to subvert the primary purpose of the Bill but on the basis of dealing with genuine concerns and technical issues.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Pringle and Tr&oacute;caire for their work on the Bill.  It is one of the most important Bills to come before the D&aacute;il this term.  To be blunt, the Minister of State's response is disappointing.  It is fair enough to wrap it up in the pose of wanting to engage and being willing to engage further.  Let us hope that works out but, as Deputy Kenny said, the substance of what is being said here is not really meeting Deputy Pringle half way in terms of the compromises that clearly have been made and the bending over backwards to address the concerns that have been raised.</p> <p>  I will make three points that the Minister of State might respond to.  First is the issue of unintended consequences.  It is a stock phrase the Government uses when it is opposing something.  It says it is worried about the unintended consequences.  There is a very deep irony here in relying on unintended consequences.  The climate crisis we are dealing with is a crisis of unintended consequences.  Nobody set out to destroy our planet.  Even the top 100 companies, which have been responsible for over 70% of greenhouse gas emissions since 1988, did not set out to destroy the plant; they just set out to make as much profit as possible and they do not care about destroying the planet.  The real unintended consequences of climate change, which is driven by fossil fuel companies which are the biggest greenhouse gas emitters in the world, and which is covered up by the greenhouse gas-fossil fuel lobby, politicians and right-wing parties that refuse to take them on, is horrifying.  It will mean 250,000 additional deaths a year between 2030 and 2050 according to the World Health Organization.  They are the real unintended consequences of climate change and we have the opportunity to do something both substantive in terms of investments but also, most importantly, symbolic that will assist the fight against climate change globally by saying Ireland will divest from fossil fuels.  I ask the Minister of State to take on board those unintended consequences.</p> <p>  Second, more concretely, the Government has a problem with the inclusion of gas as a fossil fuel.  Does the Minister of State accept that gas is a fossil fuel, by any definition?</p></speech>

It is not clean.  It is a fossil fuel.  It might not be quite as dirty as oil but it is not somewhere in between renewable energy and fossil fuels.  It is not the position that wind energy and wave energy are on one side, oil energy on the opposite side and gas somewhere in the middle.  It is a fossil fuel by any definition of what a fossil fuel is.  The only reasonable opposition to the inclusion of gas that the Government could put forward is that it will be used during the transition.  That is covered by Deputy Pringle's amendment No. 1.  To the extent it is being used as a transitional fuel, it is covered and is excluded.  It is in line with Government policy when it talks about fossil fuels.  The reason behind trying to exclude it is to create some kind of special category for gas and to say that gas is somehow not a fossil fuel when it is.  I ask the Minister of State to accept that gas is a fossil fuel by any reasonable definition.</p> <p>  I will pick up on something the Minister of State said about the money message.  Did he say that if we do not reach agreement, the Government will decide this needs a money message and will not give it?</p></speech>

We are now on the path to legislating for this.  Given we are on Committee Stage and given the numbers of Members who supported it on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il, it means we will legislate for this.  It is a real achievement by Deputy Pringle, Tr&oacute;caire and others.  My compulsion is that we get it right.  It is a complicated process and some of the Minister of State's amendments are beneficial in terms of the technical nature of drafting legislation.</p> <p>  I will make a number of points in response to Deputy Pringle's opening statement.  There has been a fair bit of commentary about this Bill.  Why is it the environmental movement is going with this divestment tack?  Why is this a big deal?  One of the reasons it is a big deal is because for 30 or 40 years the environmental movement has been hammering people at the end of the supply chain.  We have been putting all the pressure on consumers asking if they are using the right products and being responsible.  We have been asking if people have the right car or phone, for example, in terms of the materials that are used in it.  There is a broad realisation that the approach is not getting us very far.  It is shaming people and making them feel guilty.  It is not working because we have not achieved the switch away from fossil fuels which we have to do urgently.  There is a broad strategic sense led by organisations such as 350.org and others that we need to start addressing the start of the pipeline and the fossil fuel supply chain and switch it off.  We should do it confident in the knowledge that the alternative, renewable, energy efficiency systems, including the digital, transport and clean energy revolutions that are taking place, are part of the burgeoning new economy where anyone who is in any way smart should be investing.  This is the new industrial revolution.  This is a better, more efficient and cleaner economy and it is where all the money is going.  People in the know know this is happening.  It is only a small part of the economy but if one looks at the margin of investment changes, it is everything.  A total of 90% of new investment is going into this clean area.  Money going into the old legacy area is just the dregs and the last of that.</p> <p>  That is what we are doing.  This is part of a global divestment movement.  It is a fundamentally important approach to the issue of tackling climate change.  Even since the Bill was introduced by Deputy Pringle, there are other examples such as the Norwegian sovereign investment fund which owns 1.5% of global stocks.  It is not small.  It is, admittedly, a fund built up on the basis of oil.  It is a bit rich sometimes when the Norwegians and Scandinavians tell us what goody two shoes they are.  That fund is divesting from all fossil fuels.</p><p>They have indicated they are going to do it later this year.  The UK Government said in December that it will change its entire pension fund rules.  The UK has &pound;2 trillion in pension fund investments and it says it is changing the rules so that people can do fossil fuel divestment.  We are not on our own in doing this, as neighbouring countries want to do it at scale.  We have an urgent need to do it because our reputation, unfortunately, is dire when it comes to climate change, sometimes wrongly, because we are not bad at it as a country.  There are loads of things we are really good at, but our reputation is shot because the Government in the past seven years, in particular, has been acting against climate action in every international arena.  In the European Union negotiations, we used all our political capital to give agriculture a buy-out on climate.  In the European clean energy and new market governance rules and new renewables directives the Government is taking an anti-climate change position and action on every file, despite the fact that we are really good at this new transition economy.  The Government needs to start showing some leadership and change.<br/><br/>While I welcome that the Government has accepted the Bill and that it will be enacted, a couple of things the Minister of State said about the amendments really sound the wrong note.  It was as if I was listening to Shell when I heard him say that gas is the transition fuel.  I am sorry, but that is not the case.  An Oireachtas delegation went to the UN climate negotiations in Bonn last year and we got a presentation from <i>priceofoil.org</i>, which is an international consultancy looking at what exactly it will mean to meet the targets set in the Paris climate agreement.  There was a clear assessment based on a scientific analysis on what was agreed in Paris and what would need to be done to meet it.  It shows that even existing oil and gas fields and coal mines - not including new ones - will have to be restricted.  In other words, it is not just the known fossil fuel reserves in the ground, it is the working mines, oil fields and gas fields.  If we are serious about meeting the climate targets agreed in Paris we are not going to use all of that oil, gas, coal and peat.  In that context, it is not correct to depict gas as a great, clean part of climate transition.  Any country that takes that line is siding with the Russians, the Saudis and the Shells of this world.  It hollers &quot;God, these people do not get it&quot; to anyone interested in climate change.<br/><br/>We will use gas for the next 20 to 30 years because we have a lot of new combined cycle power gas plants and they provide us with a balancing facility and we will import gas and we will use whatever is in the Corrib field for the next five to ten years but we will not get any more gas from our own waters.  We have to manage that, but we will not be doing any new gas projects.  The fact that we are building new gas networks in the midlands is one of the examples of how this Government does not get climate change.  The fact that the Government is even considering a liquified natural gas, LNG, terminal in Shannon and in Cork is an indication that it does not get it.  I am sorry about that.  The Government is not part of the new clean energy revolution.  It is doing damage to our country's reputation.  Gas is not a new, clean energy transition fuel.  It is highly polluting.  Increasingly, international research shows that because methane has such an incredibly high climate change effect, although it is short term, means that gas is not a transition fuel and it should be included with the other fossil fuels.  We should keep this simple.  It should be all fossil fuels.  I am sorry but the Minister of State's amendment just does more damage to our reputation.  Hopefully, if we get it right this will be used as a message that Ireland is turning around and going green and we are leading the way.  In doing that we will attract a huge amount of fund industry and financial services expertise here because we have it here in clean energy solutions.  We attract it here because we are seen as being good at this.  We would restore our reputation, which we can do, but we will not do it if we are talking about gas as a clean option because it is not.  One cannot say that if one is interested in and serious about climate change.<br/><br/>In terms of all the complications the Minister of State cited about the funds, and having a differential rate for various fossil fuels, but it is a case of no more fossil fuels.  All of them must be gone.  It is not possible to say coal is worse than peat which is worse than oil and to have a league table of good and bad fossil fuels, they will all have to go if we are serious about this, and if we are serious about it then the new economy will blossom.  As a country we are really well placed to develop that and to attract huge international funds into this country and manage it and be good at it.  Let us be good at it.  Let us not be like Shell or the former Soviet Union, which is what the Minister of State's comments at the start sounded like to me.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-19a.1187" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1366" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018041900002#F00200"><p>I wish to address a couple of points that were made in response to the amendment, especially by the Minister of State.  The recommendation of 15% is a Government suggestion.  We took that on board from the Government's arguments and included it.  To increase it much further would reduce the effectiveness of the Bill and would not make any sense.  We believe 15% is more than achievable.</p> <p>  In relation to the ministerial requirement for investments, in section 49A(6) we have removed the Government from the decision-making process and left it to the agency itself to make the decision.  That was also an important factor that was raised by the Government.</p> <p>  Deputy Eamon Ryan and other speakers made the point abundantly clear that gas is a fossil fuel.  We recognise that gas is a transition fuel in line with the Government's approach and we have included that in the section to allow the process to continue.  That is important and should not take from the amendments.</p> <p>  The definition in Ireland of an SME is a company that employs up to 500 people.  A small and medium enterprise has a broad definition in the Irish context.  We have identified a number of changes to the text.  For example, large companies in the business of exploration, extraction or refinement of fossil fuels for combustion or for energy purposes will fall within the scope of the Bill.  We do not believe that would capture any significant number of SMEs in this country and for any of those that do the flexibility provision in the Bill ensures that they are still eligible for investment, should that investment be in the transition away from fossil fuels where that contributes to the delivery of the national transition objectives as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-19a.1188" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018041900002#F00300"><p>I wish to respond to a number of the points made.  In terms of SMEs, which were raised by Deputies Martin Kenny and Pringle, in the Government amendment we capture those companies that would be fracking.  A fossil fuel company is defined as one which wholly or mainly engages in the exploration, extraction or refining of fossil fuels.  Those companies are all covered.  I wish to clarify that matter for the meeting.</p> <p>  I assure Deputy Eamon Ryan that sustainable green finance is a priority in the 2018 action plan.  The number one priority I have for financial services is that we would make this country become the sustainable green hub not just for Europe but globally.  That is the objective.  Everything we are doing is to try to pivot in that direction and we believe that we can do that.</p> <p>  I do not propose to get into a conversation with the Deputy about the agriculture sector because I am a dairy farmer and he and I are not going to agree on that.  The position is the position.  I have been pretty much consistent on that.  The largest expenditure in the Ireland 2040 plan is in the climate change sector and the decarbonisation of the economy.  Deputy Eamon Ryan is incorrect in saying the Government is not doing enough.  I accept we will not meet the 2020 targets but we will meet the targets for 2030.</p><p> To respond to Deputy Paul Murphy, of course gas is a fossil fuel.  However, we cannot ignore the position.  At EU level the transitional role of gas, in particular, and its importance in underpinning European energy security has been clearly set out in an EU strategy paper, "Policy Framework for Climate and Energy in the period 2020 to 2030".  Regardless of whether I am pleased or displeased with it being a fossil fuel, it is a crucial element of the transition period in which we hope to move towards a much cleaner and more renewable sector for the future.  That is the EU position.  I do not know what the Shell position is, and I do not really care.  However, I cannot ignore that we must try to ensure there are no unintended consequences to everything we do here.  We also have to recognise that gas is crucial.  We cannot ignore that.</p></speech>

The State can potentially lose money through the global portfolio if the State is obliged to go into cash.  There can be negative returns on that.  Make no mistake, that is a fact.  With interest rates at historically low levels for this period of time, if ISIF is obliged to move out of certain sectors and put money into cash it can be charged to have that cash.  That can then be a charge on the State.  It is important to remember that.</p></speech>

They primarily deal with the issues mentioned already regarding the impact on micro, small and medium enterprises and where companies are transitioning from being a fossil fuel company.  Amendment No. 16 refers to where divestment would trigger costs associated with contractual obligations.  I accept that those issues are referred to in other amendments as well, so I will assess it as we proceed.  I might well reserve them until Report Stage when we see how the Bill is progressing.</p> <p>  As nobody else wishes to contribute on the group of amendments, I will put the question.  Is Deputy Pringle pressing the amendment?</p></speech>
