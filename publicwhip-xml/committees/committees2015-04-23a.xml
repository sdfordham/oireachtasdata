It may be of assistance to the committee if I say at the outset that so far as the macro story is concerned, without agreeing with every  conclusion or every detail, in general I accept the broad thrust of the official reports prepared by Messrs Honohan, Regling and Watson and Nyberg, as well as the views ... most of the views anyway put forward by Dr. Donal Donovan and Professor Anton Murphy.</p>  <p>  Irish banks, by and large, avoided the mistakes that wrought havoc in the balance sheets of American, continental European and British banks where credit derivatives and CDOs did the damage.  Unfortunately, Irish banks made mistakes of their own, principally by excessive lending for residential and commercial development and these mistakes became exposed at the same time as international money markets shut up shop in September 2008.</p>  <p>  AIB lent too much to individual developers, put too much faith in cross-collateralisation, too much faith in the large net worth of individual developers.  We didn't do enough syndication or selling down of loans, and, in addition, we relied excessively on risk models that proved inadequate to the cataclysmic events of '09 ... '08 and '09.</p>  <p>  On 5 March last, the Minister for Finance and the current CEO of AIB, Mr. Duffy, made the very welcome announcement that AIB is on course to repay the total investment made by the State in the bank.</p>  <p>  The great recession of 2008, the worst the world had seen for 80 years, didn't start in Ireland or in the Irish banks, but there's no doubt that there were decisions made in AIB which made things worse than they need have been for citizens, for employees and for shareholders.  I wish to express my sincere regret for my part in those events, and to renew the apology which I made at the AIB AGM in 2009.</p>  <p>  In analysing what went wrong at AIB, I should point out that I resigned from the board in June 2009 and my perspective is, therefore, largely limited to information that became available before my departure - I haven't worked there for the last six years - and may to that extent, be incomplete. </p>  <p>  A country's banking system has been described as the nervous system of the economy, and in that sense the largest indigenous bank was never going to separate itself from the dominant economic activity of the society in which it functioned.  In the years leading up to 2008, a principal engine of economic growth in Ireland was property and construction.  It created a lot of jobs in connected trades and professions, paid lots of taxes, was encouraged by the State and the banks were fully involved in it.  Quite apart from the tax incentives that I know the Committee has heard a lot about in relation to property, local-----</p></speech>

Local authorities collected over &euro;3 billion through development contributions imposed as part of planning permissions between '99 and 2008.</p> <p>It's perfectly clear in retrospect that the appetite for risk was excessive and the lending strategy of AIB in respect of property was too expansive.  That's not actually how it appeared at the time.  In 2007, for instance, there was a strong national consensus widely confirmed by international commentators that Ireland was on a track of rapid sustainable expansion and development, and a good example is provided by the statements made at the launch of the national development plan in 2007.  Just one detail from it: it was planned to spend &euro;70 million a day every day for seven years on infrastructure with full employment, net inward migration, low debt-to-GDP ratio, budget surplus and buoyant tax revenue, and lots of civil servants were about to move out of Dublin.  Martin Wolf, who has been described as the most respected financial columnist, expressed the view in June 2007 that the possibility of huge calamities being generated by financial markets looked remote.  The IMF, in its financial stability report in 2006, expressed the view that risk dispersion as now organised in banks was less - made banking failures less likely.  And of course, the reverse turned out to be the case.</p> <p>  In viewings with the benefit of hindsight, looking back now, it seems to me that a great deal of the issue in Ireland comes back to the question of whether at a certain stage a correction that was coming was going to arrive in the form of a so-called soft or hard landing.  I think that's central to the errors.  The OECD, the EU, the IMF, the ECB, the Central Bank, the Department of Finance, the ESRI, the great majority of published economists in Ireland and abroad, although not all, the risk section of AIB and the board of AIB all favour the consensus of the soft landing and the consensus, of course, was entirely wrong.  </p> <p>  There's a striking example or expression, I suppose, of this consensus comes from the OECD report published on Irish banks in April 2008.  And I think the date is important because most of the loans ... nearly all the loans would have been made by then.  And the OECD said, having looked at the Irish banks, the Irish banks were profitable and well-capitalised and provide a buffer against a future downturn.  It's easy and certainly tempting to dismiss everything that went on in 2007 as irrational exuberance, but I actually think that there were - although this is not a popular thing to say - some policies, some justifications for the policy at the time, some rational justifications, and I want to briefly mention three of them.  The first was the calculated demand for housing in Ireland, the second was the reassuring effect of Basel II, as it's called, and the third was reliance on risk modelling in banks.</p> <p> There was hard statistical information which indicated that Ireland needed more housing.  One of the things AIB did was get independent economists to come and talk to the board every year or so, and a distinguished independent economist in the middle of 2007 brought a paper to the board, which pointed out that of a selected group of European countries, Poland was below us, but Ireland was next lowest on the list in terms of dwellings per 1,000 citizens.  Poland was 330 about, and we were about 370.  And then Estonia, Holland, UK, were all well above us, and Denmark, France, Germany, Portugal and Spain were all over 100 dwellings per 1,000 citizens ahead of us.  They were all over 470; we were at 370.  The second feature is Ireland has, as you're undoubtedly aware, a very unusual demographic history in the last century.  The peak birthrate in most western European countries was in the '60s; people stopped having large families.  The peak year in Ireland is 1980, so there were large groups of children born in the late 70s and early 80s and the 1980 crop will be 35 this year.  So there's the feeling that there was this group of citizens coming into the ... what I would call the house purchasing age, and we took that on board.  Those are the two things I want to say about housing demand, and I suppose the fact that there is now emerging something of a housing shortage in Dublin, certainly in some urban areas, suggests that this wasn't entirely irrational.</p> <p> I don't want to say much about Basel II; it was promoted with banks by the Bank for International Settlements in Zurich, reinforced by the CRD, the Capital Requirements Directive.  Its purpose was to ensure that banks had adequate capital.  We bought into it heavily and expensively, &euro;200 million between engaging experts and consultants and installing the systems in AIB.</p> <p>It went live at the start of 2008 and frankly it wasn't much good to us when the trouble came.  Part of Basel, a large part of Basel is to do with mathematical risk modelling, I remember we had to hire maths PhDs and so on to help us with this.  There was a fraud in the American operation of AIB in 2002, a man called Rusnak stole a lot of money, and immediately after that, every regulator from Washington to Warsaw crawled over AIB and, we got the services in conjunction with the Irish regulator, of a man called  Gene Ludwig, who had been a bank supervisor in the States and he investigated us up and down.  One of his recommendations was that we needed to set up a world-class risk management system and that we needed a world-class player to head it up and we duly engaged undoubtedly distinguished and experienced risk specialists from JP Morgan in New York at a very high salary.  I think ultimately 200 people came into the risk section.  At the same time, on foot of the same recommendations, we got a group internal auditor from outside Irish banking, the individual in question had been director of audit for risk and finance in Barclays Bank, then gone to work for the Italian regulator for a short while and then was engaged by AIB.  A third initiative at the time that I was involved in, was setting up a whistleblowing system.  There's a not-for-profit in the United Kingdom called Public Concern at Work, and it will act as a facilitator, and this was published to staff; they could ring up there and their messages would come only to my office and they could preserve their anonymity if they wanted to.</p> <p> Stress testing was done, installed, and in April '07 we had a stress test that looked at what would happen if things went wrong.  There were two stresses; a plausible stress and an extreme shock test.  The extreme shock test wrote down, for instance, unzoned land by about 60%, wrote down residential by 30% and I have the various figures if you need them ... but it went for a one in 25 year downturn and of course that wasn't enough.  The stress test just didn't avail when we got a one in 100 year event.  We didn't pay sufficient attention to the fact that the stress machinery didn't cater for that event and there was what I'd call an intellectual failure, for which I have to take my part of the blame, to envisage that if there was a serious property downturn in Ireland, a really serious one, and if at the same time there was a worldwide contraction of demand so that Irish businesses started doing badly, you started having unemployment and redundancy ... and at the same time as those two things, that the wholesale money markets closed up that we'd have a very serious crisis on our hands.  When Lehman's failed on 15 September 2008, that in effect is what happened. </p> <p> I want to say something briefly Chairman, if I can, about 2009 and what it was like.  Now it's painful, it's not long ago but it's possible, in the collapsing of the historical perspective, to forget just how bad things got say from the December of 2008.  In the autumn of 2008, the Department of Finance had estimated tax revenue for 2009 at &euro;43 billion and the outturn was &euro;33 billion.  They'd also estimated the contraction in GDP in Ireland at 1%, a 1% drop in GDP, and the outturn was 11.3% for 2009, ten times worse than the prediction.  In December 2008, a range of international banks were, this was unheard of before, downgraded.  That included Deutsche Bank, Barclays, Credit Suisse, Citigroup, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley.  Anglo was nationalised in January 2009 and just as an indicator of how the general population felt, how public confidence had just gone at that stage, new car registrations in January '09 were 65% down on the previous year.  Irish banks were downgraded in February by Fitch and then in the spring, AIB and Bank of Ireland had to get help from the Government on capitalisation. </p> <p> Now you can ask the question why did everyone get it so wrong?  I think it's very hard to get it right, that economic forecasting is less reliable and more complicated than people think.  Credit has to be given to Professor Morgan Kelly, he detected the bubble but even he said he thought the downswing in prices in real terms would take eight or nine years.  He also expressed the view that the Irish banks were well capitalised.  I'd like to say something briefly about the accounting standards that applied at the time.  After the dotcom bubble, where accounting standards had given rise to alleged opacity in the accounts of public companies, IAS 39 was introduced.</p> <p>It prevented banks, in very simple terms, doing what was called cross-cyclical provisioning: putting something away in the good years to save you the trouble in the bad years.  It also had another effect.  It insisted that certain parts of a bank book had to be marked to market, and I don't think the people who designed it ever envisioned there'd be a day when there wouldn't be a market.  So you were now marking to market when there was no market and getting extraordinarily low values for assets.  And there's ... the best description of this - which I think is a key dynamic of the crisis - the best description of this that I've found is in the so-called EU high level group chaired by Jacques de Larosi&egrave;re ... Mr. Nyberg was a member, Sir Callum McCarthy and the great and good of European financial regulation.  It's a bit turgid but starting at paragraph 33, if I can read you into the record what they said.  It is about five or six sentences, Chairman, if you'll indulge me:<blockquote><br /><br />Financial institutions understandably tried to dispose of assets once they realised that they had overstretched their leverage, thus lowering market prices for these assets.  Regulatory requirements (accounting rules and capital requirements) helped trigger a negative feed-back loop amplified by major impacts in the credit markets ... Financial institutions, required to value their trading book according to mark-to-market principles, (which pushed up profits and reserves during the bull-run) were required to write down the assets in their balance sheet as markets deleveraged.  Already excessively leveraged, they were required to either sell further assets to maintain capital levels, or to reduce their loan volume.  &quot;Fire sales&quot; made by one financial institution in turn forced all ... financial institutions holding similar assets to mark the value of [those] assets down &quot;to market&quot; ... What was initially a liquidity problem rapidly, for a number of institutions, turned into a solvency problem.</blockquote>I would like, Chairman, to say something now about the milieu in which Irish banks functioned before the crisis.  Analysts and large shareholders, pension funds and stockbrokers were always interested in earnings per share and particularly where your earnings per share was going up as much as your peers.  If you were going up as much as your peers that was fine but if you weren't, then your share price would drop and that meant your capacity to raise money would drop, your capacity to expand would drop, vulnerability to takeover would increase.  Governor Honan in his report in 2011 adverted to that dynamic.  The other issue was Anglo being held up to us as an exemplar and you'll all be aware of that.  Commentators in Ireland and abroad repeatedly said: &quot;Anglo is the best bank.  Why can't you be more like Anglo?&quot;  It was determined by one international consultancy to be the best bank of its size in the world.  It was the darling not just of the Irish but of European stock exchanges generally.  And I had customers saying &quot;Why can't you be like Anglo?  Why are you always asking for more?  Yourself and Bank of Ireland give slow responses and you ask for paperwork&quot;, and things like that.  I think we tried in some way not to be drawn into the wake but inevitably we were, I think, in some respects.  Professor Honohan described the effect of this sort of competition in a memorable statement before he was the Governor.  He spoke to an economic conference in Dubrovnik in June 2009.  This is what he said: &quot;Competitive pressure on the leading banks to protect market share came especially from reckless expansion [from] one bank, Anglo-Irish (whose market share among Irish controlled retail banks jumped from 3 per cent to 18 per cent in a decade&quot;.<br/><br/>Can I say something briefly then about the regulator?  We had a perfectly professional relationship, mostly between executives and the Central Bank and the regulator.  I would meet the head once or twice a year maybe.  We invited the CEO and chairman of the regulator to come to an AIB board meeting and they accepted that invitation.  I know there has been a lot of criticism of the regulator and that is not my business.  I am wary of sporting analogies in a serious matter such as this but I did look at ... one of the witnesses that I did not to get a chance to look at was Professor Alan Ahern and he was in this room on 4 March.  And he was asked by one of the members here what was needed at that time and he said what was needed was a more intrusive regulator - someone who behaved like a referee in a football match.  And it strikes me, having reflected on it since, that that's apposite, that it's instructive ... that if you've a referee in a football match which is highly competitive - and Irish banking was enormously competitive at the time - and the referee does not blow the whistle much, then the more aggressive team tends to prosper and other people can get injured.</p> <p>Just to say one more thing about the bubble.  No bank could stop a bubble.  If, through some amazing piece of insight or wisdom which we certainly didn't have, AIB had decided on some day during this period to close up for loans and say, &quot;No more loans.  We're not lending anymore&quot;, it would have damaged the bank at the time but not as much as the crash did.  But, all of our customers who were claimants for loans would have been met within the following week by our competitors with glee, the competition was so fierce.  So, the point I make is that no bank could stop a bubble inflating; only authorities can do that.  <br/><br/>I will now turn to the night of the bank guarantee decision on 29 or 30 September 2008.  The committee are in possession of three separate near contemporary records which I made of the events of that night.  The main one is, of course, a seven page note, not perfect I'm afraid, but which I dictated a few days after the events of that night and which I've given to the committee.  There is also much shorter paragraphs in a memo that I sent to the CA two days later just as a couple of paragraphs that recites my recollection of what went on at the night and also a letter of complaint to another chairman of another bank which has a couple of paragraphs again about my recollection of the night.  <br/><br/>On Sunday, 28 September 2008 - this was a Sunday evening - AIB directors heard from the CEO at a board meeting at 6 o'clock that the word from the authorities was that two financial institutions in Ireland were likely to fail, the timescale was unknown and that a limited guarantee would be put in place for the remainder of the banks.  I furnished you in my supplemental statement a quote from the AIB minute: <blockquote>The purpose of the meeting of the 29th September which the representatives of AIB and Bank of Ireland requested with the Government was to discuss the dramatically deteriorating international situation, the apparently dire staits in which Anglo found itself and the possible repercussions of Anglo's imminent collapse for Bank of Ireland and AIB.  We learned that Anglo could not open the next morning and had run out of liquidity.  The banks expressed the view that Anglo and Irish Nationwide needed to be decisively dealt with in some way by the State and then [and I emphasise the &quot;then&quot;] for a guarantee to be provided for the remaining banks to protect the surviving banks against the turmoil which would inevitably follow from an Irish bank being either liquidated or nationalised.  </blockquote>The Governor of the Central Bank stated during the meeting, in the presence of the Government representatives, that it would be disorderly, or ... and I remember this expression, &quot;or there could be a fumble if Anglo were dealt with mid-week&quot;, so what was needed, the Governor said, was for AIB and Bank of Ireland to try and provide &euro;5 billion each in liquidity to support Anglo until the coming weekend.  <br/><br/>Most of the evening was spent in efforts by Bank of Ireland and AIB to assemble enough liquidity to keep Anglo going until the weekend.  That effort was successful and, by morning, &euro;10 billion in liquidity, in excess of our own liquidity, half provided by Bank of Ireland and half by ourselves, had been assembled with its repayment within seven days guaranteed by the Government.  I want to emphasise that AIB's representatives were not involved in discussing or the making of the decision that was ultimately made.  The so-called &quot;blanket guarantee&quot; to include six banks, including Nationwide and Anglo, was not sought by or discussed with AIB.  I make no complaint about that.  I simply record the fact.  The representatives of AIB and Bank of Ireland were not present in the room where the decision makers were for most of the evening, perfectly proper as well.  I first learned that Anglo and Irish Nationwide had been guaranteed along with the other four banks from the media early the next morning.  I acknowledge that the Government was faced with very difficult decisions on 29 September, which had to be made very urgently and I am not privy to the information or advice which was available to the Government on that evening.  Two days after the guarantee, I sent a note to the CEO of AIB which included the following, and this perhaps is the most encapsulated confirmation of what I think went on: <blockquote>Our name and reputation has been damaged by our perceived role in asking for the guarantee.  We have maintained silence on the fact that what we asked for was that Anglo and Nationwide, what brought us all down, be taken out of the market and then for a guarantee to be put in place.  What we did not ask for, and I underlined that in the original, was that Anglo and Nationwide should be boosted and baked into the system going forward.  </blockquote>The significance of the getting to the weekend, referred to by the Governor, is that at the weekend, the worldwide stock markets are closed for about two days, I think 51 hours, whereas during the week, worldwide stock markets are only closed at night for about three hours, between Japan ... between US closing and Japan opening.  Just ... finally, Chairman, to say about other options, very briefly, during that week other options, Fortis was rescued by the governments of Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands using ELA and I think that option was discussed briefly by Senator MacSharry with Professor Lane at this inquiry on 21 January.</p> <p>Later that week, or maybe at the start of the following week, the Bank of England made a secret loan of Stg&pound;63 billion to solve the allegedly critical liquidity issues at Halifax Bank of Scotland and RBS and that wasn't announced publicly until Mervyn King, the Governor of the Bank of England, said it to a Treasury select committee in November the following year.  Since then, like many other countries, Ireland has enacted special legislation to deal with bank resolution, the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010 and the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011, and they obviously provide much more options for the sort of events that  occurred on the that night.   Those are my opening remarks, Chairman.</p></speech>

We had an operation in the United States, in Poland and in the UK and then in Ireland it was divided into what is called capital markets and then Republic of Ireland, which is what people would know as the traditional bank that you've described.</p>  <p>  Four of those divisions, by and large, came through reasonably intact through the crisis.  Republic of Ireland, unfortunately, became embroiled in property lending which in retrospect ran out of control, was too expansive, was not controlled by the risk models.  I suppose it's fair to say that we had, and this is not an excuse, but it is an explanation ... some of the things that I am saying today may sound like excuses, I'm not making any excuses.  I am trying to assist the committee by explaining how it seemed at the time.  We had installed this enormously expensive ... the best personnel system of controlling risk and I think that directors thought that - and it was advertised -  as a means of measuring, monitoring and managing risk and we just had excessive faith in it.  Allied to that, we went too far with individual developers.  The AIB philosophy at the time, and for years before, was "stick with your customer".  Try and make sure they don't go anywhere else, because we had, as you said, plenty of customers and you have to remember that big developers were often customers that we'd had for maybe 25 or 30 years; people who had often started modestly as perhaps small builders and had been successful, accumulating large personnel wealth, always repaying their loans, always coming back for more and always repaying them again.  And I'm afraid we took too much comfort in that history and we weren't...our credit processes were not strict and savage enough.  We looked at affordability and I think we have to take the blame for having processes that just did not match the cataclysm that came.  As I say, the competition was fierce.  I refer again to Professor Honohan's analysis of the competition but that's another explanation, not an excuse.</p></speech>

Can I answer that because, again, it's an important question?  I believe AIB was solvent then but you'll ask the question, "When did AIB become insolvent?" and I don't know the answer to that.  Again, we tend to collapse ... or I can make the mistake of collapsing this fairly short period.  The fall in house prices has been 40% to 50% higher in some places.  At 30 September 2008, the night of the guarantee, the fall in house prices was 7.7% nationally, 8% if you included apartments.  The real trouble was 2009, and I don't know when in 09-10 AIB became insolvent, because you could mark-to-market six days in a row and get different answers and if you mark-to-market and your assets were down, then you needed more capital, then you had to sell more ... nobody will ever know, I think, because of the interaction of capital requirement rules, the Capital Requirements Directive, and the accountancy rules, when the moment came.</p></speech>

In ... by your report, or by your notes, you say "The final point I made related to the form of the guarantee.  Initial draft had been furnished" and then in brackets "I think by Bank of Ireland" and "was in a form which was brought to me bare.  I mentioned that a guarantee had to be read correctly to technical eyes in foreign central banks" and in closed brackets again "I mentioned Peru, Libya, and Russia" and in closing brackets, "we ..." and in AIB's context you're saying "we furnished a more extensive formula", in brackets again, "which we brought with us".  So you're proposing, or you're explaining that you came to the meeting that night with a document yourself.  Closing brackets again, "as to the sort of instruments and deposits that should be covered" and then in brackets again, "this formula was eventually adopted later in the night pretty well word for word".  Now I'll come back to that in a moment, and maybe Deputy Doherty, who's coming in lead will take that.  I just want to establish for the moment ... because when the committee chased up this line of inquiry, a letter came in from AIB on 21 April 2015, addressed to me, on behalf of the committee, stating from ... responding to the direction that we issued for them to get this document, saying that "AIB does not have in its possession any documents containing the formula referred to in 1 above, or the draft guarantee referred to in 2 above".  They then ... AIB then go on to say, this is from Derek Hegarty, banking unit inquiry ... or banking inquiry unit ... he goes on to say "In response I confirm that, not withstanding the extensive document review exercise we conducted in response to the direction which resulted in over 47,000 pages of documentation being disclosed to the inquiry on behalf of AIB, we have not located any such documents and I can see no evidence that any such documents were generated using AIB's electronic system".

Yeah.  I just need to ... I need to get the question established ... and we can get into later in the evening, and other members will talk about the evening.  What I want to get established right now ... did AIB arrive that evening ... whether it was a document or a formula of words as to how you would see a guarantee being constructed?</p></speech>

There was a small number of words on a slip of paper which, in my recollection, described the range that ... a guarantee that would look right from foreign central banks.  That's just this bit.  The bank guarantee is a 12-page legal document.  In the hour before we ... there was no question of drafting a guarantee, and my note is misleading to that extent.  It was this critical formula, and I know bonds were asked for.  And let me say just in relation to bonds because I know that's controversial, AIB had no bonds that matured in the two-year period ... it wasn't for ourselves.  We had no bonds - relevant bonds - that matured in the two-year time.  But that's all I can remember.  And when I say farther down the same page that you were quoting, about six lines from the end, we furnished our draft guarantee - again, it was this formula - to the Government at the very early session, I believe that slip of paper was handed over.</p></speech>

Can I take you to the question in relation to how the bank reconciled the level of lending on the property and construction sectors while being in breach of regulatory prudential lending limits for the sector?  This is from July 2006 onwards; the reference to this is in the minutes of the board meeting on 27 July, AIB B2, Vol. 1, page 6, where it's clear that you had breached prudential lending limits at that stage in relation to concentration of the property and construction sectors.</p></speech>

It was reported, as you say, at 27 July board and in the following terms: Mr X - I'm not going to use the words of the officials if that's okay - reported that in respect of broad property, building and construction sector AIB was in breach of the limit contained in the Central Bank's licensing and supervision requirements and standards.  And he said that we had ... the limit was 250% of our own funds and we had gone to 260%.  He indicated that the matter had been discussed with IFSRA, who did not regard it as a significant issue.  IFSRA were informed that the breach was likely to continue.  He suggested that other banks were also in breach.  He then advised that the concept of sectoral concentration was under discussion at the committee of European banking supervisors as well as between the Irish Bankers Federation and the Central Bank of Ireland.  The board requested this issue be pursued with IFSRA-----</p></speech>

Now, let me say this to you: we would have been very well off not to have exceeded that sectoral limit.  It's a great shame that we didn't.  But if I can describe to you what was going on at the time, it was Basel II, and we were written to by the regulator in February 2007, shortly after that, and I'm going to read the first sentence ... the first two sentences.  This is the regulator to our manager:<blockquote><br /><br />In the light of the requirements of the Capital Requirements Directive, and in particular Pillar 2 requirements on concentration risk, the Financial Regulator is currently reviewing its sectoral concentration framework.  As part of this review I am contacting credit institutions that have experienced difficulties with the current sector limit.</blockquote>We replied; I won't read out the reply because it's long and you've asked me to be short, but the reply did say, &quot;We are now dealing with this under Basel.&quot;  That reply was from Mr. Bhattacharya, the chief group risk officer, on 2 May, and there's two other pieces of information that I need to give you.  In June of 2007 we put in our Basel II application to the Regulator, a document that I'd say ran to 1,000 pages, with all sorts of mathematical formulae.  The board, in June 2007, had to approve a sort of summary of it, and that summary included - and you have these papers - that summary included a section on credit concentration risk.  The document is called the Basel Programme Governance Workstream.  It had to be signed off and approved by the board, and that described the risk model that we were using for concentration risk, Moody's KMV portfolio manager, the one used by the Basel committee itself.  And the conclusion, having applied that model to our concentration issue, was that based on the analysis conducted - I'm skipping a lot here - &quot;AIB does not require additional capital requirement for credit concentration risk&quot;.  We sent that application in and it was approved by the Regulator.<br/><br/>Now, as I say, let me go back to basis.  We'd have been much better off at the old limit.</p></speech>

Why did AIB believe that of the &euro;2 billion that is was asked to put into Nationwide three weeks before the guarantee, that &euro;1 billion of it would be lost?</p></speech>

You see we had the advantage in this conversation, Deputy Doherty, that Bank of Ireland had done a more intrusive look at this sometime in the past so there was better information there.  We never got to look ... we were never asked to look inside Anglo.  I just didn't know what the ... when we were told, when we got to Government Buildings, that they had no liquidity for the next day.  The share price had dropped 50% that day, so the view was that there was very serious dire trouble, but I didn't get to see their books that night.</p></speech>

Mr. Gleeson, your colleague, Eugene Sheehy, in notes of events occurring on the 29 and 30 September 2008 ... and it is again in book of evidence AIB C3b, Vol. 2, page 38.  I will quote the section for your attention ... said that, in relation to the original Government draft announcement on 30 September ... and this is the quote:<blockquote><br /><br />There were also issues in the Government's draft which we were uneasy about relating to the attestations by the FR that the system was solvent and that all the banks were solvent.  We felt there was clearly a risk in this statement if market participants purchased shares in companies once the guarantee was issued and it subsequently transpired that these companies were not as strong as contended.</blockquote>Are you familiar with this discussion?</p></speech>

I think the Financial Regulator wanted to include a statement in some sort of press release, Deputy, that "All Irish financial institutions are solvent", or something like that, and we advised against it.

I mean, when we were -- when we arrived at Government Buildings, I've told you, we were ... Richard Burrows, the Governor of the Bank of Ireland rang me, he said, "I think we should talk to the Government," because of Anglo's share price falling, international chaos, and so on.  We went there.  We were put in a waiting room.  We were asked to go in and the invitation to the group that I've delineated in my written statement was to say what we thought should be done and we presented this proposal for the four-bank guarantee.  You'll see that it had arisen, however, the previous day, because the AIB meeting of the previous night had learnt ... Eugene Sheehy had learnt that this solution was in prospect or being discussed.</p></speech>

Well, I remember the day ... I told you earlier that we would get independent economists and alleged experts - and I don't mean that in respect of Professor Ahearne; he is undoubtedly an expert.  I have very great regard for him.  But some of the other experts we had on other occasions weren't all that expert in the end.  On that day, we had two economists come and talk to us.  One was Professor Alan Ahearne, and he expressed the view that residential property in Ireland could be as much as 30% overvalued.  On the same day we had another economist - I don't think it's any harm to name Professor John FitzGerald - and he thought that the overvalue could be 15%, and that's in the slides, and I have them here if you need to see them.  Take the middle of those and it's 22%.  We stress tested for 30%, and we could have borne 30% if all the rest of the things hadn't happened, but we could have borne ... our extreme stress test about the same time stressed for a drop in residential of 30%, but, of course, lots of other things went very wrong as well.</p></speech>

"Is this serious?"  And then we were reassured that it wasn't and when I looked and, to be honest with you, I tried to look at this recently, when I looked at the way it was couched in their own terms and then, if you follow, the issue, as you know, was sectoral concentration, and the reason that they were relaxed, the reason that we were relaxed, frankly, about it was this: this was a standard which lumped a whole lot of non-homogenous properties together.  You know, ten acres with no zoning outside a provincial town was treated the same as an office block in the centre of Warsaw or Dublin leased to the Government.  So it was a crude, if you like, I say ... we would have been blessed if we had kept to it, or it would have helped us, but that was the case, and if you look at the Financial Regulator's reports in 2010, 2011, and 2012, they said this is a very complex issue.</p></speech>

But, here I think it was being drawn to our attention and the "we" of course speaks for the whole organization.  We got regular updates.  The group internal audit would review the property book.  The chief risk officer ... remember the way we managed risk in AIB was this.  There were three principles to do with risk management, just three.  One, the risk is owned by the business.  If you are the credit card person you own those business risks.  Two, the risk function, setup under the man from JP Morgan, is an independent function to scrutinise the observance of risk management on behalf of the board.  And that is what we depended on.  I know that sounds like an excuse but that ... you couldn't ... I couldn't go around and check it.  That was the system that we operated and the risk section was never refused resources.

Can I say, as you've asked me about this document Chairman, it's important that I would draw issue with some of it, just two points if I can make, Chairman, generally.  You see Mr. Burrows is named, most of that is things I said, not Mr. Burrows.  I think maybe the top two lines are Mr. Burrows and the rest is me; I can identify things I said, and the reference at the very end of Mr. Burrows's heard from Mr. Blank, Treasury, that's an AIB official.  And the second thing that's ... not misleading, potentially misleading, is that there's a number of references on the next page to Mr. Neary.  I met Mr. Neary in a corridor, but he was never in the decision makers' room when I was there.</p></speech>

No one asked us, no one raised it, and if I'd been asked I'd have said we were solvent.  I believe it and I believe it still.  As I say, house prices had dropped by 7.7% at that stage.  The real trouble, the real trouble hadn't really started at that stage, so I believe we were solvent and absolutely believed that.  But I was complaining here because a radio interview had been given that said all the banks were the same, last Monday, AIB was in the same trouble as us, and I knew that that wasn't true.  I knew that we had liquidity out beyond a month.  I didn't know how much; I wasn't into the detail.  I knew we had enough liquidity to be able to pull out reserves of liquidity, all this ... this was helping a competitor, to keep Anglo going until the weekend, if Governor Hurley's version had prevailed.

And I was the chairman of this and I bear the responsibility.  This is where the buck stopped.  I can tell you, Deputy Phelan, that it's a salutary thing when you discover for the first time in your life in your sixties that doing your level best in a job is not sufficient to prevent very negative consequences ensuing.  I haven't done many jobs in my life.  I was a teacher; I was a barrister, outside Dublin, barrister in Dublin, I worked for the Government for three years.  And the outturns there were adequate, perhaps, no more than that.  But I did my level best in this job as well, and the outcome was entirely unsatisfactory and that's a responsibility that I absolutely accept and I can never get away from it.</p></speech>

Clearly not appropriate by today's standards and looking back, they were paid much too high but that was the market rate at the time.  We always got consultants from outside, expensive consultants say what is the rate.  And Dr. Nyberg has commented that the salaries of the AIB chief executive was the least relative to size.  Our objective was to get what the market rate was and pay a bit less than that.  Clearly we paid too much.</p></speech>

The first thing to say is that hardly any of that ever vested, the test was too high.  CPI plus 10% is almost impossible to do.  Secondly there were components in that test that related to the market as a whole, 50 other European banks, no control over those.  And so far as Irish property lending is concerned, you know going back to the statistic that I gave to your colleague, Deputy Phelan, about 15% at most of the bank's profits were provided by Irish property so lending to Irish property was never going to affect the EPS in a way that would get you this money.</p></speech>

At some meeting subsequently, I would think a few months later when we were waiting for someone else to come or maybe when he was saying goodbye to me or if it was just the two of us, I don't remember precisely, but I do remember he said, "You know, on that night, I would've been in favour of taking down those two institutions," or something like that, and there was no more than that.  I didn't ask him, he didn't say anymore, and he wasn't complaining, I think he was just affording me an anecdote.  I didn't find it surprising that there would've been different views on the night.

And it was preparatory to going to meet the Minister.  See, we had left Government Buildings that night thinking that there were four banks going to survive with the guarantee, and ... the phrases from farther down this memo that I read out earlier, I was ... I suppose it had been presented that we had asked for a guarantee, true, but the guarantee that transpired wasn't the one we'd asked for.  But we weren't going to come out and say that, obviously, that wasn't in anyone's interest.  So there was an element of peevishness here, which perhaps I ... perhaps I should regret.  I mean, as I said to you, I remember the next morning, Goldman Sachs came out and advertised or promoted Anglo as a buy.  They said there was an upside of 50 something percent of it as a share buy.  And we'd been, sort of, asked to rescue it or to assist in its rescue for a couple of days, the day before.  So mixed feelings, can I put it that way.</p></speech>

I just don't know but you are asking me a question that's outside my information stock and competence.  I understand but perhaps closed my mind down a bit on these matters from the middle of 2009.</p></speech>

You know, we went in there that night and asked for this and in a sense the decision that had to be made by the policy makers, the Government, the Governor of the Central Bank, that involved expertise that I didn't claim to have.

I mean ... I suppose one bank in a small country where there is only one bank, you know, maybe that could happen but I don't think one bank could cause a bubble.   I mean one bank can lead a bubble.  I suppose I go back to the inference of Anglo in Governor Honohan's statement at the Dubrovnik conference that reckless lending by one bank put competitive pressure, as it did.  We used to think, well we're not going to copy Anglo but you know managers in country towns who see their good customers walking across the street, inevitably there's an effect.</p></speech>

I don't know I suppose that's the working population of Waterford or Limerick, I don't know.   They're not all going to be perfect but I think we made a serious effort and that I made a serious effort to try and inculcate ethical standards.  There had been this disgraceful business in the 90s with foreign exchange, now this is the first foreign exchange issue and you sent me some papers on that and we sent that report to the guards.</p>  <p>  We instituted staff training on ethical issues and did surveys about how effective it was and there was ... every year ... and I haven't been able to go back through the minutes, the AIB code of business ethics was sent to every employee and it was approved by the board every single year while I was there.  Usually in the spring - I can remember this time of the year.</p>  <p>  There was a separate initiative for senior managers who would be taking the more serious decisions and I think the only time I ever addressed a group of managers, managers were run by the CEO.   That's the way it works.  I run the board and he runs the bank.  But I did address a group of senior managers to launch a thing called "Leadership by example" and it was about probity and obeying the law.   And in July 2007 Eugene Sheehy and myself launched that so we did make those efforts.  We also got an assessment done by an English organisation called the Institute for Business Ethics and they said we were above par for the financial services industry.  So there was an attempt to inculcate lawfulness - can I put it that way and I believe that the vast majority of AIB employees were entirely correct in their behaviour.</p></speech>

At any stage was there, this is the question, that we really need to review our governance standards and by means of a process then developing, if the governance standards, were they of a particular nature that matters then relating to the guarantee were inevitably going to happen, in terms of credit concentration levels and all of the rest of it?</p></speech>

I mean I think the guarantee arose from all sorts of complex features including contribution by AIB mistakes but I honestly don't think that the historical issues, and they were real, lead to the guarantee.  I honestly don't think that's what happened.</p></speech>

I don't think there was repetition of error after error after error.  There were historical events in the 90s and before I was chairman and while I was chairman this FX overcharging issue came to thing which I don't think was an offensive dishonesty or anything.  Bad administration maybe but there was no-one benefitted from it and we repaid fully and we ... all our reports were always supervised by someone from the outside.  We got usually a former Governor of the Central Bank come and look over our shoulder while we did those investigations.</p></speech>

As you probably know we had two Americans at one stage, one American always, three from the United Kingdom and then two from Belfast, people around the country.  So, if there was something urgent - let's say a large plc. came and said "We are going to buy a ... do an acquisition and we need &euro;1 billion" and the capital markets fellas looked into it and said "This is fine."  You couldn't get a board together and it was over the limits, so you did it for that.  You also did it for things like sometimes you might need a board resolution for appointing a receiver, sort of housekeeping stuff really.   And then exceptions to the large exposure policy were sent to the chairman's committee as well.</p></speech>

They're heavily redacted as you know so I may well have missed some, but on my account, if you include both UK property and Irish property, I'm not talking about property lending decisions, not decisions to buy out a public company or to sponsor a share, you know, other ones, but property in the UK and Ireland, I think there were 17 in those three years.

Developer A wants ... he's got a new project, or he has run into trouble in the financing of the old one.  I remember one which was really quite extraordinary.  There might be ... say a development was going through phases and the planning authority required the sequential phases to come back for planning.  There was going to be a DART station that had to be paid for by the developer on ... or maybe a Luas station, I can't remember, and that was extra money.  So you would get top-up requests, and also I'm afraid, you would occasionally get top-up requests that suggested that a developer might be getting into trouble.  You know you'd loaned him &euro;100 million and he now needed another ten to finish the thing out and the decision was, do you give him the extra ten or do you leave it unfinished?  So, there were sometimes troublesome decisions.</p></speech>

They were all presented and explained to the board, but, the way it worked, you see, if ... a credit like that for a developer looking for extra money would typically go, first, the lenders in Republic of Ireland division would do it, the senior lenders would look at it.  Then they'd have to go to Republic of Ireland credit committee.  That's to say the credit people, who are completely independent, have nothing to do with lending and are supposed to be, if you like, scrutinising it in a sceptical way.  If it got through that, and some of them didn't, it would come to the, if it was big enough, the group credit committee.  Now the group credit committee had the group chief credit officer, the chief risk officer, these serious players on it, and it was then ... only then would it be promoted to the chairman's committee.</p></speech>

I mean, when you think of it, the idea was that these credits, like the one I've just mentioned for instance, you don't have in your small papers, but I have in my long papers, because you have them as well, but ... the mark-up for that particular credit, and I have it here, 48 pages of analysis and analysis of who the independent valuers are and what they say about everything, the loan to value of every component, the track record of this customer, what their personal net worth is, their personal net worth statement, all their own assets, running to &euro;2 billion in this case, their repayment history, so, the mark-up on a document like that would be very substantial and would give you all the history and then there would be an industry appraisal.  Some of this was for office development in Dublin, "what does the office development market look like at the moment?", so it was quite a stringent process.</p></speech>

Anglo's share price had dropped by 50%.  The American Congress was meeting on what's called the Paulson rescue plan.  So, there was a lot of nervousness.  People were, you know, very fraught.  We were talking to the fellas - the officials - down in treasury department, which is the part of the bank that collects our funds.  And the thing was quite fraught.  Richard Burrows said, "I think we should go and see the Government."  I said, "I agree."  We had a quick phone call and we arrived at Government Buildings at 9.30 p.m.</p></speech>

Under the EC state aid rules the bank was obliged to submit a structuring plan to the EU Commission, and this was finalised in April 2010.  I think it was then updated again in July 2011 and further revised in 2012.  Now, in its revised plan - this is the 2012 EU restructuring plan - and it'll come up there as paragraph 3.9.

In so far as it suggests that there was a decision to move into property, I don't think that was a decision, it was just the way things developed.  As to risk management, it clearly failed us and wasn't adequate.  There can be no doubt about that; the proof of the pudding is in the history.  It was not adequate.

And that was referred to this day one fortnight ago, just 14 days ago, by Governor Honohan in a speech that he made in Paris about facts and myths of the Irish banking crisis, and myth number two was, "It is chiefly the bank guarantee that brought about the nature of fiscal austerity and generally crippled the Irish economy."  That's a myth, he says.  He says &euro;60 billion into the banks, 20 will be paid back, but the deficit that was occasioned by the mis-matching Government revenue and expenditure is &euro;30 billion a year, something between 100 and two ... now, let's be clear: I had nothing to do with that.

Just can I take you to page 22 of your opening statement, paragraph 90, you say:<blockquote><br /><br />It seems clear now that the regulation and supervision of the Irish Banking system and of Anglo and Irish Nationwide in particular, was inadequate and that the operations of those two banks, as the most aggressive lenders in the market undoubtedly affected the way other market participants conducted their business.</blockquote></p></speech>

I mean, the extent of the loan losses was more significant in some ways.</p> <p>I think that in September AIB was in better condition and if you look at the outturn Deputy, look at it simply as that.  Of the &euro;64 billion that the State has had to put out to rescue the banking system, AIB and Bank of Ireland are well ahead in paying it off.  AIB will repay hopefully what is owes, but the &euro;35 billion that went into Nationwide and Anglo, only a very small proportion of that, I understand, will be recovered.  That's why there is a difference between them, that's all I say.</p></speech>

Again you have been sent, although you can't have read everything, but you'll see the board dashboard.  That was something that I came up with, with the chief risk officer, that every month every member of the board would get the risk dashboard.  It was against the contingency that some board member would say "We were never told about this".  It had the ten biggest risks.  Back in 2006-07 it was "Will we be able to complete the Basel transformation?" Earlier than that, perhaps at my behest it was regulatory conformance, "Are we obeying the law in everything we do?" That was something that I was very keen on.  Then subsequently it became credit risk.</p></speech>

Because I think some light was shed on that yesterday by NAMA that, for example, of the &euro;74 billion of par value of loans they acquired, &euro;9 billion of that was actually just interest being rolled up and that &euro;9 billion more or less related to the &euro;40 billion in the land and development book.  It emerged at one of your own board meetings on 8 October 2008 when questions were being asked about interest being rolled up that the bank didn't have access to that information readily.</p></speech>

I agree with you, it should have been able to find that.  I think what they said, I haven't got it in front of me now, but it had to be done manually I think.</p></speech>

I suppose that that was what was discussed.  I mean when Governor Hurley says "Can you get &euro;5 billion to keep Anglo going to the weekend?" it wouldn't make any sense if you were going to guarantee six banks the next morning for us to be providing liquidity to the weekend.  It was inconsistent with that.  And that was an effort that was ongoing, not me, but Eugene Sheehy talking to officials during the night - we are doing this or we might bid at an ECB auction tomorrow.  So that idea of Bank of Ireland and ourselves saving Anglo until the big event could take place at the weekend - and public companies often go till the weekend when they have a crisis because you get 48 hours when the stock market aren't on top of you -  would be inconsistent with the six-bank guarantee, so that's why I believe that solution was in the ether late into the night.</p></speech>

You attended educational events at the International Institute of Finance and the International Monetary Conference.  No doubt in some circles these would be seen as very prestigious institutions.  Can I ask you Mr. Gleeson, did the instruction include the fact that within capitalist banking internationally, systemic crises erupted with great regularity all over the world, and that these sprang from very definite causes which were therefore avoidable?</p></speech>

Jan Brueghel the Younger has a fascinating painting about it.  The impression is being given that what happened in Ireland in the crash was, you said a 100 year event.  But in 1999, three years before you became deputy governor, Oxford University Press published a paper by a man called Peter Englund, Stockholm School of Economics.  He wrote about a study that was done by a colleague of his, published the year before, a study of 30 major bank crises, not from 100 years ago, but from the 1980s, including three of the most advanced industrial countries in the world, namely, Norway, Finland and Sweden.  The common patterns that he outlines are in paragraph 2: deregulation, overly rapid credit expansion, sustained increase in asset prices, a bubble, the bubble bursting, collapse of asset prices accompanied by non-performing loans, acute banking crises, credit crunch, government salvage banks.</p> <p>Will you agree with me that that would be, or not, an uncanny synopsis of the bubble and crash in Ireland?  But this was from 1999, which-----</p></speech>

I was about to tell you, and you probably know this, that John Lanchester, who is a respected commentator says that economists ... that economics ... one of the reasons that economics is so bad at predicting the future is because economic history has been downgraded in economics departments in universities and that ... when I was learning my economics a long, long time ago, economic history was compulsory, but now the feeling, among some economists at least, is that it's all in the formulae, it's all in the mathematical formulae.  The mathematical formulae capture the history, therefore you don't need to learn the history, and that if there was more attention to history ... so I agree with your point that attending to the history ... on the other hand, Deputy ... let me just finish.

So far as your question relates to the issue of the price of building land, I think that there is a serious political and social issue as to how that should be controlled, and the price of building land, and you probably know that building land becomes the object of speculation, and you probably also know that 40 years ago, this very issue was addressed after an increase of 500% in the cost of building land in Dublin between 1963 and 1971.</p> <p>This is a social resource, it should have some element of, in my view, State control.  You can't increase the number of building land ... amount of building land around Dublin.  And that issue - that very issue - was put to an expert committee in 1973 ... 1971, reporting in 1973, under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Kenny.</p></speech>

I suppose we felt we were, feeding into the financial stability reports and getting feedback from it.  It was that sort of thing, it was trading information about where they felt the economy and the banking system was and getting information back.  But I can't bring the specific discussions to mind, I'm sorry to say, Deputy.</p></speech>

The proposal at one stage was that you'd ask directors for details of their personal finances at a level that wasn't been asked in London by the regulator there, and we were competitors for trying to ... one of the big problems getting bankers to be directors of AIB ... you couldn't use Irish bankers, you couldn't use former AIB people, that wouldn't be good governance.  You couldn't use Bank of Ireland because they would be bringing Bank of Ireland secrets, so you had to look to the UK.  And we thought that having to give a much more detailed account of your personal finances in a way that you wouldn't get asked if you were a bank director in London was a bad idea.  The other reservation, which I ... on one occasion saw misrepresented - I'm all in favour of compliance and people being asked to sign up to compliance ... but I remember once, for instance ... and Chairman, this ... I'll conclude on this ... getting a draft compliance statement which said that the directors would confirm that the bank is in compliance with all statutory regulations and rules.  Now, if the stairs in the bank in Ballybofey had a safety feature that they were missing - I just want to answer - I couldn't tell whether everyone was in absolute compliance all the time, no one could.</p></speech>

So I asked Mr. Daly did the banks, to his view, behave in a deferential manner to major developers and lenders.</p></speech>

If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to do so, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I will remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry, which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  Therefore, the utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings. Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.</p> <p>To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the Gallery, these documents will be displayed on the screen to your left.  Members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and they should not publish any documents as displayed.  They are there to assist proceedings when evidence is being given.</p> <p> The witness has been directed to attend this meeting of the inquiry into the banking crisis and you have been furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are before the committee and will be relied upon at times when questioning, and form part of the evidence of the inquiry.  With that said, could I now ask the clerk to administer the oath of affirmation to Mr. Forde.</p></speech>

In that invitation I was asked to give evidence relating to a number of lines of inquiry.  In the context of three positions which I held in my employment with the AIB Group, specifically in the years from 1999 to 2009.  Those three roles were general manager of the strategic development unit in the bank, managing director of AIB Bank, Republic of Ireland, and as director of group strategy at AIB plc.  I just want to take the three of these in turn for a while if I might.</p>  <p>  I was general manager of the bank's strategic development unit from September 1999 to April 2002.  That was a strategic marketing role.  In that position I had no responsibility for credit management or credit strategy.  I was appointed as managing director of AIB Bank in April 2002, and I held that position until February 2009, you may have mentioned May 2009 earlier.  I believe it is principally in the context of this role that I can be of assistance to the inquiry.  AIB Bank was the domestic retail banking division of AIB Group.  As its managing director I was responsible for all aspects of the division's activity in accordance with AIB Group policies and governance.  Specifically in the context of credit strategies, credit approval or credit risk management, activities were all conducted within policies that were set out by the central group risk management function, endorsed by the group executive committee and approved by the board of directors.</p>  <p>  Thereafter, these activities were supervised by the group risk management function with support from the internal audit function.  As managing director of AIB Bank, I did not have any credit discretion.  My responsibility was to manage the business to the highest possible level of performance in all respects, and to do so within the credit risk policies and credit risk management frameworks that were set and ordained at group level.  Let me make it clear that, in outlining the corporate governance structure within which the AIB Bank division operated, I am doing that for the purpose of clarity.  I am not in any way suggesting that I am without a share of the responsibility for the failure of the bank.  I was part of the group executive management committee through this period and I became a member of the AIB Group board in 2007.  My voice would have been an influential one if I had questioned or challenged our credit strategy and credit positioning at these fora, but I did not do so.  While I had expected a faltering of economic activity and a pull back in the property market, I simply did not foresee the scale of the collapse that was to follow.  It is clear now that AIB credit policies were inappropriate at that advanced stage of the economic cycle.  At the time, I believe that the economy was on a more resilient and sustainable footing than subsequently proved to be the case.</p>  <p>  With the wisdom of hindsight, this was a serious misjudgment on my part and on the part of many others within the bank and outside.  My own failing in this respect is a matter of deep personal regret and I am very conscious of the implications of that misjudgment for very many people.  In late January and February of 2009, I was informed by the AIB Group chief executive that I was being moved from my post as managing director of AIB Bank to a newly created position as director of group strategy.  However, that position never materialised in the way that was indicated to me at the outset.  I found myself from that point completely removed from discussions at executive management and board level, and without objectives or direction in terms of a work agenda.  That situation persisted until I decided to leave the bank nine months later in November 2009.  Throughout my time in this role, I had no involvement in the management of the bank and very little knowledge of developments from a credit risk perspective.</p>  <p>  Turning to the specific lines of inquiry that I was asked to address, I have addressed each of these in my written statement.  In the interest of time, I will not read through the detail of the views and perspectives that I have to offer, but I am happy to elaborate on my submission in any way that the committee considers helpful.  I have summarised that submission, Chairman, with my personal conclusion that the failure of the bank was primarily attributed to the failure of our credit risk management policy.  Our stress testing of customers' repayment capacity was not sufficiently challenging, and our loan to value constraint on security was inadequate.  The impact of these principle factors was exacerbated by an excessive weighting of property exposure in our portfolio, an undue level of exposure to individual counter parties, and there were external factors that contributed to the difficulty.  There were inappropriate accounting protocols in my view for loan loss provisioning, there was unanticipated and increased funding costs, there was an external requirement for increased capital and all of these added to the strain.</p>  <p>  I hope my statement is helpful to the committee.  I have relied primarily on my recollection of events in preparing material for the inquiry and this may mean that some points of detail have escaped me.  With that caveat, I am happy to address any more detailed questions that may arise.  Thank you, Chairman.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-23a.1286" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Donal Forde" time="04:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042300031#EE00700"><p>I do not think there was much action taken to remediate them.  That is the truth of the situation.  I think it became far too routine that exceptions were created to the large exposure policy.  I think that is the case.  There was not a question of remediating them.  They were referred to the board, all of these, they were approved.  I think we began to accept it as something routine that that policy was honoured more, I have to say, in the breach than in the observance.</p></speech>

All the documentation and the circumstance of the case would be reviewed three times - by the division, the division then referred them to the group credit committee and they would be reviewed again and then they would go to the board for final approval.  So it was not that there was an absence of scrutiny on them.  I think we had come to accept that large exposures to individuals who were long-established in the property and construction business were acceptable.  I would put it in those terms.</p></speech>

I may be wrong in that but of that order had to be referred to the group, essentially.  Given that it was at odds with our policy, it had to go to the board for approval and sign off.</p></speech>

So I guess the judgment to be applied in that case was whether somebody, through activities like that, was conflicted in terms of what they were doing for AIB.  And that conflict could arise in one of two ways: that they had an interest in one of the cases, and I was never aware of any such instance, or alternatively that they were active in some fashion in the market place in a manner that might've compromised one of the cases.  There wasn't ... Never was there any evidence that that had happened.  I do know there was some discomfort when one or two individuals, as I've said that I've acknowledged, but ... but, and that was the topic of some discussion, but I think we were always satisfied that they were not doing anything that conflicted in any way with the business of the bank.  And, I guess there was a view that the knowledge and intimacy, I suppose, that they had with the market place, was actually of quite a benefit to us in the sense of knowing the nuances of the market, having credibility in standing in the market, so ...</p></speech>

I suppose maybe I ... maybe before I answer that, if I explain ... I wouldn't have involvement in individual cases of any description.  I had no credit discretion of my own.  Credit decisions, there was a ... there was a framework within which they were made.  We had a chief credit officer.  He sat with the committee, he adjudicated on those cases.  I didn't get involved in those cases and I took the view that to do so created some danger that my opinion of a case would sway unduly members of the committee.  So I didn't involved in those.  Now, I ... we're dealing with many thousands of customers and can I say that there was a case ... that there weren't cases where something exceptional might've been done?  There may well have been but there would be very very few.  I mean, those credit committees operated to pretty stringent guidelines from the group credit committee.  The product ... their ... the output of their work and the decisions they made on the cases were frequently reviewed by the group risk management ... risk management function.  So, you'll see audit reports on the documentation there.  The number of exceptions that would arise to policy would be very few.</p></speech>

The credit committee essentially, I think I make reference to it in my statement, in the pre-2005 period, the credit committee ... our divisional credit committee had discretion up to &euro;40 million, I think it was, so they would've approved cases up to &euro;40 million.  Approved meant approved, and that was the at the decision of the chief credit officer.  If it exceeded that amount, it then had to be passed to the group credit committee, and the group credit committee would then review that case and it would pass decision on it and if it passed a certain threshold there, it had to go to the chief executive of the board.  So, I wasn't ... never had a sight of individual credit cases.</p></speech>

I had ... certainly that was at the heart of what I did.  In the way that I described here, my job was to drive the performance of the division within the policies that were set down.

We heard earlier from former chairman, Mr. Gleeson, and he seemed to be of the case, though I did ask him to reflect and he said he may have been incorrect, that targets were only ever linked to profitability, rather than, say, volumes.  So I was querying that.  So are you saying that when you would be setting targets for branches or performers in ... that it would be linked to growth lending, rather than profitability?</p></speech>

We would have a divisional profit target for the year that would break down into a whole variety of different lines of business.  There'd be an advance as growth target and then that would break down between an expectation of growth in margins or growth in commercial loans, each elements of the portfolio, and there would be a margin attributed to that growth.  So, example, the loan book in totality was to grow by 10%.  The expected margin on that was, let's say, 1.5%.  So the expected profitability outcome through the course of the year would be whatever the ... whatever the rate dictates.  What would go on through the course of years, obviously each of those lines would vary, so you would be endeavouring to improve the margins on lines, and as you improve the margins, then clearly there wasn't the same pressure for volume growth.  But I was accountable for the totality of that, and ... the totality being the profitability that fell out of it by the ... by year-end.</p></speech>

And thereafter, what we would endeavour to do is to manage the margin up.  We would endeavour to grow the volume but we had to grow that volume within the credit guidelines that were set out for us.</p></speech>

The chief credit officer, I think, had &euro;20 million, from memory and then we had a number of senior lending executives who had the order of &euro;8 million to &euro;10 million and pretty much after that, you know, they within their teams might pass that down one level more but we were dealing with a pretty centralised system where the local branch manager would have no discretion.</p></speech>

So if there is a piece of property, you look to see what's the potential productivity of that piece of property, so is it to be used for residential development, how many houses can be built on it, what's the price of those houses, what's the cost of building those houses, what will the density be, how long will it take for the money to be realised.  They're meant to work it out from first principles and then stress test that and that determines the value of the property.  I think I made the point in my statement that perhaps there was less of that and too much of the reliance on "the auctioneer up the road says this is worth &euro;4 million" because I'm not sure what value attached to that in some respects.  But the loan officer's job and he would be coming with 20 years' experience to this, would be to look at that asset and establish what seemed like a fair value for that asset and in many respects, the getting or the seeking of an independent valuation would be confirmatory more than anything else.  I mean, more value would attach to that senior lending officer's valuation of that asset frequently than would to the external-----</p></speech>

Because it was something of a house of cards, I mean, one auctioneer says it worth four, one says five and then a certain solidity begins to attach to that from a lending point of view when prior to that, I think there'd be a lot more rigour about saying "Actually well, we need to work out ourselves what this piece of land is worth" and I think more effort and more scrutiny and more challenge maybe went into it in the earlier stages when you didn't have the comfort of an external valuer saying this is worth X.</p></speech>

The leakage of deposits from the bank was primarily from our capital markets division and from our UK division because it was the external players, particularly, who were losing confidence in the system.  So I wasn't witnessing, in my particular area of responsibility ... I wasn't witnessing extensive leakage of deposits.</p></speech>

Thank you.</p>  <p>  I'd like to move to just a few months prior to that, when you appeared in front of an Oireachtas finance committee in December 2008.  And you said: "With regard to the recapitalisation of banks, part of the difficulty in the debate is that banks are banded together as if we are all the same.  We are not.  AIB has made it clear it does not believe it needs capital and that additional capital will not do anything for the business for which I am responsible.", and then in February, two months later ... February 2009, there was a capital injection into the bank from the Government.  Can you please explain the difference between your statement and the actual subsequent action?</p></speech>

I think you'll see in the documentation that we were given, there's a stress test that was done there on the property and construction portfolio in '07, and that was done by the risk management function in the bank ... by the most qualified people we had in the risk management discipline.  And you'll see in that, that their downside scenario, their extreme case scenario, was a loss of &euro;2 million of the bank's capital.  Well actually not of the bank's capital ... a loss of &euro;2 million which would substantially erode the profitability of the bank, and might ... might require, I suppose, it's capital adequacy to be boosted.  But this was the extreme view, so, when I was asked in '08, I was still leaning on that understanding of our portfolio.  That was my view of the risk that attached to the business that I was responsible for.  And I answered the question, and anything I would have said would have been informed by that perspective, which I now accept was wrong, but that's what guided those answers at the time.</p></speech>

And I think ... like ... and I remember seeing some of the minutes here in the documents.  I think the view of the finance team was that there were some steps we could take to improve our capital position, but not going so far as a capital issuance.  So I was persuaded by that view, and I ... that's what informed ... so ... so I wouldn't say I was instructed, I would say I accepted the view of the finance team at that stage.</p></speech>

I think ... I make the point I think, in my statement, that in my last act, if I can express it in those terms, of the MD of the division, was that the chief executive has asked me to do a very rigorous assessment of what the scale of loan losses could be.  This was in late January, early February of '09.  And I did that at the time and I did it ... that was ... that was done in close collaboration with the chief credit officer and the risk executives.  And the product of that was, at that time, to suggest that the loan losses could be of the order of &euro;2 billion to &euro;3 billion.  That was my last picture of the division before I, in a sense, stepped aside.  Now that would have not led to that order of capital requirement that subsequently came.  Now things deteriorated so quickly and so sharply after that, that from one month to another the situation changed, so I can understand how ... I mean, at that stage ... I recall when that was being done, the worry and the concern from a credit point of view was that houses weren't selling, sales of completed office developments had stopped.  The worry was not so much about the fall in value as it was about the suspension of economic activity.  At that stage values were back ... house values were back 25%.  Clearly from then, to a period 12 months later, things changed very dramatically.  So, if you'll forgive me, I think asking me whether something, an evaluation of the loan portfolio, was done in February or done in April is very material given what was happening.  And the last one I saw was what was done in late January and February and that was the product of it.</p></speech>

Thank you.  I want to take you back, then, to your management of the increase in property lending in the Republic of Ireland prior to the 2008.  The rate of increase in property lending in the AIB Group was magnified in the Republic of Ireland division, and on exposure to property, property lending grew in the Republic of Ireland from &euro;10.1 billion in 2004 to &euro;33.3 billion in 2008.  Can you explain this imbalance with other divisions in the AIB Group?  Why was it magnified?  Why was it so much greater in RoI?</p></speech>

The core of AIB's franchise in the Irish market was with business customers and the greater part of economic activity that was afoot at these times was in property and construction.  So, I think an added statistic for that period, Deputy, was that our market share wouldn't have changed during that period.  So, what happened was, we kept pace with the level of activity in the market.  We continued to service and support those customers through that time.  Mistakenly, I now accept, but we didn't feel we were stepping more intensively into the market.  We felt we were keeping pace with the requirements of our customers.</p></speech>

I don't recall specific ... well, I don't recall specific discussions with the CEOs, but I recall discussions at our group executive forum and I recall a number of discussions at the board where there would be considerable discussion about the weight of our property-construction lending, and I suppose particularly a fact that it was - again, I saw reference in the documents - it was in breach of some of the guidelines from the regulator.  And there was a number of board discussions to specifically address that point - were we comfortable with what we were doing in property-construction?  I actually recall ... I think when that stress test in 2007 was presented to the board, that was in response, I think, to a specific request from the regulator that the board would validate and confirm its comfort with AIB's property and construction exposure.  And I ... the board's response to that was to ask the risk function to do that evaluation that you've seen there and that stress test.  And the output of that - mistaken, I now accept - I think left them with a false sense of security and a false sense of comfort.  So, yes.  I've answered that in a long-winded way.  There was discussion.  I wouldn't say there was concern, but the scale of our property and construction exposure featured frequently, but each time the board got to a point of comfort with it and we continued.</p></speech>

And you'll see reference in this that ... certainly, what was communicated to me, or was communicated to us, was that the regulator themselves recognised that this singular, homogenous limit was no longer appropriate and what was now required - and that was consistent with Basel II - was a segmentation of that portfolio and analysis of the different elements of it from a risk point of view.  And that's the exercise, essentially, that the risk function presented.  And that ... you will see a reference there that the regulator was interested in that methodology themselves.</p></speech>

Yes, we were conscious of it but, at the time, the view was that mortgages were going to be so preferentially treated under the new Basel II regulations that, actually, those margins could contract further because these ... as an asset, they were particularly favourably treated, essentially under Basel II, in a manner that perhaps in hindsight wasn't justified.  And for that reason, again, the view was that those margins would continue to contract.  So, as with other elements, we didn't see the risk in that.</p></speech>

It's a risky thing to do for the reason that we've just been discussing.  In a credit crisis, when people then call in these issuances where there's no lending on the interbank market, you then run into trouble in terms of your funding and liquidity if it's called upon.  Were those risks appreciated by AIB at the time?</p></speech>

The issuance of commercial paper is a well recognised means of improving your liquidity profile.</p></speech>

By being able to issue commercial paper, you improve your liabilities and you will ... that enhances your liquidity position.  So, that was a positive step.  But, if I take it in the context of the broader question you're asking, I'm not sure we fully understood.  In fact, I am sure we didn't fully understand ... we did not anticipate the scale of dysfunctionality that came later in the interbank markets.  I accept that point and I acknowledge it.  Commercial paper would've actually been a positive feature of the work that was done to try and improve our position, or the issuance of it.</p></speech>

I mean, one of the means by which you try and remedy a loan that is not functioning is to try to restructure it, so, yes, always, not just in that period, there's a practice of trying to restructure criticised loans.  But the volume of criticised loans in the period of '06 to '08 would have been very few, so I'm not sure where your question is going, but it wouldn't have been material.</p></speech>

Well, the market began to deteriorate in early '08.  Now, what I mean by deteriorate is that essentially ... well, forgive me, I'll just step back one step further.  If you're managing a property and construction portfolio, you lend for a significant period of time.  You've to lend through a period in which land is purchased, in which houses are built and the costs are incurred before ... the revenue only comes at the end when houses begin to sell, or the office, the commercial development that has been developed begins to sell.  The loan and the cash flows are predicated on that sale happening at a particular time and, from early '08, it was obvious that activity in the market was beginning to slow; houses were not selling in the way that had been expected and what that begins to do then is it pushes out the revenues on which those loan cases are based, so, from early '08, it was obvious that there were some developers who were going ... would not meet the cash flow expectations that we had and I would describe the deterioration in the loan book through the course of '08 as that dynamic.  That's what was going on and it wasn't until '09 actually that the concern of inadequate security values began to really manifest itself.  It's only then that it became obvious that asset values were falling to a point that our security was going to be compromised.</p></speech>

I can't say that there was.

I want  to just come back, just finally, to Mr. Gleeson's evidence earlier today.  We were talking about the roll-up of interest in the RoI division and when he was asked about ... the board went looking to find out exactly how much interest had been rolled up and he said there was a bad piece of missing architecture because management weren't able to produce it, they had to go and look for it manually, and he said that this was an indefensible gap.</p></speech>

People were monitoring it, at a case-by-case basis.  The gap was that, from an overall portfolio management, we weren't readily able to present that picture and I guess that only became ... that only came into such ... our focus in late '08 and then it became obvious that that was a piece of information that we needed and needed a lot more ... needed to be able to access a lot more readily than we were able to do.</p></speech>

If you take an individual property case, as I've said, if I lend money to somebody for the purchase of land, or if I lend money to somebody to develop residential housing, there's always going to be interest roll-up.  There's no way of paying the interest.  There's no way, until the houses begin to sell or ... so, there's interest roll-up endemic in every property loan.</p></speech>

That would be fair.

That concludes the leads, but there is just one issue, maybe if we can just get a bit of further clarity on the appropriateness of property-related lending strategies and risk appetite in AIB.  This relates to core document AIB PB2, page 6, item 4, or 4.2.  Very simply, Mr. Forde, the Central Bank have a licensing and supervision requirements and standards for credit institutions and the standards provided that the credit institutions should not have risk assets amounting to more than 200% of shareholder funds; that's the own funds inside in the bank.  And, in any one sector of business, or economic activity, or were considered to apply to two or more separate sectors, the limit was 250% of own funds.  Now, in July 2006, the banks' exposures to the broad property, building and construction sector, amounted to 2006% ... or, sorry, 2060% of own funds, which was already now going over the limit and while the limit was 250% and then the bank continued to breach these limits and such lending reached the level of 390% at September 2008.  Now, you were the head of AIB's Republic of Ireland's business.  How do you reconcile the level of lending to the property and construction sectors while you were, at this case now, clearly in breach of regulatory prudential lending limits for the sector from 2006 onwards?</p></speech>

The reason I was drawing attention to that was what that presentation sets out is the fact that we're in breach of the limit, then goes on to explain, however, if I can use that phraseology, that when the portfolio is analysed in the manner that Basel II required of it, break it into logical portfolios, the result was that the risk attaching to it came within levels that were comfortable for the bank.  And that was fed back to the regulator, and it was that that led the board to the conclusion that the level of exposure that we had at that stage built up was acceptable to them.  So, no, you're right in saying that there was no direction to stop.  What there was, was, I guess, a reassessment, a re-evaluation of it under that new methodology to say, yes, it is within levels that are comfortable and prudent for the bank.</p></speech>

I raised this with Mr. Gleeson this morning and I'm just wondering if these figures are related to the point I was making.  There was a suggestion that other banks may have been eating AIB's lunch, and particularly in the property and construction sectors.  Was there a strategy during 2006 and 2008 to expand rapidly into the property and construction sectors by AIB to win back market share?</p></speech>

And, I guess, as MD, if I had a concern, it was that we should be trying to remain relevant to our customers, and that meant largely trying to maintain it, but there was no ... there was no ambition to grow it, no.  I think there was a recognition that to retain the position we had was as ambitious as we could be.</p></speech>

I worked through a time when all analysis was that there was a shortage of housing stock, okay?  That there was a demographic that meant the demand for houses was going to increase.  So, I think I would have been wiser than most if I had seen what was coming, but I didn't see it.  And it's, as I have said, a matter of great regret but I can say I acted in good conscience, in good faith.  I, at no time, ever had a premonition of what was going to happen.  If I did I would have acted differently, but I didn't.</p></speech>

I am just delving into kind of ... just certain operations in the bank with regard to risk.  And in ... the reference document for this is going to come on screen in a moment.  It's AIB, Vol. 2, pages 13 and then 21.  They are appropriate to staffing and training and so forth.  But, in a group internal audit, a GIA report dated April 2006, concern was then being expressed that the experience levels of staff in the Republic of Ireland division - the division you headed up - would not be sufficient to manage cases through the cycle and this could lead to the bank missing significant credit events on accounts.  Now, this is as things are really heating up ... it's two years out from the guarantee but we can see that the loans into different sectors are happening in particular ways.  What I want to deal with you here is how ... or did management understand the importance of maintaining a balance between staff with good credit experience and more junior, more sales orientated personnel?  In particular, I suppose what I am dealing with is that staffing and appropriate lending skills ... set ... these sets ... or the skillsets ...seem ... appear to have been an issue across the Irish banking industry, particularly in the mid 2000s.  Were you, or how aware were you, of this problem?</p></speech>

I think that's my report to the board.  So that's mine.  I was aware.</p></speech>

Through this time, the amount of ... the degree of movement of staff - senior lending staff - from one institution to another was quite intense on occasions.  So, senior lending people were highly prized assets, if I can describe it in those terms, and from time to time we in AIB lost a number ... and the loss of one or two of these was a serious blow when it happened.  So, I guess I was very conscious of it and I had two concerns - one, that our remuneration was somewhere on a par with our competitors in a way that wouldn't give people a monetary incentive to move down the road, in the first instance, but that secondly that we were trying to train young people, essentially, who would be able to reinforce and step up, essentially, if that happened.  It was an ongoing challenge because you don't learn credit experience overnight and one of the difficulties was that most of the people in ... many of the people, I wouldn't say most ... many of the people involved in credit management in AIB had never seen bad times.  That was an anxiety.</p></speech>

As the market conditions were then deteriorating and the loan impairments began to increase, Mr. Forde, did you consider, or was there consideration in AIB at that time, that you had sufficient trained staff with the appropriate skillset to deal with the arrears collections and manage prominent loans?</p> <p>It's like playing offensive football and defensive football.  This was ... you were moving from very open banking now to a far more difficult type of banking.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-23a.1671" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Donal Forde" time="05:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042300039#NN00200"><p>I think we ... we didn't so much have to make that decision, if I can describe it in those terms, because from early '08, the offensive activity had stopped and, essentially, people were being put in the back line from that point forward.  And you'll never have adequate resources when something of the scale of what was beginning to develop at that stage, you know, began to gather momentum.  That's the truth of it.  But all offensive activity stopped from early '08.  From there forward, all resources were, essentially, in the back line.</p></speech>

How do you think AIB were coped for the skillset that that new type of banking required?</p></speech>

So I think we tried to mitigate that as best possible by a more centralised approach by relying more heavily on some of the senior lending people who were working, through the late 2008, 24 hours a day, so, yes, there were strains that you wouldn't consider to be appropriate at that point.</p></speech>

Maybe the first thing to say is I would be a little bit removed from that, you know, most of these things were handled at a group level, but I would have had experience of it through my executive role.  I guess I had ... there was a number of events through my ... through that time from 2002 to 2009 that would shape my answer to your question.  I came to the division as MD at the time of the Ruznak crisis, which prompted a fairly radical governance review and overhaul and so forth, within the bank, and the regulators seemed to be intensively involved in that at the time, certainly.  Then subsequently in 2004 there was an FX charging issue.  I was at the centre of that; it was in my division, and I would regard the manner in which the regulator intervened and supervised and directed the bank as a consequence of that to be, I'll use the word quite heavy-handed.  It was very interventionist, very demanding.  This now in the context of consumer regulation, though, but it was quite-----</p></speech>

And generally I will say there afterwards as relates to matters of consumer regulation that sort of continued in ... really followed as a consequence of that.  There was a great deal of pressure, intervention, review, demand if I can use that word, from the regulator relating to fees and charges reviews and ... remedy of things that had gone wrong.  So it would be very wrong to characterise that as light touch, all in the context now of consumer regulation.</p></speech>

I mean, the people who were to the fore in that respect in the division and at group level were people who had been active in reviewing property cases for 20 years.  Okay?  And what they would bring to that consideration is, as I've said, a first-order analysis of essentially the asset that was being purchased.  If it was for residential development, you know, how many houses would be built, at what cost ...  you know, what was the track record of the developer in delivering these, in what timeframe?  And you work it back from first principles.  If you're going ton sell ten houses with a net profitability on each of whatever &euro;50,000 and you've worked that back, you can just calculate the value of the land and you discount that in some measure for safety.  So it's a first principles analysis, if you like, of what the value of the asset is relative to what it's going to produce.</p></speech>

So let's say, for instance, your ... as often is used as kind of a barometer ... the guard married to the nurse.  They were going to take a mortgage out over 20 years, whoever was the chief earner - whether it was the guard or the nurse - it would be three times their income and then the guard or the nurse's annual income applied.  But ... and that would be ... that was a very set ratio.  But over a period of time we saw that going into multiples of what the earning capacities were and the mortgage schedules getting longer and longer, going from 20 years nearly out to 40 years.  At any stage ... was it ... did somebody say "It's not the valuations of the properties now is the issue, it's the capacity and the affordability to pay?"</p></speech>

I think the emphasis shifted from the simplicity of a multiple or one or the other.</p> <p>It shifted to this capacity of the borrower to be able to meet the repayment.  The formula was that all mortgages had to be stress tested for interest rates, if I remember, for 2% higher than prevailed to make sure that the borrower was able to meet the repayments.  That sort of model did become more prevalent rather than the simple one that you described.  So it is true to say,  I think, that the model failed a little bit.  I am acknowledging that-----</p></speech>

I mean, if one operates on the assumption that all purchasing markets are required upon -  if I am selling my car tomorrow morning to buy a new car, somebody has to come in and buy a second hand car.  The housing market is very much contingent upon first-time buyers to come in to allow people to trade up and trade down and all the rest of it, and that affordability for first-time buyers was becoming so difficult that the State had brought in a package of affordable housing, which was supposed to be subsidised housing.  In Cork affordable housing was a quarter of a million euros.  This was council housing that was subsidised at a quarter of a million euros.  It is probably worth less than half of that in today's market.  So you had this massive compounding snowballing effect.  Was anybody in the bank saying that this is a concern?</p></speech>

I think our difficulty, and I now accept that mistake, but our difficulty was that we did not see that changing dramatically because the view we had was that we were in an environment where there was a shortage of housing stock ... in the capital at least, in the greater Dublin area.  Probably still the case today.  We had an influx of people coming into the country from eastern Europe and so forth.  We had a demographic where the baby boomers of the eighties were coming into house.  So you had a scenario and you had - the outlook, it seemed, was one for continued economic expansion.  We did not see how it was that there was going to be a significant change in the fact that houses were going to be more expensive and going to demand more of the proportion of disposable income to service them.  We sort of accepted that.  For that reason then, the shift in the model,  I suppose,  looking more at the capacity of the borrower to be able to meet the repayments even if interest rates rose became more the issue, rather than a concern about the inflated value of the house.  I am not justifying our approach now in hindsight,  but I am trying to rationalise the way we were thinking at the time.</p></speech>

You are very welcome, Mr. Forde.  On page 4, part of the professional valuations were frequently but not always thought by AIB to evaluate property as a security.  Could I refer to AIB before Vol. 1 on page 10.  You were referring to part 2006 in your statement today, but the board minutes show this problem persisted two and a half years later, 2006,  2007 and half way through 2008.  There was a discussion about AIB's practice of not seeking professional property valuations, and whether this will have implications in terms of financial accounts to giving a true and fair view.  So,  given that the commercial property went up 14 times from &euro;8 billion to &euro;112 billion, and the residential, as you have been saying to us, went up much less, &euro;25 billion to &euro;122 billion, the practice of not doing the valuations was still of concern at board level on 24 July 2008.</p></speech>

As that's being sought, it refers to a board discussion, AIB's exposure to the broad property building construction sector, amounted to 260% of own funds, while the limit was 250%.  And let me go on, the board requested that this issue be pursued with the IFSRA, given that the standards clearly required revision.  Is that me saying I was speeding but the speed limits were wrong, kind of ... you know or ... it's a pretty strange attitude to the regulator that you assumed that at the board level, the regulator was at fault.</p></speech>

I wouldn't have had any direct engagement with the regulator here but my understanding was this, we were in breach of the limits ... we were in breach of a limit that set out a singular constraint on the totality of all property and construction lending.  That had been in place for a long time.  What was going on in prudential circles at the time, and there is reference to it here in the paragraph just before that, what was going on at the time, was the introduction of Basel II conventions to analyse, and these were new protocols that were being introduced for the assessment of risk attaching to loans, and the thrust of those was not to look on loans as one homogeneous set, but to break them into what were called logical portfolios and to look at the particular risk attributes that are attached to each of them.  My understanding is that the regulator was also of the view that that's where they needed to go and for that reason that the old limit was somewhat ... somewhat redundant and were in conversation with AIB saying, "How are you doing this, and actually how are you getting comfort with the scale of your exposure and is the board comfortable with it?"  And then, as part of that presentation, AIB set out how it went about assessing its portfolio in this new way under this new methodology and the board, it seems, took comfort with that and is saying, okay well, let's then make it clear in our engagement with the regulator, let's have this new formula adopted but let's not have this indecision as to what particular standard of measurement is to apply.  That is my understanding of what was going on but I was not directly in discussion with them.</p></speech>

This deals with a proposal to revise the adjusted loan-deposit ratio.  How did it get to the board?  Did somebody propose it?  Did somebody second it?  Because it makes a 162% ratio into a 115% ratio.  Was this also because we didn't like the regulator when we went over the limit?  I mean, again, it seems to illustrate to me a casual attitude towards regulation.  If you don't like the rules you adjust it to make it a different set.</p></speech>

Let me first say that this wouldn't be my direct area of responsibility but my understand ... I don't believe that's a regulatory constraint.  I don't believe there was any regulatory constraint on loan to deposit.  I may be wrong on that but that's my belief.  What was happening here was that the market was putting a strong focus on the loan-to-deposit ratio in different institutions, but, again, this changing methodology in the market place was an issue and that rather than the simplicity of this customer loans and totality over customer deposits, the market was looking for a more informed ratio, where the value of long-term deposits was recognised or the saleability or liquidity of assets was recognised in the formula and that's what this adjusted loan-to-deposit ratio achieves.</p> <p>So this isn't a regulatory matter, I don't think, Senator.  This is a matter of the way in which AIB presents a picture of itself to the marketplace.  The marketplace was looking for something that was more nuanced and that's what was proposed.</p></speech>

I think we were, looking back, we were going through a period right through from 2002 to 2008 when generally banks globally were being driven to more efficiency, more efficiency meaning that you were endeavouring to squeeze, if I can express it in those terms, performance out of every aspect of the business and it is right to say that I think we were being pushed and responding to a marketplace that was constantly pressing us into positions, perhaps, of more risk, of more efficiency, more leverage of assets all the time.  I think that is true to say but I am just making the distinction between the previous one which was certainly coming from the regulator, this was coming from the market.</p></speech>

It's an undertaking essentially to put the security into effect, whatever that might involve and you leave that in the hands of the solicitor.  He undertakes to do that for you and it's as simple as that really.  You might be taking possession of deeds or might be taking possession of some documents of title and they would involve frequently work at the registry and so forth and the Land Registry and the solicitor will undertake to do those.</p></speech>

There was an internal audit in AIB in April 2006 highlighting an issue relating to outstanding solicitor undertakings in the Republic of Ireland division, your division.  It's the reference page, it's actually up on the screen there in front of you but just for noting purposes, it's AIB B4, Vol. 1, page 20.</p> <p>And in that audit it would demonstrate that outstanding solicitors undertakings was No. 1 in the top three outstanding internal audit issues, as late as October 2008.  This was a continuous issue that was running through AIB.  Was the board aware of this level of difficulty that was there in solicitors' undertakings and them being accepted, relating to property being taken as security, and the lengthy delay in perfecting security in many cases, and was there even situations that when the undertaking wasn't even complete, that the loan was being issued anyway?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-23a.1796" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Donal Forde" time="06:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042300045#UU00200"><p>Well, the loan would always be issued subject to the undertaking because you didn't have the facility to perfect the security there and then.  I suppose you're ... I think I'll answer it in two ways, Chair.  The first is to say that I, and I reference this in my statement, the first thing is, I suppose, to make sure that we see this issue in context.  The practice for all the larger exposures was that the security was handed over to be perfected to first and second order legal firms.  So they would do it for the bank.  So those loan cases with greater exposures were never a problem, they were not an issue.  So this issue related to the lower level cases, but yes, it was a constant difficulty, and as you see, the audit ... that audit report would have been given the board so they were aware of it, but it was one of those issues that I was always working on and we were never ... we were never in a comfortable position.  But it would be important not to overstate that, as I've said, because all the larger exposures would not be at issue here.</p></speech>

Did AIB in all circumstances follow up and ensure that the security had in fact actually been registered?</p></speech>

So this was part of the work of the credit committees.  A loan case would come up for review and if they had a concern about it they would stipulate that it was to be reviewed in perhaps three or six months' time.  Part of that review was to confirm the standing of the security.  So-----</p></speech>

I'm one and a half years removed from that point but that wouldn't surprise me that there were some issues relating to the lower level orders of exposure, around solicitors' undertakings.  I'd be surprised if there's any significant issue with the higher levels because they were always considered to be in good order.</p></speech>

Mr. Forde, I have a few questions also.  I want to refer to the evidence given earlier by Mr. Gleeson.  In his testimony he was asked about AIB being caught in the wake of Anglo, and to quote him directly, he said "we tried not to be brought in the wake but in many ways we were."  I just want to know, in terms of your role, as managing director of AIB from 2002 to 2009, in the Republic of Ireland, was there any direction from the board, from the chair, as to how not to be brought in the wake of Anglo Irish Bank, can you recollect?</p></speech>

I take his reply to mean that he's speaking in the context of the performance of the bank, such things as share price performance, and so forth.  In a way that was up there, if I can describe it in those terms.  At my level, Anglo was just one of a number of people that were very aggressively targeting our business.  I would have gotten no direction to deal with any one competitor more than another.  I would have constantly been relaying information about threats or inroads in our business from Anglo, yes, but Bank of Scotland, Ulster Bank, Danske Bank, Bank of Ireland, so I wouldn't have held Anglo in any particular place from my perspective.  From his, I suspect that in terms of accounting for the performance of the bank to the investor community, would be a constant thorn in-----</p></speech>

You also said that there wasn't decisions, I suppose, taken as to how to change that.  You outlined that one of your roles specifically was to diversify.  How successful were you and the Republic of Ireland operation in terms of that attempt to diversify?</p></speech>

Well, I made that comment earlier in this respect at diversification between different lines of business, and so there was a very heavy push to try to increase the profitability from deposits, from health insurance, life insurance, from fees and charges, from electronic banking.  So, the push was on from that perspective.  There was also a focus on trying as best possible diversify the loan book.  I was more successful with the first of those objectives than I was with the second, and I suppose the reason that I wasn't successful at all with the second was it's rather difficult ... in some respects, you have to respond to the business that your customers want to do.  And, unfortunately, property and construction was where it was all happening, so it made it difficult.</p></speech>

And, in the sense, is it not ... I don't want to put words in your mouth or be accused of leading you, but "wrestling with one's conscience and winning" is a phrase that might come to mind as to how the board dealt with the matter.  Or it might not, just to leave it an open question.</p></speech>

So, I can recall discussions at that time about whether this was appropriate.  There certainly was a consciousness that we were intensely involved in property and construction, so I can remember discussions at that time.  I can remember this discussion that's here, this stress test prompted by the regulator asking the board to validate that its weight of exposure in property and construction ... that it was comfortable with it.  So, I can remember that.  Certainly, no surprise in 2008, as the market began to turn down, there was discussion.  So, I think it is fair to say the board wrestled with it.</p></speech>

And I ... Basel II has been mentioned a lot and the transformation that was taking place within AIB and maybe other organisations at the time, but did those rules still stand or not with regard to sectoral lending, the 200% figure and the 250% for related sectors, and the fact that AIB was at least one third over both of those headings in terms of lending into property and development?

I saw ... it's not ... my responsibility wasn't a one-dimensional one, if I can describe it in those terms, so the risk in our portfolio was one; the profitability that was expected of the division would be another; our relevance to be able to meet the needs of customers was another.  There was a general clamour at that time that the domestic banks, AIB amongst them, was losing position and relevance with customers and that other banks coming in from outside were far more relevant.  So, in the balance of those things and with the belief that the risk in the portfolio was of the order that's outlined in the stress test that wouldn't threaten our capital, I didn't consider that we were in an imprudent place.</p></speech>

That has since been disputed by the said senior official.  Were you aware, at that time or subsequently, of that discussion and those meetings that took place?</p></speech>

Can I put some of that testimony to you from the chairman, Frank Daly?  And both made serious reference to the equality of the security that banks had or didn't have, in terms of massive loans.  Mr Daly said, "The safety zone of borrower equity usually existed only on paper.  The result is that the borrower was typically not the first to lose.  In the event of a crash, the banks stood to take 100% of the losses and that's what happened."  He said, "The model did not appear to require a stringent approach by borrowers to analysing project feasibility."  And he said,  "Very little, if any, consideration was given to the inherent cyclical nature of the property markets. The attitude appears to have been that the only way was up, that somehow the forces of gravity were suspended as far as the Irish market was concerned and that the long established pattern of property market cycles was no longer relevant."  Does any of that apply to Allied Irish Banks?</p></speech>

I'd be the first to acknowledge that I think we did lose sight of the cycle; I think that's fair.  I think the reason for that was that ... my personal view was that there was some order of economic transformation going on in the country; the number of people in employment was growing dramatically, we'd had a period of expansion, and all of the indications were that ... not at the same pace, but that it was sustainable.  So, I certainly was misled into the view that we were not in some bubble but we were in some, as I've said, economic transformation that was in some way more sustainable, so I-----</p></speech>

And it was to ensure that there was security in place, to the order, generally, of 70% of the loan, but, more importantly, to make sure that in the first instance that there was a demonstrable means by which the loan could be repaid.  That was done.  I think where it fell down was that that challenge, if you will, to the repayment capacity of the loan was not rigorous enough at all.  I do accept that.</p></speech>

They were seen to have had a track record of performance and built up significant equity.&quot;</blockquote>A stunning irony struck me in relation to that, I will ask you to comment upon, that at the end of virtually every advertisement for a bank, is &quot;past performance is no indication of future return.&quot;  Was that the situation here?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-23a.1874" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Donal Forde" time="07:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042300049#YY00200"><p>Let me try and rationalise the thinking that was going on at the time, and it's this.  If you can imagine ... earlier on I described I suppose a simple loan project where someone, a developer, has to buy land and go through that long period during which they pay for the land, they develop the housing stock and then they sell it.  Through all that time there is no revenue whatsoever to be got.  If you are dealing with a larger player that has a number of these projects afoot at one time, they tend to be at different stages of maturity so typically you'll have some projects that are closer to revenue and sales than others.  That helps to make the loan a more manageable proposal from the lender's viewpoint.  So the principle of working with a more diversified player that has experience and a track record in building houses on time and within budget, that stands.  What fell down here was that there was such a collapse of economic activity that every element of these different businesses - whether they were involved in residential development or whether they were involved in commercial development - all of them simply weren't able to produce revenue and that logic became completely unstuck.  So I am in a sense defending the principle of working with a diversified player in any industry.  But it afforded us no protection here in the way things developed, as we imagined it would.</p></speech>

Is that an inordinate amount of money, in view particularly of what happened very shortly after that?  And secondly, my last question is in relation to the people out there who have been burned badly as a result of the bubble and crash and what the banks and the bondholders did.  Do you understand how bitter they feel towards the bankers like yourself?</p></speech>

It seems an inordinate amount of money in hindsight and in the context of what happened.  As I tried to indicate in my statement, I spent my professional life with AIB.  I suppose it was my life, it was my career - the interests of the bank were what woke me up in the morning and took me to bed at night.  So, I'm very conscious of my failure, I'm very conscious of the bank's failure and I'm hugely conscious of the implications of it for everybody concerned.  I say that as genuinely as I can and looking back, I do accept that you know, the salaries we were paid now seem silly.  They didn't then in the context of what people in the banking sector earned here at home and abroad.  I had two job offers during that period, one domestically and one abroad that offered more money.  So I had no sense that I was as overpaid as I now seem to have been in hindsight.  I do fully understand that bitterness it creates.  I fully understand the disappointment that there is with us.  I have no quarrel with that, it is justified.  I am very conscious of the manner in which we did leave people down.  All I can say again is that I acted at all times in what I thought was good faith and best conscience.  I never woke up of a morning with any real concern that the bank was in a position of difficulty.  I am wrong on that, but I am guilty of a bad judgment, but no more than that.</p></speech>

It's for others to judge, but I don't think my style was ever intimidating.  I made a practice of actually having a lot of personal conversations with people and I'd like to think I was approachable, so no, I don't think they were afraid at all.  I'm, I'm pretty sure of that but others would have to validate that; I would feel confident in saying that.  I think ... I don't want to say that people wouldn't challenge our position.  I mean at our management team there would be discussions.  The discussions would more relate to what segments of the property market we should be, in a sense, more positive about, others that we should be more negative about.  There was a consciousness about the totality of that exposure, and each time it went back to the debate.  As I've said, it wasn't one dimensional about are we in safe place, what's the risk, what's the stress test telling us, what are ... where are our competitors, what do we have to do to try and remain relevant to our customers; what do we have to do to meet the expectations of the market place.  So, we had each time the debate about the balance of those and wrongly, each time we came down to feel that we were in the right place.</p></speech>

I have explained that my division wasn't so directly impacted, but I was party to the management meetings at which there was conversations about the two divisions that were more directly impacted, AIB capital markets and the UK, and certainly I could see that they were having difficulty increasingly in sourcing money from the market.  The term for which they were sourcing it was shortening.  So it's a judgment call as to whether it was going to last for a month or six weeks, but in broad terms I can understand that as being not an unreasonable picture.</p></speech>

One was a cash bonus but the bank was progressively moving away from that and it was moving more towards the grant of share grants.  And those share grants were dependent on ... and the reason it was moving there was that those share grants were dependent on two aspects of the bank's performance.  They were dependent on how the earnings per share performed over a three-year period, and they depended on the performance of the share price relative to other banks.  And there was another aspect which was that any grants that were given obligated me as a senior person to hold a very substantial share.  So when I hear on occasions that the charge that, you know, that structure incentivised me or others to do the wrong thing or behave in a short-term way, I was a significant shareholder in the bank, so it would be illogical for me to behave in any way that wasn't in the bank's medium long-term interest.  So I never felt any motivation to do anything other than the right thing in the medium to long term.</p></speech>

The people in the property and construction sector, they were obliged to tell me if they were, and they would, frequently someone would say to me that X client has invited me to a football match, or X client has invited me here, and I would approve that.  I would usually make sure that they are paying for it, or if it is excessive, that the bank is paying for it, that there was no suggestion of conflict,  but you have to do that to a point.  It is just a question of judgement that it doesn't go too far but I had no sense ever that it did.  Certainly, by the standards, whether they were all true of what seemed to happen in some other institutions, I think we were a long distance behind.</p></speech>

So, in all of that, I guess the view within AIB that two institutions domestically were particularly compromised was a dominant theme.</p></speech>

There were two things. This was my picture of it. There were two things happening. There were specific concerns about two institutions.  They were giving rise to a particular focus on the Irish market, but generally,  banks even beyond Ireland were having difficulty with funding and liquidity.  The conversations were essentially reviewing both of those dimensions, the domestic concerns revolving around those two, and the broader global picture which was deteriorating rapidly. That certainly was what was in mind as the situation then became more acute, when engagement was going on with the Department of Finance and the regulator. The briefings at those sessions would be from the head of capital markets, from the Head of the UK division, an assessment of those by the chief risk officer, the head of finance, the chief executive, so that conversation was going on. The view that a potential remedy for it was to take out the two problematic institutions, and even then, when they were taken out,  perhaps to guarantee in some limited way the liabilities of the other.</p></speech>

In September '07, the board had approved that underwrite ... written ... &euro;789 million.  A number of weeks later, on the 5 December '07, a request came for &euro;202 million additional to this individual.  Now, the document ... if we look at page 36 of the document ... the document goes on to outline the individuals ... the bank's exposures already.  They talk about a &euro;202 million exposure.  That is the request that was before the board.  They talk about &euro;228 million, which was significant pre-lets.  They talk about &euro;190 million, which was, interestingly - and there's details of this in the first page - which was &euro;160 million to buy shares in ICG, which the board ... which was suggested represented long-term strategic investment.  And I'd maybe ask you to comment ... how did that investment turn out or are you aware of how that investment turned out?</p></speech>

I won't recall this in the detail that you'd wish me to but from the documentation that you've presented there, the proposal talks about a gearing level, I think of 50%, doesn't it?</p></speech>

Is it not the case that most of this is a result of lending, by AIB, to the individual and the equity that responded from the first loan went to pay the second loan, the third loan, the fourth loan and so on and we have a domino effect, when one starts to fall, the house of cards comes in on top of the bank and the developer but the developer, as was said yesterday, has no skin in the game.</p></speech>

I mean, what earlier on I was describing what would typically be happening with a large-scale developer like this, there would be a whole series of different elements of business going on as is indicated by the different facilities here.  Each of those would have a slightly different profile and some of them will represent, in some cases land will be purchased five, six years previously on which there is a very substantial equity today.  In some cases, there's housing stock that's under construction for two or three years that's now ready for completion.  So, or there may be an office development that's being developed that is now ready for sale, so they are not cash but they're near cash if I can describe some of them in that-----</p></speech>

It's in relation to and again we have a document here, the same booklet AIB B2, Vol.1, page 25.  It's another advice to the board re approval of exception of group large exposure policy and this is for &euro;11 million to increase the individual's exposure to the bank to &euro;322 million.  This is, I believe, to buy an acre and three quarters in some place where he has already bought six and a half acres at the cost of &euro;70 million.  The question I ask is the CEO or the group chief executive approved this on 22 December, just a couple of days before Christmas, because of the timescale that was required and it went to the board then for approval.  Now how does that work if the chief executive approves &euro;11 million to increase the exposure of AIB to &euro;322 million in December.  What power does the board have at that point and is that a common factor that the CEO ... did the CEO have that power, is that the power that the group chief executive had at the time?</p></speech>

I think their discretion was up to &euro;75 or &euro;80 million.  I think then the chief executive had a discretion over that, before it went to the board, from memory.  But that was rarely practiced, in fairness and I think this would arise because there was obviously some particular deadline that had to be reached.  That was rare.  It would be unusual that the chief executive would step in and I think it's because of the particular point in time here, Christmas, but that would be an irregular thing.  That would not happen and the board would then be advised of any decisions he had made and would be asked to endorse it.</p></speech>

I think there is something in what you have said and in what the NAMA representatives may have said yesterday.  The difficulty if you are funding a client that is involved in a number of different property projects is that it is difficult for cash to be realised.  There are always ... property of any description when it's in the development, is cash consuming and as a lender you are always faced with that challenge and it is true that in many cases the equity as we saw it, that a developer would be bringing to the occasion would be completed houses or nearly-completed houses or it might be property or land, excuse me, some of which would have been bought five or six years earlier that now ostensibly was worth very much more.</p> <p>So yes, we did regard that as equity, and you're right, when push came to shove, and things ... there's was such a collapse of economic activity, all of these came unstuck.</p></speech>

I suppose if you have a developer who has essentially absorbed the cost of building an estate of houses that are ready for sale, he has a lot of skin in the game at that point, equally.</p></speech>

What NAMA, to my knowledge, and I can stand corrected in this, is the biggest national asset management agency in the world, or is a company that holds the biggest portfolio, so Mr. Daly comes with a certain authority, given the job that he has as the biggest of this type on the planet, to my knowledge.  So Mr. Daly's testimony yesterday, and I'll get it up on the screen there, it is page 2 and 3 of his opening statement.  He says, "While internal bank lending documentation may indicate that loan-to-value ratios were, typically, less than 100% when the loan was drawn, the reality, in many cases, was that a developer's equity contribution was in the form of a rolling-up of unrealised, paper profit from other developments.  This was presented as an equity position."  So it would have been presented to your bank and other banks as an equity position.</p></speech>

On the face of it therefore, developers had some skin in the game, but in reality that amounted to nothing more than unrealised equity positions levered by the developer to secure funding for new transactions."  He then goes on to say, "In effect", and what this means in summary, "In effect, therefore, the banks were providing all of the real cash funding for both acquisitions and development.  It is safe to say that quite often the borrower's paper equity position never paid for an acre of land or concrete or scaffolding or a worker's wage at the end of the week.  The safety zone of borrower equity usually existed only on paper. The result is that the borrower was typically not the first to lose.  In the event of a crash, the banks stood to take 100% of the losses and that's what happened."  Is that a fair reflection of the type of banking practice that you managed for AIB in your senior role?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-23a.2076" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Donal Forde" time="08:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042300057#GGG00900"><p>I think if I go back to an individual case and, so, you had a scenario typically, as I say, where a developer came with a piece of land, essentially, that had been purchased at x and was now worth 2x, okay?  The bank regarded some proportion of the inherent value in that as equity, and had a position of security over it.  So from a security viewpoint it's true to say that we would have relied on many occasions on non-cash assets.  That is true.  But in giving the loan, the proposition would be much more about what assets, essentially, were going to be created with that loan, and what they were going to sell for, and the bank would have, essentially, part of the loan agreement would be, that the proceeds of the sale, for example, of each residential development would come to the bank. So it's true to say that when things happened in the way they did, which is that office developments stopped selling, houses stopped selling, then the source of repayment for the banks, cash, that also stopped.  Then the difficulty arose because the security that we held, which in many cases was equity, also began to devalue very quickly.  So I think it's true to say that in the way things ultimately developed, we were left frequently where it wasn't cash that we had recourse to, but they were assets that were of much less value.  But in the normal run, essentially if the assets that were produced off the back of that loan were sold, the bank would have collected the cash on those, all the time.</p></speech>

I grew up in a council estate, my parents bought their home through a tenant purchase scheme, so I don't come with any big property background, but what I hear him saying here, very simply, is, there is an issue of acceleration and deceleration in the property market, and there's an issue of inflation and deflation in the property market.</p> <p>And what was happening is that inflation was running so quick in the property market and development was at a very accelerated level, so it wasn't the case that a housing development was completed and now sold.  It's that there was a notional value on property that was interpreted right all the way through the process.  So, a developer could develop something in a part of Cork or a part of Dublin and, even though it's now not completed - and we've seen this with housing developments as well as they were going through phases - new values were given to them.  So, even before the development is completed, a valuation would be placed upon it even though it's now not even out in the market - there's no rents coming in or anything else - and that equity - notional equity, albeit - was now being used as leverage against another loan.</p></speech>

I think that is fair.  The only comment I'd make on that is that it wouldn't be the full value, that it would be a discounted value of it.  So, in the instance that you describe where a development was near completion, a value would attach to that, but not the full value.  It would be discounted, but, yes, that would be ... have been considered as equity.</p></speech>

I fully acknowledge ... I mean, as I've said, where ... in a way, the model worked so long as developers were able to sell their assets and the produce of the work that they were doing.  We didn't require them to sell 100%, but we required them to be able to generate a measure of cashflow from those assets.  The wheels came off when that was not possible because all economic activity got suspended some time in 2009, and the wheels came off at that point.  I think it goes too far to suggest that we were allowing people just to build paper on paper, but I think we were doing that in some measure, yes.</p></speech>

Yes, well the dividend automatically got reinvested, I think, as part of a profit share, yes.  Sorry, we would have ... I'm ... the reason I'm hesitant is I would have had an established, big established shareholding and I would have got a dividend on that, some of which would have been invested automatically; I'm not sure if all of it was.  I can't say that.</p></speech>

I think the ... there was different views.  There was a conflicting view, one view held being that it was important at that point to demonstrate a confidence that the management felt that we were in a reasonably secure position from a capital viewpoint.  There was another view with the idea that essentially we needed to conserve capital.  And the view that went out was the one that we needed to make a strong statement to the market and I was persuaded by that, yes.</p></speech>

What I'm trying to convey here is, when times are good, a banker's instinct is to put money aside.  The rules were specifically designed to disallow you from putting money aside, so we always felt that, look, this isn't a clever formula.  And, with respect to the specifics, we would have been obviously of a much stronger mind to have a greater quantum aside in late '07, in '08, than would have been the case in '04, '05 and '06.</p></speech>

I made it ... I hope that I've made it clear that, you know, I am party to something that went very horribly wrong, and it's not a pleasant feeling, let me say, and I'm very conscious of the implications of that.  But, you know, it is a misjudgment, and it's all of that, but no more than that.  I mean, there was at no point, I can say, at any time in my period as MD had I any real concern that the bank was operating in a manner that could be described as reckless.  That's poor judgment, but I never had such a concern; I never went to sleep with any anxiety that I was doing the wrong thing for the bank in the medium to long term and, you know, I acknowledge the error of that and I acknowledge the consequences of it, but it's that and it's no more than that, I think, expressed in those terms.</p></speech>

The public hearing on Wednesday morning will commence at 9.30 a.m.  On Thursday, to facilitate events in the afternoon the public hearing will commence at 9 a.m., so we'll be moving it a little bit forward to accommodate the break that we need to accommodate for the afternoon.  So, with that now said, I propose that the meeting is adjourned until 3.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 28 April 2015.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>
