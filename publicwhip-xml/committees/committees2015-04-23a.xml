The credit unions paid into a fund to help other credit unions and it has been in existence for a number of years.  I raise it in the context that the Credit Union Restructuring Board, ReBo, came before the committee some months ago.  ReBo uses taxpayers' money to help credit unions that may be in difficulty to amalgamate or work together.  Is there a conflict regarding money the credit unions already had, how they are spending it and how taxpayers' money is being spent?  Are they aware of each other's movements?  Is the Central Bank aware of how the money is being spent?  Is there anything we can do to move it forward?  While it is operated by the credit unions themselves, if we are providing taxpayers' money to help the credit union movement, surely there is a link to the money they may already have.</p></speech>

When we receive the note and understand the background to it from the Central Bank's perspective, the Deputy can decide whether he wants to discuss it further.  The first step is to get the information, if the Deputy agrees.  We will do it immediately and report back to the members.</p></speech>

The Department indicated that it had established an expert group to consider the future of the site.  The Department had installed sanitation in all the cells.  Since the decision was taken not to go ahead, the media has reported that up to 800 prisoners are taking an action regarding the practice of slopping out.  Could we have some clarification about what will happen?</p></speech>

However, it is the case that if the Government decided to change the legislation or to bring in specific legislation in regard to that type of inquiry, it could then be done, but not now.  I was in the Chamber yesterday and was surprised by the announcement, but now that we have clarity on it, the Government can issue a further statement of intent if it wants to.  As of today, however, that is our position.</p> <p>  Relative to that, and because it was mentioned in regard to the Department of Finance, can we now ask for the papers relative to the sale of other entities, given it was specifically stated that there was a concern by Department officials in regard to how other entities were disposed of?  Presumably, it is within our remit to ask that question and to seek that information from the Department of Finance not just in regard to one transaction, but also the other transactions they were concerned about.  I think that is something the committee can request.  If that is the case, then I would suggest to members that the least we should do is ask for all of the information on the other entities that have been spoken about.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-23a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1008" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015042300002#C00500"><p>I appreciate the clarity of the Comptroller and Auditor General in stating that, as it stands, he and his office have no remit or power to investigate matters related to IBRC.  I am struck by the fact - this is my interpretation and I am not attributing this thought process to the Comptroller and Auditor General - that the Department indicated a willingness to bring forward legislation to expand the role and remit, and, by extension, the role and remit of this committee.  Our experience has been, to my way of thinking over the past number of months, that, in fact, we have had our wings trimmed and a narrow remit has been very carefully observed and overseen.  If there is a proposition or a willingness to extend the reach of the Comptroller and Auditor General, and, by extension, of this committee, I would find that very interesting.  We should certainly have a view on that and we should seek to have an input to it.</p> <p>  It would seem extraordinary if the Government or the Department were proposing to bring forward legislation to allow the Comptroller and Auditor General to look only at the Siteserv transaction because, as the Chairman himself said, the concerns that have been raised are far broader than that.  I support the Chairman's proposal to correspond with the Department and anyone else on all of those matters, first, to establish what is going on, and, second, to take a view as to whether, even with extended powers, the Comptroller and Auditor General is the proper and appropriate office to review, consider and conclude all of these matters.</p></speech>

It is something that we have been expressing to some degree in regard to some of the limitations on our work.  If that can be enhanced by an extension through legislation, that should be welcomed and we should seek to have a considerable input to that legislation.</p> <p>  Second, in regard to Siteserv, IBRC was a bank that went into State ownership and Siteserv was a construction services company that, likewise, would have come into State ownership because all the debts were taken over by the State.  Is it possible that Siteserv could be looked at as an entity in its own right, distinct from IBRC?  I know there are ramifications and, obviously, linkages which are substantial.  However, in its own right, is Siteserv, as an entity that was in the possession of the State before it was sold off, not something that the Comptroller and Auditor General could examine, as distinct from IBRC?  It is hard to make that distinction.</p></speech>

At that point in time, are we not talking about the protection of taxpayers' money, which is part of the remit of this committee?</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993 deals with the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In this particular instance, neither the Comptroller and Auditor General nor, by extension, the PAC has any responsibility or any remit in regard to IBRC.  While the company may or may not have been in State ownership at some stage or other during the process, it is the case that, for example, AIB is in State ownership but we do not have it before us.  What we need to do is focus on what was suggested by the Taoiseach yesterday and the comment Mr. McCarthy has added to that this morning, namely, that if the PAC or the Comptroller and Auditor General were to look at this, it would require legislation.  In the context of that legislation, I am taking from members that we would take the opportunity to look at the remit of the committee and have an input to the legislation.</p> <p>  Second, what is within our remit is the Department of Finance and its officials.  We have already agreed to ask for the paperwork in regard to their concerns and the entities they were concerned about so we can examine them.  They are due before us on 17 May and it is possible that if we flag it for them, we can deal with the issues generally from the Department's perspective.  However, we do not have a role in regard to private companies, and that has to be made clear.  We have a number of suggestions here that the members are agreeable on, and I will ask the clerk to act on each one of them today.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-23a.88" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015042300002#E00400"><p>The appropriation account for Vote 39 indicates that the Health Service Executive gross expenditure for 2013 amounted to &euro;13.87 billion.  This was approximately &euro;98 million more than provided for in the original Estimate for the Vote approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Approximately 10% of the amount spent was funded through a range of appropriations-in-aid of the Vote, which amounted to &euro;1.37 billion in 2013, a shortfall of approximately &euro;89 million compared to the amount of receipts forecast in the original Estimate.  The net result was a requirement for Exchequer funding of &euro;12.5 billion for 2013, approximately &euro;188 million or 1.5% more than originally budgeted for.  This budget overrun was met by a Supplementary Estimate in December 2013 which allocated an additional &euro;219 million to the HSE.  The &euro;31 million unspent at the end of the year was liable for surrender.</p> <p>  While the overrun relative to the original Estimate in 2013 is relatively modest, it continued a pattern of such overruns that has extended over many years.  In addition, the variance relative to budget is more significant in some spending and receipts areas than others.  The HSE is one of a small number of Votes in respect of which a Supplementary Estimate is required annually.  Notes 3 and 4 of the appropriation account provide explanations of significant variances in spending and receipts.</p> <p>  The Accounting Officer has included in the appropriation account a comprehensive statement on the system of internal financial control in place in the HSE.  This reflects the complexity of the HSE as an organisation and the range of services and facilities it provides.  I am keen to draw the committee's attention to certain key matters dealt with by the Accounting Officer in that statement.  These relate to the extent to which the HSE does not comply with its own procurement procedures, based on national and EU procurement rules - I have reported separately on this matter and I will outline my findings in that regard presently; the development by the HSE of arrangements to enhance its oversight of the governance of section 38 funded agencies, a matter the committee has inquired into previously, in particular their adherence to national public pay policy; a comprehensive review by the HSE examining its compliance with tax rules - this review was ongoing when the account was being finalised and the HSE expected to settle any underpayment of tax during 2014; the non-collection of income in respect of services provided by the HSE to some nationals of other EU states who are visiting or resident in Ireland due to weaknesses in the data collection systems in respect of such cases; and measures and initiatives taken by the HSE to ensure appropriate control over medical card eligibility.</p> <p>  Chapter 14 deals with the issue of procurement by the HSE, in particular, the extent to which procurement is based on competitive processes that can potentially deliver significant savings to the HSE.  To put the matter in context, excluding drugs paid for by the primary care reimbursement service, approximately &euro;1.6 billion of the HSE's &euro;14 billion expenditure relates to the procurement of goods and services directly by the HSE.</p> <p>  The chapter under examination today is not the first occasion on which we have reported on procurement by the HSE.  Committee members may recollect that the 2010 report on the accounts of the public services contained two chapters dealing with aspects of procurement by the HSE.  One dealt with procurement generally while the other examined procurement of external consultancies.  These chapters were examined by the committee in June 2012.</p> <p>  Among the conclusions and recommendations in those chapters were that there was scope for the HSE to increase its use of procurement frameworks; procurement should be based on up-to-date contracts rather than on simply rolling over expired contracts; the HSE had not put in place an adequate system to track non-competitive procurement and, therefore, did not know the extent to which procurement was not compliant with procurement rules; and that out of a sample of 27 consultancies which cost the HSE a total of more than &euro;41 million, the executive had tendered openly for only ten and that only ten had formal contracts or service level agreements in place to govern the procurement.</p> <p>   In the chapter under examination by the committee this morning, we report that non-compliance with procurement rules continued to be a significant problem within the HSE in 2013.  We examined in detail a sample of 100 purchases in 2013 at six different HSE locations with a total value of &euro;2.2 million.  We found that more than one third or 36% had not been subject to appropriate procurement processes.  In terms of value, these represented 47% or almost half of the value of the items examined.</p> <p>  The HSE is required to submit an annual report to my office and to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on any non-compliant procurement.  The report for 2013 referred to 116 contracts valued at &euro;17.6 million having been awarded without a competitive process.  Our examination found that 31 of the 36 instances of non-competitive procurement identified should have been included in that report.  In fact, only three were included.  On that basis, we concluded that the HSE's internal assurance process is failing to highlighting the true level of non-compliant procurement that is occurring.</p> <p>  We found that, centrally, the HSE had increased the number of framework agreements in place from 52 to 83 in the three years since July 2011.  However, the audit found a lack of awareness of the existence of those frameworks at the six locations visited during the audit.</p> <p>  The HSE has provided to the committee a copy of the management letter issued by my office following the 2013 audit of the HSE's appropriation account and annual financial statements.  A draft of the letter was inadvertently released by the HSE some weeks ago.  This has been mentioned previously at this committee.  Normally, the management letter does not come into the public domain and, therefore, it might be helpful for me to explain the context.</p> <p>  The primary purpose of the letter is to formally alert management and the HSE audit committee of any matters of concern that come to our attention during the course of an audit.  It does not aim to be a complete report on all control weaknesses or irregularities within the HSE.  We simply could not undertake the amount of work necessary to provide such a report each year, and, in any event, the HSE's own internal audit examines and reports on the operations of HSE controls.  The letter forms part of an overall feedback system to HSE management and the audit committee.  We also communicate any matters of concern that arise in the course of regular meetings with management and the audit committee throughout the audit cycle.  The management letter formally captures the salient issues as well as the response of management and serves as a key reference document for follow up by us in the next year's audit.  Failure on the part of the HSE to address significant matters raised could result in future examination or possibly a report on the matter.</p> <p>  Our draft management letter for 2013 issued to HSE management on 30 September 2014.  We sought HSE management's response to the points raised.  I understand that while this was being compiled, the letter was inadvertently released around the beginning of March.  Since then, the HSE has provided its final response on the points we raised and this is captured in the final version of the letter, which is before the committee today.</p> <p>  The table on screen before the committee sets out a summary of the key areas where we had findings and the priority classification we awarded these.  Overall, there are 52 points in the letter.  These can be conveniently categorised into 12 areas.  Each of the 52 points is awarded a rating based on its perceived importance.  A high rating indicates a significant weakness in the current control environment, financial management or governance that, in our view, requires immediate action by HSE management.  A medium rating represents an opportunity to improve the effectiveness of the control environment, financial management or governance, and requires management attention in the near term.  A low rating is a general opportunity to improve efficiency and effectiveness of the processes or controls.  Further low risk issues may be identified by us.  These are discussed with the relevant managers and we keep them under review.</p> <p>  Of the issues rated as high, a large number relate to the control over grants to outside agencies, the operations of the primary care reimbursement service and the nursing home support scheme, known as the fair deal scheme.  We have highlighted many of these issues in reports in the past and in audit certificates relating to HSE financial statements.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-23a.90" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015042300002#E00600"><p>Thank you for the invitation to attend today's meeting to discuss the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2013 report and appropriation accounts relating to Vote 39 - Health Service Executive and Chapter 14 relating to procurement by the HSE.</p><p>I wish to record my thanks to the committee for its kindness and sensitivity in rescheduling this meeting.  We have submitted information and documentation to the committee in advance of the meeting and I will, therefore, confine my opening remarks to the following issues.</p><p> The first is the 2013 out-turn.  The Revised Estimates volume provided a net vote estimate of &euro;12.312 billion for the HSE, a reduction of &euro;209 million from the final 2012 allocation.  A net Supplementary Estimate of &euro;219 million was passed by the D&aacute;il on 12 December 2013.  The Supplementary Estimate amounted to 1.8% of the original net Vote with &euro;188 million or 1.5% eventually required and the balance of &euro;31 million returned to the Exchequer.  From the outset in 2013, the Department of Health and the HSE identified certain risks to the achievement of the very demanding savings targets in the 2013 service plan.  Some of these risks materialised, including the delay in finalising and implementing the Haddington Road agreement, which was &euro;70 million; the decision by the Government to defer the introduction of charging for private patients occupying public hospital beds, which was &euro;62 million; and the delay in the introduction of regulations under the FEMPI Act to reduce fees paid to doctors and pharmacists which could not be introduced until the Haddington Road agreement was finalised.</p><p> Outside of these areas the HSE delivered a &euro;25-million surplus made up of deficits on core services, primarily hospitals and surpluses on capital and other services.  This was a considerable achievement in view of the very challenging environment in which the HSE operated in 2013 given the increasing demand due to demographic pressures, the need to ensure patient safety as a priority at all times and the very challenging targets for service delivery.</p><p> The draft management letter for the 2013 audit was issued by the Comptroller and Auditor General on 30 September 2014 on completion of the audit and certification of the HSE accounts.  The purpose of sending a management letter in draft format is to set out the Comptroller and Auditor General's observations from the audit and to confirm the factual accuracy of those observations with the HSE.  On receipt of the Accounting Officer's response, the Comptroller and Auditor General further considers his observations in light of the responses received before formally issuing the management letter to the Accounting Officer.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has pointed out that his management letter should also be considered in the context of the audit certificate and any chapters in the Comptroller and Auditor General's annual report.  The final management letter has been received by the HSE and a copy has been provided to the committee in advance of this meeting.</p><p> I have set out the actions which have been or are currently being taken by the HSE to address the control issues identified.  These issues underline the imperative of specific and sustained focus on compliance at all levels of the organisation.  The implementation of these recommendations by management will be co-ordinated by a national financial controls assurance group and progress will be monitored during 2015 by the national performance oversight group and the audit committee.  The situation will also be reassessed by the HSE in the 2015 review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control.</p><p> The HSE established a compliance unit in 2014 to support the development of a strong and consistent compliance culture across all section 38 and 39 agencies funded by the HSE.  A key role of the compliance unit is to safeguard the regulatory and governance obligations of the HSE through ensuring that all funded agencies are compliant with the guidelines and regulations as set out in the service arrangements.</p><p> The primary legal framework under which the HSE provides financial support to non-statutory service providers is set out in the Health Act 2004.  In 2009, the HSE developed a formal national governance framework with national standard governance documentation known as service arrangements to manage the funding provided to these agencies and this came into operation in 2010.  The service arrangements are to ensure a national standardised consistent application of good governance and eliminate the need for individual contracts to be created each time the HSE funds an agency.</p><p> In December 2013, the HSE sought to enhance its governance arrangements with section 38 agencies and also to strengthen the direct relationship between the HSE and the boards - as distinct from executive management - of each of these agencies.  In particular, the HSE established a formal engagement process with the chairs of the boards, including formal meetings twice a year; introduced a new compliance statement whereby the chair and another director of the board signs and confirms on behalf of the board that the agency had complied in full or in part with eight key areas under its service arrangement; and defined best practice requirements for boards and corporate governance arrangements.  The requirement for an annual compliance statement came into effect on 1 January 2014 and is applicable to each agency's 2013 annual financial statements with a requirement for agencies to have a plan in place to achieve compliance in respect of 2014.  All section 38 agencies signed the annual compliance statement in respect of 2013.</p><p> The committee will have recently received the HSE report on the implementation of recommendations in the HSE's internal audit report on section 38 agencies' remuneration.  As the committee will be aware, the internal audit report contained 22 recommendations which dealt, in the main, with issues of compliance with approved public sector remuneration levels for senior management in agencies funded under section 38 of the Health Act 2004.  A total of 17 of the recommendations have been implemented in full, a further three are still in progress and it was not possible to implement two of the recommendations due to information gained or decisions made since the audit was completed.  One of the recommendations, No. 9, relates to decisions in respect of applications to red-circle remuneration arrangements on a personal to post holder basis due to legal contractual entitlements.  A total of 85 such cases have been submitted for consideration from 25 agencies.  These applications have been made under section 7(4) of the pay policy and have been made by the agencies after they obtained independent legal advice to ensure that action taken by the agency as an employer is legally compliant.  This mitigates the risk of future legal action to the greatest extent possible.  The cases were submitted to the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform and we are awaiting their decisions.</p><p> This committee had a significant interaction with St. Vincent's Hospital Group.  There remain serious outstanding issues concerning overall governance arrangements in this group, notwithstanding the clear commitments made here and to the HSE concerning "swinging around into compliance" by the then chair of the group board.  To be fair to him, he had made some important progress on that before his removal from office by the group's shareholders.</p><p> Members have received an advance briefing document on chapter 14 of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report dealing with procurement by the Health Service Executive.  In the conclusion to Chapter 14, the Comptroller and Auditor General drew attention to a number of issues and made a number of recommendations.  The HSE accepted the conclusions and the related recommendations and has over the past 15 months implemented actions to address them.  It is also important to note that through ongoing work in procurement over the past number of years, significant savings have been achieved by the HSE.  </p><p> In respect of the recommendations and the actions taken by the HSE, I highlight the following.  In November 2010, an agreement was negotiated following an LRC process to implement a single integrated procurement function for the HSE.  This implementation necessitated the re-positioning of all procurement staff to the head of procurement.  In 2013, a further change was implemented and progressed following the Government decision incorporating the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, and "one voice" for health procurement.  A health procurement plan 2016-2019 is under preparation in consultation with budget managers across the health system.  A procurement programme management system, PPMS, is being developed to manage work in progress in regard to future multi-annual procurement plans and to provide up-to-date reporting on progress and outcomes.  Since the audit, some frameworks have been combined on the basis of similar requirements and also some frameworks are transferred to the OGP.  The HSE currently has put 80 national framework agreements in place covering the majority of its common expenditure categories and has in excess of 550 central contracts in place covering an annual expenditure value of &euro;426 million.  To improve the communications, awareness of framework agreements and contracts, the HSE has developed a procurement assisted sourcing system, PASS, from which budget holders will be able to access current contracts information.</p><p> The HSE is implementing on a phased basis the national distribution centre, NDC, plan which will consolidate stock holding across the HSE, improve contract compliance, increase stock management at the point of use and control and deliver efficiencies in transactional costs.  Over the past 15 months, HSE procurement has achieved cost reductions of over &euro;50 million.  Since 2010, with the development of a centralised procurement function, total savings achieved to date have been &euro;250 million.  Work has commenced on a data warehouse and business intelligence system which will allow for information to be extracted for reporting, data analysis and comparisons across the numerous financial systems within the HSE.  The HSE has commenced a new training programme for senior managers outlining the importance of being compliant with procurement rules and national financial regulations.  Over 100 senior staff members have been trained to date.  Arising out of the finance reform agenda, we are currently considering options to deliver an integrated financial and procurement management system.</p><p>These systems and enhanced processes will assist budget holders and procurement personnel in identifying areas where greater efficiencies can be achieved and will support compliance with procurement rules. </p><p> A detailed briefing note was submitted to the committee on the issues relating to the Waterford intellectual disability service.  I will highlight several points in regard to this very serious and sensitive matter.  The HSE has been involved in undertaking an inquiry into the standard of care provided by one foster family in Waterford over an extended period.  This inquiry involved two distinct phases.  The first, which commenced in 2010, examined the standard of care provided to a person with an intellectual disability who resided with that foster family.  This report, the Conal Devine report, was completed in March 2012.  A complex legal process followed the completion of the first phase of the investigation.  Once that was resolved, the second phase involved a full tracing and look-back exercise in respect of all clients, living and agreeable to this process, who had contact with the foster family concerned.</p><p> In addition to the inquiry by the HSE, these matters are also subject to an ongoing Garda investigation, as well as civil proceedings.  The matter has also seen the involvement of the Wards of Court office.  In this context, the HSE is limited as to what it can comment on publicly.  The service and policy issues have been the subject of discussion at the Joint Committee on Health and Children and the HSE has committed to providing that committee with a copy of the inquiry reports once clearance has been received from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Wards of Court.  The Data Commissioner has also been advised of the HSE's intention to publish the reports once clearance is received.  In the meantime, the HSE is anxious to assist this committee in so far as possible in its consideration of the procurement issues involved in the process.</p><p> The appointment of inquiry teams is not subject to tender for several reasons.  The nature of inquiries is that they deal with sensitive issues which it would not be appropriate or even permissible in some cases to discuss or publish for the purposes of conducting an open tender process.  Inquiries are often urgent and the time periods for open tendering do not permit the conduct of a tender process in such circumstances.  The scope and extent of inquiries often means there may be only one person or collection of persons with the technical expertise to deal with the matter.  Professional experience and expertise are critical for the conduct of inquiries.</p><p> There are exceptions under procurement rules which mean the HSE is not required to tender in each of the above circumstances.  The relevant regulation is Regulation 32 of the European Communities (Public Authorities' Contracts) Regulations 2006, which permits awarding authorities to engage in a negotiated procedure without a call for competition in these exceptional circumstances.  In the briefing note that was submitted to the committee on this serious and sensitive issue, we set out the process that was followed in regard to the procuring of Conal Devine, who undertook the first phase of the inquiry, and Resilience Ireland, which undertook the second phase.  Resilience Ireland appointed an inquiry team which consisted of two people who previously worked in the health system, and the briefing provides further detail in that regard. </p><p> It is important to point out that the expertise required to undertake this broad-ranging and sensitive work included expertise in conducting serious incidents, reviews and investigations, knowledge of the social care services, child protection knowledge and expertise, as well as knowledge and experience of safeguarding practice.  This type of expertise is not readily available in Ireland.  As a result, the local HSE area asked Resilience Ireland to undertake the review as it had available the specialist staff and knowledge, which included the former health care employees, to undertake the review within the timeframe available.  It is important to emphasise that while these former health care employees have worked in the health system in the past, neither has ever held management responsibility for service delivery in the Waterford or south-east areas.</p></speech>

I welcome the witnesses and thank Mr. O'Brien for his presentation.  Prior to my becoming a member of this committee, issues relating to section 38 agencies were examined in considerable detail here.  I understand a total of 202 business cases were presented to the HSE relating to instances where the remuneration of individuals was outside of the accepted pay policy guidelines.  Are there any other agencies where such applies and in respect of which a business case has not been submitted?</p></speech>

In some of the cases we looked at, that was done by way of payments that were effectively coming from the public purse.  In other instances, it was by way of pay that was coming from a separate source.  In this particular instance, a business case has not been made to continue making payments from the public purse because it is contended that the pay was never coming from that source.</p></speech>

We are saying that by not giving us this information, it is not in compliance with our process.  While that might seem like splitting hairs, there is an important distinction.  In some instances, throughout this process, we discovered that some of the returns that were made to us at the outset included arrangements which probably should never have been returned.  For example, there were instances where people were receiving genuinely private income from legitimate private sources but, for reasons of administrative convenience, this was put through a singular pay roll and returned to us, which might not have been the appropriate thing to do.  These issues are never completely black and white.  I am conscious that whenever this issue comes up, two individuals in Holles Street may be feeling under particular pressure.  I do not want to suggest that we have reached a view that they are in breach of public policy.  We do not yet know whether or not that is the case.</p></speech>

Did the HSE not consider the matter important enough to seek to clear it up before now?  There are 202 other cases where issues have arisen in regard to red circling and so on, but this uncertainty in regard to the personnel at Holles Street cases is allowed to drag on.</p></speech>

All of the unauthorised allowances, the subject of the discussion, were discontinued in line with the commitments made by the chairman when he attended the committee.  It included some staff members actually leaving the public service altogether.</p> <p>  The outstanding issue relates to the relationship between St. Vincent&rsquo;s Private Hospital and St. Vincent's University Hospital which are under the combined management of a board known as the St. Vincent's Hospital Group.  The concern aired by the committee at the time - it is continuing - was that consultants whose contracts did not permit them to work in private hospitals were being permitted by the St. Vincent's Hospital Group to do so.  The information I have available is that approximately 56% of the admitting consultants at St. Vincent&rsquo;s Private Hospital are consultants whose contracts do not permit them to work there.

Any one of us could log on to its website and pull down a full listing of all the consultants who work there in one form or another.  Funnily enough, I have a copy in my bag.  It does not, however, give me the level of detail that I need.  My concern is that, in effect, the private hospital is being run on the back of the public hospital.  I am concerned for the public hospital, but I am equally concerned for the private hospital.  Given its bed stock, number of theatres and parasitic dependence on the public hospital, it may well not be viable as a private hospital.  It is a private hospital that was developed on the back of the tax investor scheme, which means that it has serious implications for health care in the area and those who invested in it.  I want to balance this by saying St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital is an important part of our health infrastructure and has many fine clinicians, as well as fine national and specialist services.  This should in no way reflect on the quality of care provided in it.</p></speech>

It is important to be clear that a number of them have contracts that permit this, while a number do not.  There are different categories of contract, what are known as category 2 contracts, B star contracts and so forth, but there appear to be a number of consultants with B contracts working in the private hospital.  It is our view that their contracts do not permit this.</p></speech>

There is also the option of having what is known as a category C contract, which is what is normally applied for where a consultant's specialty depends on him or her being able to work privately in order to maintain his or her skills.  In current circumstances I am not in a position to consider any category C application from St. Vincent's University Hospital without full disclosure.  There are no category C consultants at St. Vincent's University Hospital.</p></speech>

A number of category C applications have been made by St. Vincent's University Hospital.  They require the approval of the hospital and the consultant and involve some other approval processes.  They are referred to a type C committee and ultimately come to me for approval.

He said "inquiries are often urgent and the time periods for open tendering do not permit the conduct of a tender process in circumstances where the establishment of an inquiry is urgent."  The issue with which we are dealing concerns the alleged sexual abuse of mentally disabled children.  It has been alleged that there were dozens of children involved.  The allegations date back about 24 years.  I have looked at this issue inside out and there was no urgency in dealing with it.  In fact, it was the exact opposite.  There was resistance to dealing with it, from start to finish, within Mr. O'Brien's organisation.  To actually characterise any of it as being "urgent" in any respect within the organisation is false.</p> <p>  On the tender process, Mr. O'Brien said inquiries were related to sensitive issues which it would not be appropriate or even permissible in some cases to discuss or publish for the purposes of an open tender process.  I wish to delve into that specific point initially with the staff from the Office of Government Procurement at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform who are present.  It might also be worthwhile seeking the opinion of the Comptroller and Auditor General on what Mr. O'Brien said about the reasons this was not put out to tender.</p> <p>  A couple of things really strike me.  Mr. O'Brien has said the necessary expertise was not available in Ireland, but how does he know that if it was not put out to tender?  Tenders are not just about cost, they are also about getting the appropriate person with the appropriate skills set, but there was no attempt to do this.  When it comes to the rules on contracts, the relevant regulation is No. 32 of the EC (Public Authorities Contracts) Regulations which permit awarding authorities to engage in a negotiated procedure without a call for competition in exceptional circumstances.  Was there a negotiated procedure when it came to Resilience Ireland and Mr. Conal Devine?  Was the Office of Government Procurement involved in the negotiated procedure with the HSE in this regard?  I ask Mr. Ryan and Mr. Bresnan to indicate whether that was the case.</p></speech>

The Office of Government Procurement was not involved in the tendering process which was handled by the contracting authority.  The general position is that our guidelines require a competitive process.  That should be the norm when purchasing or awarding contracts, except in duly justifiable cases.</p></speech>

That is why we are in this position.  The in-house experts were continually ignored.  Senior social care officers were continually ignored, which is the reason we have ended up in this position.  Frankly, the last line of the statement is insulting, where Mr. O'Brien refers to the two whistleblowers who had made protected disclosures and says, "neither has ever held management responsibility for service delivery"-----</p></speech>

I believe there was a clique in the HSE for a number of years which shoved all of this under the rug.</p> <p>  I will go back to the issue of urgency.  The two whistleblowers who made protected disclosures contacted their senior managers in September or October 2009, but they were ignored.  They were then forced to go to the Department to make protected disclosures.  A report was commissioned in March 2010, approximately four or five months after the protected disclosures had been made.  It took two years to finalise the report, but at the time of its initiation, it was announced that it would take eight weeks.  There was no urgency - absolutely none.  We must remember that the allegations date back to 1992.   </p> <p>  Regarding investigations, persons involved in the health care system and the health boards then in place reported what they felt were improper practices in the foster home mentioned by Mr. O'Brien.  When he uses the word "urgency", I do not take him seriously because there is absolutely no evidence that urgency was shown in any of this.  The report was then sent to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  When was it officially sent to the Garda?  When did it first get sight of the report finalised by Mr. Conal Devine?</p></speech>

How does the HSE continue to contract people who had worked in the organisation for years, knew the people who were in management in the south east region and had had contact with them over years?  Who in their right mind would consider that independent?  I have nothing against Mr. Conal Devine but I have been dealing with the families who dealt with Resilience and the process was appalling.

How could he possibly know that the expertise did not exist if the HSE did not put it out to open tender?  He would have absolutely no idea whether the expertise existed if it was not publicised.  Notwithstanding the sensitivity he just mentioned, how would he know?  The reason Mr. O'Brien and the organisation did not make an attempt to do this was because there was a comfort factor in finding individuals known by the senior officials in the HSE to deal with this.  This stems back to 1992.  It was 17 years previous to this commissioning of the report, in terms of Mr. Conal Devine, that these issues arose.  Surely there was an urgency within the HSE to take it out of the HSE and deal with this independently.  There was never an attempt to do that - it remained in the fold and the fold got stronger.</p></speech>

Conal Devine was not part of the HSE.  His piece of work was directed specifically at the specific allegations.  The secondary decision was to have a broader look back.  The skill sets that the individuals have is an appropriate skills set and I told the committee what the exemptions are under EU procurement.  Clearly, the Deputy is not happy with that situation.  I am simply putting forward the rationale for the decisions that were made at the time and I do not believe there is any basis to question the integrity of the individuals concerned, particularly those whose names have been mentioned today.</p></speech>

I am not questioning the integrity of any individuals, I am talking about HSE procedures.  This is the Committee of Public Accounts.  Surely we are allowed to ask about procurement procedures and whether it is appropriate to hire people who are former HSE employees - Mr Crowley, as was said, and not Mr. Devine.  Is it appropriate to do that in cases like this?  It is not and Mr. O'Brien would have known that.  He would have known the history of this issue going back to 1992 and, institutionally, people would have understood the allegations that had been made back in 1992 and 1993.</p></speech>

It was not just Mr. Crowley, but Mr. Drohan and Mr. O'Dwyer.  There were plenty of former HSE employees involved in this.  This is endemic.  It is just unbelievable.  In terms  of investigations, one name that comes up is a Mr. Tennant, who is recommended by HSE staff when it comes to section 39 bodies.  It is par for the course - that is what the HSE does and has done for years.  It employs former employees to deal with these issues.  It was not once or twice.  I am not questioning their integrity but am talking about the HSE's unbelievably, incredible, illogical procedures when it comes to procurement and tendering these contracts when it comes to issues like this.</p> <p>  I remind Mr. O'Brien of a couple of things that occurred.  In the case of one girl who was placed in placement, there were significant concerns of abuse back in the 1990s which led to a number of Garda inquiries.  Files were submitted to the DPP.  After a decision was made that it was in her best interests to be removed owing to allegations of sexual abuse, the child was left in that foster home for 13 years.  That was in the 1990s.  Nobody has ever been sacked or disciplined.  The decision was reversed.  The senior care worker - Mr. O'Brien knows his name - arrived on the scene ten years later and went back over the files, making his disclosure in 2009.  Here we are six years later.  There have been news reports about this but they have been scant.  As Mr. O'Brien knows, it has been on RTE's "Prime Time Investigates".  The big finger of the HSE points at people who try to air this, which is worrying when it comes to an organisation like the HSE. </p> <p>  There are other questions regarding the costs involved here which are directly related to the Committee of Public Accounts and the case of that girl.  A fully funded residential bed, held open for two and a half years for the client in question at a cost of &euro;120,000 per annum, was never used.  The costs with regard to Mr. Devine and Resilience Ireland came to a couple of hundred thousand euro.  There were five legal firms involved, also.  I believe the committee should be given the amounts involved in the costs of those legal firms.</p></speech>

Two firms were involved.  From a corporate point of view, Arthur Cox was involved in more recent times.  Local firms were used by the local team when involved in this.  In any investigation of this order, the investigation team itself has to be provided with legal advice separate from the HSE, so we use our own corporate lawyers, Arthur Cox.  When the investigation was undertaken and the completed report was circulated for due process and fair procedure, there was correspondence from lawyers of some of those who received extracts, and that had to be engaged with.</p> <p>  To correct the record in respect of two names mentioned by Deputy Deasy, Mr. Tennant and Mr. Drohan.

Now, it is the rare individual who actually has all of those capacities.  In this individual, one has someone who actually led the Madonna inquiry in Ireland, which gave rise to the basis of the establishment of the social care inspectorate.  He has been involved in, and led, on behalf of the regional health boards at the time, the child care guidelines, Children First.  He was a key player in implementing that.  He is currently a registered social worker.  He was a head social worker for the mid-west for 12 years.</p></speech>

I am just outlining for the Deputy, he is well known within the health service.  His reputation is very significant.  The point I was trying to make was that a key piece here was that a clinical team had to go to meet very sensitively and in line with a protocol from the garda&iacute;, in line with data protection and in line with legal requirements, all of these families.  He supervised, and had the professional capacity to supervise, that work.</p></speech>

That is my point.  They should not have been hired for that reason considering what we were dealing with here.  It was inappropriate.  It was wrong.  I know plenty of people with good CVs and great qualifications.  It was completely wrong for the HSE to hire former employees to deal with something that had existed since 1992.  By the time they made their protected disclosure it was 17 years later.  Surely, one would have copped on by that point that there was something wrong.</p></speech>

Over the course of 23 years, the HSE failed to deal with this issue.  Over the course of many years in the 1990s, the HSE failed to protect these children.  Mr. O'Brien may not have been in the health board but the organisation that he is head of now failed to protect these children and I think it is incredibly serious.  I think it is a dereliction such as I have never seen before.  It is absolutely amazing stuff.  Management that presided over this case had left by the time this inquiry had been completed; they are gone to places like Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  I think everybody who was involved in a senior management position between the early 1990s to date needs to be investigated.  I think that, considering what I know, and what I think the Chairman knows, and considering the interaction we have had with the families, the social care workers who were involved in this and the garda&iacute;, this needs to be taken out of the HSE's hands completely.  I do not think the HSE has a role in this whatsoever any longer.  I do not think the HSE can be trusted to actually look at this independently.  I think the HSE has failed miserably when it comes to the review of this and the investigation of it, regardless of the reports the witnesses have commissioned by their friends.  I think there needs to be a commission of investigation conducted under the appropriate legislation and I think the Minister for Health should look at it immediately with other members of the Government, and I think it should be taken out of this completely now.  The HSE has mishandled this for 23 years.  It is astonishing.  That is it for now.</p></speech>

I will reflect on this just for a minute.  The central concern is the 30 to 40 young adults, at the time, who were in care.  That is first and foremost.  For the work of this committee what is important is the governance issues, the cost and so on, and the investigation itself, whether that was good governance practice or management practice.  The other issue that I find in this report, which I have read, is the issue of protection for the whistleblowers.  I will start by asking if Mr. Healy can tell me, from the date of the reporting, which was 2009, the funding graph for the following five years for the agency that employed the whistleblowers.  Will Mr. Healy tell us what that agency received in, say, 2007 onwards?</p></speech>

I note in the accounts in note C that legal fees amount to &euro;44 million, I think.  Could we check that figure?</p></speech>

Then, when various requests were made under freedom of information, it went to considerable lengths not to give the information.  In fact, there were cases where the individual seeking information had to remind officials of the timeframes involved.  It was only under continued inquiries, almost constituting harassment, that the HSE decided to give the person some of the information, even though the person involved was part of the committee for the individual who was intellectually challenged and allegedly suffered sexual abuse.</p></speech>

There is a cost factor involved in respect of legal representation which continues to mount.  Mr. O'Brien specifically raised this issue in his opening remarks and went into some detail about it and yet, because we are the Committee of Public Accounts, he did not see fit to bring that figure here although he might be asked about it.  That is what we are doing here.  This is totally secondary to how these 30 to 40 individuals were treated, but it is the work of this committee and it is important that we know the answer to that.

I have it all here.  I have the names and how they were selected.  I support Deputy Deasy in his remarks that this is an effort by the HSE to cover up what went on.  Referring it to the Garda is just a method of prolonging it.  In the correspondence I have here, the HSE refers to "the final report".  The HSE has never published that final report.  It has never even gone to the whistleblowers and discussed the final report.  As I understand it, one of those whistleblowers had to raise the issue publicly at a meeting on &Aacute;ras Attracta and ask what stage it was at.  That does not show an organisation which is concerned about this and which will deal with it.  Meanwhile, as we discuss facts and figures, there are 30 or 40 individuals who may very well need assistance and support because of what happened.  Finally, in terms of-----</p></speech>

I must ask about the professionalism of the HSE's approach to this, about the fact that it has gone on since 1992, the legal costs, the costs of stonewalling the whistleblowers, and the cost of stonewalling the release of information through the freedom of information system.  These are all costs that I would like to see being put before this committee.  The answer the witnesses have given Deputy Deasy regarding the procurement process is nothing short of a disgrace.  I know it did not happen on Mr. O'Brien's watch and that it dates back to the 1990s, but it appears to me that there was no standard in place and that as soon as the HSE found the problem, there was a rush to ensure that no one else found the problem.  The individuals who blew the whistle were the ones who came forward and persisted with this.  It is all down to costs.  Where are the figures that will identify for us the cost of this investigation from start to finish?  The answers have not been given here this morning.  I am interested in the overall case, but we must be interested in the costs.  Can we go back to the figures?</p></speech>

The Chairman has mentioned the 30 or 40 potential victims in this case.  Many of those alleged victims are non-verbal.  In some cases, it is 22 or 23 years since these alleged crimes took place.  In many cases, the witnesses or perpetrators have passed on.  The urgency required by the HSE to deal with the matter as time moved on was absent.  There was no desire to deal with this and no attempt was made to do so, because as time moved on and decades passed, reports were issued, it was prevaricated upon and the long finger came out at every juncture.  The Statute of Limitations does come into this.</p> <p>  In my opinion, part of the reason this has been put on the long finger is that there is an attitude that time will deal with this and that prosecutorially it may not be possible to bring some of these people to justice.  That is appalling.  The HSE was aware of the gravity of these alleged crimes, going back to the 1990s.  It was reminded of them in 1999 and surely at that point, when those protected disclosures had been made, there would have been a requirement within the organisation to deal with it and, as Mr. O'Brien said, some urgency.  This urgency was not there.  There are legal issues around the duration between when a crime is allegedly committed and when it is brought to a court.  In this case, it could be 23 years.  There was no urgency whatsoever here.</p></speech>

We do not have that level of detail with us today, but we can extract it from our systems and will do so.  Regarding the impression that may have been gained that somehow the involvement of the Garda is a recent thing, or is designed in some way to shield us from providing the committee with this information, I just want to be clear that following the protected disclosures and the establishment of the inquiry there has been ongoing involvement and liaison with an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There is no basis for any suspicion or concern that this involvement is recent or related to these proceedings.  We do have written correspondence from the Garda asking us not to put that report into the public domain at this time.  The committee will understand that we feel obliged to co-operate in that respect.  There is no suggestion that we have sought to involve the Garda in regard to this meeting.  There has been an involvement with it over an extended period.</p></speech>

On 18 February 2015 I went to Pearse Street Garda station and made that disclosure.  I have not heard a single word from the Garda since then, even though I was given a story involving these young adults who could not verbalise, as Deputy Deasy said.</p></speech>

So many matters regarding the funding and everything else have been raised here this morning that I want to ask for a complete report on costings dating back to the beginning, with an indication as to who approved the various reports, who authorised them, how they came about and so on, so that we can clearly understand how we arrived at the cost.</p> <p>  The use of former employees of the health service in this instance and in other instances is not best practice and it should not continue.  If there had been an independent inquiry into this the matter would probably have been resolved a long time ago.  It would not have been going on since 1992, with the lives of people who need further counselling and assistance being put in jeopardy.  I agree with Deputy Deasy that we need to move the matter on significantly for those concerned.</p> <p>  I ask the committee to agree that we request a commission of inquiry of some kind, possibly instigated by the Minister, but it must be taken out of the hands of the HSE because as far as I can see it will never be resolved if it is left there.  That is a recommendation we can make at the end of the meeting.</p></speech>

It was investigated.  This is the second time around with this.  Time badly limits the effect of a criminal prosecution.  For the sake of justice and getting answers for the families involved, I am beginning to think that because of the effect time will ultimately have on these criminal investigations and potential prosecutions, the only recourse that these families will ultimately have is an independent investigation from which the HSE is completely removed.  At this point, it deserves the HSE's removal from the issue completely.  That is the only way these individuals and their families will have any recourse to justice and fair play.</p></speech>

Any civil servant or any person who leaves the State services is not prevented from partaking in any other aspect of life afterwards.  That is an important point given the number of people involved.  I do not know the background to this story but I have listened very actively today.  If we were to take this rule as a rule of the public service, it would mean that anybody who worked for the State would be excluded from doing any consultancy work in any other Department.</p></speech>

We are talking about the disability sector.  There is a massive requirement for on-the-spot audits, which are essential for homes that cater for the disabled sector and nursing homes.  Given all the regulations that came in, which are very much necessary, is the HSE budget adequate to cover that?  I know there was a recent query regarding the HSE and HIQA and the requirements.  I ask Mr. O'Brien to go through that with me.</p></speech>

First of all, I should say on the record that those standards are appropriate and in the round are to be welcomed.  However, one of the challenges the HSE faces is that the cost of compliance is quite considerable.</p></speech>

That opportunity is not currently available as regards the disability sector and, consequently, the cost-increasing recommendations from inspections are not capable of being met within our current budget.  Having regard to our obligations relating to how we use the budget provided to us within a service plan that is approved under specific headings, when costs arise from a separate set of regulations from another agency whose parent is the same Department as ours but where their requirements and our budget do not match completely, it is a significant in-year challenge for us and it is something we are discussing at the moment.</p></speech>

Some of that requires additional resources, such as for our new quality improvement teams at a cost of &euro;750,000 this year.  The teams have already visited 50 of the centres and we want to support those centres as they aim to meet HIQA standards.  The service improvement team approach is in line with the service arrangements and we are trying to link funding to quality and put the focus on outcomes.</p> <p>  In the disability sector, the congregated settings report of 2009 identified the fact that, in the transition to the new person-centred model, significant capital investment was required in moving from old, long-stay institutions and nightingale wards to person-centred independent living.  We are trying to develop mechanisms to support that and discussions are ongoing involving the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Department of Health and the HSE to see how the housing component can be supported by local government.  We are looking at developing a reform fund for the transition.  </p> <p>  The costs in 2014 for the implementation of standards and the new approaches for the disability resource were between &euro;12 million and &euro;15 million.  That had to be managed by ourselves, the community health care organisations and the individual voluntary sector agencies.  There is a  significant capital requirement but training and staffing also need to be addressed and we are working with organisations to do that within the existing resource, which brings challenges.  A further dimension is the fact that in trying to transform a sector, taking on new capacity, new referrals and new places becomes more challenging for the existing voluntary sector organisations, meaning we face a bill for private placements.  These places are not there now to the same extent as in the past because organisations coming to grips with the implementation of the new standards are not able to take on new referrals to the same extent.</p> <p>  As the director general said, the service user is at the forefront of our minds at all times and safeguarding vulnerable people through our safeguarding teams is fundamental to that, which means cost issues arise.</p></speech>

The key, as we try to bring about the fundamental change that is required, is to do it in an organised and systematic way over time and in a way which assures the standards but also can be delivered within the resources provided.</p></speech>

These agreements, which the Department of Health manages, mean we do not have to chase individual states with bills for a large chunk of people.  For the rest, however, we do need to improve our processes to bring the collection period up to date.  We have done significant work on this but we have not finished.</p></speech>

The Secretary General of the Department is Mr. Jim Breslin.</p> <p>  The fair deal scheme was a significant concern in the early part of this year for one simple reason - the level of demand exceeded the level of supply of cash.  Consequently, a waiting list developed, generally made up of people in hospital waiting to get out or people in the community seeking fair deal and ending up in hospital as their ability to be cared for at home diminished.  The Government recently agreed traditional expenditure of the order of &euro;44 million as part of an overall &euro;74 million package to bring waiting times on fair deal down to four weeks, post-financial approval, which is back to where it was when the scheme originally began.  That will help to bring equilibrium back into our system.  It is taking us approximately 18 weeks to see the excess demand that had built up move from waiting time to actual beds.</p><p>That enables us to release transitional care bed stock, which usually turns over multiple times, from temporary long-term usage to enable the acute hospital system to work more effectively.  With this recent allocation, our concerns about the fair deal scheme in terms of its current operation have been addressed.  That is particularly important to those waiting for fair deal placements, many of whom felt they were under pressure to privately fund their nursing home care.  That was a significant challenge and it led to a degree of inequality for society generally.  Longer-term issues arise for the fair deal scheme.  Thankfully, the population aged over 65 years is growing by 22,000 per year.  This  country is now successfully ageing to a greater extent than heretofore.  That in turn will present a challenge for the Exchequer in terms of what it does with the fair deal scheme in the future but for now, the scheme will be stabilised by this change in the financial regime, which is welcome.</p></speech>

When the fair deal scheme was introduced nursing home developments were what could be described as very bankable because commercial funding was readily available.  The development of capacity slowed down in the intervening period because of increasing waiting times stabilising the supply of customers to nursing homes and due to the loss of bankability.  Particularly in the north east, where there has been a significant mismatch between demand and supply, I am hopeful that the recent commitment on ensuring people do not wait longer than four weeks, which has increased the overall number of beds, will encourage those who wish to get into the business of developing private nursing homes and persuade potential bankers to look upon those schemes more favourably.  We need that stock to be developed.</p></speech>

The rate paid per bed is determined by a process managed by the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, which is a separate statutory agency under the aegis of the Department of Health.  The NTPF takes account of a range of factors in determining the price.  We recognise, however, that increasing numbers of people will be able to avail of the nursing home scheme and for this reason the level of demand for beds is only going to increase.  That in itself will make projects bankable.  The reason we cannot give a specific commitment on any nursing home is because the resident makes the fundamental choice as to the nursing home in which he or she wishes to stay.

I welcome the witnesses to the Committee of Public Accounts.  I have a number of questions.  One of the issues I am concerned about is the cost of drugs.  We seem to be the most expensive country in the world in terms of drugs purchase.  The drugs bill for the Health Service Executive, HSE, is approximately &euro;2 billion.  Have we any clear indication as to the reason we have not been able to manage better with generic drugs or be in a better position to put together some block purchasing?  The drugs bill is astronomical, and that is extended to the consumer in terms of the cost of drugs and to the Exchequer, etc., in every format.  Could we get some answers on that issue?</p></speech>

The overall drugs spend is in the region of &euro;1.8 billion.  In the past couple of years significant inroads have been made to the individual cost of medications.  This has arisen from two sources, one of which is what is known as the IPHA agreement.  This is the agreement between the Department of Health, the HSE and the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association which has reduced the cost of patented medications on an agreed basis.</p><p>Separate to this, in 2013 reference pricing legislation came into effect, which is of relevance where there are interchangeable medications.  In other words, molecular equivalents.  As a result of this, and the powers given to the HSE at that time, we have been, on a continuous basis and starting with the highest volume and, therefore, the highest cost medications, referencing down in accordance with the legislation against the European average.  We are in the process of completing a second round in regard to some of the higher value medications which are enabling the overall cost of medications, both for the State and individuals, to be reduced.  We are required to proceed with a degree of caution.  We must take into account the impact on supply and also the risk of co-payments.  This has not been a significant issue so far and the reference pricing approach has proceeded very effectively.  At the end of this year we will be in a position to provide a retrospective report. </p></speech>

There is such a facility in Italy, which is the only one in Europe.  Shannon has the capacity for all sorts of transport required to deal with tsunamis, earthquakes and other unexpected events throughout the world.  One of the reasons cited for our not being able to have a base in Ireland was the cost of drugs, given the many drugs associated with all of these major events.  There was a substantial survey done on this in 2012.  The problem was that it was not possible to get the quantity of generic drugs required at the right price.  It was possible to get them anywhere else in the world but not in Ireland.  Has the HSE tackled this problem?</p></speech>

We are in the process of tackling it in line with the intent of the legislation.  We are sequentially, by volume and cost - which is where we would expect to start - referencing down against the European average basket as provided for in the legislation.  We are not yet at the levels achieved in the UK, where this has been done for a considerable period now.  By revisiting the reference pricing we are moving further in that direction.  We are obliged under the legislation to take into account the impact of what we do on continuity of supply.  Consequently, we are proceeding with a degree of caution.  The targets that have been set, in terms of the reductions to be achieved, are being met.  It is a longer journey than we have currently travelled.</p></speech>

We have a national distribution centre in Tullamore.  Within that we have a licence for distribution.  We looked at this issue in the context of what the costs would be as distinct from what the distributors charge us but they were not comparable in terms of effort and the amount of money required.  Even ensuring we were getting the right drugs, in terms of ingredients, and not spurious drugs was a risk.  It has been discussed.

The Health Products Regulatory Authority, which is an Irish entity, is the licensing body for any pharmaceutical that can be supplied or sold in the Republic of Ireland.</p><p>Their requirements are specific, which is why the packaging of products sold here meet these standards, as do information leaflets.  The indications approved are sometimes different in different member states and it is the HPRA which determines whether products are interchangeable for the purposes of reference pricing.  The net effect of what we have done in terms of the IPHA agreement which, as Mr. Mulvany said, is performing against its objectives and reference pricing is to implement the policy parameters determined by the Government and legislation.

I do not think I referenced bulk buying and I am not sure where that came from.  When I referred to volume, I simply said - I may need to clarify - that when we were beginning the process of reference pricing, we started with the most prescribed and highest cost items in order that as we gained the benefit of reference pricing, it was related to those which had the greatest financial benefit.  However, we do not bulk buy as such.  We have national agreements on pricing and the way medicines are prescribed is obviously not in a bulk buying context but in the context of individual patients and prescribers.</p></speech>

The costs about which we are talking largely are those which are reimbursed by the primary care reimbursement service.  It is people going into individual pharmacies.  The pharmacies require the drugs and what we have, in effect, is a bulk agreement on price with the IPHA which, as the director general mentioned, has delivered &euro;400 million in savings since October 2012.  This has allowed us to invest &euro;210 million in new drugs which we would not otherwise have been able to afford.  That is the bulk element.  That is us dealing with the entire market in terms of the reimbursement of drugs where individuals go into pharmacies.  Obviously, we do not buy the drugs directly but reimburse patients through the primary care reimbursement service.</p></speech>

Clearly, there was an issue around the 40/02 report.  The audit report stated the 40/02 report had been late and incomplete in that these instances were not reflected in it.  We redoubled our efforts and have introduced a training programme that we are rolling out across all appropriate staff.  We say "appropriate staff" as we used to do so by grade.  We have stopped doing this as staff in many of the grades referenced in the 40/02 report were not actually in charge of expenditure but staff in grades below them.  The training is across procurement directives and national financial regulations which incorporate the 40/02 report requirements.  In doing this we have trained more than 107 senior managers.  We have it on the web as a reference point for them and are continuing to roll it out in quarter 2.  By the end of June, we will have completed the training programme across the HSE.  It is inclusive of the voluntary hospitals and section 39 bodies which are now part of One Voice for Health which we have also introduced as part of the Government's decision in April 2013 that the public sector will talk with one voice.  Specifically in health, One Voice was required to incorporate the voluntary sector and section 39 bodies.  It included the TUPE of a private company in the voluntary sector which moved over on 1 January this year.  We acknowledge that there was a shortfall which we put down to a lack of communication and awareness of the frameworks in place.  Since the report was produced, we have introduced-----</p></speech>

If I can take a step back, I will explain how the central procurement process came into being.  In 2010 we had an agreement with the unions to introduce central purchasing across the HSE.  It came to life in 2011 and, as the Deputy will appreciate, required the establishment of offices of central procurement and logistics to bring it into being.  It took time to bring it into play.  At the time we also had austerity hit us quite hard.  In fact, we were sent the savings figures and asked to take money out of the system.  When one goes that way and chases savings, one moves away from putting more of an effort into compliance and building one's number of contracts to cover all expenditure.  One looks at areas where one can negotiate through agreements already in place to take money out of the system.  We were very successful in taking out &euro;250 million since 2010.  That is a significant amount of money.  It works out at an average figure of &euro;50 million a year, which sum is not collective.  When I refer to a figure of &euro;50 million, I am referring to &euro;50 million in cash.</p></speech>

It is important to recognise that we have taken action on the report.  There are four elements to what we have done.  We have put in place a procurement management system to identify the pipeline of contracts on which we are working.  It also gives us information on what is in place and its achievement by way of savings and statutory reports which we are required to give to the Office of Government Procurement, our partner in this process.  Our procurement assistant system identifies contracts which are visible on a web portal which has been live since March this year.</p><p>We have 124 users and over 100 contracts on it.</p><p> We have also put in place a national distribution centre which I mentioned briefly.  That is being rolled out.  It is reducing our stockholding arrangements within the hospital areas.  We are operating using a hub and base process in which we have hubs in Letterkenny, Sligo, Galway, Limerick, Tralee, Cork, Wexford, Dublin and County Louth, from which we will distribute all of our products.  It will have the effect of consolidating all of our stock purchases, which will greatly assist in dealing with the compliance issue raised in the audit.  We have statistics to support this.  We reduce the inventory first time out, increase productivity, put our staff at point of use and reduce the clinical time nursing staff spend on stock management.  It is measured in the format of four to six hours per week, which is per ward.</p><p> On top of this, we have also changed the culture of spend.  We will easily meet the industry standard of 7%.  On an amount of stock of &euro;400 million, one can work out the figure of 7%, which is annualised.  We will save approximately &euro;30 million per annum in those areas.</p><p> With regard to compliance, we are working with the Office of Government Procurement and have segregated all of the work that will come to us, as we move into the new structures for hospitals, with the seven groups, and the CHO areas, of which there are nine.  We are actively engaged in all of these areas to build a three year rolling plan.  We are workng actively with the hospitals and the community health organisations to establish what is required across the entire HSE.  This includes, for the first time ever, the voluntary sector.  I consider this to be good progress.</p></speech>

This is what is reflected in the audit report and the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We will not know whether the package Mr. Swords has outlined is effective until the next report is presented.  Can he give us an assurance that this is working on the ground?</p></speech>

In the past two years, as we grew into a centralised procurement function, our requests for procurement support have increased threefold.  That is a fair indication that awareness of the obligations of our budget holders is taking hold.</p> <p>  The second aspect is the 40/02 report.  This year has seen a large increase.  The Deputy might say it is bad, but I believe it is a good indication that there is awareness on the ground that people should state with what they have not been compliant.  One might say it is bad, but it can be turned into a positive in the sense that it allows me to implement it in the procurement plan as we move forward.  With the assistance of and collaboration with the Office of Government Procurement we will have more coverage than ever, which will make a significant difference.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-23a.666" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Mulvany" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015042300002#Z02000"><p>Absolutely, that is the objective.  We have a strong procurement function, although obviously responsibility for some of it was transferred to colleagues in the Office of Government Procurement.  Within the limits of their overall capacity - we probably do not have enough - they engage in good procurement and produce good contracts.  The issue concerns compliance with these contracts, an issue which Mr. Swords has covered to some extent.  We have a distributed buying system.  We have thousands of people who are buying product all the time; we do not have a single national system, either to facilitate this or to be able to readily track it.  Some of what the director general outlined in his opening statement, in the brief we submitted and what Mr. Swords has covered is trying to deal with the awareness, communication and training aspects, but we can reassure the Deputy that procurement has a significantly higher profile as a control and reputational issue within the organisation in the past few years.  We are clear that the public equates procurement with potential waste with the overall health service.  It is a significant priority.  We are not where we need to be yet, but the position is improving and must improve further in the next few years.</p></speech>

For example, of a sample of 100 cases with a value of &euro;2.2 million, which represents just a proportion of the spend, 36% were not subject to procurement processes.  A timeframe of how many years has been set?</p></speech>

The OGP has been resourced to take care of all the common areas across the public sector.  It is a changing environment, for procurement but also for the health service, and there are moving parts here at all times.</p><p> How does one tap the situation into getting the best possible outcome?  I think it is done by system.  What we recognised is that we have done our training.  We started our training programme - we are going to be finished by the end of June - to do that.  That is awareness.  The second part then is about visibility of the contracts, which, I think, was part of the overall failure on our part that led to the 36% figure referred to.  On greater awareness, it should be that the first port of call is to go to the system and check is their a contract in place and then take a reference to one's procurement organisation.  What we have right now is a combination of that.</p><p> We have 124 staff of whom we know are involved in the procurement function and who are now registered on this system.  From there, we will now introduce that to the new system of the hospital groups plus the CHO areas.  That, on top of the assistance we will get from the OGP, is the basis of how we are going to tackle this.  I would think a rolling programme of three years will see change.  It will take that time before we could say we will have full coverage on all of our contracts.</p></speech>

I just do not want to give her a commitment here today about something that group has not yet discussed or give her a particular target that we have not yet agreed or put in place.  In terms of the principle and whether we want to be far more compliant around procurement, we absolutely do.  We see the value of it, both in terms of reducing actual wastage and the perception around any health funding being used in a wasteful way because all of that damages our capacity.</p></speech>

Here I am referring to the HSE, if I could use the term, swinging into compliance with the procurement rules, regulations, standards and norms.  That is what I am talking to Mr. Mulvany about.  The <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>for this approach is to minimise waste - we take that as read.  The issue of reputational damage or the issue of concern when audited is when one comes across a phenomenon that seems to be persistent within the HSE, as the officials themselves have acknowledged, of non-compliance with the rules.  I would have thought that Mr. O'Brien would have a much firmer message to give to the Committee of Public Accounts in terms of his determination and the timeline to reach full compliance.</p></speech>

I should say I have made reference to this oversight group.  This oversight group is looking at compliance with all the national financial regulations and the reason Mr. Mulvany will not have had this on the agenda of his first meeting is because he would be aware of the significant work that the procurement function is doing to address the specific recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General which, in my view, has had a very substantive response.  What we now need to do is ensure that all of the buyers who were not abiding by the rules have not more excuses left, such as, "I did not know about the frameworks", or "I do not have access".</p> <p>  There is an established pathway to follow in the literature as to how one achieves procurement compliance.  Those steps are being followed and the function of the assurance or oversight group is to provide assurance across the whole piece.  The fact that committee did not discuss procurement on that occasion was simply a feature of the fact that there is such a strong focus on procurement at present already whereas we do, unfortunately, have some other challenges as well.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Brien might let us know, perhaps by way of note to the committee.  I do not know whether the following would be in order and the Chairman might guide me on this.  As Mr. Mulvany's group takes shape and its members get their feet under the desk, is there a way in which he can keep this committee informed as to its work programme, agenda and progress being made on the various issues, including procurement.

That is useful.  I raise this issue and zeroed in on the procurement one from a public interest point of view.

A lot of documentation and information is trawled over, analysed and produced.</p><p>I am not gainsaying that.

When he went on to speak about the procurement practice in establishing inquiries, he quoted the relevant EC regulation and the exceptional circumstances by way of explanation of how he engaged the services of Conal Devine and Resilience Ireland.  He stated:</p><blockquote>It is important to point out that the expertise required to undertake this broad-ranging and sensitive work included expertise in conducting serious incidents, reviews and investigations, knowledge of the social care services, child protection knowledge and expertise, as well as knowledge and experience of safeguarding practice.  This type of expertise is not readily available in Ireland.</blockquote> <p>I am sure he has had a long conversation about this.</p></speech>

While overall pay decreased, agency costs increased, and they increased again in 2014.  They have stabilised somewhat but have not yet started to decrease significantly.</p></speech>

Given that the moratorium on recruitment largely did not apply to medical posts, the issue is not typically approval but availability, the capacity to find suitable people, particularly for smaller, more rural places and those with more challenging rosters.  It is about being able to attract and retain staff, and the fact that in some hospitals we are under significant pressure consistently to field a team of directly employed medics, which is our preference.  While it is not all down to salary, we hope the recent changes in consultant salaries should assist us in recruiting consultants, and there will be an obvious knock-on to NCHDs.  This is our single most challenging area, and it is not related to funding availability, approval or the moratorium, but to the market and our ability to attract and retain medical staff.  We are competing in an international market.</p> <p>  The other large areas are agency and support staff, which are subject to moratorium and approvals and the permission to recruit under the previous employment control framework.  When it hits grades at which we are providing essential, often 24-7 residential services, there is a growth in agency costs, albeit overall pay costs, including agency, have decreased during the period.  This includes nursing and support staff, such as porters, cleaners, domestics and health care assistants.</p></speech>

The premiums can vary very significantly and we are not in control of the market.  The variations from direct pay for other grades are smaller and more standard.  While there tends to be a normalised rate, the VAT cost creates a 23% gap between our costs, direct and agency.  It is expensive overall.  Approximately 5% of our total pay costs are agency and overtime whereas in hospitals approximately 10% of costs are agency and overtime.  Overtime is also an issue, particularly in services that are over reliant on it.</p></speech>

I do not have the figure across the whole of the health sector, across hospitals and so on.  We track that and there is a national incident management process which takes account of all reviews currently under way.  An important part of this which is relevant to Waterford is that one does not have to wait for the completion of a review.  Significant action was taken immediately to start to address issues that were evident and to take the corrective action that was needed.  That is a feature of the disability sector and applies across the system.  Reviews like this are regularly undertaken although I do not have the exact figure for the whole of the health sector.</p></speech>

That was a tax risk assessment review.  One of its recommendations led on to where we are.  I imagine when we engaged with Revenue, it asked that we start at 2011, which was the year before the review.  That has gone on up as far as 2013. The process is not complete.  We are now at the stage where Revenue is validating or auditing what we have given it.  We would expect it to be complete in the coming weeks or months but we do not have control over it.</p></speech>

However, the process that has been in existence for some time requires us to calculate and generate a huge amount of additional material, including around consultants' private fees and all those other costs, in order to submit that to the insurers, even though our only interest is the statutory charge.  That causes significant delays in us issuing the bill to the insurers and there are also delays on their side.  The reality is that the figure has got worse in terms of what is outstanding, just to get the bad news first.</p></speech>

If I could just put that in context, which is important, one of the measures we use is how much of that outstanding debt is on our side, either in our processing or in our consultants not signing the forms, and how much is with the insurers in their processing, their delay or, to be quite frank, their "pending" of our claims.  That is improving.  The percentage of what is with the insurers has now increased, it is about 61% of the total.</p> <p>  Where this is going to end up is that we are in the process of negotiating - although no negotiation can be predicted until it is finished - to improve that collection process by seeking agreement with the insurers.  We have three of them engaged in detailed negotiations and are nearly finished with two, I believe.  This would involve us receiving a form of advance payment.  It will improve the payment process so that we will be able to issue a bill shortly after discharge and will get paid upfront for a percentage of our cost while the rest will flow later.</p></speech>

What we are seeking now very clearly is an ongoing agreement which changes the payment term so that we get paid far quicker.</p><p>As soon as we can conclude that agreement, which we are targeting to conclude in the next couple of months, it should substantially reduce the level of debt between us and the insurers.  It will also bring about a better process.</p></speech>

The terms of reference for the inquiry were adjusted to encompass the totality of those protected disclosures to form part of the inquiry.</p> <p>  In answer to the question, there were two separate disclosures - one from two individuals in a voluntary organisation and one separately from one who worked with the health service.</p></speech>

The South Eastern Health Board, the HSE and voluntary organisations have not placed anybody with the family in question since 1993.  Resilience will look back at matters between 1983 and 1993 to identify all those individuals living and willing to participate in a study to establish what the details were.  The particular focus is to ensure they have appropriate services and anything else that could be learned.  That is a look-back and tracing exercise.</p></speech>

It would be of great value from the HSE's point of view if we were able to publish both reports because it would be a comprehensive articulation of the issues.  Unfortunately, however, we are precluded from doing that at present because of the Garda inquiry and the requirement for approval from the Office of Wards of Court to publish this documentation.

I see from the information we have been given that it is expected that delayed discharges will increase by 24% this year on the 2013 figures.  Can somebody explain the reason for that increase?  Are the new moves in regard to the fair deal scheme having a bearing on the numbers?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-23a.821" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015042300002#EE01700"><p>Once a period of eight weeks has elapsed from the announcement of new funding for the fair deal scheme, we believe the new moves will have a measurable impact on delayed discharges in acute hospitals.  It was precisely the tapering upwards of the waiting periods for the fair deal scheme that could be correlated against the increase in the number of delayed discharges and the number of people on trolleys.  An additional effect is that when there is no outlet to the fair deal scheme because of an absence of funding, the step-down or transitional care beds that many of the hospitals have access to are utilised by people who are waiting for the fair deal scheme.  They would normally be turned over multiple times in an eight-week period, enabling staged discharge from the acute hospitals.</p> <p>  In our assessment, the core issue is the fact that the waiting time for a bed under the fair deal scheme headed out beyond 16 weeks at the end of last year, and if that situation had continued it would have reached about 20 weeks by this time, so the additional funding for the fair deal scheme, which amounts to &euro;44 million, enables us to bring the waiting period down to four weeks and keep it at that point.  Due to the numbers waiting and the pace at which people can be discharged and admitted into nursing homes, we see it as an eight-week process before the full effect of the new funding is experienced.</p></speech>

By virtue of that, the overall number of days accounted for by delayed discharges in our system this year will be higher than in previous years.</p></speech>

Clearly it is better to have patients in the right place for the level of care they need.  The typical cost of care in a long-term nursing facility or for the person to stay in their home with home care supports is considerably less that the rolled up cost of a hospital bed.  When hospitals are overcrowded in emergency departments and it is necessary to use the full capacity protocol and place extra beds on wards in order to maintain safe care, extra staff must be brought in, and that increases costs in the hospital over and above that factor.</p> <p>  When we spoke earlier about the first two months in one particular hospital, I did at that point indicate that across the hospital system there were particular pressures at play in January and February which were pretty closely correlated with the pressures arising from overcrowding in emergency departments, which was a facet of the delayed discharge situation they experienced.</p> <p>  On the opposite side, it is also the case that patients are typically at their most expensive when they are being admitted for treatment as opposed to when they are in the bed awaiting discharge.  A hospital that is more efficient is, generally speaking, in some respects more costly because of the costs of procedures, implants, hip replacements and so on.  It is not all one-way traffic in cash terms, but overall it is a very bad situation when hospitals are clogged up to the extent that they were. </p></speech>

We are opening an additional 65 short-stay bed community hospital in Mount Carmel.  Some 24 dedicated beds were secured through the private sector for the Louth area to support Our Lady of Lourdes hospital.  That is a good indication that there were not sufficient short-stay or long-stay beds in the Louth area to support the hospital.  We are looking at creative ways of supporting hospitals.  More will be required and, as Mr. O'Brien, the director general, said earlier, there are a couple of aspects to the issue.  First, there is the direction of travel to the fair deal scheme, or the nursing home support scheme, which I hope will bring confidence to the private sector to engage in the development of further facilities.  People have planning permission for nursing homes in various locations but the projects have not been progressing to capital construction.  Equally, on the public side, there are locations around the country where additional capacity will need to be developed in both the private and public sectors, and obviously we will have to attend to that.</p></speech>

It is clearly stated Government policy that it is a necessity to have both public and private.  We require to maintain the current public facilities and ensure that they are meeting the standards that HIQA set down.  There is a discussion going on around that at present to ensure that happens.  Additional capacity will also be required as the population age.  The percentage of people in long-stay care will reduce but the volume or overall number will increase when one looks at the ageing population over time.  One will have to provide for that.  One will also have to provide for appropriate community supports such as home care packages, home helps and so on.</p></speech>

There was some discussion on it earlier so I shall try not go over that again.</p> <p>  There is still a considerable issue in terms of proper procurement processes and 36% was the figure that the Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned in his report.

The actions that we have taken, and the description of services and systems that we have put in place to assist in compliance, have been put in place.  In addition, we brought in One Voice for health in which negotiations took place with the voluntary organisations, both section 38 and section 39, since last year.  Since 1 January we have used TUPE to move section 38 organisations into health so we are now speaking as One Voice to the market.</p></speech>

With any of the contracts now that go in place, we put in a mechanism.  The legislation is there from the point of view of the Government but in regard to voluntary hospitals with their own entities there was a complication within that.  We took a model, a collaborative model, so we have agreement across health that we will work together.  For example, if there is an organisation, such as a large hospital like Beaumont or St. James's and they have a specialty, they will take the contract on behalf of health as distinct from the hospital and, <i>vice versa</i>, the HSE will take the contracts.  All of the contracts that we put in place from herein will represent health.</p></speech>

As I said earlier, we have brought about savings of &euro;250 million to date.  Our target this year is &euro;30 million of which we have achieved &euro;25 million, so we are on target this year.  I caution against savings because savings come in different ways and also because the medical devices, and the medical area that we have charge of now across the public sector, will be affected by sterling, the dollar and currencies.  We expect that will be a hard battle for us on which to hold the line.  We have managed to do it to date but I think the savings are going to get harder.</p> <p>  In any procurement organisation, and particularly the transition that we have taken since 2010, the approach would be that one would harmonise the pricing across the organisation, put frameworks in place which we have done to a large degree,  start working on one's contracts and from that one derives savings.  From there one has to start looking at how one does one's work and that is where we will be concentrate our efforts from herein.  We will look at the specifications that are there on current contracts and, thereafter, we might be made to make adjustments.  Companies may come to us with difficulties, which they have already started to do, and say to us that they are suffering a cost increase on their costs and want us to absorb those.  We are not funded for cost increases.  We are funded for a delivery of service.  Therefore, we have to look with them at bringing savings in different ways.  The only way one can do so is by maybe looking at specifications. </p></speech>

Can the director general clarify what will happen if it continues to obstruct the HSE in determining where we are in regard to this matter?  What remedies are available to the HSE to move the matter forward?</p></speech>

We have made inquiries and one post did.  It was a nurse tutor post.  It is not relevant to the issue of the private hospital but it is within the red circled group.</p></speech>

It relates to a small allowance on top of the appropriate salary in respect of tutoring activities.  We will get the information for the Deputy.</p> <p>  Ultimately, and this is where we do get into a difficult situation, the sanction would have to relate to our continued ability to fund the hospital at the present level, which would affect both revenue and capital.  Of particular concern is that this is one of the hospitals assigned to the Ireland East Hospitals Group which includes other hospitals like the Mater, from Wexford through to Navan.  Unless the governance on this campus is straightened out it is going to have an adverse impact on the ability of that group to be formed.</p> <p>  At the present time, I am holding on any approvals, or even considerations of approvals, for category "C" consultants.  It may be that we will not be able to approve other types of consultants as those come up.  We will have to consider all the issues of funding.  At the present time, whatever their overall financial position, I can say categorically that unless this is straightened out, whatever deficit they may have, they will not get one cent above the amount of money that is specified for that hospital this year.  Beyond that, I am not yet certain what I will do but it is a very serious situation.</p></speech>

This is a true voluntary hospital.  There are other voluntary hospitals, or what we call voluntary hospitals, such as Beaumont and James's, which are actually in the ownership of the State and whose boards are appointed by the Minister or on the Minister's nomination.  This is not that type of hospital.  This is in the ownership of a private entity.  It is one of the orders.  I cannot recall offhand which one it is so I won't attempt to guess in case I get it wrong.  We have no appointment authority in relation to the board of that group.</p> <p>  The governance structure of the group at present, which is also a cause of concern, and was something that the former chairman had agreed to address, was that there is a single board over three hospitals. </p></speech>

As Mr. Healy referenced, one of the other big issues that the HSE is examining at the moment is &Aacute;ras Attracta.  What is the framework for the investigation in &Aacute;ras Attracta?  Is it a HSE internal investigation?  Was it put out to tender?  Was it a point bid?  Who is carrying out the investigation?</p></speech>

The first is the formal investigation that is chaired by Mr. Christy Lynch who has a team with him.</p><p>Shortly after we initiated that investigation, the Garda, given that it is also carrying out investigations, asked us to pause our investigation for a period.  Having got clearance from the Garda, we subsequently restarted the investigation and it is progressing very well.  The expectation is that the work will be concluded by May and we will have a final report completed by July.  This work is progressing.  </p><p> The second process was an assurance process to look at, from a service and learning point of view, what happened.  Dr. Kevin McCoy was asked to lead that investigation.</p></speech>

For example, an important part of the assurance review is to have the voice of the service user and family central to it.  It was in that context that Deirdre Carroll was identified as someone who would participate.  As I stated, she is a former chief executive officer of Inclusion Ireland, which is a representative body.  Dr. Bob McCormack is the chief executive officer of Dara Residential Services.  He has experience but, more important, he is the chair of the quality and risk group of the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies and has considerable experience in the area of quality.</p></speech>

As I mentioned, there are two processes and this is an assurance process.  The first task is to look at what happened in &Aacute;ras Attracta to identify why all of the significant training and other work that had been done to improve matters in &Aacute;ras Attracta did not have the effect it should have had or that we expected.  It is also specifically tasked with coming up with a plan for &Aacute;ras Attracta, to look at each of the individual bungalows and come up with a plan.  Probably the most important part is to take that learning and see how we translate it in a systematic way across the country.  Dr. McCoy outlined to the national summit his plans in relation to that and we are using the national summit.  There is also a whole process by which academics and others can feed into this so that there will be a rich learning that can be translated across the country.</p></speech>

A natural progression involves what is under way at &Aacute;ras Attracta.

Either they are or they are not charging &euro;1,000 a day; either there is or there is not competitive tendering; people either have the proper skills set or they do not.  Not in any way being disparaging towards the people involved on committees, in fairness to them, the HSE needs to clear up the issue of how they were appointed and indicate the basis on which they were appointed, how much they cost and who pays.</p></speech>

One of the things I noted when Deputy McDonald was speaking to Mr. Swords about services and procurement was his comment that there were no contracts and that sometimes people at grade 4 and above would do that kind of thing.  What kind of services are we talking about?  I do not work in the HSE but I know that I could not walk into a place like that and order something without a proper contract - without doing it formally.  I just wonder what kind of services are we talking about that those at grade 4 and above can do.</p></speech>

For example, in 2010, we brought centralised procurement into the HSE.  Before that it was health boards.  So a whole culture is being changed.  It is a change management issue.  When one is bringing that in, one has to stage it in.  Then, when one looks at the issues around austerity, what we were asked to focus on was actually saving money so that we could retain services.  We had to go on that.  Since 2010, we have had a further change in that the Government has made the decision that procurement will change again and it will move up a notch to address the public service issue overall, and what we are doing now, along with our colleagues, is changing in that regard as well.  So there have been changes along the way, but there also has been progress.  To give the impression that nothing has been done would be wrong, but I do think it is correct to acknowledge that the audit was right, and from the audit we will take the positive view in how we address it.  What we have done to address it is to take contraction, and I think that is the point we should focus on.</p></speech>

As I have said, I do not know of any organisation of our size that is fully compliant, so there will always be a variance, but it is the extent of the variance that we are addressing.  In looking at compliance and non-compliance, should I say, one looks at different trends that are within industry and ourselves and they are no different, but we are addressing them, and that, I think, is the proper course of action to take.</p></speech>

Now, we want to be compliant.  We want to always be compliant, but although people are not new to the system, because moratoriums have actually put a stop to new people coming in, there has been a drift of people out of the system.  In my own division I have lost 100 people since 2010.  That is a considerable amount of expertise to lose.  So in addressing the areas of procurement, we would obviously like more numbers to get there faster.</p></speech>

I know it was touched on earlier.  Can I ask which hospital is owed the largest amount of money and what exactly the HSE is doing to recoup that money?  I ask because I know Mr. O'Brien said that there was &euro;150 million outstanding.  Again, if that was a business it would have closed by now.  I work with excellent people in the HSE - I have to give credit where credit is due - in the midlands and they do their damnedest to support me and to help me to provide services for people that I am looking after, but when I look in my constituency for a service for a person with, for example, intellectual disability and physical disability, nine times out of ten there are budget constraints.  There is always a point at which someone will say, "We would like to do that for you, Deputy McFadden, but we cannot because we do not have the budget."  Yet there is &euro;150 million floating out there that has not been collected.  I would like to know what urgency there is with regard to collecting that money, because if I went to an accident and emergency unit with my daughter I would get a bill for whatever it is - &euro;100 - and I would be chased by the hospital for that &euro;100.  Why is the HSE not chasing private health insurance people and getting that &euro;150 million, which could go towards helping with budgets for people with disabilities so that they can be kept in their own homes?  I know a person who cannot get funding to go into a residential unit that he wants to go into.  He is in a nursing home because there is no money for him, yet there is &euro;150 million floating out there that is not collected.</p></speech>

Again, I do not want to minimise it, but, as Mr. O'Brien said, that does not prevent the hospital from having a budget.  It is an issue of cash and cashflow, a very serious issue, and we do chase the insurers.  We are chasing the insurers.  As I said, we are looking to reach an agreement with them which should improve that position, but it does not have an impact on the actual budget available to provide direct hospital services in the year.</p></speech>

The budget, or pay, is categorised into a number of categories, namely, medical and dental; nursing; health and social care professionals; management and administration; general support staff; and other patient and client care.  In simplistic terms, the starting point would be to examine only management, administration and general support staff, and I will explain why that is not as precise as it might be.  The proportions of staff in those categories have been changing.  In 2007, the proportion of the workforce in all the front-line categories was 71.8% of all staff.  It now stands at 75.4% of all staff.  However, within the category of management, administration and general support staff are a wide range of staff who are in the front-line space, such as the clerks in hospitals who greet people at emergency departments or outpatient registration.  While they are classified as management and administration, the distinction is not easy to make.  Over the period, there has been a biasing of exits and recruitments in favour of the categories that are clearly 100% frontline.</p> <p>  Among the many staff in the management and administration category, a great proportion are also doing patient-facing work.  I regard those who take care of hygiene on a ward as front-line staff.  I regard those who perform civil marriages and those who answer the calls for medical cards and issue medical cards as front-line staff, although they are categorised as management and administration due to our narrow framework within which all pay must be classified.  It is not very straightforward for me to say exactly which staff members are wholly or partially frontline or administration.  The bias is moving in the right direction.</p></speech>

The total cost is &euro;38 million, which is broken down over three main companies as follows: Noonan Cleaning Services, &euro;16 million; ISS, &euro;12 million; and Derrycourt, &euro;8 million.

In the old days there was no MRSA, and there were matrons going around with white gloves checking whether everything was clean.  There was not as much MRSA and talk about hospital bugs as now.  I accept that things have changed.</p></speech>

For several years, we would never have been allowed to employ a cleaner.  As cleaners left, they were not in the categories that were exempt from the moratorium.  The overall ceiling for the health services was coming down continuously during those years, due to the circumstances in which the country existed.  In many instances, the only option was to procure from external providers because we would not have been in a position to employ.  At times, it can have advantages in terms of flexibility of provision.  I understand the Deputy's point.  My wife, who was a nurse, often says we should bring back the matron.</p></speech>

I was just curious about how cost-effective it was.  I refer to the community supports Mr. Healy mentioned when we talked about the fair deal.  At Christmas, a huge number of people were on trolleys in emergency departments.  When I went to visit one of them between Christmas and the new year, a huge percentage of the people on trolleys were very elderly people coming from nursing homes.  I was told the reason many of them were there was that they were dehydrated and needed a drip or had chest infections and needed intravenous antibiotics, which could not be done in a nursing home due to governance issues.  There was a question about employing community-based geriatricians.  Now that there is no moratorium and no reason we cannot employ medical staff, will it happen?  It could help alleviate the pressure on beds in emergency departments.  Elderly people in their 80s and 90s should not be taken out of their beds in nursing homes to go to an emergency department just to get a drip.  It should be done in a nursing home.  It might help alleviate the problems and it might not cost as much money.</p></speech>

One of the ways we are aiming to improve it is through community intervention teams whereby we will join up the work in the hospital, primary care team, something like a community nursing unit and social care.  The community intervention teams have nurses who will go out and do the type of work the Deputy mentioned.  Part of the initiative we implemented with Government support through funding was to increase the number of community intervention teams.</p></speech>

Together on the social care side we are working with Nursing Homes Ireland and our own community nursing units to develop the capacity and approach whereby people will have the confidence and capacity to hydrate and respond to a far greater extent to the needs of older people.  Another important part of it is end-of-life care.  We will support, in so far as possible, efforts to maintain people in their residences, whether in a community nursing unit or a nursing home, rather than transferring them to hospitals in an end-of-life situation.  More and more, with palliative care teams and community intervention teams, we are trying to support such an approach.</p></speech>

With regard to cost of claims to the HSE, without mentioning any names, can we get a list of them?  We mentioned the legal fees earlier and they ran at &euro;44 million this year and last year.  Can we go through the procurement process and how many firms were involved?  I refer in particular to the Waterford situation and the cost there.</p> <p>  A single financial management system was mentioned.  I pester the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform about this issue all the time.  It has been cropping up at these meetings since 2011, with no resolution in sight.  Perhaps we can get a note on an update.</p> <p>  In cases like the Canning case, where reports and legal fees were involved, is it in order to ask for costs in regard to these reports?  The document refers to various types of reports sought.  I am interested in knowing how much these reports cost.</p> <p>  I posed the question on St. Patrick's in Kilkenny, the respite house and the opening of clients' accounts.  I tabled a parliamentary question on this but the HSE must respond.  Perhaps the HSE will examine the issues here.</p> <p>  There was an overview of section 38 bodies.  Can we get an overview of the section 39 bodies?  We went through the history to it before.  There is a figure of &euro;8 million for retired staff coming back and perhaps we can get a breakdown of that and the skills it covers.</p> <p>  Generally, a lot was asked today and the HSE committed to providing the facts and figures.  Is it fair to ask for a timeline and is it possible to get it within a couple of weeks?  Does the HSE have this information to hand?  When the witnesses leave here, there is a whole lot of things to do but I am asking in the context of the information we have asked for.</p></speech>

The Government allocation in respect of the fair deal scheme, in particular, provides an opportunity for us to examine that in a different way.  If the fair deal scheme problem had continued, we would have been in significant difficulties.  The budget this year has two distinct components.  There are demand-led schemes, which have rule sets based on eligibility, meaning certain costs arise on the basis of people accessing their eligibility.  This is seen in one dimension as an acceptance and a monitoring process between ourselves and colleagues in the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Then there are the things we have more direct control over.</p> <p>  We have some challenges in the acute hospitals and some challenges in social care that arise from the regulatory issue Deputy John Perry raised.  The other divisions are performing in line with their budgets.  It is relatively early in the year for us to make end of year projections so we do not but we know the challenges and we are using our escalation or accountability framework.  It is a particular feature of this year's service plan and we are triggering the necessary responses to address the issues.  </p></speech>

It may be of assistance to the committee if I say at the outset that so far as the macro story is concerned, without agreeing with every  conclusion or every detail, in general I accept the broad thrust of the official reports prepared by Messrs Honohan, Regling and Watson and Nyberg, as well as the views ... most of the views anyway put forward by Dr. Donal Donovan and Professor Anton Murphy.</p> <p>  Irish banks, by and large, avoided the mistakes that wrought havoc in the balance sheets of American, continental European and British banks where credit derivatives and CDOs did the damage.  Unfortunately, Irish banks made mistakes of their own, principally by excessive lending for residential and commercial development and these mistakes became exposed at the same time as international money markets shut up shop in September 2008.</p> <p>  AIB lent too much to individual developers, put too much faith in cross-collateralisation, too much faith in the large net worth of individual developers.  We didn't do enough syndication or selling down of loans and, in addition, we relied excessively on risk models that proved inadequate to the cataclysmic events of '09 ... '08 and '09.</p> <p>  On 5 March last, the Minister for Finance and the current CEO of AIB, Mr. Duffy, made the very welcome announcement that AIB is on course to repay the total investment made by the State in the bank.</p> <p>  The great recession of 2008, the worst the world had seen for 80 years, didn't start in Ireland or in the Irish banks, but there's no doubt that there were decisions made in AIB which made things worse than they need have been for citizens, for employees and for shareholders.  I wish to express my sincere regret for my part in those events, and to renew the apology which I made at the AIB AGM in 2009.</p> <p>  In analysing what went wrong at AIB, I should point out that I resigned from the board in June 2009 and my perspective is, therefore, largely limited to information that became available before my departure - I haven't worked there for the last six years - and may to that extent, be incomplete. </p> <p>  A country's banking system has been described as the nervous system of the economy, and in that sense the largest indigenous bank was never going to separate itself from the dominant economic activity of the society in which it functioned.  In the years leading up to 2008, a principal engine of economic growth in Ireland was property and construction.  It created a lot of jobs in connected trades and professions, paid lots of taxes, was encouraged by the State and the banks were fully involved in it.  Quite apart from the tax incentives that I know the Committee has heard a lot about in relation to property, local-----</p></speech>

Local authorities collected over &euro;3 billion through development contributions imposed as part of planning permissions between '99 and 2008.</p><p>It's perfectly clear in retrospect that the appetite for risk was excessive and the lending strategy of AIB in respect of property was too expansive.  That's not actually how it appeared at the time.  In 2007, for instance, there was a strong national consensus widely confirmed by international commentators that Ireland was on a track of rapid sustainable expansion and development, and a good example is provided by the statements made at the launch of the national development plan in 2007.  Just one detail from it: it was planned to spend &euro;70 million a day every day for seven years on infrastructure with full employment, net inward migration, low debt-to-GDP ratio, budget surplus and buoyant tax revenue, and lots of civil servants were about to move out of Dublin.  Martin Wolf, who has been described as the most respected financial columnist, expressed the view in June 2007 that the possibility of huge calamities being generated by financial markets looked remote.  The IMF, in its financial stability report in 2006, expressed the view that risk dispersion as now organised in banks was less - made banking failures less likely.  And of course, the reverse turned out to be the case.</p><p>  In viewings with the benefit of hindsight, looking back now, it seems to me that a great deal of the issue in Ireland comes back to the question of whether at a certain stage a correction that was coming was going to arrive in the form of a so-called soft or hard landing.  I think that's central to the errors.  The OECD, the EU, the IMF, the ECB, the Central Bank, the Department of Finance, the ESRI, the great majority of published economists in Ireland and abroad, although not all, the risk section of AIB and the board of AIB all favoured the consensus of the soft landing and the consensus, of course, was entirely wrong.  </p><p>  There's a striking example or expression, I suppose, of this consensus comes from the OECD report published on Irish banks in April 2008.  And I think the date is important because most of the loans ... nearly all the loans would have been made by then.  And the OECD said, having looked at the Irish banks, the Irish banks were profitable and well-capitalised and provide a buffer against a future downturn.  It's easy and certainly tempting to dismiss everything that went on in 2007 as irrational exuberance, but I actually think that there were - although this is not a popular thing to say - some policies, some justifications for the policy at the time, some rational justifications, and I want to briefly mention three of them.  The first was the calculated demand for housing in Ireland, the second was the reassuring effect of Basel II, as it's called, and the third was reliance on risk modelling in banks.</p><p> There was hard statistical information which indicated that Ireland needed more housing.  One of the things AIB did was get independent economists to come and talk to the board every year or so, and a distinguished independent economist in the middle of 2007 brought a paper to the board, which pointed out that of a selected group of European countries, Poland was below us, but Ireland was next lowest on the list in terms of dwellings per 1,000 citizens.  Poland was 330 about, and we were about 370.  And then Estonia, Holland, UK, were all well above us, and Denmark, France, Germany, Portugal and Spain were all over 100 dwellings per 1,000 citizens ahead of us.  They were all over 470; we were at 370.</p><p> The second feature is Ireland has, as you're undoubtedly aware, a very unusual demographic history in the last century.  The peak birth rate in most western European countries was in the '60s; people stopped having large families.  The peak year in Ireland is 1980, so there were large groups of children born in the late 70s and early 80s and the 1980 crop will be 35 this year.  So there's the feeling that there was this group of citizens coming into the ... what I would call the house purchasing age, and we took that on board.  Those are the two things I want to say about housing demand, and I suppose the fact that there is now emerging something of a housing shortage in Dublin, certainly in some urban areas, suggests that this wasn't entirely irrational.</p><p> I don't want to say much about Basel II; it was promoted with banks by the Bank for International Settlements in Zurich, reinforced by the CRD, the Capital Requirements Directive.  Its purpose was to ensure that banks had adequate capital.  We bought into it heavily and expensively, &euro;200 million between engaging experts and consultants and installing the systems in AIB.</p><p>It went live at the start of 2008 and frankly it wasn't much good to us when the trouble came.  Part of Basel, a large part of Basel is to do with mathematical risk modelling, I remember we had to hire maths PhDs and so on to help us with this.  There was a fraud in the American operation of AIB in 2002, a man called Rusnak stole a lot of money, and immediately after that, every regulator from Washington to Warsaw crawled over AIB and, we got the services in conjunction with the Irish regulator, of a man called  Gene Ludwig, who had been a bank supervisor in the States and he investigated us up and down.  One of his recommendations was that we needed to set up a world-class risk management system and that we needed a world-class player to head it up and we duly engaged undoubtedly distinguished and experienced risk specialists from JP Morgan in New York at a very high salary.  I think ultimately 200 people came into the risk section.  At the same time, on foot of the same recommendations, we got a group internal auditor from outside Irish banking, the individual in question had been director of audit for risk and finance in Barclays Bank, then gone to work for the Italian regulator for a short while and then was engaged by AIB.  A third initiative at the time that I was involved in, was setting up a whistleblowing system.  There's a not-for-profit in the United Kingdom called Public Concern at Work, and it will act as a facilitator, and this was published to staff; they could ring up there and their messages would come only to my office and they could preserve their anonymity if they wanted to.</p><p> Stress testing was done, installed, and in April '07 we had a stress test that looked at what would happen if things went wrong.  There were two stresses: a plausible stress and an extreme shock test.  The extreme shock test wrote down, for instance, unzoned land by about 60%, wrote down residential by 30% and I have the various figures if you need them ... but it went for a one in 25 year downturn and of course that wasn't enough.  The stress test just didn't avail when we got a one in 100 year event.  We didn't pay sufficient attention to the fact that the stress machinery didn't cater for that event and there was what I'd call an intellectual failure, for which I have to take my part of the blame, to envisage that if there was a serious property downturn in Ireland, a really serious one, and if at the same time there was a worldwide contraction of demand so that Irish businesses started doing badly, you started having unemployment and redundancy ... and at the same time as those two things, that the wholesale money markets closed up that we'd have a very serious crisis on our hands.  When Lehman's failed on 15 September 2008, that in effect is what happened. </p><p> I want to say something briefly Chairman, if I can, about 2009 and what it was like.  Now it's painful, it's not long ago but it's possible, in the collapsing of the historical perspective, to forget just how bad things got say from the December of 2008.  In the autumn of 2008, the Department of Finance had estimated tax revenue for 2009 at &euro;43 billion and the outturn was &euro;33 billion.  They'd also estimated the contraction in GDP in Ireland at 1%, a 1% drop in GDP, and the outturn was 11.3% for 2009, ten times worse than the prediction.  In December 2008, a range of international banks were, this was unheard of before, downgraded.  That included Deutsche Bank, Barclays, Credit Suisse, Citigroup, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley.  Anglo was nationalised in January 2009 and just as an indicator of how the general population felt, how public confidence had just gone at that stage, new car registrations in January '09 were 65% down on the previous year.  Irish banks were downgraded in February by Fitch and then in the spring, AIB and Bank of Ireland had to get help from the Government on capitalisation. </p><p> Now you can ask the question why did everyone get it so wrong?  I think it's very hard to get it right, that economic forecasting is less reliable and more complicated than people think.  Credit has to be given to Professor Morgan Kelly, he detected the bubble but even he said he thought the downswing in prices in real terms would take eight or nine years.  He also expressed the view that the Irish banks were well capitalised.</p><p> I'd like to say something briefly about the accounting standards that applied at the time.  After the dotcom bubble, where accounting standards had given rise to alleged opacity in the accounts of public companies, IAS 39 was introduced.</p><p>It prevented banks, in very simple terms, doing what was called cross-cyclical provisioning: putting something away in the good years to save you the trouble in the bad years.  It also had another effect.  It insisted that certain parts of a bank book had to be marked to market, and I don't think the people who designed it ever envisioned there'd be a day when there wouldn't be a market.  So you were now marking to market when there was no market and getting extraordinarily low values for assets.  And there's ... the best description of this - which I think is a key dynamic of the crisis - the best description of this that I've found is in the so-called EU high level group chaired by Jacques de Larosi&egrave;re ... Mr. Nyberg was a member, Sir Callum McCarthy and the great and good of European financial regulation.  It's a bit turgid but starting at paragraph 33, if I can read you into the record what they said.  It is about five or six sentences, Chairman, if you'll indulge me:</p><blockquote>	Financial institutions understandably tried to dispose of assets once they realised that they had overstretched their leverage, thus lowering market prices for these assets.  Regulatory requirements (accounting rules and capital requirements) helped trigger a negative feed-back loop amplified by major impacts in the credit markets ... Financial institutions, required to value their trading book according to mark-to-market principles, (which pushed up profits and reserves during the bull-run) were required to write down the assets in their balance sheet as markets deleveraged.  Already excessively leveraged, they were required to either sell further assets to maintain capital levels, or to reduce their loan volume.  &quot;Fire sales&quot; made by one financial institution in turn forced all ... financial institutions holding similar assets to mark the value of [those] assets down &quot;to market&quot; ... What was initially a liquidity problem rapidly, for a number of institutions, turned into a solvency problem. </blockquote><p>I would like, Chairman, to say something now about the milieu in which Irish banks functioned before the crisis.  Analysts and large shareholders, pension funds and stockbrokers were always interested in earnings per share and particularly where your earnings per share was going up as much as your peers.  If you were going up as much as your peers that was fine but if you weren't, then your share price would drop and that meant your capacity to raise money would drop, your capacity to expand would drop, vulnerability to takeover would increase.  Governor Honohan in his report in 2011 adverted to that dynamic.  The other issue was Anglo being held up to us as an exemplar and you'll all be aware of that.  Commentators in Ireland and abroad repeatedly said, &quot;Anglo is the best bank.  Why can't you be more like Anglo?&quot;  It was determined by one international consultancy to be the best bank of its size in the world.  It was the darling not just of the Irish but of European stock exchanges generally.  And I had customers saying, &quot;Why can't you be like Anglo?  Why are you always asking for more?  Yourself and Bank of Ireland give slow responses and you ask for paperwork&quot;, and things like that.  I think we tried in some way not to be drawn into the wake but inevitably we were, I think, in some respects.  Professor Honohan described the effect of this sort of competition in a memorable statement before he was the Governor.  He spoke to an economic conference in Dubrovnik in June 2009.  This is what he said, &quot;Competitive pressure on the leading banks to protect market share came especially from reckless expansion [from] one bank, Anglo-Irish whose market share among Irish controlled retail banks jumped from 3 per cent to 18 per cent in a decade&quot;.<br/><br/>Can I say something briefly then about the regulator?  We had a perfectly professional relationship, mostly between executives and the Central Bank and the regulator.  I would meet the head once or twice a year maybe.  We invited the CEO and chairman of the regulator to come to an AIB board meeting and they accepted that invitation.  I know there has been a lot of criticism of the regulator and that is not my business.  I am wary of sporting analogies in a serious matter such as this but I did look at ... one of the witnesses I did get a chance to look at was Professor Alan Ahearne and he was in this room on 4 March.  And he was asked by one of the members here what was needed at that time and he said what was needed was a more intrusive regulator - someone who behaved like a referee in a football match.  And it strikes me, having reflected on it since, that that's apposite, that it's instructive ... that if you've a referee in a football match which is highly competitive - and Irish banking was enormously competitive at the time - and the referee does not blow the whistle much, then the more aggressive team tends to prosper and other people can get injured.</p><p>Just to say one more thing about the bubble.  No bank could stop a bubble.  If, through some amazing piece of insight or wisdom which we certainly didn't have, AIB had decided on some day during this period to close up for loans and say, &quot;No more loans.  We're not lending anymore&quot;, it would have damaged the bank at the time but not as much as the crash did.  But, all of our customers who were claimants for loans would have been met within the following week by our competitors with glee, the competition was so fierce.  So, the point I make is that no bank could stop a bubble inflating; only authorities can do that.  <br/><br/>I will now turn to the night of the bank guarantee decision on 29 or 30 September 2008.  The committee are in possession of three separate near contemporary records which I made of the events of that night.  The main one is, of course, a seven page note, not perfect I'm afraid, but which I dictated a few days after the events of that night and which I've given to the committee.  There is also much shorter paragraphs in a memo that I sent to the CA two days later just as a couple of paragraphs that recites my recollection of what went on at the night and also a letter of complaint to another chairman of another bank which has a couple of paragraphs again about my recollection of the night.  <br/><br/>On Sunday, 28 September 2008 - this was a Sunday evening - AIB directors heard from the CEO at a board meeting at 6 o'clock that the word from the authorities was that two financial institutions in Ireland were likely to fail, the timescale was unknown and that a limited guarantee would be put in place for the remainder of the banks.  I furnished you in my supplemental statement a quote from the AIB minute: </p><blockquote>	The purpose of the meeting of the 29th September which the representatives of AIB and Bank of Ireland requested with the Government was to discuss the dramatically deteriorating international situation, the apparently dire staits in which Anglo found itself and the possible repercussions of Anglo's imminent collapse for Bank of Ireland and AIB.  We learned that Anglo could not open the next morning and had run out of liquidity.  The banks expressed the view that Anglo and Irish Nationwide needed to be decisively dealt with in some way by the State and then [and I emphasise the &quot;then&quot;] for a guarantee to be provided for the remaining banks to protect the surviving banks against the turmoil which would inevitably follow from an Irish bank being either liquidated or nationalised.   </blockquote><p>The Governor of the Central Bank stated during the meeting, in the presence of the Government representatives, that it would be disorderly, or ... and I remember this expression, &quot;or there could be a fumble if Anglo were dealt with mid-week&quot;, so what was needed, the Governor said, was for AIB and Bank of Ireland to try and provide &euro;5 billion each in liquidity to support Anglo until the coming weekend.  <br/><br/>Most of the evening was spent in efforts by Bank of Ireland and AIB to assemble enough liquidity to keep Anglo going until the weekend.  That effort was successful and, by morning, &euro;10 billion in liquidity, in excess of our own liquidity, half provided by Bank of Ireland and half by ourselves, had been assembled with its repayment within seven days guaranteed by the Government.  I want to emphasise that AIB's representatives were not involved in discussing or the making of the decision that was ultimately made.  The so-called &quot;blanket guarantee&quot; to include six banks, including Nationwide and Anglo, was not sought by or discussed with AIB.  I make no complaint about that.  I simply record the fact.  The representatives of AIB and Bank of Ireland were not present in the room where the decision makers were for most of the evening, perfectly proper as well.  I first learned that Anglo and Irish Nationwide had been guaranteed along with the other four banks from the media early the next morning.  I acknowledge that the Government was faced with very difficult decisions on 29 September, which had to be made very urgently and I am not privy to the information or advice which was available to the Government on that evening.  Two days after the guarantee, I sent a note to the CEO of AIB which included the following, and this perhaps is the most encapsulated confirmation of what I think went on: </p><blockquote>	Our name and reputation has been damaged by our perceived role in asking for the guarantee.  We have maintained silence on the fact that what we asked for was that Anglo and Nationwide, what brought us all down, be taken out of the market and then for a guarantee to be put in place.  What we did not ask for, and I underlined that in the original, was that Anglo and Nationwide should be boosted and baked into the system going forward.   </blockquote><p>The significance of the getting to the weekend, referred to by the Governor, is that at the weekend, the worldwide stock markets are closed for about two days, I think 51 hours, whereas during the week, worldwide stock markets are only closed at night for about three hours, between Japan ... between US closing and Japan opening.  Just ... finally, Chairman, to say about other options, very briefly, during that week other options, Fortis was rescued by the governments of Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands using ELA and I think that option was discussed briefly by Senator MacSharry with Professor Lane at this inquiry on 21 January.</p><p>Later that week, or maybe at the start of the following week, the Bank of England made a secret loan of Stg&pound;63 billion to solve the allegedly critical liquidity issues at Halifax Bank of Scotland and RBS and that wasn't announced publicly until Mervyn King, the Governor of the Bank of England, said it to a Treasury select committee in November the following year.  Since then, like many other countries, Ireland has enacted special legislation to deal with bank resolution, the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010 and the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011, and they obviously provide much more options for the sort of events that  occurred on the that night.   Those are my opening remarks, Chairman.</p></speech>

We had an operation in the United States, in Poland and in the UK and then in Ireland it was divided into what is called capital markets and then Republic of Ireland, which is what people would know as the traditional bank that you've described.</p> <p>  Four of those divisions, by and large, came through reasonably intact through the crisis.  Republic of Ireland, unfortunately, became embroiled in property lending which in retrospect ran out of control, was too expansive, was not controlled by the risk models.  I suppose it's fair to say that we had, and this is not an excuse, but it is an explanation ... some of the things that I am saying today may sound like excuses, I'm not making any excuses.  I am trying to assist the committee by explaining how it seemed at the time.  We had installed this enormously expensive ... the best personnel system of controlling risk and I think that directors thought that - and it was advertised -  as a means of measuring, monitoring and managing risk and we just had excessive faith in it.  Allied to that, we went too far with individual developers.  The AIB philosophy at the time, and for years before, was "stick with your customer".  Try and make sure they don't go anywhere else, because we had, as you said, plenty of customers and you have to remember that big developers were often customers that we'd had for maybe 25 or 30 years; people who had often started modestly as perhaps small builders and had been successful, accumulating large personnel wealth, always repaying their loans, always coming back for more and always repaying them again.  And I'm afraid we took too much comfort in that history and we weren't...our credit processes were not strict and savage enough.  We looked at affordability and I think we have to take the blame for having processes that just did not match the cataclysm that came.  As I say, the competition was fierce.  I refer again to Professor Honohan's analysis of the competition but that's another explanation, not an excuse.</p></speech>

Can I answer that because, again, it's an important question?  I believe AIB was solvent then but you'll ask the question, "When did AIB become insolvent?" and I don't know the answer to that.  Again, we tend to collapse ... or I can make the mistake of collapsing this fairly short period.  The fall in house prices has been 40% to 50% higher in some places.  At 30 September 2008, the night of the guarantee, the fall in house prices was 7.7% nationally, 8% if you included apartments.  The real trouble was 2009, and I don't know when in 2009-10 AIB became insolvent, because you could mark-to-market six days in a row and get different answers and if you mark-to-market and your assets were down, then you needed more capital, then you had to sell more ... nobody will ever know, I think, because of the interaction of capital requirement rules, the Capital Requirements Directive, and the accountancy rules, when the moment came.</p></speech>

In ... by your report, or by your notes, you say "The final point I made related to the form of the guarantee; an nitial draft had been furnished" and then in brackets "I think by Bank of Ireland" and "was in a form which we thought was too bare; I mentioned that a guarantee had to be read correctly to technical eyes in Foreign Central Banks" and in closed brackets again "I mentioned Peru, Libia (sic), and Russia" and in closing brackets, "We ..." and in AIB's context you're saying "We furnished a more extensive formula", in brackets again, "which we brought with us".  So you're proposing, or you're explaining that you came to the meeting that night with a document yourself.  Closing brackets again, "as to the sort of instruments and deposits that should be covered" and then in brackets again, "This formula was eventually adopted later in the night pretty well word for word".</p> <p>  Now I'll come back to that in a moment, and maybe Deputy Doherty, who's coming in lead will take that.  I just want to establish for the moment ... because when the committee chased up this line of inquiry, a letter came in from AIB on 21 April 2015, addressed to me, on behalf of the committee, stating from ... responding to the direction that we issued for them to get this document, saying that "AIB does not have in its possession any documents containing the formula referred to in 1 above, or the draft guarantee referred to in 2 above".  They then ... AIB then go on to say, this is from Derek Hegarty, banking unit inquiry ... or banking inquiry unit ... he goes on to say "In response I confirm that, not withstanding the extensive document review exercise we conducted in response to the direction which resulted in over 47,000 pages of documentation being disclosed to the inquiry on behalf of AIB, we have not located any such documents and I can see no evidence that any such documents were generated using AIB's electronic system".

There was a small number of words on a slip of paper which, in my recollection, described the range that ... a guarantee that would look right from foreign central banks.  That's just this bit.  The bank guarantee is a 12-page legal document.  In the hour before we ... there was no question of drafting a guarantee, and my note is misleading to that extent.  It was this critical formula, and I know bonds were asked for.  And let me say just in relation to bonds because I know that's controversial, AIB had no bonds that matured in the two-year period ... it wasn't for ourselves.  We had no bonds - relevant bonds - that matured in the two-year time.  But that's all I can remember.  And when I say farther down the same page that you were quoting, about six lines from the end, we furnished our draft guarantee - again, it was this formula - to the Government at the very early session, I believe that slip of paper was handed over.</p></speech>

Can I take you to the question in relation to how the bank reconciled the level of lending on the property and construction sectors while being in breach of regulatory prudential lending limits for the sector?  This is from July 2006 onwards; the reference to this is in the minutes of the board meeting on 27 July, AIB B2, Vol. 1, page 6, where it's clear that you had breached prudential lending limits at that stage in relation to concentration of the property and construction sectors.</p></speech>

It was reported, as you say, at 27 July board and in the following terms: Mr X - I'm not going to use the words of the officials if that's okay - reported that in respect of broad property, building and construction sector AIB was in breach of the limit contained in the Central Bank's licensing and supervision requirements and standards.  And he said that we had ... the limit was 250% of our own funds and we had gone to 260%.  He indicated that the matter had been discussed with IFSRA, who did not regard it as a significant issue.  IFSRA were informed that the breach was likely to continue.  He suggested that other banks were also in breach.  He then advised that the concept of sectoral concentration was under discussion at the committee of European banking supervisors as well as between the Irish Bankers Federation and the Central Bank of Ireland.  The board requested this issue be pursued with IFSRA-----</p></speech>

Now, let me say this to you: we would have been very well off not to have exceeded that sectoral limit.  It's a great shame that we didn't.  But if I can describe to you what was going on at the time, it was Basel II, and we were written to by the regulator in February 2007, shortly after that, and I'm going to read the first sentence ... the first two sentences.  This is the regulator to our manager:</p> <blockquote> 	In the light of the requirements of the Capital Requirements Directive, and in particular Pillar 2 requirements on concentration risk, the Financial Regulator is currently reviewing its sectoral concentration framework.  As part of this review I am contacting credit institutions that have experienced difficulties with the current sector limit. </blockquote> <p>We replied; I won't read out the reply because it's long and you've asked me to be short, but the reply did say, &quot;We are now dealing with this under Basel.&quot;  That reply was from Mr. Bhattacharya, the chief group risk officer, on 2 May, and there's two other pieces of information that I need to give you.  In June of 2007 we put in our Basel II application to the regulator, a document that I'd say ran to 1,000 pages, with all sorts of mathematical formulae.  The board, in June 2007, had to approve a sort of summary of it, and that summary included - and you have these papers - that summary included a section on credit concentration risk.  The document is called the Basel Programme Governance Workstream.  It had to be signed off and approved by the board, and that described the risk model that we were using for concentration risk, Moody's KMV portfolio manager, the one used by the Basel committee itself.  And the conclusion, having applied that model to our concentration issue, was that based on the analysis conducted - I'm skipping a lot here - &quot;AIB does not require additional capital requirement for credit concentration risk&quot;.  We sent that application in and it was approved by the regulator.<br/><br/>Now, as I say, let me go back to basis.  We'd have been much better off at the old limit.</p></speech>

It goes on to say, "The quality of loans was suspect and could require write-downs ranging from a benign 13% estimated by the FR [Financial Regulator], to 30%/50% estimated by Bank of Ireland,  which had previously conducted a due diligence review on the institution."  End of quote.  Can I ask you, Mr. Gleeson, what was the request made of AIB by the Financial Regulator in relation to Nationwide in these minutes?</p></speech>

I think there was a request that we would put &euro;2 billion into it, I think.</p></speech>

Why did AIB believe that of the &euro;2 billion that is was asked to put into Nationwide three weeks before the guarantee, that &euro;1 billion of it would be lost?</p></speech>

We never got to look ... we were never asked to look inside Anglo.  I just didn't know what the ... when we were told, when we got to Government Buildings, that they had no liquidity for the next day.  The share price had dropped 50% that day, so the view was that there was very serious dire trouble, but I didn't get to see their books that night.</p></speech>

Mr. Gleeson, your colleague, Eugene Sheehy, in notes of events occurring on the 29 and 30 September 2008 ... and it is again in book of evidence AIB C3b, Vol. 2, page 38.  I will quote the section for your attention ... said that, in relation to the original Government draft announcement on 30 September ... and this is the quote:</p> <blockquote> 	There were also issues in the Government's draft which we were uneasy about relating to the attestations by the FR that the system was solvent and that all banks were solvent.  We felt there was clearly a risk in this statement if market participants purchased shares in companies once the guarantee was issued and it subsequently transpired that these companies were not as strong as contended. </blockquote> <p>Are you familiar with this discussion?</p></speech>

I mean, when we were -- when we arrived at Government Buildings, I've told you, we were ... Richard Burrows, the governor of the Bank of Ireland rang me, he said, "I think we should talk to the Government," because of Anglo's share price falling, international chaos, and so on.  We went there.  We were put in a waiting room.  We were asked to go in and the invitation to the group that I've delineated in my written statement was to say what we thought should be done and we presented this proposal for the four-bank guarantee.  You'll see that it had arisen, however, the previous day, because the AIB meeting of the previous night had learnt ... Eugene Sheehy had learnt that this solution was in prospect or being discussed.</p></speech>

Well, I remember the day ... I told you earlier that we would get independent economists and alleged experts - and I don't mean that in respect of Professor Ahearne; he is undoubtedly an expert.  I have very great regard for him.  But some of the other experts we had on other occasions weren't all that expert in the end.  On that day, we had two economists come and talk to us.  One was Professor Alan Ahearne, and he expressed the view that residential property in Ireland could be as much as 30% overvalued.  On the same day we had another economist - I don't think it's any harm to name Professor John FitzGerald - and he thought that the overvalue could be 15%, and that's in the slides, and I have them here if you need to see them.  Take the middle of those and it's 22%.  We stress tested for 30%, and we could have borne 30% if all the rest of the things hadn't happened, but we could have borne ... our extreme stress test about the same time stressed for a drop in residential of 30%, but, of course, lots of other things went very wrong as well.</p></speech>

"Is this serious?"  And then we were reassured that it wasn't and when I looked and, to be honest with you, I tried to look at this recently, when I looked at the way it was couched in their own terms and then, if you follow, the issue, as you know, was sectoral concentration, and the reason that they were relaxed, the reason that we were relaxed, frankly, about it was this: this was a standard which lumped a whole lot of non-homogenous properties together.  You know, ten acres with no zoning outside a provincial town was treated the same as an office block in the centre of Warsaw or Dublin leased to the Government.  So it was a crude, if you like, I say ... we would have been blessed if we had kept to it, or it would have helped us, but that was the case, and if you look at the Financial Regulator's reports in 2010, 2011 and 2012, they said this is a very complex issue.</p></speech>

I can't remember what precise steps I took on a day in, the date again, June 2006.  That is nine years ago.  But, here I think it was being drawn to our attention and the "we" of course speaks for the whole organisation.  We got regular updates.  The group internal audit would review the property book.  The chief risk officer ... remember the way we managed risk in AIB was this.  There were three principles to do with risk management, just three.  One, the risk is owned by the business.  If you are the credit card person you own those business risks.  Two, the risk function set-up under the man from JP Morgan, is an independent function to scrutinise the observance of risk management on behalf of the board.  And that is what we depended on.  I know that sounds like an excuse but that ... you couldn't ... I couldn't go around and check it.  That was the system that we operated and the risk section was never refused resources.  Whatever it needed to do their part of it, the second part.  To look at the business end of it and to manage the risk on their ... to monitor the risk on their behalf.</p></speech>

"Manage it tightly" does not mean do not extend the exposure, with all due respect.  "Tightly" means that you apply the proper credit standards and you know ... this was part of the bank obviously, the Republic of Ireland property book.  But the property book in the Republic of Ireland never contributed more than 15% to the overall profits of the bank.  It brought the bank down.</p></speech>

I did the best I could to make a note a few days later, that's my contribution, I'm afraid, to this.  Can I say, as you've asked me about this document Chairman, it's important that I would draw issue with some of it, just two points if I can make, Chairman, generally.  You see Mr. Burrows is named, most of that is things I said, not Mr. Burrows.  I think maybe the top two lines are Mr. Burrows and the rest is me; I can identify things I said, and the reference at the very end of Mr. Burrows is "heard from [Mr. Blank], Treasury", that's an AIB official.  And the second thing that's ... not misleading, potentially misleading, is that there's a number of references on the next page to Mr. Neary.  I met Mr. Neary in a corridor, but he was never in the decision makers' room when I was there.</p></speech>

No one asked us, no one raised it, and if I'd been asked I'd have said we were solvent.  I believe it and I believe it still.  As I say, house prices had dropped by 7.7% at that stage.  The real trouble, the real trouble hadn't really started at that stage, so I believe we were solvent and absolutely believed that.  But I was complaining here because a radio interview had been given that said all the banks were the same, last Monday, AIB was in the same trouble as us, and I knew that that wasn't true.  I knew that we had liquidity out beyond a month.  I didn't know how much; I wasn't into the detail.  I knew we had enough liquidity to be able to pull out reserves of liquidity, all this ... this was helping a competitor, to keep Anglo going until the weekend, if Governor Hurley's version had prevailed.

And I was the chairman of this and I bear the responsibility.  This is where the buck stopped.  I can tell you, Deputy Phelan, that it's a salutary thing when you discover for the first time in your life in your 60s that doing your level best in a job is not sufficient to prevent very negative consequences ensuing.  I haven't done many jobs in my life.  I was a teacher; I was a barrister, outside Dublin, barrister in Dublin, I worked for the Government for three years.  And the outturns there were adequate, perhaps, no more than that.  But I did my level best in this job as well, and the outcome was entirely unsatisfactory and that's a responsibility that I absolutely accept and I can never get away from it.</p></speech>

Clearly not appropriate by today's standards and looking back, they were paid much too high but that was the market rate at the time.  We always got consultants from outside, expensive consultants say what is the rate.  And Dr. Nyberg has commented that the salaries of the AIB chief executive was the least relative to size.  Our objective was to get what the market rate was and pay a bit less than that.  Clearly we paid too much.</p></speech>

The first thing to say is that hardly any of that ever vested, the test was too high.  CPI plus 10% is almost impossible to do.  Secondly there were components in that test that related to the market as a whole, 50 other European banks, no control over those.  And so far as Irish property lending is concerned, you know going back to the statistic that I gave to your colleague, Deputy Phelan, about 15% at most of the bank's profits were provided by Irish property so lending to Irish property was never going to affect the EPS in a way that would get you this money.</p></speech>

And it was preparatory to going to meet the Minister.  See, we had left Government Buildings that night thinking that there were four banks going to survive with the guarantee, and ... the phrases from farther down this memo that I read out earlier, I was ... I suppose it had been presented that we had asked for a guarantee, true, but the guarantee that transpired wasn't the one we'd asked for.  But we weren't going to come out and say that, obviously, that wasn't in anyone's interest.  So there was an element of peevishness here, which perhaps I ... perhaps I should regret.  I mean, as I said to you, I remember the next morning, Goldman Sachs came out and advertised or promoted Anglo as a buy.  They said there was an upside of 50 something percent of it as a share buy.  And we'd been, sort of, asked to rescue it or to assist in its rescue for a couple of days, the day before.  So mixed feelings, can I put it that way.</p></speech>

And so, I mean, it was said in those terms.

We used to think, well we're not going to copy Anglo but you know managers in country towns who see their good customers walking across the street, inevitably there's an effect.</p></speech>

I don't know I suppose that's the working population of Waterford or Limerick, I don't know.   They're not all going to be perfect but I think we made a serious effort and that I made a serious effort to try and inculcate ethical standards.  There had been this disgraceful business in the 90s with foreign exchange, now this is the first foreign exchange issue and you sent me some papers on that and we sent that report to the guards.</p> <p>  We instituted staff training on ethical issues and did surveys about how effective it was and there was ... every year ... and I haven't been able to go back through the minutes, the AIB code of business ethics was sent to every employee and it was approved by the board every single year while I was there.  Usually in the spring - I can remember this time of the year.</p> <p>  There was a separate initiative for senior managers who would be taking the more serious decisions and I think the only time I ever addressed a group of managers, managers were run by the CEO.   That's the way it works.  I run the board and he runs the bank.  But I did address a group of senior managers to launch a thing called "Leadership by example" and it was about probity and obeying the law.   And in July 2007 Eugene Sheehy and myself launched that so we did make those efforts.  We also got an assessment done by an English organisation called the Institute for Business Ethics and they said we were above par for the financial services industry.  So there was an attempt to inculcate lawfulness - can I put it that way and I believe that the vast majority of AIB employees were entirely correct in their behaviour.</p></speech>

At any stage was there, this is the question, that we really need to review our governance standards and by means of a process then developing, if the governance standards, were they of a particular nature that matters then relating to the guarantee were inevitably going to happen, in terms of credit concentration levels and all of the rest of it?</p></speech>

I mean I think the guarantee arose from all sorts of complex features including contribution by AIB mistakes but I honestly don't think that the historical issues, and they were real, lead to the guarantee.  I honestly don't think that's what happened.</p></speech>

I don't think there was repetition of error after error after error.  There were historical events in the 90s and before I was chairman and while I was chairman this FX overcharging issue came to thing which I don't think was an offensive dishonesty or anything.  Bad administration maybe but there was no-one benefitted from it and we repaid fully and we ... all our reports were always supervised by someone from the outside.  We got usually a former Governor of the Central Bank come and look over our shoulder while we did those investigations.</p></speech>

As you probably know we had two Americans at one stage, one American always, three from the United Kingdom and then two from Belfast, people around the country.  So, if there was something urgent - let's say a large plc. came and said "We are going to buy a ... do an acquisition and we need &euro;1 billion" and the capital markets fellas looked into it and said "This is fine."  You couldn't get a board together and it was over the limits, so you did it for that.  You also did it for things like sometimes you might need a board resolution for appointing a receiver, sort of housekeeping stuff really.   And then exceptions to the large exposure policy were sent to the chairman's committee as well.</p></speech>

Developer A wants ... he's got a new project, or he has run into trouble in the financing of the old one.  I remember one which was really quite extraordinary.  There might be ... say a development was going through phases and the planning authority required the sequential phases to come back for planning.  There was going to be a DART station that had to be paid for by the developer on ... or maybe a Luas station, I can't remember, and that was extra money.  So you would get top-up requests, and also I'm afraid, you would occasionally get top-up requests that suggested that a developer might be getting into trouble.  You know you'd loaned him &euro;100 million and he now needed another &euro;10 million to finish the thing out and the decision was, do you give him the extra &euro;10 million or do you leave it unfinished?

They were all presented and explained to the board, but, the way it worked, you see, if ... a credit like that for a developer looking for extra money would typically go, first, the lenders in Republic of Ireland division would do it, the senior lenders would look at it.  Then they'd have to go to the Republic of Ireland credit committee.  That's to say the credit people, who are completely independent, have nothing to do with lending and are supposed to be, if you like, scrutinising it in a sceptical way.  If it got through that, and some of them didn't, it would come to the, if it was big enough, the group credit committee.  Now the group credit committee had the group chief credit officer, the chief risk officer, these serious players on it, and it was then ... only then would it be promoted to the chairman's committee.</p></speech>

I mean, when you think of it, the idea was that these credits, like the one I've just mentioned for instance, you don't have in your small papers, but I have in my long papers, because you have them as well, but ... the mark-up for that particular credit, and I have it here, 48 pages of analysis and analysis of who the independent valuers are and what they say about everything, the loan to value of every component, the track record of this customer, what their personal net worth is, their personal net worth statement, all their own assets, running to &euro;2 billion in this case, their repayment history, so, the mark-up on a document like that would be very substantial and would give you all the history and then there would be an industry appraisal.  Some of this was for office development in Dublin, "What does the office development market look like at the moment?", so it was quite a stringent process.</p></speech>

In other words when we were asked back into the decision makers, we met the same personnel, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, the Attorney General, the Governor of the Central Bank until very late when he was replaced by Mr. Grimes, and departmental secretaries, Mr. Doyle, Mr. Cardiff his assistant, and ... I've listed them in the list.  And when we went back in to that room, Mr. Lenihan was always there, as far as I remember.</p></speech>

Anglo's share price had dropped by 50%.  The American Congress was meeting on what's called the Paulson rescue plan.  So, there was a lot of nervousness.  People were, you know, very fraught.  We were talking to the fellas - the officials - down in treasury department, which is the part of the bank that collects our funds.  And the thing was quite fraught.  Richard Burrows said, "I think we should go and see the Government."  I said, "I agree."  We had a quick phone call and we arrived at Government Buildings at 9.30 p.m.</p></speech>

Under the EC state aid rules the bank was obliged to submit a structuring plan to the EU Commission, and this was finalised in April 2010.  I think it was then updated again in July 2011 and further revised in 2012.  Now, in its revised plan - this is the 2012 EU restructuring plan - and it'll come up there as paragraph 3.9.

In so far as it suggests that there was a decision to move into property, I don't think that was a decision, it was just the way things developed.  As to risk management, it clearly failed us and wasn't adequate.  There can be no doubt about that; the proof of the pudding is in the history.  It was not adequate.

I mean, I have had a commitment in the past to education in various ways and I think it's the answer to most of the problems of the world, but I think there is, given that you're focusing on it, I think there is a tendency, not in this room but outside, to think that the banks brought down the country and that there was nothing else involved.  And that was referred to this day one fortnight ago, just 14 days ago, by Governor Honohan in a speech that he made in Paris about facts and myths of the Irish banking crisis, and myth number two was, "It is chiefly the bank guarantee that brought about the nature of fiscal austerity and generally crippled the Irish economy."  That's a myth, he says.

AIB will repay hopefully what is owes, but the &euro;35 billion that went into Nationwide and Anglo, only a very small proportion of that, I understand, will be recovered.

Again you have been sent, although you can't have read everything, but you'll see the board dashboard.  That was something that I came up with, with the chief risk officer, that every month every member of the board would get the risk dashboard.  It was against the contingency that some board member would say "We were never told about this".  It had the ten biggest risks.  Back in 2006-07 it was "Will we be able to complete the Basel transformation?" Earlier than that, perhaps at my behest it was regulatory conformance, "Are we obeying the law in everything we do?" That was something that I was very keen on.  Then subsequently it became credit risk.</p></speech>

Because I think some light was shed on that yesterday by NAMA that, for example, of the &euro;74 billion of par value of loans they acquired, &euro;9 billion of that was actually just interest being rolled up and that &euro;9 billion more or less related to the &euro;40 billion in the land and development book.

I mean when Governor Hurley says "Can you get &euro;5 billion to keep Anglo going to the weekend?" it wouldn't make any sense if you were going to guarantee six banks the next morning for us to be providing liquidity to the weekend.  It was inconsistent with that.  And that was an effort that was ongoing, not me, but Eugene Sheehy talking to officials during the night - we are doing this or we might bid at an ECB auction tomorrow.  So that idea of Bank of Ireland and ourselves saving Anglo until the big event could take place at the weekend - and public companies often go till the weekend when they have a crisis because you get 48 hours when the stock markets aren't on top of you -  would be inconsistent with the six-bank guarantee, so that's why I believe that solution was in the ether late into the night.</p></speech>

You attended educational events at the International Institute of Finance and the International Monetary Conference.  No doubt in some circles these would be seen as very prestigious institutions.  Can I ask you Mr. Gleeson, did the instruction include the fact that within capitalist banking internationally, systemic crises erupted with great regularity all over the world, and that these sprang from very definite causes which were therefore avoidable?</p></speech>

Jan Brueghel the Younger has a fascinating painting about it.  The impression is being given that what happened in Ireland in the crash was, you said a 100 year event.  But in 1999, three years before you became deputy governor, Oxford University Press published a paper by a man called Peter Englund, Stockholm School of Economics.  He wrote about a study that was done by a colleague of his, published the year before, a study of 30 major bank crises, not from 100 years ago, but from the 1980s, including three of the most advanced industrial countries in the world, namely, Norway, Finland and Sweden.  The common patterns that he outlines are in paragraph 2: deregulation, overly rapid credit expansion, sustained increase in asset prices, a bubble, the bubble bursting, collapse of asset prices accompanied by non-performing loans, acute banking crises, credit crunch, government salvage banks.</p><p>Will you agree with me that that would be, or not, an uncanny synopsis of the bubble and crash in Ireland?

I was about to tell you, and you probably know this, that John Lanchester, who is a respected commentator says that economists ... that economics ... one of the reasons that economics is so bad at predicting the future is because economic history has been downgraded in economics departments in universities and that ... when I was learning my economics a long, long time ago, economic history was compulsory, but now the feeling, among some economists at least, is that it's all in the formulae, it's all in the mathematical formulae.  The mathematical formulae capture the history, therefore you don't need to learn the history, and that if there was more attention to history ... so I agree with your point that attending to the history ... on the other hand, Deputy ... let me just finish.

So far as your question relates to the issue of the price of building land, I think that there is a serious political and social issue as to how that should be controlled, and the price of building land, and you probably know that building land becomes the object of speculation, and you probably also know that 40 years ago, this very issue was addressed after an increase of 500% in the cost of building land in Dublin between 1963 and 1971.</p><p>This is a social resource, it should have some element of, in my view, State control.  You can't increase the number of building land ... amount of building land around Dublin.

I suppose we felt we were, feeding into the financial stability reports and getting feedback from it.  It was that sort of thing, it was trading information about where they felt the economy and the banking system was and getting information back.  But I can't bring the specific discussions to mind, I'm sorry to say, Deputy.</p></speech>

The proposal at one stage was that you'd ask directors for details of their personal finances at a level that wasn't being asked in London by the regulator there, and we were competitors for trying to ... one of the big problems getting bankers to be directors of AIB ... you couldn't use Irish bankers, you couldn't use former AIB people, that wouldn't be good governance.  You couldn't use Bank of Ireland because they would be bringing Bank of Ireland secrets, so you had to look to the UK.  And we thought that having to give a much more detailed account of your personal finances in a way that you wouldn't get asked if you were a bank director in London was a bad idea.</p> <p>  The other reservation, which I ... on one occasion saw misrepresented - I'm all in favour of compliance and people being asked to sign up to compliance ... but I remember once, for instance ... and Chairman, this ... I'll conclude on this ... getting a draft compliance statement which said that the directors would confirm that the bank is in compliance with all statutory regulations and rules.  Now, if the stairs in the bank in Ballybofey had a safety feature that they were missing - I just want to answer - I couldn't tell whether everyone was in absolute compliance all the time, no one could.</p></speech>

I will remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry, which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  Therefore, the utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings. Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.</p><p>To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the Gallery, these documents will be displayed on the screen to your left.  Members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and they should not publish any documents as displayed.  They are there to assist proceedings when evidence is being given.</p><p> The witness has been directed to attend this meeting of the inquiry into the banking crisis and you have been furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are before the committee and will be relied upon at times when questioning, and form part of the evidence of the inquiry.

In that invitation I was asked to give evidence relating to a number of lines of inquiry in the context of three positions which I held in my employment with the AIB Group, specifically in the years from 1999 to 2009.  Those three roles were general manager of the strategic development unit in the bank, managing director of AIB Bank, Republic of Ireland, and as director of group strategy at AIB plc.  I just want to take the three of these in turn for a while if I might.</p> <p>  I was general manager of the bank's strategic development unit from September 1999 to April 2002.  That was a strategic marketing role.  In that position I had no responsibility for credit management or credit strategy.  I was appointed as managing director of AIB Bank in April 2002, and I held that position until February 2009, you may have mentioned May 2009 earlier.  I believe it is principally in the context of this role that I can be of assistance to the inquiry.  AIB Bank was the domestic retail banking division of AIB Group.  As its managing director I was responsible for all aspects of the division's activity in accordance with AIB Group policies and governance.  Specifically in the context of credit strategies, credit approval or credit risk management, activities were all conducted within policies that were set out by the central group risk management function, endorsed by the group executive committee and approved by the board of directors.</p> <p>  Thereafter, these activities were supervised by the group risk management function with support from the internal audit function.  As managing director of AIB Bank, I did not have any credit discretion.  My responsibility was to manage the business to the highest possible level of performance in all respects, and to do so within the credit risk policies and credit risk management frameworks that were set and ordained at group level.  Let me make it clear that, in outlining the corporate governance structure within which the AIB Bank division operated, I am doing that for the purpose of clarity.  I am not in any way suggesting that I am without a share of the responsibility for the failure of the bank.  I was part of the group executive management committee through this period and I became a member of the AIB Group board in 2007.  My voice would have been an influential one if I had questioned or challenged our credit strategy and credit positioning at these fora, but I did not do so.  While I had expected a faltering of economic activity and a pull back in the property market, I simply did not foresee the scale of the collapse that was to follow.  It is clear now that AIB credit policies were inappropriate at that advanced stage of the economic cycle.  At the time, I believe that the economy was on a more resilient and sustainable footing than subsequently proved to be the case.</p> <p>  With the wisdom of hindsight, this was a serious misjudgment on my part and on the part of many others within the bank and outside.  My own failing in this respect is a matter of deep personal regret and I am very conscious of the implications of that misjudgment for very many people.  In late January and February of 2009, I was informed by the AIB Group chief executive that I was being moved from my post as managing director of AIB Bank to a newly created position as director of group strategy.  However, that position never materialised in the way that was indicated to me at the outset.  I found myself from that point completely removed from discussions at executive management and board level, and without objectives or direction in terms of a work agenda.  That situation persisted until I decided to leave the bank nine months later in November 2009.  Throughout my time in this role, I had no involvement in the management of the bank and very little knowledge of developments from a credit risk perspective.</p> <p>  Turning to the specific lines of inquiry that I was asked to address, I have addressed each of these in my written statement.  In the interest of time, I will not read through the detail of the views and perspectives that I have to offer, but I am happy to elaborate on my submission in any way that the committee considers helpful.  I have summarised that submission, Chairman, with my personal conclusion that the failure of the bank was primarily attributed to the failure of our credit risk management policy.  Our stress testing of customers' repayment capacity was not sufficiently challenging, and our loan to value constraint on security was inadequate.  The impact of these principle factors was exacerbated by an excessive weighting of property exposure in our portfolio, an undue level of exposure to individual counter parties, and there were external factors that contributed to the difficulty.  There were inappropriate accounting protocols in my view for loan loss provisioning, there was unanticipated and increased funding costs, there was an external requirement for increased capital and all of these added to the strain.</p> <p>  I hope my statement is helpful to the committee.  I have relied primarily on my recollection of events in preparing material for the inquiry and this may mean that some points of detail have escaped me.  With that caveat, I am happy to address any more detailed questions that may arise.  Thank you, Chairman.</p></speech>

Welcome, Mr. Forde.  Can I ask what processes and actions were taken to monitor and remediate the regular approval of exceptions to the group-large exposure policy limits?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-23a.2372" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Donal Forde" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042300002#EE00700"><p>I do not think there was much action taken to remediate them.  That is the truth of the situation.  I think it became far too routine that exceptions were created to the large exposure policy.  I think that is the case.  There was not a question of remediating them.  They were referred to the board, all of these, they were approved.  I think we began to accept it as something routine that that policy was honoured more, I have to say, in the breach than in the observance.</p></speech>

All the documentation and the circumstance of the case would be reviewed three times - by the division, the division then referred them to the group credit committee and they would be reviewed again and then they would go to the board for final approval.  So it was not that there was an absence of scrutiny on them.  I think we had come to accept that large exposures to individuals who were long-established in the property and construction business were acceptable.  I would put it in those terms.</p></speech>

I may be wrong in that but of that order had to be referred to the group, essentially.  Given that it was at odds with our policy, it had to go to the board for approval and sign off.</p></speech>

So I guess the judgment to be applied in that case was whether somebody, through activities like that, was conflicted in terms of what they were doing for AIB.  And that conflict could arise in one of two ways: that they had an interest in one of the cases, and I was never aware of any such instance, or alternatively that they were active in some fashion in the market place in a manner that might've compromised one of the cases.  There wasn't ... Never was there any evidence that that had happened.  I do know there was some discomfort when one or two individuals, as I've said that I've acknowledged, but ... but, and that was the topic of some discussion, but I think we were always satisfied that they were not doing anything that conflicted in any way with the business of the bank.  And, I guess there was a view that the knowledge and intimacy, I suppose, that they had with the market place, was actually of quite a benefit to us in the sense of knowing the nuances of the market, having credibility in standing in the market, so ...</p></speech>

I suppose maybe I ... maybe before I answer that, if I explain ... I wouldn't have involvement in individual cases of any description.  I had no credit discretion of my own.  Credit decisions, there was a ... there was a framework within which they were made.  We had a chief credit officer.  He sat with the committee, he adjudicated on those cases.  I didn't get involved in those cases and I took the view that to do so created some danger that my opinion of a case would sway unduly members of the committee.  So I didn't get involved in those.  Now, I ... we're dealing with many thousands of customers and can I say that there was a case ... that there weren't cases where something exceptional might've been done?  There may well have been but there would be very very few.  I mean, those credit committees operated to pretty stringent guidelines from the group credit committee.  The product ... their ... the output of their work and the decisions they made on the cases were frequently reviewed by the group risk management ... risk management function.  So, you'll see audit reports on the documentation there.  The number of exceptions that would arise to policy would be very few.</p></speech>

Approved meant approved, and that was the at the decision of the chief credit officer.  If it exceeded that amount, it then had to be passed to the group credit committee, and the group credit committee would then review that case and it would pass a decision on it and if it passed a certain threshold there, it had to go to the chief executive of the board.

We heard earlier from former chairman, Mr. Gleeson, and he seemed to be of the case, though I did ask him to reflect and he said he may have been incorrect, that targets were only ever linked to profitability, rather than, say, volumes.  So I was querying that.  So are you saying that when you would be setting targets for branches or performers in ... that it would be linked to growth in lending, rather than profitability?</p></speech>

We would have a divisional profit target for the year that would break down into a whole variety of different lines of business.  There'd be an advance as growth target and then that would break down between an expectation of growth in margins or growth in commercial loans, each elements of the portfolio, and there would be a margin attributed to that growth.  So, example, the loan book in totality was to grow by 10%.  The expected margin on that was, let's say, 1.5%.  So the expected profitability outcome through the course of the year would be whatever the ... whatever the rate dictates.  What would go on through the course of years, obviously each of those lines would vary, so you would be endeavouring to improve the margins on lines, and as you improve the margins, then clearly there wasn't the same pressure for volume growth.  But I was accountable for the totality of that, and ... the totality being the profitability that fell out of it by the ... by year-end.</p></speech>

We would endeavour to grow the volume but we had to grow that volume within the credit guidelines that were set out for us.</p></speech>

So if there is a piece of property, you look to see what's the potential productivity of that piece of property, so is it to be used for residential development, how many houses can be built on it, what's the price of those houses, what's the cost of building those houses, what will the density be, how long will it take for the money to be realised.  They're meant to work it out from first principles and then stress test that and that determines the value of the property.  I think I made the point in my statement that perhaps there was less of that and too much of the reliance on "the auctioneer up the road says this is worth &euro;4 million" because I'm not sure what value attached to that in some respects.  But the loan officer's job and he would be coming with 20 years' experience to this, would be to look at that asset and establish what seemed like a fair value for that asset and in many respects, the getting or the seeking of an independent valuation would be confirmatory more than anything else.  I mean, more value would attach to that senior lending officer's valuation of that asset frequently than would to the external-----</p></speech>

Because it was something of a house of cards, I mean, one auctioneer says it worth four, one says five and then a certain solidity begins to attach to that from a lending point of view when prior to that, I think there'd be a lot more rigour about saying "Actually well, we need to work out ourselves what this piece of land is worth" and I think more effort and more scrutiny and more challenge maybe went into it in the earlier stages when you didn't have the comfort of an external valuer saying this is worth X.</p></speech>

The position that I understood I was taking up, I thought, given, in a way, the difficulties in which the bank found itself at that stage, that it's ... a perspective on strategy would be an interesting ... and a role in which I could make a contribution, and in some sense help with the situation that I was part of creating.

Thank you.</p><p>I'd like to move to just a few months prior to that, when you appeared in front of an Oireachtas finance committee in December 2008.  And you said: </p> <blockquote> 	With regard to the recapitalisation of banks, part of the difficulty in the debate is that banks are banded together as if we are all the same.  We are not.  AIB has made it clear it does not believe it needs capital and that additional capital will not do anything for the business for which I am responsible. </blockquote> <p>Then in February, two months later ... February 2009, there was a capital injection into the bank from the Government.  Can you please explain the difference between your statement and the actual subsequent action?</p></speech>

I think you'll see in the documentation that we were given, there's a stress test that was done there on the property and construction portfolio in '07, and that was done by the risk management function in the bank ... by the most qualified people we had in the risk management discipline.  And you'll see in that, that their downside scenario, their extreme case scenario, was a loss of &euro;2 million of the bank's capital.  Well actually not of the bank's capital ... a loss of &euro;2 million which would substantially erode the profitability of the bank, and might ... might require, I suppose, it's capital adequacy to be boosted.  But this was the extreme view, so, when I was asked in '08, I was still leaning on that understanding of our portfolio.  That was my view of the risk that attached to the business that I was responsible for.  And I answered the question, and anything I would have said would have been informed by that perspective, which I now accept was wrong, but that's what guided those answers at the time.</p></speech>

And I think ... like ... and I remember seeing some of the minutes here in the documents.  I think the view of the finance team was that there were some steps we could take to improve our capital position, but not going so far as a capital issuance.  So I was persuaded by that view, and I ... that's what informed ... so ... so I wouldn't say I was instructed, I would say I accepted the view of the finance team at that stage.</p></speech>

I think ... I make the point I think, in my statement, that in my last act, if I can express it in those terms, of the MD of the division, was that the chief executive has asked me to do a very rigorous assessment of what the scale of loan losses could be.  This was in late January, early February of '09.  And I did that at the time and I did it ... that was ... that was done in close collaboration with the chief credit officer and the risk executives.  And the product of that was, at that time, to suggest that the loan losses could be of the order of &euro;2 billion to &euro;3 billion.  That was my last picture of the division before I, in a sense, stepped aside.  Now that would have not led to that order of capital requirement that subsequently came.  Now things deteriorated so quickly and so sharply after that, that from one month to another the situation changed, so I can understand how ... I mean, at that stage ... I recall when that was being done, the worry and the concern from a credit point of view was that houses weren't selling, sales of completed office developments had stopped.  The worry was not so much about the fall in value as it was about the suspension of economic activity.  At that stage values were back ... house values were back 25%.  Clearly from then, to a period 12 months later, things changed very dramatically.  So, if you'll forgive me, I think asking me whether something, an evaluation of the loan portfolio, was done in February or done in April is very material given what was happening.  And the last one I saw was what was done in late January and February and that was the product of it.</p></speech>

Thank you.  I want to take you back, then, to your management of the increase in property lending in the Republic of Ireland prior to the 2008.  The rate of increase in property lending in the AIB Group was magnified in the Republic of Ireland division, and on exposure to property, property lending grew in the Republic of Ireland from &euro;10.1 billion in 2004 to &euro;33.3 billion in 2008.  Can you explain this imbalance with other divisions in the AIB Group?  Why was it magnified?  Why was it so much greater in RoI?</p></speech>

The core of AIB's franchise in the Irish market was with business customers and the greater part of economic activity that was afoot at these times was in property and construction.  So, I think an added statistic for that period, Deputy, was that our market share wouldn't have changed during that period.  So, what happened was, we kept pace with the level of activity in the market.  We continued to service and support those customers through that time.  Mistakenly, I now accept, but we didn't feel we were stepping more intensively into the market.  We felt we were keeping pace with the requirements of our customers.</p></speech>

I don't recall specific ... well, I don't recall specific discussions with the CEOs, but I recall discussions at our group executive forum and I recall a number of discussions at the board where there would be considerable discussion about the weight of our property-construction lending, and I suppose particularly a fact that it was - again, I saw reference in the documents - it was in breach of some of the guidelines from the regulator.  And there was a number of board discussions to specifically address that point - were we comfortable with what we were doing in property-construction?  I actually recall ... I think when that stress test in 2007 was presented to the board, that was in response, I think, to a specific request from the regulator that the board would validate and confirm its comfort with AIB's property and construction exposure.  And I ... the board's response to that was to ask the risk function to do that evaluation that you've seen there and that stress test.  And the output of that - mistaken, I now accept - I think left them with a false sense of security and a false sense of comfort.  So, yes.  I've answered that in a long-winded way.  There was discussion.  I wouldn't say there was concern, but the scale of our property and construction exposure featured frequently, but each time the board got to a point of comfort with it and we continued.</p></speech>

And I think, when you'll see that, if I can just lay my hands on it ... when you see the presentation that was made to the board ... this was a time when there was a lot of discussion going on about Basel II and the manner in which loan portfolios should be measured and evaluated from the perspective of what capital was required to support them.  And you'll see reference in this that ... certainly, what was communicated to me, or was communicated to us, was that the regulator themselves recognised that this singular, homogenous limit was no longer appropriate and what was now required - and that was consistent with Basel II - was a segmentation of that portfolio and analysis of the different elements of it from a risk point of view.  And that's the exercise, essentially, that the risk function presented.  And that ... you will see a reference there that the regulator was interested in that methodology themselves.</p></speech>

Yes, we were conscious of it but, at the time, the view was that mortgages were going to be so preferentially treated under the new Basel II regulations that, actually, those margins could contract further because these ... as an asset, they were particularly favourably treated, essentially under Basel II, in a manner that perhaps in hindsight wasn't justified.  And for that reason, again, the view was that those margins would continue to contract.  So, as with other elements, we didn't see the risk in that.</p></speech>

It's a risky thing to do for the reason that we've just been discussing.  In a credit crisis, when people then call in these issuances where there's no lending on the interbank market, you then run into trouble in terms of your funding and liquidity if it's called upon.  Were those risks appreciated by AIB at the time?</p></speech>

The issuance of commercial paper is a well recognised means of improving your liquidity profile.</p></speech>

By being able to issue commercial paper, you improve your liabilities and you will ... that enhances your liquidity position.  So, that was a positive step.  But, if I take it in the context of the broader question you're asking, I'm not sure we fully understood.  In fact, I am sure we didn't fully understand ... we did not anticipate the scale of dysfunctionality that came later in the interbank markets.  I accept that point and I acknowledge it.  Commercial paper would've actually been a positive feature of the work that was done to try and improve our position, or the issuance of it.</p></speech>

I mean, one of the means by which you try and remedy a loan that is not functioning is to try to restructure it, so, yes, always, not just in that period, there's a practice of trying to restructure criticised loans.  But the volume of criticised loans in the period of '06 to '08 would have been very few, so I'm not sure where your question is going, but it wouldn't have been material.</p></speech>

Well, the market began to deteriorate in early '08.  Now, what I mean by deteriorate is that essentially ... well, forgive me, I'll just step back one step further.  If you're managing a property and construction portfolio, you lend for a significant period of time.  You've to lend through a period in which land is purchased, in which houses are built and the costs are incurred before ... the revenue only comes at the end when houses begin to sell, or the office, the commercial development that has been developed begins to sell.  The loan and the cash flows are predicated on that sale happening at a particular time and, from early '08, it was obvious that activity in the market was beginning to slow; houses were not selling in the way that had been expected and what that begins to do then is it pushes out the revenues on which those loan cases are based, so, from early '08, it was obvious that there were some developers who were going ... would not meet the cash flow expectations that we had and I would describe the deterioration in the loan book through the course of '08 as that dynamic.  That's what was going on and it wasn't until '09 actually that the concern of inadequate security values began to really manifest itself.  It's only then that it became obvious that asset values were falling to a point that our security was going to be compromised.</p></speech>

I can't say that there was.  I think the level of growth in the market intensified in '05 and '06, so it seemed like the pace of activity was more frantic, if I can describe it in those terms, through '05 and '06.  I didn't ...

I want  to just come back, just finally, to Mr. Gleeson's evidence earlier today.  We were talking about the roll-up of interest in the RoI division and when he was asked about ... the board went looking to find out exactly how much interest had been rolled up and he said there was a bad piece of missing architecture because management weren't able to produce it, they had to go and look for it manually, and he said that this was an indefensible gap.</p></speech>

People were monitoring it, at a case-by-case basis.  The gap was that, from an overall portfolio management, we weren't readily able to present that picture and I guess that only became ... that only came into such ... our focus in late '08 and then it became obvious that that was a piece of information that we needed and needed a lot more ... needed to be able to access a lot more readily than we were able to do.</p></speech>

If you take an individual property case, as I've said, if I lend money to somebody for the purchase of land, or if I lend money to somebody to develop residential housing, there's always going to be interest roll-up.  There's no way of paying the interest.  There's no way, until the houses begin to sell or ... so, there's interest roll-up endemic in every property loan.</p></speech>

That would be fair.  Later on, that became a feature, I think, I would say through '09; and, late '08, there were some who were beginning, as I explained earlier on when you asked me to explain the deterioration in the portfolio, it was for that reason, that we were beginning to encounter some cases where they simply couldn't pay their interest because those sales weren't materialising.

That concludes the leads, but there is just one issue, maybe if we can just get a bit of further clarity on the appropriateness of property-related lending strategies and risk appetite in AIB.  This relates to core document AIB PB2, page 6, item 4, or 4.2.  Very simply, Mr. Forde, the Central Bank have a licensing and supervision requirements and standards for credit institutions and the standards provided that the credit institutions should not have risk assets amounting to more than 200% of shareholder funds; that's the own funds inside in the bank.  And, in any one sector of business, or economic activity, or were considered to apply to two or more separate sectors, the limit was 250% of own funds.  Now, in July 2006, the banks' exposures to the broad property, building and construction sector, amounted to 206% ... or, sorry, 260% of own funds, which was already now going over the limit and while the limit was 250% and then the bank continued to breach these limits and such lending reached the level of 390% at September 2008.  Now, you were the head of AIB's Republic of Ireland's business.  How do you reconcile the level of lending to the property and construction sectors while you were, at this case now, clearly in breach of regulatory prudential lending limits for the sector from 2006 onwards?</p></speech>

The reason I was drawing attention to that was what that presentation sets out is the fact that we're in breach of the limit, then goes on to explain, however, if I can use that phraseology, that when the portfolio is analysed in the manner that Basel II required of it, break it into logical portfolios, the result was that the risk attaching to it came within levels that were comfortable for the bank.  And that was fed back to the regulator, and it was that that led the board to the conclusion that the level of exposure that we had at that stage built up was acceptable to them.  So, no, you're right in saying that there was no direction to stop.  What there was, was, I guess, a reassessment, a re-evaluation of it under that new methodology to say, yes, it is within levels that are comfortable and prudent for the bank.</p></speech>

I raised this with Mr. Gleeson this morning and I'm just wondering if these figures are related to the point I was making.  There was a suggestion that other banks may have been eating AIB's lunch, and particularly in the property and construction sectors.  Was there a strategy during 2006 and 2008 to expand rapidly into the property and construction sectors by AIB to win back market share?</p></speech>

And, I guess, as MD, if I had a concern, it was that we should be trying to remain relevant to our customers, and that meant largely trying to maintain it, but there was no ... there was no ambition to grow it, no.  I think there was a recognition that to retain the position we had was as ambitious as we could be.</p></speech>

I worked through a time when all analysis was that there was a shortage of housing stock, okay?  That there was a demographic that meant the demand for houses was going to increase.  So, I think I would have been wiser than most if I had seen what was coming, but I didn't see it.  And it's, as I have said, a matter of great regret but I can say I acted in good conscience, in good faith.  I, at no time, ever had a premonition of what was going to happen.  If I did I would have acted differently, but I didn't.</p></speech>

And in ... the reference document for this is going to come on screen in a moment.  It's AIB, Vol. 2, pages 13 and then 21.  They are appropriate to staffing and training and so forth.  But, in a group internal audit, a GIA report dated April 2006, concern was then being expressed that the experience levels of staff in the Republic of Ireland division - the division you headed up - would not be sufficient to manage cases through the cycle and this could lead to the bank missing significant credit events on accounts.  Now, this is as things are really heating up ... it's two years out from the guarantee but we can see that the loans into different sectors are happening in particular ways.  What I want to deal with you here is how ... or did management understand the importance of maintaining a balance between staff with good credit experience and more junior, more sales orientated personnel?  In particular, I suppose what I am dealing with is that staffing and appropriate lending skills ... set ... these sets ... or the skillsets ...seem ... appear to have been an issue across the Irish banking industry, particularly in the mid 2000s.  Were you, or how aware were you, of this problem?</p></speech>

I think that's my report to the board.  So that's mine.  I was aware.</p></speech>

Through this time, the amount of ... the degree of movement of staff - senior lending staff - from one institution to another was quite intense on occasions.  So, senior lending people were highly prized assets, if I can describe it in those terms, and from time to time we in AIB lost a number ... and the loss of one or two of these was a serious blow when it happened.  So, I guess I was very conscious of it and I had two concerns - one, that our remuneration was somewhere on a par with our competitors in a way that wouldn't give people a monetary incentive to move down the road, in the first instance, but that secondly that we were trying to train young people, essentially, who would be able to reinforce and step up, essentially, if that happened.  It was an ongoing challenge because you don't learn credit experience overnight and one of the difficulties was that most of the people in ... many of the people, I wouldn't say most ... many of the people involved in credit management in AIB had never seen bad times.  That was an anxiety.</p></speech>

As the market conditions were then deteriorating and the loan impairments began to increase, Mr. Forde, did you consider, or was there consideration in AIB at that time, that you had sufficient trained staff with the appropriate skillset to deal with the arrears collections and manage prominent loans?</p><p>It's like playing offensive football and defensive football.  This was ... you were moving from very open banking now to a far more difficult type of banking.</p></speech>

And you'll never have adequate resources when something of the scale of what was beginning to develop at that stage, you know, began to gather momentum.  That's the truth of it.  But all offensive activity stopped from early '08.  From there forward, all resources were, essentially, in the back line.</p></speech>

How do you think AIB were coped for the skillset that that new type of banking required?</p></speech>

So I think we tried to mitigate that as best as possible by a more centralised approach by relying more heavily on some of the senior lending people who were working, through the late 2008, 24 hours a day, so, yes, there were strains that you wouldn't consider to be appropriate at that point.</p></speech>

Most of these things were handled at a group level but I would have had experience of it through my executive role.  There was a number of events through that time from 2002 to 2009 that would shape my answer to your question.  I came to the division as MD at the time of the Ruznak crisis which prompted a fairly radical governance review and overhaul within the bank and the regulator seemed to be intensively involved in that at the time, certainly.  Then subsequently, in 2004 there was an FX charging issue.  I was at the centre of that; it was in my division and I would regard the manner in which the regulator intervened, supervised and directed the bank as a consequence of that to be quite heavy-handed.  It was very interventionist, very demanding.  This, now, is in the context of consumer regulation, though, but it was quite ---</p></speech>

It really followed as a consequence of that but there was a great deal of pressure, intervention, review and demand, if I can use that word, from the regulator relating to fees and charges reviews and remedy of things that had gone wrong.  So, it would be very wrong to characterise that as light touch, all in the context, now, of consumer regulation.</p></speech>

My memory of that is an April 2007 review and I recall at the time that the regulator asked that the board "confirm its comfort" with the bank's position in property and construction.  That just struck me at the time as a slightly odd phraseology for a regulator, by contrast with the terminology which would frequently be used in matters of consumer regulation.</p></speech>

That isn't fair, I don't think.  I certainly wasn't conscious that we were chasing Anglo but we were chasing the pack, if I can describe it in those terms.  We were regularly being challenged by the investors, by shareholders and by the analysts as to how we were going to keep pace, not just with Anglo but with other Irish banks and with some very fast-growing UK and continental banks.</p><p>So, yes, it's true to say there was a lot of pressure for performance.  But Anglo ... see I'm careful to say that because, to be fair, it's true that lending was the core of where the growth was coming from but the  bank was trying to diversify away from that.  Certainly one of my objectives all the time - formally given to me - was to try to diversify the earning stream of the divisions, so more fees and charges income, more from health and life insurance and the like.  So there was an objective to diversify but it's true that ... that the substance of our performance was coming from loan growth.</p></speech>

It's just on the issue of valuation.  How was the expertise gathered or was ... and applied in AIB with applying valuations?

I mean, the people who were to the fore in that respect in the division and at group level were people who had been active in reviewing property cases for 20 years.  Okay?  And what they would bring to that consideration is, as I've said, a first-order analysis of essentially the asset that was being purchased.  If it was for residential development, you know, how many houses would be built, at what cost ...  you know, what was the track record of the developer in delivering these, in what timeframe?  And you work it back from first principles.  If you're going to sell ten houses with a net profitability on each of whatever &euro;50,000 and you've worked that back, you can just calculate the value of the land and you discount that in some measure for safety.  So it's a first principles analysis, if you like, of what the value of the asset is relative to what it's going to produce.</p></speech>

So let's say, for instance, your ... as often is used as a kind of a barometer ... the guard married to the nurse.  They were going to take a mortgage out over 20 years, whoever was the chief earner - whether it was the guard or the nurse - it would be three times their income and then the guard or the nurse's annual income applied.  But ... and that would be ... that was a very set ratio.  But over a period of time we saw that going into multiples of what the earning capacities were and the mortgage schedules getting longer and longer, going from 20 years nearly out to 40 years.  At any stage ... was it ... did somebody say "It's not the valuations of the properties now is the issue, it's the capacity and the affordability to pay?"</p></speech>

I think the emphasis shifted from the simplicity of a multiple or one or the other.</p><p>It shifted to this capacity of the borrower to be able to meet the repayment.  The formula was that all mortgages had to be stress tested for interest rates, if I remember, for 2% higher than prevailed to make sure that the borrower was able to meet the repayments.  That sort of model did become more prevalent rather than the simple one that you described.  So it is true to say,  I think, that the model failed a little bit.

I mean, if one operates on the assumption that all purchasing markets are required upon -  if I am selling my car tomorrow morning to buy a new car, somebody has to come in and buy a second hand car.  The housing market is very much contingent upon first-time buyers to come in to allow people to trade up and trade down and all the rest of it, and that affordability for first-time buyers was becoming so difficult that the State had brought in a package of affordable housing, which was supposed to be subsidised housing.  In Cork affordable housing was &euro;250,000.  This was council housing that was subsidised at &euro;250,000.  It is probably worth less than half of that in today's market.  So you had this massive compounding snowballing effect.  Was anybody in the bank saying that this is a concern?</p></speech>

I think our difficulty, and I now accept that mistake, but our difficulty was that we did not see that changing dramatically because the view we had was that we were in an environment where there was a shortage of housing stock ... in the capital at least, in the greater Dublin area.  Probably still the case today.  We had an influx of people coming into the country from eastern Europe and so forth.  We had a demographic where the baby boomers of the 80s were coming into house.  So you had a scenario and you had - the outlook, it seemed, was one for continued economic expansion.  We did not see how it was that there was going to be a significant change in the fact that houses were going to be more expensive and going to demand more of the proportion of disposable income to service them.  We sort of accepted that.  For that reason then, the shift in the model, I suppose, looking more at the capacity of the borrower to be able to meet the repayments even if interest rates rose became more the issue, rather than a concern about the inflated value of the house.  I am not justifying our approach now in hindsight, but I am trying to rationalise the way we were thinking at the time.</p></speech>

You are very welcome, Mr. Forde.  On page 4, part of the professional valuations were frequently but not always thought by AIB to evaluate property as a security.  Could I refer to AIB before Vol. 1 on page 10.  You were referring to part 2006 in your statement today, but the board minutes show this problem persisted two and a half years later, 2006,  2007 and half way through 2008.  There was a discussion about AIB's practice of not seeking professional property valuations, and whether this will have implications in terms of financial accounts to giving a true and fair view.  So, given that the commercial property went up 14 times from &euro;8 billion to &euro;112 billion, and the residential, as you have been saying to us, went up much less, &euro;25 billion to &euro;122 billion, the practice of not doing the valuations was still of concern at board level on 24 July 2008.</p></speech>

As that's being sought, it refers to a board discussion, AIB's exposure to the broad property building construction sector, amounted to 260% of own funds, while the limit was 250%.  And let me go on, the board requested that this issue be pursued with the IFSRA, given that the standards clearly required revision.  Is that me saying I was speeding but the speed limits were wrong, kind of ... you know or ... it's a pretty strange attitude to the regulator that you assumed that at the board level, the regulator was at fault.</p></speech>

I wouldn't have had any direct engagement with the regulator here but my understanding was this, we were in breach of the limits ... we were in breach of a limit that set out a singular constraint on the totality of all property and construction lending.  That had been in place for a long time.  What was going on in prudential circles at the time, and there is reference to it here in the paragraph just before that, what was going on at the time, was the introduction of Basel II conventions to analyse, and these were new protocols that were being introduced for the assessment of risk attaching to loans, and the thrust of those was not to look on loans as one homogeneous set, but to break them into what were called logical portfolios and to look at the particular risk attributes that are attached to each of them.  My understanding is that the regulator was also of the view that that's where they needed to go and for that reason that the old limit was somewhat ... somewhat redundant and were in conversation with AIB saying, "How are you doing this, and actually how are you getting comfort with the scale of your exposure and is the board comfortable with it?"  And then, as part of that presentation, AIB set out how it went about assessing its portfolio in this new way under this new methodology and the board, it seems, took comfort with that and is saying, okay well, let's then make it clear in our engagement with the regulator, let's have this new formula adopted but let's not have this indecision as to what particular standard of measurement is to apply.  That is my understanding of what was going on but I was not directly in discussion with them.</p></speech>

This deals with a proposal to revise the adjusted loan-deposit ratio.  How did it get to the board?  Did somebody propose it?  Did somebody second it?  Because it makes a 162% ratio into a 115% ratio.  Was this also because we didn't like the regulator when we went over the limit?  I mean, again, it seems to illustrate to me a casual attitude towards regulation.  If you don't like the rules you adjust it to make it a different set.</p></speech>

Let me first say that this wouldn't be my direct area of responsibility but my understand ... I don't believe that's a regulatory constraint.  I don't believe there was any regulatory constraint on loan to deposit.  I may be wrong on that but that's my belief.  What was happening here was that the market was putting a strong focus on the loan-to-deposit ratio in different institutions, but, again, this changing methodology in the marketplace was an issue and that rather than the simplicity of this customer loans and totality over customer deposits, the market was looking for a more informed ratio, where the value of long-term deposits was recognised or the saleability or liquidity of assets was recognised in the formula and that's what this adjusted loan-to-deposit ratio achieves.</p><p>So this isn't a regulatory matter, I don't think, Senator.  This is a matter of the way in which AIB presents a picture of itself to the marketplace.  The marketplace was looking for something that was more nuanced and that's what was proposed.</p></speech>

I think we were, looking back, we were going through a period right through from 2002 to 2008 when generally banks globally were being driven to more efficiency, more efficiency meaning that you were endeavouring to squeeze, if I can express it in those terms, performance out of every aspect of the business and it is right to say that I think we were being pushed and responding to a marketplace that was constantly pressing us into positions, perhaps, of more risk, of more efficiency, more leverage of assets all the time.  I think that is true to say but I am just making the distinction between the previous one which was certainly coming from the regulator, this was coming from the market.</p></speech>

It's an undertaking essentially to put the security into effect, whatever that might involve and you leave that in the hands of the solicitor.  He undertakes to do that for you and it's as simple as that really.  You might be taking possession of deeds or might be taking possession of some documents of title and they would involve frequently work at the registry and so forth and the Land Registry and the solicitor will undertake to do those.</p></speech>

There was an internal audit in AIB in April 2006 highlighting an issue relating to outstanding solicitor undertakings in the Republic of Ireland division, your division.  It's the reference page, it's actually up on the screen there in front of you but just for noting purposes, it's AIB B4, Vol. 1, page 20.</p><p>And in that audit it would demonstrate that outstanding solicitors' undertakings was No. 1 in the top three outstanding internal audit issues, as late as October 2008.  This was a continuous issue that was running through AIB.  Was the board aware of this level of difficulty that was there in solicitors' undertakings and them being accepted, relating to property being taken as security, and the lengthy delay in perfecting security in many cases, and was there even situations that when the undertaking wasn't even complete, that the loan was being issued anyway?</p></speech>

I suppose you're ... I think I'll answer it in two ways, Chair.  The first is to say that I, and I reference this in my statement, the first thing is, I suppose, to make sure that we see this issue in context.  The practice for all the larger exposures was that the security was handed over to be perfected to first and second order legal firms.  So they would do it for the bank.  So those loan cases with greater exposures were never a problem, they were not an issue.  So this issue related to the lower level cases, but yes, it was a constant difficulty, and as you see, the audit ... that audit report would have been given the board so they were aware of it, but it was one of those issues that I was always working on and we were never ... we were never in a comfortable position.  But it would be important not to overstate that, as I've said, because all the larger exposures would not be at issue here.</p></speech>

So this was part of the work of the credit committees.  A loan case would come up for review and if they had a concern about it they would stipulate that it was to be reviewed in perhaps three or six months' time.  Part of that review was to confirm the standing of the security.  So-----</p></speech>

Mr. Forde, I have a few questions also.  I want to refer to the evidence given earlier by Mr. Gleeson.  In his testimony he was asked about AIB being caught in the wake of Anglo, and to quote him directly, he said "we tried not to be brought in the wake but in many ways we were."  I just want to know, in terms of your role, as managing director of AIB from 2002 to 2009, in the Republic of Ireland, was there any direction from the board, from the chair, as to how not to be brought in the wake of Anglo Irish Bank, can you recollect?</p></speech>

I take his reply to mean that he's speaking in the context of the performance of the bank, such things as share price performance, and so forth.  In a way that was up there, if I can describe it in those terms.  At my level, Anglo was just one of a number of people that were very aggressively targeting our business.  I would have gotten no direction to deal with any one competitor more than another.  I would have constantly been relaying information about threats or inroads in our business from Anglo, yes, but Bank of Scotland, Ulster Bank, Danske Bank, Bank of Ireland, so I wouldn't have held Anglo in any particular place from my perspective.  From his, I suspect that in terms of accounting for the performance of the bank to the investor community, would be a constant thorn in-----</p></speech>

How successful were you and the Republic of Ireland operation in terms of that attempt to diversify?</p></speech>

Well, I made that comment earlier in this respect at diversification between different lines of business, and so there was a very heavy push to try to increase the profitability from deposits, from health insurance, life insurance, from fees and charges, from electronic banking.  So, the push was on from that perspective.  There was also a focus on trying as best as possible to diversify the loan book.  I was more successful with the first of those objectives than I was with the second, and I suppose the reason that I wasn't successful at all with the second was it's rather difficult ... in some respects, you have to respond to the business that your customers want to do.  And, unfortunately, property and construction was where it was all happening, so it made it difficult.</p></speech>

And, in the sense, is it not ... I don't want to put words in your mouth or be accused of leading you, but "wrestling with one's conscience and winning" is a phrase that might come to mind as to how the board dealt with the matter.  Or it might not, just to leave it an open question.</p></speech>

So, I can recall discussions at that time about whether this was appropriate.  There certainly was a consciousness that we were intensely involved in property and construction, so I can remember discussions at that time.  I can remember this discussion that's here, this stress test prompted by the regulator asking the board to validate that its weight of exposure in property and construction ... that it was comfortable with it.  So, I can remember that.  Certainly, no surprise in 2008, as the market began to turn down, there was discussion.  So, I think it is fair to say the board wrestled with it.</p></speech>

Basel II has been mentioned a lot and the transformation that was taking place within AIB and maybe other organisations at the time, but did those rules still stand or not with regard to sectoral lending, the 200% figure and the 250% for related sectors, and the fact that AIB was at least one third over both of those headings in terms of lending into property and development?

There was a general clamour at that time that the domestic banks, AIB amongst them, was losing position and relevance with customers and that other banks coming in from outside were far more relevant.  So, in the balance of those things and with the belief that the risk in the portfolio was of the order that's outlined in the stress test that wouldn't threaten our capital, I didn't consider that we were in an imprudent place.</p></speech>

Dr. John FitzGerald, in evidence to the committee, a number of weeks ago, expressed the view that a senior official within AIB had raised with him, at the end of October 2005, concerns with regards to stress tests and exposure to the property sector.  That has since been disputed by the said senior official.  Were you aware, at that time or subsequently, of that discussion and those meetings that took place?</p></speech>

Can I put some of that testimony to you from the chairman, Frank Daly?  And both made serious reference to the equality of the security that banks had or didn't have, in terms of massive loans.  Mr. Daly said, "The safety zone of borrower equity usually existed only on paper.  The result is that the borrower was typically not the first to lose.  In the event of a crash, the banks stood to take 100% of the losses and that's what happened."  He said, "The model did not appear to require a stringent approach by borrowers to analysing project feasibility."  And he said,  "Very little, if any, consideration was given to the inherent cyclical nature of the property markets. The attitude appears to have been that the only way was up, that somehow the forces of gravity were suspended as far as the Irish market was concerned and that the long established pattern of property market cycles was no longer relevant."  Does any of that apply to Allied Irish Banks?</p></speech>

I'd be the first to acknowledge that I think we did lose sight of the cycle; I think that's fair.  I think the reason for that was that ... my personal view was that there was some order of economic transformation going on in the country; the number of people in employment was growing dramatically, we'd had a period of expansion, and all of the indications were that ... not at the same pace, but that it was sustainable.  So, I certainly was misled into the view that we were not in some bubble but we were in some, as I've said, economic transformation that was in some way more sustainable, so I-----</p></speech>

And it was to ensure that there was security in place, to the order, generally, of 70% of the loan, but, more importantly, to make sure that in the first instance that there was a demonstrable means by which the loan could be repaid.  That was done.  I think where it fell down was that that challenge, if you will, to the repayment capacity of the loan was not rigorous enough at all.  I do accept that.</p></speech>

They were seen to have had a track record of performance and built up significant equity.&quot; </blockquote> <p>A stunning irony struck me in relation to that, I will ask you to comment upon, that at the end of virtually every advertisement for a bank, is &quot;past performance is no indication of future return.&quot;  Was that the situation here?</p></speech>

If you can imagine ... earlier on I described I suppose a simple loan project where someone, a developer, has to buy land and go through that long period during which they pay for the land, they develop the housing stock and then they sell it.  Through all that time there is no revenue whatsoever to be got.  If you are dealing with a larger player that has a number of these projects afoot at one time, they tend to be at different stages of maturity so typically you'll have some projects that are closer to revenue and sales than others.  That helps to make the loan a more manageable proposal from the lender's viewpoint.  So the principle of working with a more diversified player that has experience and a track record in building houses on time and within budget, that stands.  What fell down here was that there was such a collapse of economic activity that every element of these different businesses - whether they were involved in residential development or whether they were involved in commercial development - all of them simply weren't able to produce revenue and that logic became completely unstuck.  So I am in a sense defending the principle of working with a diversified player in any industry.  But it afforded us no protection here in the way things developed, as we imagined it would.</p></speech>

Is that an inordinate amount of money, in view particularly of what happened very shortly after that?  And secondly, my last question is in relation to the people out there who have been burned badly as a result of the bubble and crash and what the banks and the bondholders did.  Do you understand how bitter they feel towards the bankers like yourself?</p></speech>

It seems an inordinate amount of money in hindsight and in the context of what happened.  As I tried to indicate in my statement, I spent my professional life with AIB.  I suppose it was my life, it was my career - the interests of the bank were what woke me up in the morning and took me to bed at night.  So, I'm very conscious of my failure, I'm very conscious of the bank's failure and I'm hugely conscious of the implications of it for everybody concerned.  I say that as genuinely as I can and looking back, I do accept that you know, the salaries we were paid now seem silly.  They didn't then in the context of what people in the banking sector earned here at home and abroad.  I had two job offers during that period, one domestically and one abroad that offered more money.  So I had no sense that I was as overpaid as I now seem to have been in hindsight.  I do fully understand that bitterness it creates.  I fully understand the disappointment that there is with us.  I have no quarrel with that, it is justified.  I am very conscious of the manner in which we did leave people down.  All I can say again is that I acted at all times in what I thought was good faith and best conscience.  I never woke up of a morning with any real concern that the bank was in a position of difficulty.  I am wrong on that, but I am guilty of a bad judgment, but no more than that.</p></speech>

The fact we weren't growing at any pace that was faster than people in the market and the fact that, notwithstanding that there was one or two people who were critical, the broad mass of those who essentially were offering a view on the market and offering analysis of the market were positive about the outlook.</p></speech>

It's for others to judge, but I don't think my style was ever intimidating.  I made a practice of actually having a lot of personal conversations with people and I'd like to think I was approachable, so no, I don't think they were afraid at all.  I'm, I'm pretty sure of that but others would have to validate that; I would feel confident in saying that.  I think ... I don't want to say that people wouldn't challenge our position.  I mean at our management team there would be discussions.  The discussions would more relate to what segments of the property market we should be, in a sense, more positive about, others that we should be more negative about.  There was a consciousness about the totality of that exposure, and each time it went back to the debate.  As I've said, it wasn't one dimensional about are we in safe place, what's the risk, what's the stress test telling us, what are ... where are our competitors, what do we have to do to try and remain relevant to our customers; what do we have to do to meet the expectations of the market place.  So, we had each time the debate about the balance of those and wrongly, each time we came down to feel that we were in the right place.</p></speech>

I have explained that my division wasn't so directly impacted, but I was party to the management meetings at which there was conversations about the two divisions that were more directly impacted, AIB capital markets and the UK, and certainly I could see that they were having difficulty increasingly in sourcing money from the market.  The term for which they were sourcing it was shortening.  So it's a judgment call as to whether it was going to last for a month or six weeks, but in broad terms I can understand that as being not an unreasonable picture.</p></speech>

One was a cash bonus but the bank was progressively moving away from that and it was moving more towards the grant of share grants.  And those share grants were dependent on ... and the reason it was moving there was that those share grants were dependent on two aspects of the bank's performance.  They were dependent on how the earnings per share performed over a three-year period, and they depended on the performance of the share price relative to other banks.  And there was another aspect which was that any grants that were given obligated me as a senior person to hold a very substantial share.  So when I hear on occasions that the charge that, you know, that structure incentivised me or others to do the wrong thing or behave in a short-term way, I was a significant shareholder in the bank, so it would be illogical for me to behave in any way that wasn't in the bank's medium long-term interest.  So I never felt any motivation to do anything other than the right thing in the medium to long term.</p></speech>

The people in the property and construction sector, they were obliged to tell me if they were, and they would, frequently someone would say to me that X client has invited me to a football match, or X client has invited me here, and I would approve that.  I would usually make sure that they are paying for it, or if it is excessive, that the bank is paying for it, that there was no suggestion of conflict, but you have to do that to a point.  It is just a question of judgment that it doesn't go too far but I had no sense ever that it did.

There were two things. This was my picture of it. There were two things happening. There were specific concerns about two institutions.  They were giving rise to a particular focus on the Irish market, but generally,  banks even beyond Ireland were having difficulty with funding and liquidity.  The conversations were essentially reviewing both of those dimensions, the domestic concerns revolving around those two, and the broader global picture which was deteriorating rapidly. That certainly was what was in mind as the situation then became more acute, when engagement was going on with the Department of Finance and the regulator. The briefings at those sessions would be from the head of capital markets, from the Head of the UK division, an assessment of those by the chief risk officer, the head of finance, the chief executive, so that conversation was going on. The view that a potential remedy for it was to take out the two problematic institutions, and even then, when they were taken out,  perhaps to guarantee in some limited way the liabilities of the other.</p></speech>

In relation to this individual, which is one of your larger exposures ... we can see from Project Atlas in page 19 the different types of exposures you have, so this individual is definitely in the top five.  In September '07, the board had approved that underwrite ... written ... &euro;789 million.  A number of weeks later, on the 5 December '07, a request came for &euro;202 million additional to this individual.  Now, the document ... if we look at page 36 of the document ... the document goes on to outline the individuals ... the bank's exposures already.  They talk about a &euro;202 million exposure.  That is the request that was before the board.  They talk about &euro;228 million, which was significant pre-lets.  They talk about &euro;190 million, which was, interestingly - and there's details of this in the first page - which was &euro;160 million to buy shares in ICG, which the board ... which was suggested represented long-term strategic investment.  And I'd maybe ask you to comment ... how did that investment turn out or are you aware of how that investment turned out?</p></speech>

And &euro;30 million was for planning ... or was for a development where planning permission refused for 737 apartments and 270,000 sq. ft. commercial space rejected by An Bord Plean&aacute;la on the basis of infrastructure and so on.  Then there is &euro;138 million to be clear in 12 months, designated site, substantially complete, &euro;90 million for sites - and we don't know where they are - &euro;59 million for five distinct sites, with interest being funded, &euro;84 million for something that's 73% self-financing and takes this person's total exposure to AIB of &euro;991 million.  But of the request that was before the board that day, it was for a syndicate proposal that was going to be co-funded with NIB and another bank, which I just don't see in front of me here.  There was two other banks in ... and the total request was &euro;602 million of which ... &euro;605 million, sorry, of which AIB were asked to put up &euro;201 million.  On this documentation, I can't see anywhere where the developer was putting in his own cash.</p></speech>

I won't recall this in the detail that you'd wish me to but from the documentation that you've presented there, the proposal talks about a gearing level, I think of 50%, doesn't it?</p></speech>

Is it not the case that most of this is a result of lending, by AIB, to the individual and the equity that responded from the first loan went to pay the second loan, the third loan, the fourth loan and so on and we have a domino effect, when one starts to fall, the house of cards comes in on top of the bank and the developer but the developer, as was said yesterday, has no skin in the game.</p></speech>

I mean, what earlier on I was describing what would typically be happening with a large-scale developer like this, there would be a whole series of different elements of business going on as is indicated by the different facilities here.  Each of those would have a slightly different profile and some of them will represent, in some cases land will be purchased five, six years previously on which there is a very substantial equity today.  In some cases, there's housing stock that's under construction for two or three years that's now ready for completion.  So, or there may be an office development that's being developed that is now ready for sale, so they are not cash but they're near cash if I can describe some of them in that-----</p></speech>

It's in relation to and again we have a document here, the same booklet AIB B2, Vol.1, page 25.  It's another advice to the board re approval of exception of group large exposure policy and this is for &euro;11 million to increase the individual's exposure to the bank to &euro;322 million.  This is, I believe, to buy 1.75 acres in some place where he has already bought 6.5 acres at the cost of &euro;70 million.  The question I ask is the CEO or the group chief executive approved this on 22 December, just a couple of days before Christmas, because of the timescale that was required and it went to the board then for approval.  Now how does that work if the chief executive approves &euro;11 million to increase the exposure of AIB to &euro;322 million in December.  What power does the board have at that point and is that a common factor that the CEO ... did the CEO have that power, is that the power that the group chief executive had at the time?</p></speech>

I think their discretion was up to &euro;75 million or &euro;80 million.  I think then the chief executive had a discretion over that, before it went to the board, from memory.  But that was rarely practised, in fairness and I think this would arise because there was obviously some particular deadline that had to be reached.  That was rare.  It would be unusual that the chief executive would step in and I think it's because of the particular point in time here, Christmas, but that would be an irregular thing.  That would not happen and the board would then be advised of any decisions he had made and would be asked to endorse it.</p></speech>

I think there is something in what you have said and in what the NAMA representatives may have said yesterday.  The difficulty if you are funding a client that is involved in a number of different property projects is that it is difficult for cash to be realised.  There are always ... property of any description when it's in the development, is cash consuming and as a lender you are always faced with that challenge and it is true that in many cases the equity as we saw it, that a developer would be bringing to the occasion would be completed houses or nearly-completed houses or it might be property or land, excuse me, some of which would have been bought five or six years earlier that now ostensibly was worth very much more.</p><p>So yes, we did regard that as equity, and you're right, when push came to shove, and things ... there's was such a collapse of economic activity, all of these came unstuck.</p></speech>

I suppose if you have a developer who has essentially absorbed the cost of building an estate of houses that are ready for sale, he has a lot of skin in the game at that point, equally.</p></speech>

What NAMA, to my knowledge, and I can stand corrected in this, is the biggest national asset management agency in the world, or is a company that holds the biggest portfolio, so Mr. Daly comes with a certain authority, given the job that he has as the biggest of this type on the planet, to my knowledge.  So Mr. Daly's testimony yesterday, and I'll get it up on the screen there, it is page 2 and 3 of his opening statement.  He says:</p> <blockquote> 	While internal bank lending documentation may indicate that loan-to-value ratios were, typically, less than 100% when the loan was drawn, the reality, in many cases, was that a developer's equity contribution was in the form of a rolling-up of unrealised, paper profit from other developments.

On the face of it therefore, developers had some skin in the game, but in reality that amounted to nothing more than unrealised equity positions levered by the developer to secure funding for new transactions. </blockquote> <p>He then goes on to say, and what this means in summary:</p> <blockquote> 	In effect, therefore, the banks were providing all of the real cash funding for both acquisitions and development.  It is safe to say that quite often the borrower's paper equity position never paid for an acre of land or concrete or scaffolding or a worker's wage at the end of the week.  The safety zone of borrower equity usually existed only on paper.  The result is that the borrower was typically not the first to lose.  In the event of a crash, the banks stood to take 100% of the losses and that's what happened. </blockquote> <p>Is that a fair reflection of the type of banking practice that you managed for AIB in your senior role?</p></speech>

The bank regarded some proportion of the inherent value in that as equity, and had a position of security over it.  So from a security viewpoint it's true to say that we would have relied on many occasions on non-cash assets.  That is true.  But in giving the loan, the proposition would be much more about what assets, essentially, were going to be created with that loan, and what they were going to sell for, and the bank would have, essentially, part of the loan agreement would be, that the proceeds of the sale, for example, of each residential development would come to the bank. So it's true to say that when things happened in the way they did, which is that office developments stopped selling, houses stopped selling, then the source of repayment for the banks, cash, that also stopped.  Then the difficulty arose because the security that we held, which in many cases was equity, also began to devalue very quickly.  So I think it's true to say that in the way things ultimately developed, we were left frequently where it wasn't cash that we had recourse to, but they were assets that were of much less value.  But in the normal run, essentially if the assets that were produced off the back of that loan were sold, the bank would have collected the cash on those, all the time.</p></speech>

I grew up in a council estate, my parents bought their home through a tenant purchase scheme, so I don't come with any big property background, but what I hear him saying here, very simply, is, there is an issue of acceleration and deceleration in the property market, and there's an issue of inflation and deflation in the property market.</p><p>And what was happening is that inflation was running so quick in the property market and development was at a very accelerated level, so it wasn't the case that a housing development was completed and now sold.  It's that there was a notional value on property that was interpreted right all the way through the process.  So, a developer could develop something in a part of Cork or a part of Dublin and, even though it's now not completed - and we've seen this with housing developments as well as they were going through phases - new values were given to them.  So, even before the development is completed, a valuation would be placed upon it even though it's now not even out in the market - there's no rents coming in or anything else - and that equity - notional equity, albeit - was now being used as leverage against another loan.</p></speech>

I think that is fair.  The only comment I'd make on that is that it wouldn't be the full value, that it would be a discounted value of it.  So, in the instance that you describe where a development was near completion, a value would attach to that, but not the full value.  It would be discounted, but, yes, that would be ... have been considered as equity.</p></speech>

I fully acknowledge ... I mean, as I've said, where ... in a way, the model worked so long as developers were able to sell their assets and the produce of the work that they were doing.  We didn't require them to sell 100%, but we required them to be able to generate a measure of cashflow from those assets.  The wheels came off when that was not possible because all economic activity got suspended some time in 2009, and the wheels came off at that point.  I think it goes too far to suggest that we were allowing people just to build paper on paper, but I think we were doing that in some measure, yes.</p></speech>

What I'm trying to convey here is, when times are good, a banker's instinct is to put money aside.  The rules were specifically designed to disallow you from putting money aside, so we always felt that, look, this isn't a clever formula.  And, with respect to the specifics, we would have been obviously of a much stronger mind to have a greater quantum aside in late '07, in '08, than would have been the case in '04, '05 and '06.</p></speech>

I made it ... I hope that I've made it clear that, you know, I am party to something that went very horribly wrong, and it's not a pleasant feeling, let me say, and I'm very conscious of the implications of that.  But, you know, it is a misjudgment, and it's all of that, but no more than that.  I mean, there was at no point, I can say, at any time in my period as MD had I any real concern that the bank was operating in a manner that could be described as reckless.  That's poor judgment, but I never had such a concern; I never went to sleep with any anxiety that I was doing the wrong thing for the bank in the medium to long term and, you know, I acknowledge the error of that and I acknowledge the consequences of it, but it's that and it's no more than that, I think, expressed in those terms.</p></speech>

It is not sufficient to put them on silent mode; they need to be switched off.  The meeting is being televised live today and we do not want to interfere with the broadcast.  We have received apologies from Deputies John Halligan, Joe O'Reilly and Se&aacute;n Kyne and Senators Catherine Noone and Kathryn Reilly.</p> <p>  I welcome to the meeting the Minister of State with special responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Dara Murphy.  He is a former member of this committee and we are familiar with each other.  He will brief the committee on the draft 2015 national reform programme.  The Government is currently consulting with the Oireachtas on the draft in advance of its submission to the European Commission in Brussels.</p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, the preparation of the national reform programme is a key part for each member state in its annual European Semester process, which began in recent years.  Today's meeting is welcome in the context of the European Semester as part of the involving engagement with the Oireachtas to ensure that the necessary democratic accountability, legitimacy and oversight all are part and parcel of the process.  The Minister of State will also give us a brief update on the outcome of the General Affairs Council meeting that was held last week.</p> <p>  When the Minister of State concludes, we will have time for questions.  Following a brief suspension, the second part of the meeting will be with members of the Committee of the Regions.  I am delighted to welcome to the Gallery some of the committee's guests and contributors to the second part of the meeting but, first, we will hear from the Minister of State.</p></speech>

It is a great pleasure to be back at my former committee.  I acknowledge the presence of members of the Committee of the Regions who are here and also my colleagues from the Oireachtas.  I will give a brief report on the General Affairs Council, but the rest of the presentation is not particularly brief.  It is substantive and I ask for the Chairman's indulgence in that regard.  I am more than happy to take questions.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for the opportunity to be here and to hear the members' views and questions on Ireland's draft national reform programme, NRP, which has been circulated.  As the committee will be aware, the preparation and submission of an NRP is an important element in the European Semester process.  Listening to the views of fellow parliamentarians is rightly acknowledged as an important part of the process, and is something that I strongly support.  Before considering the contents of the NRP, I will refer briefly to the context in which it is being prepared.</p> <p>  Members of the committee will be familiar with the semester process and at our last engagement at the start of March I outlined some of the recent developments.  It is worth noting that the March European Council concluded the first phase of European Semester 2015 by providing guidance to member states for submission in mid-April of their stability programme updates and national reform programmes.  Based on preparatory work in the Council, the political emphasis now in place reinforces the economic priorities set by the new Commission in its first annual growth survey, which was produced last November.  This year's process will therefore be advanced on the basis of three main pillars: a boost to investment; a renewed commitment to both national and EU-level structural reforms; and the pursuit of fiscal responsibility.  The Council invited member states to reflect these priorities in their forthcoming national reform programmes and stability or convergence programmes, depending on which they are in.</p> <p>  At the end of February, the Commission presented a comprehensive assessment for each member state, under the 2015 cycle of the European Semester.  This is a procedural improvement introduced for this year's process that is designed to support stronger national-level engagement with the Commission's assessment, including by key stakeholders and national parliaments.</p> <p>  Draft proposals for the next round of country specific recommendations, CSRs, are produced by the Commission in May, for adoption subject to amendment by the Council.  In Ireland's case, the assessment in the new country report is a broadly positive one, reflecting the strength of the economic recovery under way and supporting, in turn, a gradual unwinding of the deep imbalances developed during the crisis period.</p> <p>  The semester process embraces Europe 2020, the EU's ten-year plan, adopted in 2010, based around five headline EU targets in the areas of employment, innovation, climate and energy, education and social inclusion.  Under Europe 2020, each member state adopts national targets in these five areas and progress is monitored within the framework of the European Semester and reported on annually by member states in their NRPs.  The Commission's consideration of the future development of the Europe 2020 strategy will be informed by the public consultation to which this committee made a contribution in November, as reviewed in the Seanad, which I attended, in March.</p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, last year was the first occasion on which Ireland was a full participant in the European Semester process upon exiting our programme and we received seven CSRs in 2014.  Country specific recommendations are tailored, concrete recommendations for reforms that are considered in the relevant Council formations - on what is called a comply or explain basis - and finally endorsed by the European Council meeting at the end of June.  Ireland's CSRs covered public finances, health care spending, active labour market policies, social inclusion, access to finance, non-performing loans in the financial sector and legal services.  The draft NRP reports formally on progress in implementing them.</p> <p>  I am pleased to report that progress is broadly on track and consistent with policy directions already firmly established at national level.</p><p>The draft NRP also takes stock of progress towards our Europe 2020 targets in the areas of employment; research and development; climate change and energy; education; and social inclusion.  While the NRP is a reasonably comprehensive text, it is expected to be concise and as such it is not possible to include every detail in any policy area or elaborate the full extent of Government action across each issue.  However, it provides a good picture of the range and scale of reforms being advanced by the Government to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery strengthens and remains fully sustainable.   In this regard, there is strong synergy between the approaches being adopted in Ireland and at European level.  The semester is part of the strengthened arrangements for policy co-ordination in the wake of the economic crisis.  It reflects the fact that mismanagement of one economy in an economic and monetary union can have negative implications for the economies of other member states.  We have, therefore, expressed strong support for the semester process and for the oversight it provides.   </p><p> I will now provide Members with an overview of the draft document, following which I will be happy to take their questions.  At its outset, the NRP will provide an overview of our macroeconomic position.  This will be further updated and aligned with the Department of Finance&rsquo;s latest macroeconomic forecasts when the stability programme update is finalised and published next week.  As the committee will be aware, our economic performance over the past year has been strong and growth is expected to continue into 2015 and beyond.</p><p> The NRP will also provide an update on measures being taken by the Government in respect of each of the seven country specific recommendations.  The first of these recommendations pertains to our public finances.  Considerable progress has been made in recent years, and the outlook for the period ahead is positive, as will be set out in detail in our stability programme update.  Key reform measures set out in the NRP include the following: placing multi-annual expenditure ceilings on a statutory basis; establishing an Irish Fiscal Advisory Council; broadening the tax base, including through introduction of annual property tax, abolition or curtailment of tax reliefs and increases in minimum tax rates for high earners; and devising a roadmap for Ireland&rsquo;s tax competitiveness, which was launched in budget 2015 and sets out a medium-term strategy for Ireland&rsquo;s corporation tax policy.  </p><p>  The second recommendation pertains to reform of the health care sector.  A significant programme of reform is being advanced in this area.  The Government&rsquo;s future health strategy, which was published in 2012, is driving reforms across four strands, namely, health and well being, structural reform, services reform and financial reform.  The introduction of generic substitution and reference pricing delivered &euro;50 million in savings in 2014, with a further &euro;25 million expected to be saved in 2015.  By the end of 2014 the penetration of generic drugs had reached 68% by volume, compared to a target of 60%.  The use of individual health identifiers is another important reform which will commence with the introduction of free GP care to children under the age of six years in June 2015.  As the committee will be aware, priorities for continuing health reform were published by the Minister for Health in January of this year.  </p><p> Our third recommendation pertains to labour market activation, including long-term unemployment, the youth guarantee and reform of further education and training.  This has been a key focus for Government since taking up office, with the twin strategies of the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work supporting job creation and helping those on the live register to return to work.  This is another area for which a detailed whole-of-government approach has delivered strong results and it is now reasonable to look forward to a return to full employment in the economy, something that would have been inconceivable a few years ago.  The Action Plan for Jobs for 2015 sets a target of 2.1 million people in employment by 2018, which is two years ahead of the original schedule.  There is a particular focus under the action plan on regional development and measures to support the domestic economy in sectors including construction, retail, tourism and hospitality and agriculture and food. The updated Pathways to Work programme for 2015, which was published in October 2014, contains a suite of enhanced reforms with special focus on long-term and youth unemployment.  For example, this year will see the roll-out of a new employment service model called JobPath which will support the long-term unemployed in their efforts to access today&rsquo;s labour market.  We all know how difficult this can be, particularly for those who have spent a number of years out of work.  The Government is determined to ensure that they have the supports they need to access work and to reach their full potential.  Approximately 57,000 education and training places are reserved for the long-term unemployed in 2015, subject to demand.   A minimum of 16,000 places for the long-term unemployed are being created in public employment programmes, including the extension of the highly successful JobsPlus initiative.</p><p> Our fourth recommendation pertains to low work intensity households and poverty.  It is important to note that Pathways to Work is supporting jobless households access the labour market.  This recommendation reflects an ongoing discussion between Ireland and the Commission aimed at ensuring that, in addressing this issue, we are working on the basis of sound and reliable data.  There are different ways to measure low work intensity and jobless households, and if we are to be confident that our policy responses are right for Ireland, we need to ensure that the correct measures are adopted.  I refer the committee to the details set out in the NRP on this subject.  The Government is firmly committed to supporting people, including those with family responsibilities, into work, to ensure that work pays and to avoid creating poverty traps that hold people back.  We have been introducing reforms to the one-parent family payment on an incremental basis, which aim at strengthening links between lone parents, who are a key cohort in the jobless household population, and the labour market.  Some 30,000 recipients of the payment with children over the age of seven years will transition from the payment in 2015.  Tailored child care schemes, including for after school care, have been introduced to support this process.  More widely, some &euro;260 million is being invested annually by the Government in child care support programmes reaching more than 100,000 children each year and an interdepartmental group has been established to explore ways of ensuring that current and future investments deliver more affordable, accessible and high quality early years and school age care and education.  The group is due to present a range of options to the Government by June 2015. </p><p> Our fifth recommendation pertains to SME financing and debt.  The Government has taken numerous steps to ensure that SMEs, which play an important role in our economy, can access the finance that they need to grow and thrive.  Among the key policy initiatives developed in 2014, which contributed to the evolution of a more robust and effective institutional architecture for the financing of SMEs, were the establishment of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, which is providing up to &euro;800 million of funds; the development of an innovative SME State support online tool to provide an entrepreneur with a list of the possible Government business supports; amendment of the Credit Guarantee Act 2012 and introduction of a new more flexible credit guarantee scheme; the announcement by the Minister for Finance of the commencement of work on an integrated export finance strategy in 2015; a review of Microfinance Fund Ireland; participation by Permanent TSB in the credit review process; and the transition of the NPRF into the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund.</p><p>Our sixth recommendation relates to bank performance against mortgage arrears restructuring targets and SME debt.  Tackling mortgage arrears is a priority for Government and, as the committee will be aware, the Government will shortly bring forward a range of further actions in this regard.  The NRP sets out some of the work that has already been undertaken and the progress that has been made. <br/><br/>At the end of 2014, the number of private dwelling home mortgage accounts classified as restructured by the banks stood at 114,674 - an improvement of 29% over the 2013 figures.  Progress has continued in 2015.<br/><br/>The Central Bank set further mortgage arrears resolution targets for quarter three and quarter four of 2014, and has reported that the banks have continued to meet or exceed the targets set for them.  It has also confirmed that the banks have reported that they have met their required targets on SME loans arrears to date. NAMA, which addresses distressed real-estate exposures, continues to outperform targets and is well ahead of schedule, having redeemed &euro;17.6 billion of NAMA senior bonds, which exceeds its target of 50%. <br/><br/>Our seventh recommendation relates to the Legal Services Regulation Bill and court data collection.  As the committee will be aware, debate on the Legal Services Regulation Bill has resumed, and it remains the Government&rsquo;s aim to complete its passage so as to allow the legal services regulatory authority come into operation in mid-2015.  Yesterday I took the first part of Report Stage, which was later completed by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  The Bill is now going to the Seanad.  Therefore, it is making progress.  The courts caseload data committee is overseeing an extensive range of work on enhancing computerised case support systems, and this is set out in the NRP. <br/><br/>I turn now to the national targets under the Europe 2020 strategy.  These targets are horizontal and cross-cutting - for example, across employment and poverty reduction strategies. Our target is to raise to between 69% and 71% the employment rate for women and men aged 20 to 64, including through greater participation of young people, older workers and low-skilled workers and the better integration of legal migrants, and to review the target level of ambition in 2014 in the context of a proposed mid-term review of the Europe 2020 strategy.  The mid-term review is currently ongoing.  For 2014, the employment rate for women and men aged 20-64 was 67%, a welcome increase of three percentage points from 2012.  This increase demonstrates the continuing improvement in the labour market after a fall from a high of 74% in the employment rate in 2007 to 71% in 2008 and less than 64% in 2012, which was the worst year for unemployment in the State.  For us to reach the 2020 target, the employment rate will have to increase by 0.5 percentage points each year.  We see this as feasible, provided the recent recovery is maintained into the medium term.  As I have already mentioned, the Government is continuing to tackle unemployment and to support employment through the twin strategies of the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work.<br/><br/>Our target in the area of research and development is to raise combined public and private investment levels in this sector to 2.5% of GNP.  We have significantly increased our investment in research and development in the past decade and more, while also introducing a range of measures to improve commercialisation of research and build strong links between the higher education sector and enterprise.  In 2013 it is estimated that research and development intensity in Ireland was at 1.94% of GNP.  As a result, Ireland has built a strong science base and is in the world&rsquo;s top 20 countries for scientific output.  This investment in the science base has had a positive impact on our industrial development.  We are now in the process of developing a new strategy for science, technology and innovation, which is due for completion this summer.<br/><br/>The target for climate change and energy is to reduce emissions in the non-traded sector by 20% compared to 2005 levels, to increase the share of renewables in final energy consumption to 16%, and to move towards a 20% increase in energy efficiency.<b></b>On climate change, under the 2009 EU effort-sharing decision, which applies to greenhouse gas emissions, GHG, outside the scope of the EU emissions trading scheme, Ireland must limit the growth of emissions to 20% below 2005 levels over the period 2013 to 2020.  This emission reduction target under EU law is ambitious and very challenging from an Irish perspective, particularly given the large size of our agriculture sector and the scale of emissions associated with it.  Our target for the period to 2020 consists of a series of declining annual targets, and compliance must be demonstrated with each annual target in turn.  The targets for the years 2013 to 2016 are within reach, but beyond that point deficits will arise.  The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill 2015 is currently before the Houses, with enactment expected during the course of 2015.<br/><br/>On energy, the overarching objective of the Government's policy is to ensure secure and sustainable supplies of competitively priced energy to all consumers.  The 2009 EU renewable energy directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020.  In order to meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources, with 10% for transport and 12% for heat.  In 2013, 7.8% of Ireland&rsquo;s overall energy requirement was met by renewable energy.  As a percentage of the targets for each of the three sectors, this equates to 20.9% of electricity demand, and 4.9% and 5.7% respectively of transport and heat power needs, being met by renewable energy in 2013.<br/><br/>The national energy efficiency action plan, NEEAP, which is the overarching policy framework for energy efficiency in Ireland, contains Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to a 20% energy savings target across the economy by 2020 in pursuit of EU obligations.  Recognising that Government must lead by example, we are committed to achieving a 33% reduction in public sector energy use by 2020.  Ireland has already achieved 39% of our national target, and progress is also steady with respect to the 33% reduction in public sector energy use.<br/><br/>Targets in the area of education aim to address early school leaving and boost the number of people with third level qualifications.  Specifically, they are to reduce the percentage of 18 to 24 year olds with at most lower secondary education and not in further education and training to 8%, and to increase the share of 30 to 34 year olds who have completed tertiary or equivalent education to at least 60%.  The percentage of early school leavers in Ireland fell from 11.4% in 2010 to 8.4% by the end of 2013.  This represents positive progress towards achievement of our 8% target.</p><p>The latest EU data show that Ireland's tertiary attainment for 30-34 year olds was 52.6% in 2012.  Since 2009, Ireland has the highest rate for this indicator of all 28 member states.  In the tertiary attainment rate for 25-34 year olds indicator presented by the OECD, Ireland ranks first in the European Union and fourth in the OECD.</p><p> On poverty our interim target is the reduce the number experiencing consistent poverty to 4% by 2016 and the target is to reduce it to 2% or less by 2020 from the 2010 baseline rate of 6.3%.  Ireland's contribution to the Europe 2020 poverty target is to reduced by a minimum of 200,000 people the number in the population who are either in consistent poverty, at risk-of poverty or basic deprivation.</p><p> Following a review in 2012, the Government agreed a revised and enhanced national social target for poverty reduction, which is to reduce consistent poverty to 4% by 2016 and to 2% or less by 2020.  As I have said the latest measure of consistent poverty is 8.2% in 2013.  In recognition of the higher risks and life-long consequences of child poverty, a new child-specific social target was set in the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014-2020, which is to lift 70,000 children out of consistent poverty by 2020</p><p> The General Affairs Council, GAC, took place in Luxembourg this week.  The meeting was originally to focus on inter-institutional relations, however in light of the tragic events at the weekend, the Ministers also discussed the migration crisis in the Mediterranean.  As we speak the Taoiseach is attending an emergency summit of EU leaders at the European Council to deal with the migrant crisis in the Mediterranean.  As a follow-up to Monday's joint meeting of Foreign and Justice Ministers, the General Affairs Council discussed what EU members states could do to alleviate the crisis in migration and the situation in the Mediterranean.</p><p> Ministers expressed their solidarity with the victims and the countries concerned and agreed that there was an urgent need to step up common EU action to respond to the situation.  The discussion focused on human trafficking, smuggling, border surveillance and solidarity.  The need to address the root causes of displacement and forced migration was also discussed in detail.  There was broad support for the ten point action plan proposed by the Commission and which is being discussed by the European Council today.</p><p> The General Affairs Council had a discussion on the proposal to revise the 2003 Inter-Institutional Agreement on Better Law Making to take account of post-Treaty of Lisbon realities.  There was consensus that in the forthcoming negotiations of the Inter-Institutional Agreement, the General Affairs Council should prioritise better regulation, programming and delegated Acts.</p><p> In my intervention I welcomed the high priority the Commission has afforded the better regulation agenda and highlighted some areas where further progress could be made.  I also highlighted the role of national parliaments in contributing to the good functioning of the European Union.  Over lunch there was a discussion on the issue of counter-terrorism and measures to prevent radicalisation and to safeguard values.  </p><p> The General Affairs Council marked the ten year anniversary of the signing of the accession treaties with Bulgaria and Romania.  Ministers also adopted Council conclusions on the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, expressing grave concern about the deteriorating situation there.</p><p> As the committee will appreciate the draft national reform programmes covers considerable ground across all Departments.  In my lengthy contribution I have tried to capture some of the key elements, however it has not been possible to cover every detail.</p><p> I am more than happy to take questions from members.  I am now at the disposal of the Chairman.</p></speech>

It was a lengthy contribution but it was necessary because I think it is important to go through the detail of what was being proposed at the General Affairs Council.  I have a number of questions.</p> <p>  I have a question on the draft national reform programme.  As the Minister of State states the recommendations are tailored specifically to each individual country.  We have to comply with what is recommended or explain the reason we are not complying with the recommendations.  One of the country specific recommendations CSR 1, is the recommendation on the budget, that in order to support fiscal consolidation, consideration should be given to raising revenues through broadening the tax base.  This recommendation was made last year.  The Minister of State outlined what Ireland has done to comply with this recommendation.  We have brought in the property tax, we have abolished some tax credits and we have brought in a carbon tax.  However, all of these measures were done in advance of this recommendation.  Does the Minister of State think that will be sufficient to meet the requirements for an explanation, bearing in mind that the CSR recommendations would have been written post the introduction of those taxes and post the abolition of those credits?</p> <p>  The Minister of State may have been a member of the committee at the stage we did a report on Europe 2020, and how we would achieve the targets set in that strategy.  We concluded that the strategy would be likely to fail in the delivery of its targets if it remained a top-down and a non-exclusive process.  We thought it would be necessary to ensure there would be a partnership approach to the targets.  Is the Minister of State satisfied that there is sufficient buy-in and engagement at local and regional levels with the relevant organisations to make sure we achieve the targets set out in the 2020 strategy?</p> <p>  At our committee meeting we had raised the question of Macedonia and the Minister of State's response to that was comprehensive.  We were glad to see that he raised the issue at the General Affairs Council.  I thank the Minister for doing so and we very much appreciate it.</p> <p>  This committee is concerned about the crisis in regard to migration and the situation in the Mediterranean.  We discussed among ourselves the push-backs at the Bulgarian border.  It is getting increasingly tense with potential migrants being harried and harassed at the border.  This is a very important issue and we will discuss it again at our meeting next week to which we have invited the Italian and Maltese ambassadors and the UN special representative for global migration, Mr. Peter Sutherland.  We hope they will give us an update on the situation in order to see what we as a national Parliament can do to add our voices to the concerns about the unfolding humanitarian crisis.</p> <p>  Senator Colm Burke is next.</p></speech>

I focus on health care and my first questions relates to generic drugs substitution, which has been in place for a short time.  I have seen three or four sets of figures that have been bandied around.  I am not at all convinced that we have done enough.  A saving of &euro;50 million last year and &euro;25 million this year has been made by substituting generic for branded drugs.  The penetration rate of generic drugs has reached 68% by volume of drugs.  A saving of &euro;75 million over a two year period does not sound to me as if a significant amount of work has been done on this issue.  I wonder if we have done enough in this respect.  Some 10% of drugs used in this country are generic drugs whereas the average in the United Kingdom is 80% generic drugs.  I am not saying we should reach the 80% target for use of generic drugs.  Has there been real reform, and if so, why have the savings not been greater?  Savings of &euro;75 million over two years seems very low in real terms.</p><p>The question is about reform, timeframe and savings.  I am not convinced.  The cost of pharmaceuticals within the health care sector went from &euro;570 million to over &euro;2 billion in a seven-year period.  With the introduction of generic drugs, we are talking about a saving of only &euro;75 million in two years.  I am worried about that.  </p><p> The second issue I want to raise is the crisis in the Mediterranean.  This has been very serious issue for the last two years but we had not really taken any notice of it until four to six weeks ago.  I am approaching it from a totally different point of view.  While we need to take emergency action to deal with the problem, to a large extent, Europe and America have been the contributors to that problem.  The arms and ammunition industry across Europe and the US has contributed to creating conflicts in a lot of places.  When we overthrew Gaddafi in Libya, there was a huge surplus of arms which went to all sorts of groups and we are now paying the price.  When thinking about policy in the short-term, we should be looking at the long-term consequences.  We are now feeling the long-term consequences of some of the decisions that were taken five, eight or ten years ago and are having to pick up the pieces.  Is this issue of countries selling arms and ammunition into developing countries and the Middle East on the agenda in Europe?  If so, what do we intend doing about it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-23a.3266" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1012" speakername="Derek Keating" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015042300002#F00200"><p>I join with the Chairman and members in welcoming the Minister of State and his officials.  I have two questions.  One concerns employment under Europe 2020, which the Minister of State has, however, covered particularly well.  The other concerns child poverty.  We had aimed to lift 70,000 children out of poverty in Ireland by 2020.  There has been an increase in the number, which is over 100,000.  Does the Minister of State have any specific measures that would help to solve that growing problem and succeed where we have not done so before?  How confident would he be about those measures?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-23a.3267" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015042300002#F00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State.  That was a long and detailed speech, so I will try to keep my contribution fairly short.  The Minister of State said that some 30,000 recipients of the one-parent family payment with children over the age of seven years will transition from the payment in 2015 and that tailored child care schemes, including after-school care, have been introduced to support this process.  What the Minister of State was referring to was 30,000 people losing their payment.  The big argument that many lone parents are making to us, as politicians, is that the promised child care schemes are not there and the ones that are there are too costly.  We are forcing people into employment without putting the supports in place.  I think the T&aacute;naiste said that child care would be a key element of these changes, but the spaces are not there.  How is the Minister of State going to square that circle?  It sounds positive that people are moving on with their lives, and I have not met any lone parent who does not want to get into employment.  However, there are difficulties and barriers there.  All the groups advocating on behalf of lone parents are saying that the child care spaces are not there and that is a big problem.  We need to get our act together on this.</p> <p>  As regards the training schemes, the Minister of State said that 57,000 education and training places are reserved for the long-term unemployed in 2015, subject to demand.  What does "subject to demand" mean?  Does it mean that if people do not want to go on these schemes, they do not have to?  That is not what I am being told.  According to the Minister of State, a minimum of 16,000 places for long-term unemployed are being created in public employment programmes, including through the highly successful JobsPlus initiative.  I was recently talking to a group of workers who were notified that they had to go on one of these schemes.  There was one person under the age of 40 in the room.  Many of them had skills - one was a tiler while another was a carpenter - and many of them had worked in the construction industry but for whatever reasons they have not been able to get back in to employment, even part-time.  I would imagine that we need to be gearing a lot of those schemes towards young people.  I do not know what training value those workers are going to get on this course.  Some of it will be sweeping roads, cleaning up grass verges and so on, even though the argument was that they would be increasing their skill level.  They were annoyed that they were being forced down this route.  They certainly all want to get back into employment and want to upskill.  What was being offered was clearly not enough.</p> <p>  Although we are told almost on a daily basis that we have regained our economic sovereignty and so on, Ministers are replying to questions by saying that EU rules will dictate our budget for a long time to come and that this happens through the semester.  Our next budget will have to be against the backdrop of the so-called expenditure benchmark.  I understand the Government is seeking greater flexibility in that regard but it seems like other countries within Europe are flagrantly disregarding the rules at the moment.  We are coming in on the back of that and looking for greater flexibility, saying that it is arbitrary, even though we agreed to it.</p> <p>  The difficulty is that we are talking about balancing books with no understanding of the socio-economic cost of that so-called balancing.  The Minister of State is talking in terms of jobs and so on.  Ireland is second only to the US in terms of numbers in low-paid employment in the OECD.  We are the highest in Europe.  We may be talking about creating full employment, but at what cost?  We have had the recent experience of Dunnes Stores as regards zero-hour contracts and so on.  By all means, we need full employment and we all support that but I am concerned about the quality of the jobs we are creating.</p> <p>  Emigration is also a key issue.  Recently, just under 4,000 jobs came on offer in Canada and the visas were gone within 12 minutes.  Our young people are bright and intelligent with plenty of skills.  Many of them are leaving jobs and emigrating because they do not have any hope.  Collectively, it is part of our job to instil hope and show that there are alternatives.  The biggest thing we need to do in Europe is instil in those in power the understanding that there are alternatives to the austerity we have faced up to now.  Stimulus is the way forward and that is the big debate we need to bring to the table in Europe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-23a.3268" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015042300002#G00100"><p>I tried to practise bilocation not very successfully for the last hour or so.  I apologise for my absence for the Minister's speech, but I have read it.  In the country-specific areas applicable to this country, how do we compare with other European countries and how well are all other European countries complying with the objectives laid down initially, which I agree with and with which we all must comply?  Are all European countries, large and small, fully complying with the general thrust of what we are doing in this country?  We have had to do it because if one does not have the resources to expend, one must cut one's cloth according to one's measure.</p><p>Second, the CSRs cover public finances, health care spending, active labour market policies, social inclusion, access to finance, non-performing loans and so forth.  In the area of health care, how do we compare with our colleagues across Europe in spending on health care, that is, the ratio of spending <i>per capita</i>in this country compared with the best in Europe, as well as the efficiency with which we and they can deliver services?  I am conscious that we all have a particular role to play across Europe in addressing the issues that have beset Europe in the past number of years.  In view of the sacrifices the people in this country have made and the sacrifices politicians had to make to take very unsavoury decisions, I would like to think that everybody was shouldering responsibility to the same extent.</p><p>The semester process is better than its predecessor in that it provides for regular review of the targets.  Previously, there were no reviews of the targets and by the end of the ten year period we were in a situation where no target had been met and there was insufficient or partial monitoring.  Breaches in economic performance were blatant everywhere but nobody knew about it until it was too late.  Clearly, this country is adhering to its programme and is delivering to the best of its ability in difficult circumstances.  How do we compare with all of our colleagues in the European Union, particularly in the eurozone?  The danger in a situation such as this is that those countries that were seriously in error or deficient in their performance initially might get all or most of the attention, while others that could do with a little attention might not receive the same regulatory experience.</p><p>The Pathways to Work scheme has been discussed.  The one-parent family payment has arisen repeatedly.  Both parties in the Government have been criticised about it on the basis that it was somewhat uncaring.  I do not believe it was.  There is provision to ensure that no loss of income should take place for the individual families.  That must apply and if it does not, somebody is not doing the job the way it was intended to be done.  In my experience, there is no need to encourage lone parents to do anything.  They will do it themselves.  That is the nature of the individual.  They want to do the best they can in their circumstances.  They will go to work as a first option, as opposed to a last option.  Lest some European bureaucrat gets the impression that people here are living a cosy lifestyle and that we only do things at their behest and as a last resort, that is not so.  In fact, in my time in public life, and I have been in public life for a year or two at this stage, I can assure the Minister that the efforts of lone parents to seek employment are exemplary, without exception, even though they are in very difficult circumstances.  What is the comparison across Europe?  What is determined in one country might not apply in another.</p><p>I wish to refer to two further points.  The first is climate change, the extent to which we must comply with less dependency on fossil fuels, the degree to which we can achieve our targets and the extent to which all other countries throughout Europe are achieving targets as well and making the same sacrifices that we will have to make.  We must ensure somebody does not take advantage of the situation in the European Union and say, for example, that the food sector in Ireland is a carbon rich area that puts a high level of responsibility on the economy here to produce alternatives.  It is correct that it does.  However, it should be possible to achieve the standards required across Europe without doing damage to our economy or to the other economies in Europe.</p><p>The last issue is bank performance in respect of mortgage arrears, restructuring targets and SME debt.  Every Member of the House, including the Minister, has struggled with this problem for the past six or seven years.  In general, the people have shouldered their responsibilities admirably.  There will always be a minority of people who will see an opportunity to make a quick buck and who will suggest that if enough people opt out they will not have to pay at all.  I hold no brief for those people.  However, there is a body of people who have been very responsible.  They found themselves in difficult circumstances six to eight years ago, which they had great difficulty working out.  Some of it was due to the collapse in the housing market, some was due to the collapse of business, some was the result of the collapse of their health and some was the result of unemployment.  However, they have faithfully managed to make a payment throughout the entire period, be it from their social welfare or whatever.  They continue to pay to this day.</p><p>It is very difficult to accept the attitude of some financial institutions.  They say the scene has changed, they are now over the difficulties and it is time to go back to traditional systems and methods.  My response is, &quot;not so fast&quot;.  The lending institutions also had a role in, and responsibility for, what happened to this country.  It was not a small role or responsibility.  It is fine for people to say we must return to the way we were, clean up our act and get everything in order, but we are already doing that.  It is happening.  However, there must be a graduated system whereby those people who made the effort are recognised for making that effort.  That must happen in this country and throughout Europe.  Our European colleagues must recognise the sacrifices that many people, families and businesses in this country have made over the past number of years.  Doing so would be significantly to the advantage of the European project, and obviously to us as members of the European Union.</p></speech>

For example, there are countless situations where a person who has a 25 year loan might find themselves reaching 70 years of age before the end of the 25 years.  The lending institutions saw fit to lend to that extent at the time of the institution of the mortgage, but they now see things in a different light.  They say, "By the way, you will be 72 or 73 before this is repaid".  "So what?", is the correct reply to that.  If it was possible to lend the money in the first place, regardless of the criteria by which it was loaned, equally it should be possible to restructure, without interest, in such a way as to accommodate the unfortunate person who is burdened with the responsibility of that loan.</p> <p>  I apologise for taking so much time, but I will not intervene again.</p></speech>

To start with the question on broadening the tax base, we welcome the fact that the Commission and the Council have acknowledged that Ireland has made significant progress in this regard.  I will not go through the property tax and the other ways in which we have broadened it to date.  Development in the future will be in the space of getting more people back to work and increasing income tax revenues in that way and increasing spending tax revenue through VAT as we see domestic demand and activity growing in the economy.  That is the next phase on which we will focus.</p><p>The Europe 2020 strategies are being reviewed at present.  With the exception of the education sector, many of the targets were not achieved, so it remains to be seen what the next set of proposals will be, but the Deputy is spot on: there will have to be a broad engagement across all sectors of Irish life.  This cuts across many of the questions.  Whether it is in Europe 2020 or the country-specific targets, the people who benefit most from achieving the targets in both areas are the Irish people themselves.  That is why we will be looking to get strong engagement with respect to all of them.</p><p> I was very glad to bring to the General Affairs Council the issue of - it was not referred to as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as it must be referred to in the European Council-----</p></speech>

It is a very important part of my job to bring to the General Affairs Council the observations and deliberations of this committee, so I will continue to ensure that process works.  There was a strong intervention on Monday evening from Bulgaria.  Many countries from the southern Mediterranean are deeply affected and concerned for the poor individuals involved, who continue to be trafficked.  There was broad consensus on the initial deliberations of the Commission, but that is being discussed as we speak by the Prime Ministers.</p><p>There has been reform with respect to pharmaceutical spending.  Nobody is suggesting that reform has been completed.  That is the nature of reform.  The State continues to seek further savings from the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association and we must also acknowledge that the process has resulted in the lowering of prices for branded drugs and will have to deliver further savings.</p><p><font color="#FF0000"> </font>In response to Deputy Keating, it is vital to support people getting back into work and child care is key to this.  Some 100,000 children are supported in the State each year.  There is the community child care subvention and the early childhood care and education scheme.  In budget 2015, the Government increased expenditure on children by &euro;96 million, including increased child benefit payment and a new payment of &euro;30 per child per week for people returning to work.  We are fully aware that we are coming from a very difficult few years and work must continue in that respect.</p><p>To some extent, Deputy Durkan gave my answer to Deputy Crowe's questions about the objective that people would not be out of pocket by virtue of the changes.  Deputy Crowe also asked about the demand level.  Subject to demand, as I referenced in my note, the places are reserved in the first instance for the long-term unemployed.  Fortunately, as is the case with all categories of the unemployed, the number of long-term unemployed is decreasing and there are also other options available.  Places available on the courses may not be taken up, so it is possible that places available may exceed demand.  We would have to see how that evolves.</p><p>In respect of the country-specific recommendations and how we compare, about which Deputy Durkan asked, on the country-specific report on budget 2015, Ireland was one of only five countries that were fully compliant with the Stability and Growth Pact.  The compliance of other countries is very mixed, but we strongly support the process.  When there are discussions about rules and how compliant we are, it is important to stress that it is for the Irish people that we are complying with these measures, which are delivering strong job creation.  The Deputy asked how we compare generally.  After some very difficult years, we have the fastest growing economy in the European Union for this year, with falling unemployment projected for next year and perhaps even for the year after.  This compliance with these recommendations for countries is in the best interests of the Irish people.  That includes the climate change targets, which the Deputy also mentioned.  Just two or three months ago the European targets for the deliberations, which will take place in Paris, were decided by the European Council.  The specific national elements of that have not been agreed, but they are under active discussion as we speak.</p><p>I strongly support the Deputy's comments about the continued role the banks will have to play in ensuring that solutions are found for people.  The other committee of which I was a member before becoming a Minister of State was the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  The engagement of that committee with the banks has been productive in the past and was very productive yesterday.  I congratulate the Chairman, Deputy Liam Twomey, and his committee on that engagement.  All of us who are involved as politicians are aware that, notwithstanding the very positive figures and targets that have been met for some people in banking distress, there are still many people experiencing great difficulty.  We must all must raise at any opportunity the important point that it is never too late for people who are in difficulty with lending institutions to engage, to talk to their lenders and to engage with some of the supports we have.  A significant number of repossessions that take place by court order are a consequence of people not engaging.</p><p>The Chairman's questions were very detailed and I am sure that my answers to some of them were a bit brief, but I am aware of the time.  I thank the committee for inviting me to this meeting.</p></speech>

As the Deputy will know, the broader issue underlying the migration we are now seeing is the significant state failings in countries like Syria and Libya.  They are the consequence of many factors, over many years, which have now reached the point of significant conflict.  I am not going to comment on the broader foreign policy actions taken by other countries, which is a subjective perspective that people would have.  At my level, as Minister of State with special responsibility for European affairs and through attending the Foreign Affairs Council, we are aware there is a human crisis unfolding in the Mediterranean.  We must support and show solidarity with the countries of the southern Mediterranean, in particular, which are trying to help and support people who are being trafficked, and also look at measures to deal in a robust fashion with the traffickers.  The Senator spoke about the need for a long-term strategy of having in place states that can actively deal with their own populations and that do not arrive at a point where people are so fearful for their lives and their safety that they are willing to engage with traffickers to get themselves out of terrible conditions.</p><p>We will have to continue to work with the countries known as transit countries, and their neighbours.  Many of the latter are themselves in dire economic situations and need support if they are to help in this regard.</p><p> I was asked a specific question about weapons and how conflicts commenced.  We could talk about it in the context of the African continent and the Middle East but, with respect, it is a broad topic of deliberation that I do not propose to get into today.</p></speech>

Last year we reviewed this matter.  It was the first time we had a delegation from the Committee of the Regions in attendance.  This year we again have a delegation in attendance.  We are joined today by Councillor Mary Freehill, Councillor Neale Richmond, Councillor Maria Byrne, and Councillor Enda Stenson.  We have also been joined by two officials from the committee.</p><p>For people who do not know, the Committee of the Regions is composed of 344 local and regional representatives from across the European Union.  Therefore, it is an important institution which ensures that the views and experiences of local people are fed into EU policy.  We saw the committee during our review of the Europe 2020 strategy.  It raised many issues that ended up in our report, which we published and sent to the Commission.  The issues included making sure that we address regional disparities, and the requirement for strategies, not just from the top down, but involving local and regional organisations in a partnership-based approach, which is a point I made earlier to the Minister of State.  All of those things fed into our review of 2020.  We are delighted to have the opportunity to discuss the national reform programme with representatives of the Committee of the Regions.</p><p>Before we begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>We have spoken beforehand about the order for today's contributions.  I will call people from left to right, so I will start with Councillor Mary Freehill.</p></speech>

On behalf of the Irish delegation of the European Committee of the Regions, I thank the Chairman for inviting us to make a presentation which follows up on submissions made by our members last year on the national reform programme and the mid-term review of the Europe 2020 strategy.  We wish to record our appreciation for the interest that the Chairman and his committee have taken in our activities.</p> <p>  I shall update the committee on some developments at regional level.  The new terms for the Committee of the Regions came into effect in January last and our mandate continues for five years.  The nine full members and nine alternate members, nominated by the Government, reflect the wide spectrum of councillors elected across the country last May.</p> <p>  Last January, the three new regional assemblies came into being.  The assemblies are based in the following areas: Ballymun for the eastern and midlands region; Ballaghaderreen for the northern and western region; and Waterford for the southern region.  Three regional assemblies replaced the eight regional authorities and the two regional assemblies.  However, somewhat confusingly for cohesion policy purposes, the old NUTS II and NUTS III classifications remain in place until at least 2016, with the country remaining divided in two for European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, operational programmes in the Border, midlands and west region and the south and east region, as was the case in the past.  This will run until 2020.</p> <p>  My three colleagues have already been introduced.</p><p>Our presentation will touch on the Committee of the Regions, COR,<b></b>European perspective, differing challenges faced by our regions across Ireland and the newer roles and structures of local and regional government relevant to achieving the European 2020 targets.  The COR has long prioritised implementation of the European 2020 strategy, with particular focus on emphasising the need to recognise and address issues at sub-national level and underlining the importance of partnership and multilevel governance.<br/><br/>Since 2011, the COR has been monitoring the involvement of local and regional authorities and their representative bodies in the preparation and implementation of the national reform plans across Europe.  Generally, it has been found that multilevel governance arrangements are being increasingly adopted in many EU countries to implement Europe 2020.  Naturally, these arrangements differ according to how powers are allocated in each country according to the various policy fields.  Over the years, across the EU, there is an increasing trend towards regionally differentiated approaches, along with a greater role for local and regional authorities in implementing the Europe 2020 strategy through the national reform programmes.  Last year, for example, the national reform programme in 24 states mentioned the active role of local and regional authorities in implementation, with use of Structural Funds in particular being key to achieving the Europe 2020 targets.<br/><br/>The COR has also found that the disparities between and within countries as measured by gross domestic product and levels of employment are increasingly due to the impact of the economic crisis and pre-existing gaps.  Whereas neither 2014 country-specific recommendations nor the countries report of 2015 make specific reference to regional disparities in the Irish context, there is a need to take account of the varying challenges facing regions.<br/><br/>I will briefly touch on the potential of the European Fund for Strategic Investment, also known as the Juncker plan, which has ambitions to invest &euro;315 billion in productive infrastructure based on seed capital of &euro;21 billion in EU money.  When the Minister was here, the Chairman asked if there is buy-in from the regions and that query was not answered.  I emphasise that it is important that all stakeholders in Ireland, including the local government sector, are fully informed of the fund details once they are finalised and that our authorities have an opportunity to benefit from participation.<br/><br/>Following lengthy planning in February, the two regional operational programmes to implement the European Regional Development Fund element of the European structural and investment funds were formally signed.  These will see investment of approximately &euro;820 million in Ireland up to 2020, with 50% provided by Brussels.  This underlines the continuing importance of EU regional policy to Irish regions.  These regional operational programmes, ROPs, are the EU's principal investment tool for delivering Europe 2020 goals and a focus on investment, research and development, information and communications technology, competitiveness of small and medium enterprises and a shift to a low carbon economy.  There will also be significant sustainable urban investment in designated gateway towns.  Given these investment priorities and their scale, we would like to see consistency and co-ordination between these Structural Funds and any investments to be developed in Ireland under the Juncker plan.  It is crucial that the new fund be used to address regional disparities and facilitate synergies for further investment across the regions.<br/><br/>I thank the Chairman.  Mr. Richmond will now highlight regional imbalances and challenges.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-23a.3291" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Neale Richmond" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015042300002#K00200"><p>I thank the committee for having us back.  In Ireland, although there has been a very welcome and robust reduction in unemployment, there are marked differences in regional performance, with recovery unevenly spread across the regions.  Using the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics, NUTS, III classification, since 2012, employment has fallen in the west and south west, while unemployment rates are highest in the midlands and south east.  Labour force participation rates are lowest in the Border and mid-west regions.  As far as income is concerned, Central Statistics Office figures indicate Dublin as the only region with higher <i>per capita</i>disposable income than the State average during the entire 2003 to 2012 period.  The midland, Border and west regions have continuously earned less than the State average.  For example, in 2012, the disposable income in the midlands was less than 80% of the Dublin figure.<br/><br/>The focus of the economic recovery has been on the greater Dublin area and although there is potential for the recovery in greater Dublin to spill over into neighbouring counties, there needs to be concerted action to prevent structural shifts that could further weaken outlying counties and regions.  Statistics can be presented in such a way as to back up differing arguments but it is undeniable that there are regional and local disparities that are best addressed with targeted actions.  For example, it is recognised that city regions are the drivers for economic investment and growth.  Dublin, therefore, is competing globally with the likes of San Diego and Shanghai, rather than locally with Sligo.  Greater Dublin and the &quot;Silicon Docks&quot; area in particular, is a global hub for ICT investment and Dublin is recognised as one of the best places in the world for technology start-ups.  However, a relative decline in Dublin's status as a financial services centre demonstrates that the city and the region must strive to improve its competitiveness and attractiveness to ensure continuing foreign as well as domestic investment.<br/><br/>There are major challenges facing the metropolitan area that could put future investment in jeopardy, such as the availability of reasonably priced housing, increasing congestion and the very small degree of wiggle-room with water resources now available.  Equally, the relative decline of our universities in global rankings needs to be reversed.  Whatever about average GDP rates, there are pockets of deprivation that need targeted interventions.  More broadly, these differing regional strengths and weaknesses indicate that more nuanced regional targets, taking heed of regional strengths and weaknesses, may be more appropriate than one size fits all national targets.  A particular challenge for the eastern and midland regional assembly established in January in addition to its statutory responsibilities will be to forge its identity with the wider public service sector over the coming years and develop its own operational programme for Structural Funds.  This process would start with the realignment of the NUTS regions next year.<br/><br/>We also very much appreciate the strong regional element of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation's 2015 Action Plan for Jobs, based on the NUTS III regions.  We strongly welcome this process to support job creation across the country by supporting agencies and organisations within each region to build on their particular strengths and assets and drive new job creation projects and strategies.  The eastern and midland regional assembly area naturally includes the midlands, with its own set of priorities and challenges, and I congratulate Longford County Council and Coillte on the recent Center Parcs announcement, which is a great example of ensuring that every region has the opportunity to make the best of its own resources.<br/><br/>I will hand over to my colleague, Ms Maria Byrne from Limerick City and County Council, who will highlight elements of recent local government reform relevant to the national reform programmes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-23a.3292" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria Byrne" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015042300002#K00300"><p>I thank the committee for inviting us here today.  As the committee appreciates, the Local Government Reform Act 2014 gave legislative effect to commitments to reform local government and provide it with a more central role in local economic, social and community development.  The Act requires that each local authority establish a dedicated strategic policy committee for economic development, which is required to guide and support economic and enterprise development at county level.  The Act also includes the establishment of local community development committees and local enterprise offices.  The statutory function of the local community development committees includes the preparation and implementation of the community elements and the review of the economic elements of the local economic and community plans, the economic element being prepared by the local enterprise office.</p> <p>  The management and oversight of local development companies brings responsibility for national funding programmes to a local level, with the implementation of the social inclusion community and activation programme to support local strategies for social inclusion issues promoting access to life-long learning, employment and social enterprise.</p><p>The LCDCs will also facilitate the Leader element of the rural development programme by taking a management as well as an applicant role to support economic development projects for rural communities.  Under Leader, &euro;250 million will be available in the period to 2020 and the selection process for local action groups has commenced.</p><p> These more recent developments, in addition to the wider responsibilities of local authorities, indicate that we will have a direct impact on the achievement of elements of the national European 2020 targets, and in addressing several of the CSRs on labour market and SME policies.  This should be reflected in the national reform plan.  Unfortunately, however, there was no mention of these local authority roles in the NRP.</p><p> The establishment of three new regional assemblies in January was described by the Minister of State, Deputy Paudie Coffey, as an opportunity to frame new governance institutions, to counteract unbalanced development and promote regional recovery.  The key function of the new regional assemblies will be to develop new regional, spatial and economic strategies to come on stream from 2016 onwards.  These strategies will be underpinned to ensure that all relevant public sector bodies with responsibility for economic development and enterprise promotion follow through on implementation.</p><p> The Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, has indicated that all relevant agencies will be accountable to the regional assemblies as regards progress being made towards achieving the objectives of the new regional strategies. </p><p> In the Irish context, with increasing congestion in and around the capital, strategies to increase investment throughout the so-called two-tier cities, such as Limerick, would be more environmentally sustainable.  Moreover, academic studies have demonstrated that because cities like Limerick have greater potential for growth, investments in these cities will very likely show a greater return.</p><p> I will give a small example of something we have done in Limerick.  We have established another company under the auspices of the local authority called Innovate Limerick.  It is made up of local authority representatives and council management, as well as public and private sector businesses and representatives from education.  The key aims of Innovate Limerick are: to establish Limerick's innovation hub as Ireland's first growth accelerator; grow dynamic industry and sector partnerships; double the number of innovation partnerships and SME-FTI linkages; double the number of incubating and accelerating firms; also double the number of HPSUs; and deliver the national centre for social innovation.  I thank the Chairman and will now hand over to my colleague, Councillor Enda Stenson.</p></speech>

As a member of the Committee of the Regions and an independent member of Leitrim County Council, it is a great honour for me to be here and I am grateful for the invitation.</p> <p>  I would like to summarise our position and underline what we would like to see in the NRP.  In the Irish context, the approach to Europe 2020 and the national reform programme process have plenty of room for improvement.  As we see it, discussion on national targets is essentially confined within a number of Government Departments, with measures selected largely from existing national policy documents to achieve them.  Ireland is not alone in this regard, but the centralised and closed nature of the process here is particularly acute.</p> <p>  Later this year, the mid&ndash;term review of the Europe 2020 strategy is due to be presented.  It is likely that attention will be drawn to the need for greater partnership in the development, ownership and implementation of national reform plans.  We would also expect to see expression of the need for more regionally differentiated targets.</p> <p>  This year in the Irish NRP we hope to see, as a general approach, at least a recognition of regional disparities and the need for specific policy actions at regional level.  Unfortunately, this was not visible in the draft programme circulated to stakeholders.</p> <p>  In relation to the future Irish NRPs, we would welcome increased consultation with stakeholders at local and regional levels.  We would advocate giving a clear territorial dimension by setting regionally differentiated targets, with regional indicators to assess progress in a process that would include all relevant tiers of governance.</p> <p>  This is what we are proposing when it comes to the Europe 2020 strategy and how its targets can be achieved effectively &ndash; a whole-of-Government approach.  This includes national, regional and local government as well as other agencies and key stakeholders.</p> <p>  With a new national planning framework to succeed the national spatial strategy expected in 2016, we would expect to see more coherence and consistency with regard to economic, social and territorial planning.  Development of the NRPs must be part of, and contribute to, this coherence.</p> <p>  Future national reform programmes should be compatible with, and must inform, the priorities of the regional spatial and economic strategies, which in turn provide a framework for local economic and community plans.</p> <p>  In this context, we would therefore like to see the Department of the Taoiseach provide a roadmap for a more structured, continuous and constructive engagement with NRP stakeholders after the mid-term review.</p> <p>  I would briefly like to mention one other relevant issue concerning climate change targets.  On 1 April, milk quotas were finally abolished and this has liberated Irish milk farmers and processors to do more of what we are among the best in the world at doing.</p> <p>  Last week, I was pleased that the Committee of the Regions formally adopted my recommendation that EU climate change and food security policies need to be reconciled so that the most carbon-efficient and environmentally-sustainable agricultural production systems are supported.   Irish food production has an extremely low carbon footprint, but we cannot take things for granted.  Our farmers - I am a farmer myself - and scientists must continue to improve our adaptation and mitigation measures so that our potential to sustainably produce food is not threatened.  I will leave it at that Chairman but we would be happy to respond to any questions and comments members may have.</p></speech>

The Government's Action Plan for Jobs, published earlier this year, focused on how we can ensure that the economic recovery can be experienced by people across the country.  Does Councillor Stenson have any thoughts on the approach being adopted by the Action Plan for Jobs?  Does it go far enough?  Could more be done and, if so, in what areas?</p> <p>  My second question concerns the involvement of stakeholders in the national reform programme.  Councillor Stenson said he would welcome increased consultation.  He is calling on the Department of the Taoiseach to provide a structured roadmap.  It would be useful for this joint committee if the Committee of the Regions could make some concrete proposals on how it could become engaged with the process.  We could then take it forward on its behalf and feed it in to the Minister.</p> <p>  Representatives of the ESRI will attend this committee next week to talk about the national reform programme.  After that, we will be writing to the Minister with our views, including the discussions we are having today.  Therefore, if the Committee of the Regions could put some concrete proposals to us, we can ensure that they will form part of the submission this committee will make to the Minister.</p> <p>  I am making that suggestion because we do not have control over the Department of the Taoiseach producing a structured roadmap, which may take time.  It might be best, therefore, if we moved things along from our end.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-23a.3300" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1150" speakername="Colm Burke" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015042300002#L00800"><p>I thank the councillors for their contributions as well as for their work at local and European level, which is much appreciated.  My question, specifically to Councillor Maria Byrne, is about the whole structure of Limerick City Council.</p><p>Limerick city and county are now under one council.  People might not be aware that there is greater industrial output in the Cork-Kerry region than in Dublin and the greater Dublin region.  We are doing well, particularly in the Cork region.  A report will be produced at the end of October or beginning of November about whether Cork county and city councils should amalgamate.  The population is 526,000 in County Cork and in the Cork-Kerry region it is over 650,000.  From their own experience do the witnesses think there is an advantage in the reforms that have occurred or is it too early to judge?  For example, does Limerick have a stronger pitch for getting its share of the national cake because there is now a coordinated approach, instead of many local authorities competing with one another?  Would there be a better distribution of jobs and other infrastructural development if Cork city and county councils amalgamate?  I am not talking about competing with Limerick or Waterford for jobs but about moving outside Dublin and the greater Dublin region, and the allocation of jobs to Limerick.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-23a.3302" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1172" speakername="Aideen Hayden" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015042300002#M00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  I have comments and observations on all of them, maybe not in logical order but in the order of the presentations.  The witnesses spoke about the whole-of-government approach including national, regional and local government as well as agencies and key stakeholders.  Have we ever really achieved regional government?  It has been on the cards on numerous occasions.  We have had numerous reports about how to develop an Ireland of the regions, and we can talk about the Cork region, as Senator Burke did.  This point is close to my heart.  People talk, for example, about the Dublin region but there are regions within regions, in other words, there are regions within Dublin.  Quite often people dismiss Dublin or the Dublin region as if it were a single entity rather than several regions with separate issues and complications.  We have a great deal more work to do in developing a regional approach.  Do the witnesses, especially Councillor Stenson, have any comments on that?</p> <p>  Councillor Byrne mentioned the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, tender process.  It was incredibly badly handled.  Much of what happened was illogical, with partnerships bidding against each other, although they were dealing with completely different regions, for example, Ballymun and Blanchardstown, which are not interchangeable.  Senator Burke mentioned the population of 500,000 in Cork city and county but in the Dublin region the population is over 1 million.  The process undermined the valuable work partnerships had done.  Does Councillor Byrne have any comments on that? </p> <p>  Councillor Richmond mentioned housing.  It is important, when talking about income and disposable income, to take on board the fact that there are greater costs imposed on people living in urban areas such as Cork, Dublin, Galway, and to a lesser extent Limerick, in order to provide housing.  There are significant pressures on people to provide housing.  There is a big wash-out in mortgage arrears, which in terms of the country specific recommendations is a major issue that will hit urban Ireland in particular.  Would Councillor Richmond like to say something about the regional disparities that put pressure on people&rsquo;s disposable incomes, such as the cost of housing?</p> <p>  The Government has set up the Office for Government Procurement, OGP, which has centralised the tendering and procurement process for State agencies.  This creates a problem because trying to achieve best value for the taxpayer at the same time as centralising the tendering process may rule out regional competitors, for example, as happened with certain procurement for hospitals, or the leaving certificate examination papers when a Spanish company got the job.  Do the witnesses have a view or position on what we should do to ensure that local small and medium sized enterprises, SMEs, get access to tendering for State contracts, particularly in view of EU tendering rules and social contract clauses?</p></speech>

I agree with Senator Hayden about identifying specific deficiencies in the regions, whether urban or rural.  It is a work in progress and we must concentrate on it to ensure we have a balanced economic spread of development across the country.  Some may be isolated and an anchor investor is required in those regions.  I recall going to Germany a few years ago but I will not say how many.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-23a.3305" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015042300002#M00500"><p>Many people were not born at the time.  I was on one of those much-criticised junkets.  It was a learning experience and one of the first things we learnt was in Stuttgart, headquarters of Mercedes manufacturing, where 20,000 people worked.  The benefit was visible as one approached the city, one knew there was a big player in the area because so many ancillary industries had piggybacked on to it to make it much bigger.</p><p>We have to do that in this country.  I use the example of the Shannon development zone which was very effective in years gone by.  It was a co-ordinated plan and those of us who were not from that area travelled there to see what was available.  The nearby airport was used very effectively at that time, although circumstances have changed since.  It had a co-ordinated plan which affected the whole region.  Immediately one drove into the area one could sense that there was something afoot.</p><p> We have to replicate that performance in particular throughout the midlands, the mid-west, the south and in the north west.  I agree with the references to the development in Longford which is a worthwhile experience, a great development and a great proposal and we hope that it goes well.  It is up to the local people there to drive it on from there.  There was an equally welcome investment in the Waterford-Kilkenny area in recent times and also in Tipperary and various other regions. It is the beginning but there is a long way to go.  The geographic isolation needs to be addressed.  The social and economic deprivation to which my colleague referred has to be addressed in cities and towns, in both urban and rural areas.</p><p> When one is in the trenches for a while - as we all try to be - one notices things in a way that the people living there all the time do not necessarily notice.  For example, I remember canvassing in a by-election - I will not say where - in an urban area and seeing the children coming home from school and studying in stairwells that were littered with disused needles and various other items and castoffs - not the proper environment nor the kind of environment in which we would expect our children to excel.  It is not fair to them and there is no necessity for it.  We need to spend much more time addressing those social issues, including that kind of deprivation that forces children at first or second level of schooling to study in an environment that is anything but conducive to study.  Those coming from that bacground will be at a disadvantage when they go into the workplace in order to compete with others.  I support the remarks made by my colleague, Senator Aideen Hayden.  There is a great deal of scope for improvement that we have not tapped into.  It applies to all our cities and to some rural areas.</p><p> I referred to the question of anchor investors.  We need them, we need to look after them, we need to ensure they stay here and we need to ensure they continue to come.  No industry lasts forever in that times change and we have to be prepared.  In the context of planning we need to encourage our local authorities to try to ensure that they plan sensitively in order to give the best possible opportunity to those providing jobs in order for them to do so in the respective regions.  The local authorities should not impose restrictions to the extent that people will decide it is not worth the risk and they will go elsewhere.  </p><p> We need to prioritise the issues that impact most on us.  For instance, in the urban areas, access to proper areas of recreation is an issue that must be dealt with to a far greater extent than has been the case.  The Government is doing this but we must improve on it.  Access to sport is a means of deflecting attention from other activities that are not so constructive and certainly not so useful in the workplace.  I refer to basic requirements such as access to water.  Water services will become a huge issue in the future, much more than we have ever experienced.  Major industries coming to this country and existing indigenous industries will rely heavily on high quality water supply and instant availability.  They do not want to wait for two, three or ten years before they get it.  We need to have the best of modern telecommunications such as broadband available throughout all the regions.  In the area of transport there has been reference to congestion and rightly so.  In particular this is the case in the eastern region all the time.  We need to implement counter-measures.  For instance, the M50 any morning at rush hour is jammed with traffic.  It reached over-capacity a long time ago.  We need to plan for the future, not just for the moment.  The Naas dual carriageway stood the test of time for far longer than some of the more recent introductions to that area.  </p><p> Climate change is an important issue which has the potential to impact positively or negatively on our most important industry, in particular, in the context of economic recovery.  In the recent past, during the boom, for instance, little regard was had for the agricultural sector and nobody wanted to know about it.  Sons and daughters from the agricultural community wanted to get into development or go anywhere else other than agriculture.  When the crunch came, it showed that our basic industries were the ones that carried the responsibility and had the ability to recover much more quickly than any other sector.  I agree entirely with and I strongly support every effort that can be made to ensure that we comply with the requirements and that we do not incur carbon penalties to the extent that this might happen, resulting in the obvious negative impact on the whole industry and associated industries.  We must maximise the availability of realisable alternative energy because it is on that basis that we will be able to compete with all others.</p></speech>

I refer to references in the presentation to regional disparities.  I agree with my colleagues that parts of Dublin have not seen the so-called growth and development in the region.  Many of those areas were left behind during the boom times.  They are still being left behind and another cycle begins.</p> <p>  The delegates are meeting their European counterparts in committees.  Is there any sense that they understand the sacrifices and the difficulties that people have endured in Ireland and in countries like Ireland?  There does not seem to be this understanding at other levels.  People think that we have done well, that we are now in recovery mode and the country is back on track.  There is no sense of the sacrifices that have been made and the sacrifices that are still being made.  Do the delegates regard their role as complementing the Minister or do they regard their role as being separate with a separate voice and pair of eyes at local and regional level?  I am trying to tease that out for people who are listening at home.  The jargon we use in this meeting is NUTS III classification but people are scratching their heads wondering what is NUTS III.  The language we use, such as reference to LEOs, is completely different from the language used by ordinary people.</p> <p>  I mentioned two-tier development or recovery  when speaking to the Minister.  I spoke about job creation.  Do people in Europe understand that many of the new jobs created are low-income jobs?  Is there any sense or understanding that Ireland has proportionately the highest number of people in low-income jobs in Europe?</p><p>We had a spatial strategy during the boom times.  What happened to it?  That development did not happen.  The Minister is now talking about developing a new spatial strategy.  That is certainly the way to go.  The local authorities are going to oversee it.  This problem developed when all sorts of structures were in place.  The previous spatial strategy was led by the Government, but it did not happen in many regions.  I could refer to many of the places where the councillors are from, including counties Leitrim and Limerick.  There were weaknesses within the strategy.  Are the councillors confident that this will work at local level?  In my experience, the Government does not really listen to local authority members.  I am worried that if this is the driver for change, if this is how the spatial strategy is going to be rolled out, at some stage the Minister will say he does not necessarily agree with it and it will be pushed to one side.</p></speech>

We thank the Chairman for facilitating that.  It is the first time such an initiative has been taken.  It is very important to recognise that we need much more interaction.  The committee can talk to us, but we cannot talk to the committee.  Perhaps we can see how that might be changed.</p> <p>  It was music to my ears to hear the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government say last week that it is time for the regions to play to their strengths.  I think there has been a very welcome change in attitude.  Historically, Ireland has been way behind many other countries in terms of the level of centrality of the system of governance.  Maybe this is one of the good things that might come out of the process of local government reform.  It is up to all of us to start working on this.</p> <p>  I would like to speak about economic growth.  There is no doubt that IDA Ireland is very regionalised.  It is working very well at that level.  There is a need to connect that into the regional assemblies.  We used to have two regional assemblies but we now have three.  All of that has to bed down.  More clarity is needed from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in terms of how we will work on that.</p> <p>  Deputy Crowe mentioned the use of nomenclature like NUTS II and NUTS III.  I suggest there is very real meaning in that in so far as it presents us with the figures and what we have to deal with.  A great deal of clarity is needed in that regard.</p> <p>  The regional assemblies are certainly up for it.  We want to work.  Although we are here from the European Committee of the Regions, we are also members of regional assemblies.  If we are to work, the regional assemblies have to work.  It is about everyone working together.</p> <p>  Senator Hayden asked whether this has really started.  I am saying that we need a team approach.  We had a meeting with Declan Kelleher, who is Ireland's ambassador at the permanent representation in Brussels, when we were in that city last week.  It was a welcome first step because it allows us to start moving on this and to operate in a much more coherent way.</p> <p>  Senator Hayden asked about the centralisation of procurement and about the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme, SICAP.  Both of those questions can be answered in the same way.  A very centralised approach to all of this was probably taken.  I wonder whether a sufficient percentage of value was assigned to track records, to local knowledge and to what had been done in the past when projects were being weighed and evaluated under SICAP.  I have questions about the way that was done.  Perhaps the same thing applies to procurement, although that is saving money and probably creates much more transparency than we might otherwise have had.  I think these things always have to be looked at again.</p> <p>  I would like to respond to Deputy Durkan, who was a councillor at one stage.</p></speech>

The Deputy spoke about Germany, etc.  I come back to the point that a co-ordinated plan is needed for the regions.  One of our big difficulties is that national statistics and indicators keep being used.  We need to make much more use of our regional indicators.  I took that up at a recent meeting of the European Committee of the Regions when reference was made to 80% broadband coverage.  That was probably the national figure.  As we know, the provision of broadband in Ireland was left to the market and we saw what happened.  The Minister, Deputy White, is doing a very good job in rectifying all of that at the moment.</p> <p>  Deputy Crowe referred to regional disparities.  The European Committee of the Regions is extremely concerned about the urban indicators because the presence of the wealthiest people within a city means the existence of the highest level of poverty in the same city does not show up.</p> <p>  The Deputy also referred to those who are low paid.  When we were waiting for the airplane with our Northern Ireland colleagues on our way back from Brussels the other day, they pointed out that salaries in the South are 15% higher, even among low-paid workers, than they are in the North.  I suppose we are doing something right.  That does not mean we do not have a very big challenge in that area.</p></speech>

I probably have the longest journey home and transport to Leitrim is not always the easiest.  I know my colleagues will cover everything that needs to be said.  I believe there should be better consultation with local authorities.  There is a lack of consultation in this country from top to bottom.  We can be working away, but I am not sure at times.  I do not know whether the funding is coming through to help the wonderful regional assemblies and their wonderful staff.  The western and Border regions probably suffered more over the years of the Troubles and all of that than any other region of this country.  I think we deserve better help at times.  Our transport system and everything else is not at the same level.</p> <p>  We have three regions in this country - the Dublin region, the southern region and the western region.  The western region might be the poorest of the three.  I believe something has to be done for our rural towns, particularly in the western region.  The centres of many rural towns are dying.  We need to get help from somewhere.  I appeal to the relevant authorities to help us through this.  I know there was a programme on RTE lately about rural degeneration.  There is no place like the west and rural Ireland.  People might be surprised to hear I would never for the life of me leave somewhere like Leitrim.  We love that part of the country.  I think there should be greater co-operation with places like our region.  I appeal to people in higher levels of authority to facilitate that.</p> <p>  We used to have a huge industry in our county.  Deputy Durkan mentioned that up to 20,000 people are employed in large places in Germany.  That is comparable in relative terms to what we had in Carrick-on-Shannon when MBNA employed 1,200 people there.  When people came into the town, they immediately knew something was happening.  Sadly, MBNA is gone.  The regions should be supported in things like that.  Employment should be given back to the regions.  That is what will keep the regions alive.  We never want to let the regions die.</p><p>I will hand over to my colleagues.  I thank the committee very much and am sorry that I have to leave.</p></speech>

There are a couple of points I will address in as chronological an order as I can.  The regional spread and aspect of the Action Plan for Jobs was raised.  It is something we have seen quite a bit in the three years since the Action Plan for Jobs was launched.  It was initially focused on the larger urban areas, and definitely Dublin, which was probably necessary to restore the holes and go not for the quick fixes but for areas where it was easier to attract jobs straight after the crash.  However, we are starting to see that improve with, for example, Centre Parcs in Longford, which sounds brilliant to me.  There is an entire strategy for the midlands which is due to come on stream, we are told by the Government, in the coming months.  That could add a great deal to the regional aspect of the Action Plan for Jobs.  It is something that is greatly needed.  As my colleagues have mentioned, the co-operation between Enterprise Ireland and the IDA has been top class in terms of bringing in jobs.  We see the people going across to foreign countries and operating within the internal market to attract investment.  They are going out flying the flag and wearing the jersey.  It is something of which we should be very proud and to see a regional dimension come into it is definitely welcome.  It will allow for longer-term sustainable growth.</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan mentioned an anchor investor but as Councillor Stenson mentioned in the cases of MBNA and, Councillor Maria Byrne will probably not thank me for saying it, Dell, we saw the risks that come with putting all our apples with one big anchor investor.  We feel a cluster of investors is required.  It is about having an area for the region where a number of companies come in, not just a large one-stop shop on which a whole town or city relies.  It is about a couple of companies starting from SMEs, which are the backbone of the European economy, building up to the larger ones.  They all feed in, tying into third level institutions and also second level with whatever training programmes are there.  That is where the local authorities come in.</p> <p>  The issue about disposable income after taxation, which Senator Hayden raised, is extremely apparent in Dublin, especially when it comes to the housing crisis.  The housing crisis is at all levels.  It is an affordable housing crisis as much as a social housing crisis.  It is the generation to which I belong which is looking to get a foot on the property ladder.  Let us face the fact that Irish people are addicted to owning property.  We must face that as an aspect of our culture.  When one is going out looking at mortgage compared to rental options in Dublin, it is simply cheaper to get a mortgage per month than to pay out rent, especially for a three-bedroom semi-detached house or two-bedroom apartment.</p> <p>  I do not know how popular I will be with Councillor Maria Byrne for saying that what we would like to see is local authorities and the Government playing a balancing act on the local property tax.  It is something that is coming up repeatedly.  On my authority of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, which Senator Hayden will know, we reduced the property tax by 15%, as did Dublin City Council, in our first year since the local elections.  We were able to do it - the funds were in place - even though we only got to hold on to 80% of our property tax.  We cannot do that again for four years.  That is done.  We do not know what the property market will do and what sort of measures the Government will introduce on the revaluation of properties, especially in Dublin.  We have reduced the property tax by 15%, but in many places in Dublin property values have gone up 30% since the original revaluation.  Is the solution from central government and the Minister for Finance simply to freeze the valuation of properties as is at the rate, or is it to give local authorities in Dublin the opportunity to reduce it or increase it as much as they see fit in order to produce the services they need?  That is something that could address Dublin-specific concerns around disposable income.  I know a great many people who noticed that 15% coming off their bills this year.</p> <p>  Deputy Crowe made some comments and suggestions.  When we go over to Brussels, we go as a delegation of nine Irish people having met beforehand.  Therefore, when Councillor Stenson and Councillor McCarthy from Cork were tabling amendments last week, we were able to back them.</p></speech>

Within our group, we sit in larger political groups, as Senator Burke will remember.  Councillor Maria Byrne and I are members of the EPP, while Councillor Freehill is a member of the socialist grouping.  We mirror the European Parliament.  Councillors McCarthy, Stenson and McGrath, who are all independents, sit in the European Free Alliance which used to involve Fianna F&aacute;il and the Europe of the Nations group once upon a time.  As a Sinn F&eacute;in councillor, Rose Conway Walsh from Mayo sits as an independent.  Our two Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues sit in the liberal ALDE group.  As such, we have a responsibility to our groups as well.  We do not go over there and completely abandon what we feel is important, but we have differing opinions.  Maria Byrne and I are proud members of Fine Gael and the EPP, as are all the members of their respective affiliations, and we must do what we believe accords with our political persuasions.  We are talking about certain different things.  We will have different opinions on everything political, but that is the way it goes.</p> <p>  There is definitely an appreciation at a European level of the sacrifices Ireland has made.  Maria Byrne and I had a meeting with a number of leading EPP MEPs and members of the European Council, Heads of State and Ministers when we were over for plenary last week.  All of them speaking to our entire group of representatives from 28 member states cited the examples of both Ireland and Portugal as countries which have made deep and meaningful sacrifices, albeit sacrifices with a direction.  They were made for a reason, which was to get back on an even keel.  We will probably disagree politically on whether it was the right thing to do, but there is a recognition that something was done and things definitely have changed at an Irish level.  We are seeing that with the type of jobs that are coming on stream.  They are not all low-paid jobs.  We are seeing some really high-paying high-tech jobs.  Within the fin-tech sector, there is a potential in the next 20 years for 5,000 jobs with an average wage of &euro;80,000 per annum.  That is a high-quality sustainable job of the type we need to attract to Ireland and not just for Dublin, Cork or the Kerry region.  We need such jobs throughout the entire country because that is where we compete against the other European regions such as Poland and the UK, especially Scotland.  I will hand over to Councillor Byrne to wrap up.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-23a.3326" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria Byrne" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015042300002#P00700"><p>The Chairman asked a question on the Action Plan for Jobs.  In Limerick, people welcomed the fact that the Minister came down and spoke directly.  There were people there to give advice and there was interaction.  People felt their voices were being heard, which was very important.  It was not seen that everything was happening above in Dublin but that things were spread throughout the country.  That is just a comment I heard back.</p> <p>  Senator Burke asked a question about Limerick and the amalgamation of the local authorities.  We have had the amalgamation of Limerick city and county councils since last year, but we sat as two separate councils leading up to the local elections, since which all 40 councillors have sat around the same table.  It has certainly involved a learning curve for everyone.  Of the old city council, only six councillors were returned whereas a significant number of county councillors from the former county council were returned.  The rest is made up of newly elected members.  Some of my colleagues come from the really urban areas while my own area goes from urban to extremely urban and rural to extremely rural and is very diverse compared with when I was on the city council.  I am covering everything from one-off housing applications to investment in the city centre.  It is very different.</p> <p>  Certainly there has been a great deal of emphasis on the redevelopment of the city centre.  Limerick city was governed by three local authorities previously.  One had Limerick City Council, Limerick County Council and Clare County Council on the outskirts.  A number of out-of-town shopping centres were granted permission with a detrimental effect on the city centre.  We are now operating as a unit.  Deputy Durkan referred to the Shannon Development lands and it is interesting that there is now a partnership approach between the educational institutions and Shannon Airport, which is in Clare.  There is a joined-up thinking approach that was never there before.  When I was first elected in 1999, the city operated as the city and everybody else operated separately.  The joined-up approach has certainly helped.  A number of my colleagues in the really rural areas see the city and investment in the city centre as a threat, however.  This goes back to my reference earlier to Innovate Limerick, which we set up under the LEOs and the economic development unit.</p><p>They have purchased six incubation units, which are located not only in the city but the county, including the Andersen plant in Rathkeale which is an extremely rural area.  Occupancy at this plant is currently 80%, with some companies having purchased part of the plant and the remainder paying rent.  A further 20% remains unoccupied.</p><p> We have also purchased other key infrastructure.  It is all about providing space, the returns from which will be invested in our economic development plan.  There is more joined-up thinking now than in the past.  We are on a learning curve.  It will take up to two election terms before everybody is satisfied that we are all operating on a level playing field.  However, this is the most positive thing that has happened and in the long-term it will benefit not only Limerick but the region in that we will into the future be working together rather than competing with one another.  </p><p> In terms of the housing crisis, there are more than 5,000 people on our housing waiting list.  Councillor Richmond mentioned that people in Ireland like to own their home while across Europe people predominantly like to rent.  I spoke only yesterday to a person who has been renting a house in an urban area, in respect of which the rent up to now was &euro;500 per month but has since been increased to &euro;800 per month.  It is an issue that needs to be addressed.  </p><p> The Social Inclusion Community and Activation Programme, SICAP, was mentioned.  The fact that funding for urban and rural development is to be administered locally is very positive.  In Limerick, PAUL Partnership and the rural development companies now operate under one umbrella.  This means there will be equal distribution in terms of funding provision for relevant projects.  As regards the one-size fits all for the different regions, I do not think that will be the case.  Each region is different and has their own difficulties and crises which need to be addressed.  While the regions need to work together, the same issues do not arise across the board.  </p><p> Local SMEs are covered by our economic development unit.  Councillor Richmond referred to Dell.  I was delighted to hear the 100 job announcements by the company today.  While previously there were 3,500 people working at that plant the current workforce is only approximately 1,000, but it appears it is set to increase.  While that is very positive it is important we do not put all of our eggs in the one basket.  Job losses at that plant had a huge socioeconomic effect not only on Limerick but on the region because there were people working there from counties Tipperary, Clare and Kerry as well.  It is good see a company increasing its workforce.  </p><p> Recreation and sport was mentioned.  All across the country we have fine facilities in this regard.  The linkage between sport and business is to be commended.</p></speech>

I invite Mr. Dolan to make his opening statement.  Following the presentations, committee members will pose questions.</p></speech>

In 2012, we appeared before the committee when the Chairman was a member of it.  We had a useful conversation and debate that day.<br/><br/><i>safe</i>food was set up as the Food Safety Promotion Board under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement as one of six implementation bodies established under the Belfast agreement in December 1999.  <i>safe</i>food implements, on an all-island and cross-Border basis, policies agreed in the North-South Ministerial Council, the most recent of which was held in Derry last Wednesday.  Departmental responsibility rests with the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Belfast and the Department of Health in Dublin.<br/><br/>Our budget for 2015 is &euro;7.8 million, roughly &pound;6.3 million sterling.  Funding is provided by the Oireachtas and by the Northern Ireland Assembly.  The Oireachtas provides 70% of the funding, with 30% coming from the Northern Ireland Assembly.  <i>safe</i>food does not have a direct involvement in public communications relating to food safety incidents and alerts as these responsibilities are assigned to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland in the South and the Food Standards Agency in Northern Ireland.  Our headquarters is in Little Island in Cork, with a sub-office in Dublin that houses our marketing and communications people.  This leaves us with four directorates reporting to the chief executive.<br/><br/><i>safe</i>food&rsquo;s strategy links economic, social, and cultural factors that continue to change over time, influencing consumer concerns and their perceptions of behaviour in regard to food.  The food industry continues to grow globally and, from time to time, there are outbreaks of food-borne illness or incidents that will further alter consumer perceptions and occasionally dent confidence.  <i>safe</i>food monitors these concerns and utilises its resources to appropriately inform and, where necessary, reassure consumers so that they may continue to make healthy and safe food choices.  We also use targeted consumer messages to further inform, support and motivate consumers to put food safety and healthy eating at the centre stage of their lifestyle choice.<br/><br/>Our focus has evolved from individual food poisoning crises and pathogens to an emphasis on the four c&rsquo;s, cook, clean, chill and cross-contamination; from limited individual nutrient information to a holistic approach to the obesity epidemic; from bench research to applied and behavioural research; from mass media campaigns to multi-component integrated campaigns; and from print and traditional media to social media.  We are aware of the wider public health context in which we operate and we work in partnership with Governments and professional partners across the island of Ireland to inform consumers of positive lifestyle choices to improve their health, particularly nutritional advice and good food safety practice.<br/><br/>Our most recent campaign was on childhood obesity, the aim of which was to communicate practical solutions that parents can adopt to help them tackle the everyday habits associated with excess weight in childhood.  To date, six television ads have been developed covering the topics of portion size, treats, fizzy drinks, physical activity and sleep.  Some members may have noted that our sleep television ad went out this week.<br/><br/>These messages have been augmented with radio and outdoor advertising as well as considerable digital and social media activity.  We have partnered with the HSE and Healthy Ireland in the South and the Public Health Agency in Northern Ireland.  Resources have been disseminated through Early Childhood Ireland in the South and Early Years in Northern Ireland.  All GP surgeries have been circulated with leaflets detailing practical tips for parents and we have also partnered with the Irish College of General Practitioners in the development of a resource to help general practice tackle this important and sensitive issue.<br/><br/>Our most recent food safety campaign related to chicken and campylobacter.  With eight out of ten adults eating chicken every week, consumers need to be reminded to ensure that chicken is cooked and handled properly to avoid food-borne illnesses.  In November 2014, we launched a food safety awareness campaign in partnership with the Food Standards Agency in Northern Ireland with the theme, Don't Wash Raw Chicken.  Campylobacter is one of the most common causes of bacterial food poisoning on the island of Ireland.  <br/><br/>I would like to mention another strong piece of consumer communication in the area of obesity on which <i>safe</i>food is delighted to have worked, that is, the RTE programme &quot;Operation Transformation&quot;.  On review of one of the earlier programmes in the series, we spotted the opportunity to get involved in the programme and have worked closely for the past five years with the programme makers in the development and roll-out of the series.  The show and its format have been a phenomenal success across the island and is being applauded around the world.  It has been adopted in Belgium, France and the USA.  It has not only worked on an individual level in helping people to lose weight but also on a community level, managing to get hundreds of communities engaged, motivated and moving. <br/><br/>The 2015 programme ran for six weeks in January and February to an audience of just under 500,000, and 314 communities across the island started weight loss groups.  Some 20% of those who watched the show claimed to have lost weight, with 46% of those claiming to have lost between 0 lbs and 6 lbs.  Some 23% of those who watched the show have claimed that, since the show ended, they are being more active and 21% are now eating healthier food.  <br/><br/>I refer to our education initiatives.  With up to one in five teenagers leaving school early, this can impact negatively on their longer-term health, as limited knowledge about  healthy eating and physical activity is a contributory factor to the growing problem of obesity on the island.  In partnership with Youthreach and the Northern Ireland NEET forum for those not in education, employment or training, we developed <i>www.eatright.eu</i>and launched it in 2014 to help inform these early school leavers about nutrition and general cooking skills.  One of our successful programmes mentioned by the Chairman in his introduction was the community food initiatives.<br/><br/>We are in our second tranche of ten projects, which we fund for the years 2013, 2014 and 2015.  These are collaborative, community projects that cover areas from Antrim to Cork.  They are targeted at a low-income audience and the emphasis is on cooking skills, growing food, nutrition and food education and food supply.  It has proved to be successful.<br/><br/><i>safe</i>food has promoted food safety and hygiene across the food chain through the establishment of all-island food safety networks.  These collaborative arrangements, called knowledge networks, create and augment linkages across the island between food safety professionals.  Many food professionals, not only North-South but also east-west, do not get the opportunity to meet and share the issues that arise.  This has been a great success over the years.<br/><br/>With regard to research, we have continued to undertake appropriate research and knowledge-gathering in order to address gaps in scientific knowledge related to our core areas of food safety, hygiene and healthy eating.  This builds the evidence base that facilitates <i>safe</i>food&rsquo;s communications to consumers and food safety professionals across the food chain.  Our aim is always to provide messages that are supported by science and that are clear, concise, authoritative, relevant and independent.  Our information must be accessible, accurate, and supportive of public policy.  I, and my colleagues, will be delighted to take any questions that members have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-23a.3342" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/970" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2015042300002#C00400"><p>I welcome Mr. Dolan and his colleagues.  The importance of the body is evident from the fact that it was one of the six of implementation bodies established following the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  The last point concerned research.  Does <i>safe</i>food collaborate with institutes of technology and universities throughout the island of Ireland on research?  One of my bugbears is the amount of duplication in this country.  Representing two southern Ulster counties, I see too much duplication and not enough collaboration at public service level in general.  There is plenty of potential for consolidating research in one university, institute of technology or research institute instead of everyone doing a little bit of this and that.  It is not putting public money to best use or getting the best outcomes from research.  I have noticed, over the past few years, more third level institutions developing food programmes and it concerns me.  It is always better to have specialist centres.  We know about the value of specialist centres in the delivery in health services.  It is similar in research and innovation.</p><p>We have expertise in and a focus on particular areas.  Does <i>safe</i>food collaborate with third level institutes throughout the island of Ireland?  I presume there is room for improvement with regard to co-operation and eliminating duplication.<br/><br/>On food poisoning caused by chicken, the delegates have noted that they launched the food safety awareness campaign in partnership with the Food Standards Agency in Northern Ireland.  There was no mention of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland in that context.  Was it because of fiefdom building or defence that it was not involved?<br/><br/>In regard to childhood obesity and awareness campaigns, the delegates mentioned fizzy drinks.  Sports sponsorship is a related and contentious issue, particularly alcohol companies sponsoring sports programmes.  What non-alcoholic drinks pose particular dangers?<br/><br/>People sometimes confuse <i>safe</i>food and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, although I know that they have separate remits.  <i>safe</i>food's role is the promotion of good health and lifestyle standards.  Advertising and marketing programmes are often the only way to get the message out, but perhaps it would also be useful to go into the marketplace to meet potential consumers.  Ten years ago I was involved in the roll-out of the Food Dude programme which aimed to persuade children to eat more fruit and vegetables.  The outcome of the programme was very satisfactory.  Children were provided with various fruits and vegetables at school and by this means they often educated their own parents on the importance of consuming fruit and vegetables.  It is welcome that <i>safe</i>food is working with Youthreach and its counterpart north of the Border.  Have the delegates thought about working at primary school level?  I recognise that the question arises of finding resources to reach the 3,000 primary schools in the State.  However, in working with children, they will bring the message to their parents.</p></speech>

It had responsibility for communicating with consumers when it was established under legislation introduced in 1997.  When <i>safe</i>food subsequently came on board as a result of the Belfast Agreement, the authority lost its remit of communicating with the consumer.  As the Food Standards Agency in Northern Ireland has the remit of communicating with consumers, we partner it in that context.  It was not a case of fiefdom building.  This arrangement works well and the FSAI is happy with it.<br/><br/>All of our research is put out to tender and we have a good relationship with the various academic institutions.  Certain institutions have strong expertise in different areas of food science.  UCC, UCD, Queens University Belfast and the University of Ulster all have strong faculties in food sciences, but we often find that the specific areas of expertise differ.  This becomes clear when they bid for research contracts because we have an open tendering process.  Where commonalities are identified, institutions often collaborate to bid for a project, which also works well for us.<br/><br/>I agree with Deputy Brendan Smith that Food Dudes which was developed by Bord Bia was a great success.  Educating children offers a route to reaching their parents.  We are closely involved in developing the curriculum in this area and enjoy strong relationships with the teacher associations.  We attend their AGMs and other meetings to make presentations.  We take advantage of every opportunity to get into schools, both North and South.  We are also trying to work with creches.</p></speech>

When we commission research, we use our network of other food safety agencies to investigate whether similar work has been carried out in centres of excellence on this island and in the United Kingdom to ensure we do not duplicate research.  Approximately 96% to 98% of our more than 100 research projects involve partners from both Northern Ireland and the Republic.  Mr. Dolan referred to several institutions which are particularly strong in food safety research.  They tend to carry out many of the projects in this area because they have the necessary capacity to do so.  We also have a scientific advisory committee which advises us on research we might pursue and developments elsewhere in the world, as a way of ensuring taxpayers' money is put to good use and that we maximise the potential of research projects.  The committee also helps us to identify gaps in food safety along the food chain from producer to the consumer and to find ways of harnessing research in consumer communications.</p></speech>

Children learn about where food comes from and how their diet affects their health.  I agree with Deputy Brendan Smith on the importance of children bringing the message home to their parents and this is something we strive to achieve.  We have worked with cr&egrave;ches to introduce educational resources on hand-washing sin order that children learn this message at a very early stage.  We created a rhyme about hand-washing which children can learn with their carers and teachers in the cr&egrave;che.  We have also worked with Agri Aware to grow food in schools.</p> <p>  On fizzy drinks and sponsorship, we carry out tracking research on an annual basis to identify consumer concerns about food.  This year we asked a number of questions about sponsorship.  One in four respondents would ban sponsorship of sport by alcohol and food companies, while one in three linked the food sold or advertised at sports events with obesity.</p></speech>

Everything is interesting but we cannot afford everything.  A number of Government Departments and agencies fund food-related research, including the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Health.  The idea of Healthy Ireland is relevant in terms of pulling those potentially disparate groups together to prioritise areas of research.  Even the balance between bench research, which is important in the long term, and things like behavioural research that give more immediate feedback is significant.</p><p> One area we have tackled that is a good example from the North-South perspective is dietary surveillance - getting frequent, ongoing and quite detailed information about what people are actually eating.  We now have a group of all the relevant funders, as distinct from recipients of funding.  They are the groups that are using and want to use public money as effectively as possible.  We are agreeing a formula and have six meetings organised with the Departments North and South and the relevant funders, in which we will get together and work out a system avoiding duplication and gaps.  That is one example, but there is plenty of scope for developing even further in other areas of research.  </p><p> Sports drinks sponsorship is an issue involving not just fizzy drinks but all confectionery.  Sometimes it is giving the message to children that they can walk from one side of a room to another and then get a bar that contains 300 or 400 calories - it does not make any sense.  It is a funding issue for these groups, but very mixed messages are being given.  From a policy perspective, we are involved in the special advisory group on obesity in the South and the steering group on obesity prevention in the North.  We are influencing policy as much as we can.  The alcohol issue is going to come first, but this is also a genuine issue.</p><p> I echo what Ms Gilligan was saying about listening to both families and children.  Any initiative we have in schools is founded on what children and parents want, or what will target them and impact on them.  The resources she was talking about have as major aspects homework and exercise.  It might be a nursery rhyme or everybody might have to bring in an apple the next day or bring in an unusual fruit or vegetable.  It is all games-oriented rather than what we could call didactic, boring old stuff.  Off the top of my head, my recollection is that with Tastebuds - a primary school project which is also running in the North under the name Eat, Taste and Grow - our most recent evaluation shows that 70% of primary schools are taking it up, which is a very high rate.</p></speech>

I apologise to the friends and family I have poisoned over the years with chicken and turkey - I am one of those individuals who has been guilty of that, so the witnesses' information is welcome, although I do not want any claims coming in.</p><p>As committee members, we do not have many powers but we can make recommendations.  What is <i>safe</i>food's view on setting up an all-Ireland body that would deal with emerging food and safety issues?  The horsemeat scandal showed us that the island's food chain is complex.  An oversupply of horsemeat was combined with pressure from large retailers and their suppliers to cut costs, creating the perfect set of circumstances for fraud and all the difficulties that occurred.  Would it make sense to have some sort of neutral space where stakeholders and individuals working in this field could flag up issues of concern, or even to have some sort of whistleblower mechanism for the food industry?  If such a body had existed, the problem might have been picked up far quicker.  Would <i>safe</i>food, in its non-regulatory, all-island capacity, be well placed to facilitate such a body?</p><p>What happened to the plans for the enteric reference centre for the island of Ireland?  As far as I can remember, they were shelved by Mary Harney when she was Minister.  It was part of the <i>safe</i>food remit at the time and would have allowed food samples to be tested for harmful bacteria.  I imagine it would have saved Irish taxpayers a small fortune.  Under the current system, we send the samples to Colindale in England, which is a costly process.  Could the witnesses let me know the cost?  Do they know whether it can result in delays?  If there was an outbreak, the Government might wait for a number of samples to save on shipping costs.  I think they get it free in the North, but there is pecking order in which the North is placed just above the Republic of Ireland in the prioritisation of tests.</p><p>The childhood obesity campaign was mentioned and we all welcome that.  Obesity is a problem in both Britain and Ireland.  What is the attitude of <i>safe</i>food, if the witnesses can comment, on the question of a sugar tax?  A tax on products that contain a high quantity of sugar has been mooted, as has been mentioned already in the context of energy drinks, soft drinks and sweets.  We have heard that the money raised in this way could be put back, for example, into the health budget.  It could also be put into promoting vegetables and fruit. </p><p>Is any work being undertaken with parents and guardians around how to eat healthily on a budget?  A lot of the shops in what are officially described as deprived areas stock their shelves with two-for-one offers, doughnuts, all the high-sugar foods, pizzas and so on.</p><p>It is almost impossible to get them to bring in fresh vegetables.<br/><br/>How many parents does <i>safe</i>food work with?  Cooking is important.  I am involved in a not-for-profit company in Fettercairn in Tallaght whose aim was to try to provide a healthy food option every day, but coming up with the calorie count for a particular meal was beyond their capability.  Does <i>safe</i>food know of supports for such small community enterprises?  I have worked with several groups of lone parents who were naive and did not have a clue how to cook basic foods.  There are several of those organisations on the island of Ireland.  Does <i>safe</i>food tie in with them?  I congratulate it on the work it does. <br/><br/>Cooking for teenagers is another problem.  I spoke to some students recently who said even those who are going to university and are highly intelligent do not have a clue how to make the most basic meal.  I know there are several programmes on television on that topic, but how do we popularise the culture of people cooking for themselves?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-23a.3351" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ray Dolan" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2015042300002#F00200"><p>The Deputy asked some very good questions.  We are involved in a very useful project in Fettercairn, a community food initiative, which helps people learn about food and nutrition.  It extends to providing facilities to mind children while their parents go to the classes.  It is halfway through its three-year cycle and I understand it is a great success, which is a great credit to the people doing it.  Often these communities are not ready for the bureaucracy needed to be accountable for State money, or to meet all our requirements for sending in forms and mini-accounts.  We have 20 projects, ten of which finished in 2013 and ten which began in 2013.  They all run on three-year cycles and focus on people who need that kind of basic education.<br/><br/>In one case a community had put in a request to rent a bus to bring people to the local town and go to the supermarket.  I wondered why they were doing that, but it was to educate people about what is on the supermarket shelves, what is worth taking down and what they should not eat, and to explain fruit or vegetables they had never heard of.  That campaign has been a great success, so much so that we hope after a three-year cycle they will be able to run themselves or find financing somewhere else.  They will often set up market gardens and sell the produce, and open a coffee shop, and that money keeps them going.  Many of the first tranche of initiatives, 2010-13, are still going as a result of the kick start we gave them.<br/><br/>The food chain has been very topical since the horsemeat scandal.  Last week, a North-South Ministerial Council meeting took place with both Ministers in Derry, and <i>safe</i>food brought in Professor Chris Elliott, an eminent professor of food science from Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast.  He made the Deputy's point to the Ministers that it is not too soon to consider what we could do on the island of Ireland to put a policy in place to address that, whether for whistleblowers or something else.  It has been done in other countries, so there is a model.  That is topical and I hope we can move on it.<br/><br/>The enteric reference laboratory is one of our functions.  A lot of early work was done on it.  The present system whereby we send samples to Colindale does not cost us money and it works very well, but an enteric reference laboratory on the island of Ireland would be an even better solution.  Resources are an issue.  Getting all the key players together is a difficult project and we have not managed to get it across the line.  From time to time we revisit it and it is probably time to do it again.  Dr. Kearney has been very much involved in this for the past 15 years and can give a front-line view of it.</p></speech>

Food safety is a key factor underpinning the reputation and sustainability of the industry.  Since the horsemeat scandal broke, many people have done a lot of work to introduce new checks and balances.  The regulatory agencies in both jurisdictions have put in place systems, committees and groupings to study and trying to scan the horizon and come up with a plan for potential issues in the food chain or food commodities.  The Food Standards Agency, for example, has set up a crime unit, which is quite heavily staffed, to reassure consumers that everything is being done and that a dishonest approach within the food chain will not be accepted.<br/><br/>The European Food Safety Authority has pulled all 28 member states together in a major grouping as an initiative to examine what they can do collectively in addition to what they are doing individually to ensure that traceability along the food chain can be optimised.  The food chain is extremely complex.  The horsemeat scandal showed that.  It takes quite a long time to break down what each member state is doing by way of systems, controls, approaches and resources applied.  The scandal showed that potential vulnerabilities need to be shored up.  It may not have been a food safety, food quality or consumer issue, but it showed us that maybe not everything is right.  Food safety is a 24-hour-a-day, seven-days-a-week, forever-and-ever concern.  People need to consume food and food is always produced, and we need to be on top of the game all the time.  It is not a question of putting a control in place and assuming everything will go correctly.  A great deal of effort has been put into that.  We have discussed with various stakeholders, including regulators, how <i>safe</i>food can assist in that type of approach.  Someone mentioned a neutral space, but we have to be careful because we are not a regulator; we promote food safety across the food chain.  It is not our role to audit traceability.  We already have very good regulatory agencies to do that.<br/><br/>Professor Elliott has outlined an informal approach in which industry players can come together and share information and pick up trends before they become a problem in terms of food safety further down the food chain.  Over the past few years we have established an initiative called knowledge networks.  These are collaborative frameworks linking those who work in food safety, or have a responsibility in that area, in academia, including universities and institutes of technology, in industry and in food or food-related agencies, including regulators, across the island.  The role of those networks is to identify new risks, especially emerging challenges - to gaze into a crystal ball and examine various areas and try to ask the hard questions such as what happens if the controls do not work in one place or we do not have enough information in another.</p><p>We have seven networks.  They are built around scientific issues of particular interest - for example, campylobacter in chicken - and we have more than 2,700 members.  These are food safety professionals, with 20% coming from industry.  We have held approximately 38 events and conferences over the last three to four years and had attendances of 2,200 people within the food chain.  People are coming together and identifying issues, especially new risks, that are coming down the track.</p><p> We held a very good function at the end of last year with Teagasc.  One of our facilitators who runs the campylobacter network, Dr. Declan Bolton from Teagasc, brought in the experts from those countries in Scandinavia that have resolved the campylobacter issue to greater effect than most of the rest of Europe, to learn the tips and tricks they used and how best we can apply what they applied to our situation on the island.  We use forums such as those.  It is quite robust.  There are newsletters and other support mechanisms to try to get people to talk and exchange information on a North-South basis.  The industry is an all-island endeavour.  It is about building relationships and trust so that information can be shared formally and informally.</p><p> The last issue the Deputy mentioned was the enteric reference service.  As Mr. Dolan mentioned, I was at the coalface on that.  It is in our legislation and we have made a number of efforts to get it over the line.  It is a very complex issue.  It is not that we are losing money by not having such a service, but the key problem for us, and the reason it was put into our legislation, is the "what if" issue.  If there was an outbreak of a major food problem in the Republic of Ireland, how would we get on?  There are two centres in the Republic, in Galway and Dublin, that carry out enteric services to a very high standard.  The funding streams are not always guaranteed.  Even though they do fantastic work, they need a greater guarantee or reassurance regarding funding and resources.  In Northern Ireland, the first call is to Colindale.  If there was a serious outbreak that swamped us in the Republic, we would use Colindale, but if it affected Northern Ireland there might be a delay in that respect.</p><p> As I said, it has been a very complex situation with many stakeholders and many priorities.  We had taken the process to a costing stage, where we identified a number of solutions.  At that point, two or three years ago, economic circumstances were unfavourable and we were asked to hold off until they were more favourable.  We are going to take a fresh look at it.  We know the issues and the people.  They have not changed.  The solutions we had in mind that we intended to cost have not changed.  We had a very good consultation with stakeholders across the island, so we have a good understanding of what people think and of what will work.  It is a case of moving onward on that process.  We hope that over the next year we will have fresh progress in that area.</p></speech>

It is a critical area and there is an increasing skills deficit, particularly among the lower socioeconomic groups.  The two things we have done recently were in television, because the lower socioeconomic groups watch television to a huge extent.  The audience figures are huge.  Celebrity chefs have been tried and tested, but we have found in the research that people are watching them for entertainment.  In one programme we did, called "Take on the Takeaway", we challenged people to cook their normal takeaway - for example, a Chinese meal - at home.  They did it with a chef helping them, but they had to do it at a cheaper price and to a quicker time so that it would be ready just as quickly.  Obviously, that is what people want when they order a takeaway.  Also, the taste would be as good as what they might get from the takeaway.  In 80% of cases, people were delighted with what they found.  There were eight programmes broadcast throughout the country and the viewership was very high.  It was broadcast twice on RTE.</p> <p>  Building on that, last year we did a programme called "Angeline's Home Cooks" in conjunction with Tesco.  Angeline Ball fronted the programme.  Previously she could not cook - she was a singer but she could not cook well - but she married a Frenchman and ended up learning to cook quite well.  It featured items such as Granny's stew, with Granny showing up to teach three contestants how to cook it.  Again, this was not a celebrity type of meal.  It was a simple, recipe-based piece.  For example, when contestants were asked to saut&eacute; the onions, some of them did not know what that was.  There were many technical things that people who cook regularly will know, but basics such as saut&eacute;ing, simmering, grilling and so forth were explained.  The contestants were also brought to the supermarket and shown the shelves and where to find the food.  They were quite surprised that they did not have to go down some of the aisles that stocked the packaged items they were used to buying.  Again, there was good viewership.  TV3 broadcast it in conjunction with Tesco; the products could be found in Tesco.</p> <p>  On the education perspective, fortunately in Northern Ireland it is mandatory for all secondary school children to take cookery.  We would love that to happen in the South.  To fill that gap we have worked with St. Angela's College in rolling out a competition along the lines of "Take on the Takeaway".  That has run for a number of years.  We are reviewing it at present to see how we can alter it and, perhaps, get more people on board.  There would have been more than 1,000 students involved each year, not just students doing home economics but others as well.</p></speech>

What is being proposed at present is a sugar-sweetened beverage tax.  The reason is that honey, jam and numerous other products contain sugar and can be nutritious, whereas sugar-sweetened drinks are not.  Officially we can say that we would support it.  It is one of a suite of measures that has been shown to have some merit, in the same way as calorie posting.  However, it brings into focus the bigger issue of fiscal measures in general.  The Deputy mentioned fruit and vegetables.  It would be the carrot-and-stick approach of subsidising fruit and vegetable availability and cost.</p> <p>  Much has happened in recent times with regard to cost in some of the low-price multiples.  It is interesting what is happening there with the supermarkets.  It is an example of how we work with our colleagues in the North.  Members will be familiar with the offers of five products for a very reasonable price, or variations thereof, that all the supermarkets in the South are advertising on a weekly basis.  The same supermarkets had not been doing that in the North.  We have linked up with our colleagues who are now putting pressure on the same multiples in the North.  It seems crazy.</p> <p>  The evidence is that fiscal measures work.  That is the reason we have been talking about them and working with them for years in respect of tobacco and, more recently, alcohol.  Food is next.  We must be careful that we pick good examples for fiscal measures, but there is no doubt that it works.  It is another example of the different Departments in the Government joining up to prioritise health.</p><p> The Deputy also mentioned food poverty.  Among other things, we work with the Money Advice and Budgeting Service and its counterpart in the North.  For example, we have produced a resource called 101 Square Meals which is nutritionally sound, financially okay but also acceptable.  It is a critical issue which we have found-----</p></speech>

That brings to mind a project for which we held a soft launch on Tuesday because it is a time of purdah in Northern Ireland, during which anything that might influence policy may not be dealt with.  It involves consensual budget standards.  We were doing this work, both North and South, in the context of the issue of food baskets.  It is not just about what is nutritionally and financially sound but also what is acceptable.  It includes limited treats, as well as a small amount of alcohol and some tips on catering for guests.  It is about what is reasonable socially and psychologically, as well as nutritionally.  That is the philosophy with which we are working, whether in community food initiatives or different resources.  We have an all-island food poverty network involving the key NGOs and Departments, North and South.  Our philosophy focuses on acceptability, as well as financial and nutritional considerations.</p></speech>

Has there been any discernible improvement in that regard?  As a public representative, I represent socio-economically disadvantaged housing estates, lone parents, unemployed persons and so on.  When they come to my constituency services, it is striking how many of their children are obese.  Everything seems to be from a fast food outlet.  There does not seem to have been any decline in my area; therefore, I do not think the message is getting home.  That is not the fault of the delegates, but perhaps we need a more co-operative approach across the board between those involved in politics; education through schools, local authorities, NGOs and so forth.</p> <p>  Dr. Foley-Nolan mentioned "Operation Transformation".  I watch television very little, but I have seen a few episodes of this programme.  One in particular sticks out for me as a Kerry footballer was involved.  Kids are the ones whom we need to target.  Has anything like this been done with children as distinct from adults?  It is when children are starting in secondary school that it is probably more obvious to an individual and more hurtful to him or her.  Has any effort been made to produce something similar to "Operation Transformation" involving young people who have a tendency to look to their peers rather than adults?  They expect adults to be fat or obese, which is accepted.</p> <p>  Have the delegates seen any improvement as a result of the school PE and exercise programme?  What more could be done in that regard?  Many schools, especially in more rural areas, are contending with a reduction in the number of teachers and one of the first things to fall by the wayside is the PE programme.  Class sizes are continuing to go up and if teacher numbers are to be cut, they will be cut for what is perceived to be the least important subject, even though it may, in fact, be the most important.</p></speech>

We know that people who are less advantaged do not eat as well.  They are not as active and we know that children in less advantaged families sleep for shorter periods of time.  All of these factors are relevant.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned teenagers and younger children.  We now know that children as young as three years are overweight and obese.  Their risk of being overweight as adults is huge.  We are not talking about the middle-aged spread but about decades of serious illnesses.  The evidence shows that what is the norm at home is the issue.  Tackling teenagers is certainly not the priority, although this must be done.  That is where the childhood obesity campaign comes from.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked if there was any evidence of improvement.  There are some indications.  Some of the work done as part of the childhood obesity surveillance initiative, COSI, a World Health Organization surveillance initiative, shows a levelling off in some age groups among children.  However, it is an unacceptably high level.  One in four children is overweight or obese.  I am sure Ms Gilligan will be able to provide figures for indications of positivity in our childhood obesity campaign.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned his familiarity with the estates in the area in which he works.  The challenge is dealing with the stigma attached to not having enough money or not being as well off as we perceive others to be.  We have a dilemma in which we are inclined not to emphasise the social inequalities so as not to further stigmatise people.  It is a difficult issue.  If we say people who are less advantaged are more likely to be overweight, it is just another negative from their perspective.</p></speech>

As we cannot change people's incomes, to be supportive, one must ask what people can do in their own homes.  The issue of fast food outlets is significant.  I do not know if the Deputy is aware, but there have been a number of examples in the past year or two of the major chains actually targeting schools.  There are three examples where outlets have been built across the road from schools in deprived areas, including one in Cork and one in Bray.</p><p>There are some minor positive signs.  It took two or three decades to get garage forecourts where one can hardly buy petrol without being tempted to buy two-for-one or three-for-two sweets and whatever else.  It will take time and we do not expect improvements immediately, but there are some positive signs.</p></speech>

Initially, we wondered whether we might be telling parents that their children are overweight and telling them what overweight looks like.  However, when we researched the topic with parents, they said they knew that but they needed to know what to do.  They wanted practical messages.  <br/><br/>The campaign has very practical messages, such as one needs to reduce one's portion size.  A five year old child needs half of what an adult needs.  People need to drink more water rather than fizzy drinks and cordials which often contain unnecessary amounts of sugar.  Physical activity must be increased and a child needs 60 minutes of physical activity a day, which is a very practical message and which has rolled out well.  Treats need to be reduced.  We found from those messages regarding portion sizes, for example, that one in five had thought about making changes and one in three had made changes and had stopped the child from eating everything on the plate, which is a start, because we are coming from that mentality.  <br/><br/>Consumption of water at mealtimes has increased considerably, by 10% in the Republic and 15% in Northern Ireland.  These are all claimed behaviours but they are a start.  The proportion of people who say treats are being given once a day has dropped by 8%, from 40% to 32%, and one in three have tried to increase their physical activity.  We have also found an increase in the comfort factor, with an increase of 7% in the percentage of people now able to discuss the fact that their child may be overweight.  <br/><br/>The level of acknowledgement that health risks may present at a later age has also increased by 6%.  That is a considerable change because we know that people have a disconnect regarding health risk.  Illnesses like diabetes, heart disease and cancers, which are the three pieces we have added to the communication as risk factors for later in life, are now being considered.  It is a slow burn, but that is where we are at the moment and there are positive signs.<br/><br/>Regarding the C2DE grouping, our buying for this campaign is heavily weighted towards what people in this group are watching and where they are.  For example, our CEO said that he had not seen the sleep ad yet, and I told him he would not have unless he had been watching &quot;Keeping Up With the Kardashians&quot;.  The television ads are on particular stations at particular times, when we know that our audience is watching.  Social media also plays an important role in their lives, particularly YouTube and Facebook, so we have advertising across those platforms.  Our Twitter channel and, in particular, our Facebook channel are reaching numbers of about 600,000 on an average three-week period in the campaign.  We are also in places like <i>MummyPages.ie</i>, <i>eumom.ie</i>, and <i>NI4Kids.com</i>, which are where these people are having conversations with one another about their children.</p></speech>

If local authorities state in their development plan that no fast food outlet may be located close to schools, that can be done.  It is about getting the relevant councillors in the local authorities across the State and beyond to put that into their county development plans.  It would be a very good idea.  Fast food provides cheap quantity and is almost instant.  For low income families, who may not have education regarding diet and so forth, all those factors contribute to making it attractive.</p> <p>  Another problem with young kids who become obese is that their bodies become dependent.  I was reading an article recently that stated that once the body has that dependency, while one might lose weight temporarily, it comes back almost instantly unless one defeats it at an early age.  That comes back to education of the parent by the GP and getting that message across.  I have 12 grandchildren.  One of them is a little obese, but the rest are grand.  We are lucky because we do not live near a fast food outlet and we live in a country area.  It starts with the relationship between the GP and the parents and the responsibility the parents must take for the child's development.</p></speech>

The W82GO programme has been developed by Temple Street Children's Hospital and is being rolled out in these pilot schools.  To return to the question on "Operation Transformation", that is how we are handling the children's aspect of that.  It is much more sensitive, so it needs to be done in that contained environment, as opposed to on a television programme where people choose to put themselves forward.</p></speech>

It has obviously helped fuel the obesity crisis we have compared with a decade or so ago.</p><p>The quality of food in many canteens can be lacking.  Have the witnesses any research on the impact of this?  Many schools are now very aware and we have made huge inroads in ensuring the food is healthy.  We have talked about the sugar tax, which is an issue, but where do we stand with vending machines in schools?  We have heard many anecdotes about people being against them.  It is a bit like Deputy Ferris's issue regarding fast food outlets near schools.</p><p>I lost about two stone myself and, from a community point of view, I spent about six months explaining to people that I was not sick.  There was huge peer pressure.  I know one lady whose goal in life is to put on an extra two stone.  I feel much better.  I went down two clothes sizes and one incentive for me was buying new suits and so on.  We have this conservation grant and everything comes back to pounds, shillings and pence.  Is there any incentive we can give, such as a voucher system such that if someone loses two or three pounds, they could get a One4All voucher or some other kind of voucher?  I know it is very controversial, but could any incentive be offered?</p><p>A lot of good work has been done, but unfortunately we are failing.  More young people are becoming obese.  In the past ten to 15 years we increased by ten pounds on average.  It will put major pressure on our health system from the point of view of finances and resources.  People ask whether we are mad.  There is no silver bullet, but there needs to be some incentive.  I look forward to hearing the views of the witnesses.</p><p> I refer to the recommendations from members.  We would welcome the witnesses coming back with recommendations for the committee which we could pass up the line.  I look forward to the responses.</p></speech>

We would be delighted to come back with recommendations from our discussions today.  Last year we were in the throes of putting together our corporate plan and great pressure was put on us to include targets.  In terms of obesity targets, we were told by the clinical experts that if we maintained the same level of obesity in 2016 as we had in 2014 or 2015, we would have done a great job.  I found it very sad that one would get plaudits for maintaining the same level of obesity.  I will ask Dr. Foley-Nolan to discuss schools, sleep in regard to screen time and that kind of thing.</p></speech>

The gaming issue is related to marketing, which is being extended.  The very innocent adverts from Cadbury 30 years ago have changed and companies now use ICT and television in participative things like gaming.  We have done research on the area.  The project was called Candy-coated Marketing and examined the level of exposure of preschool children to unhealthy products.  Needless to say, there is very little advertising for apples or grapes.  Keeping children sedentary, decreasing their activity levels and what they are exposed to in gaming are all relevant in terms of childhood obesity.</p> <p>  The Government's plan is at an advanced stage and I am a member of an obesity strategy group.  Consultation will take place in the next few weeks.  Vending machines and what is happening in schools is very much to the fore and is being actively debated.  I am afraid that the idea of a financial incentive has not been on the agenda.  I appreciate the logic.  Plateauing can been seen in a negative way.  During my career I have been involved in tobacco and HIV, and now the obesity issue.  If one wanted to get depressed, it would be easy to do so.</p> <p>  The temporal trends are very nice.  There are slideshows of the different states in the United States that show the level of obesity growing over the past ten years.  To stop that is a start.  Although it seems somewhat negative, one has to have a level of optimism as well as realism.  The temporal trends are an increasing graph upwards.  The first thing we have to do is halt the increase and get the green shoots.</p></speech>

The message we are currently playing shows a child who goes to bed at night but has a game in his or her hand.  His or her shadow is thrown onto the wall and one can see his or her girth increasing as he or she increases in age and continues to play a Nintendo or watch television.  We are suggesting that parents make the bedroom a game-free zone and charge all screens in another room.  It is quite a critical message and some of the pieces we have heard to date indicate that people are delighted to have this evidence because they need it to tell their children to get screens out of the room.  Parents are quite happy to have a strong message.</p> <p>  On the incentive end of things, I have heard that insurance companies are starting to consider that.  It would be a positive way of doing it.</p></speech>

I am pleased to be here today to bring these public hearings on the general scheme of a new public health (alcohol) Bill 2015 to a close.  Before I start, I would like to remind the committee that at the start of the year the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch and I set out our 25 actions for the year and grouped them around five themes.  First among those themes was Healthy Ireland, followed by patient outcomes and safety, the first steps towards universal health care, investment in infrastructure and facilities, and reform.</p> <p>  The reason we put Healthy Ireland at the top is that we strongly believe we need to improve our health as individuals and as a nation.  If we do not do that we will never get on top of chronic disease problems and illnesses that we have and will certainly never get the health budget under control in the long term.  This will involve a number of different actions.  The Healthy Ireland survey is now under way and we will have the first figures in the summer.  This is the first study of Ireland's health since Sl&aacute;n in 2007.  We will repeat that study every year to see if our policies are working.  There will also be specific actions on obesity and an event next Monday at Farmleigh to which I hope committee members are invited.  The committee members will be familiar with the actions taken on tobacco already.  There will also be a new sexual health strategy before the end of the year along with the national physical activity plan.  Alcohol fits into all that as part of a general drive towards better public and individual health.</p> <p>  I commend the Chairman, Deputy Jerry Buttimer, the members of the committee, other members of the Oireachtas who participated in these hearings, and all the invited guests on the sensible and constructive approach that we have witnessed over the past few weeks.   My officials and I have found the presentations and insights presented by the witnesses very useful.  I am confident that these submissions and the report the committee will produce will greatly assist me and my officials in the drafting of the final legislation.  </p> <p>  I am sure the committee members will agree that Ireland has a serious problem &ndash; we drink too much alcohol.  The consumption of alcohol in Ireland increased by 192% between 1960 and 2001, from an average of 4.9 litres of pure alcohol per adult to 14.3 litres at peak.  Even though this is a problem going back decades and centuries, it is much worse than it was before the 1960s.  Since this peak in 2001, alcohol consumption has reduced and in 2013 alcohol consumption per adult was 10.64 litres.  Ireland&rsquo;s alcohol consumption remains in the top five among the EU 28 member states. The European region has the highest consumption in the world.  Early statistics indicate that alcohol consumption increased in 2014 from 10.6 litres to 11 litres per person, which is worrying as it suggests that a feature of the recovering economy is going to be an increase in alcohol consumption as more people get back to work and have more money in their pockets.  It is a certainty that alcohol consumption will continue to grow as the economy grows in the absence of any policy change and that is part of why these measures are so important.</p> <p>  As a country, when we drink, we tend to binge drink.  I doubt many of us in this room are entirely innocent of that.  It is very much part of our culture.  Patterns of drinking, especially drinking to intoxication, play an important role in causing alcohol-related harm.  The evidence suggests that a majority of Irish drinkers engage in excessive or problematic drinking behaviours and that Irish drinkers underestimate their alcohol intake.  Ireland was second in the WHO European region in binge drinking with 39% of the population misusing alcohol in this manner at least monthly.  </p> <p>  Our most recent national alcohol consumption survey was published by the Health Research Board last year.  It found that 54% of drinkers were classified as harmful drinkers; 75% of all alcohol consumed was done as part of a binge drinking session; and Irish drinkers underestimate how much they drink by about 61%.  The study also shows that more than half of adult drinkers in the population are classified as harmful drinkers, and this figure does not include 20.6% of the population who abstain.  When the proportion of survey respondents who are classified as harmful drinkers is applied to the population, this equates with between 1.3 and 1.4 million harmful drinkers in the country. </p> <p>  Harmful drinking is more common among men than women, and most common among 18 to 24 year olds.  In this category a staggering 75% drink in a harmful way.  In addition, a considerable proportion of self-defined light, moderate or social drinkers drink six or more standard drinks on a typical drinking occasion.  This is the equivalent of binge drinking.  Even these light or social drinkers do not realise that they consume alcohol in an unhealthy manner.</p> <p>  The findings of this study lead to the conclusion that, among the drinking population, harmful drinking is the norm in Ireland, in particular for men and women under 35.  I am aware that over the past weeks the committee has listened to numerous speakers who have presented on the kinds of damage that alcohol misuse of this magnitude does to the drinker, families, communities and society and the economy.</p> <p>  The general scheme of the Bill was published last February and my Department is now drafting the Bill.  It is my intention to have the Bill ready before the summer recess and introduced in the Houses of the Oireachtas in autumn.  This legislation is the most far-reaching proposed by any Irish Government, with alcohol being addressed for the first time as a public health measure.  The significance of that might not have been fully understood by many people.  This is health legislation, rather than justice or enterprise legislation, so the regulations will be signed by the Minister for Health and will come from a health point of view.  The enterprise Minister would be coming from more of a consumer and competition point of view and the justice Minister from a criminal justice point of view.</p> <p>  The Bill is part of a comprehensive package of measures to reduce excessive patterns of alcohol consumption as set out in the steering group report on a national substance misuse strategy.  It is also one of the measures being taken under the Healthy Ireland framework.  The aim is to reduce alcohol consumption in Ireland to 9.1 litres per person per annum - the western world average - by 2020, to reduce binge drinking in particular and to reduce the harms associated with alcohol.  I believe the legislative measures contained in the Bill are necessary if we are to achieve this aim and change our relationship with alcohol.  The Bill includes provisions for minimum unit pricing to eliminate cheap alcohol from supermarkets; structural separation in shops to reduce availability and visibility; labelling on alcohol products; restrictions on the advertising and marketing of alcohol; regulation of sports sponsorship; and enforcement powers for environmental health officers.</p> <p>  Addressing the price of alcohol is an important component of any long-term approach to tackling alcohol misuse.  The price of alcohol is linked to consumption levels and levels of alcohol-related harms.  The World Health Organization states that there is &ldquo;indisputable evidence that the price of alcohol matters.  If the price of alcohol goes up, alcohol-related harm goes down.&rdquo;  Despite Ireland having relatively high excise duty, alcohol remains very affordable, particularly in supermarkets.  A woman can reach her low-risk weekly drinking limit for just &euro;6.30, while a man can reach this weekly limit for less than &euro;10.</p> <p>  The public health (alcohol) Bill will make it illegal to sell or advertise for sale alcohol at a price below a set minimum price, essentially a floor price for alcohol.  Minimum unit pricing, MUP, sets a minimum price per gram of alcohol.  The minimum price of an alcohol product shall be based on the number of grams of alcohol in the product.  I know that Dr. John Holmes and Dr. Colin Angus from the University of Sheffield delivered an excellent presentation on minimum unit pricing and the study they carried out in Ireland.  Suffice to say that the study provided robust evidence that minimum unit pricing policies would be effective in reducing alcohol consumption, alcohol harms including alcohol-related deaths, hospitalisations, crimes and workplace absences and the costs associated with those harms.</p><p> The study also showed that minimum unit pricing would only have a small impact on alcohol consumption for low risk drinkers.  Somewhat larger impacts would be experienced by increasing risk drinkers, with the most substantial effects being experienced by high risk drinkers.  This is because minimum unit pricing is aimed at those who drink in a harmful and hazardous manner.  Alcohol products which are strong and cheap are those favoured by the heaviest drinkers, who are most at risk of alcohol-related illness and death and young people who have the least disposable income.  Minimum unit pricing is not expected to affect the price of alcohol in the on-trade in the main.  However, it will prevent large multiple retailers from absorbing increases in excise rates and from using alcohol as a loss leader.  Officials in my Department are also looking at possible mechanisms to ensure that some of the financial benefits of minimum unit pricing may flow back to the Exchequer, although if it succeeds in significantly reducing consumption, there may not be any financial benefit.</p><p> Some members have been calling for a ban on below-cost selling instead of minimum unit pricing.  I would like to take the opportunity to clarify why minimum unit pricing is more effective than a ban on below-cost selling.  First of all, there is no agreed definition of below-cost selling in Ireland or how it could be calculated.  If it is interpreted as alcohol being sold below VAT and excise duty then very little alcohol is sold at this price in Ireland.  The University of Sheffield study found that a ban on below-cost selling would have a negligible impact on alcohol consumption and related harms.  Working out a cost price that incorporates other costs such as manufacturing, transportation and retailing is a complex, expensive and perhaps inaccurate exercise.  Banning below-cost selling would be difficult to implement, monitor and enforce.  MUP is easier to understand, measure and enforce than a ban on below cost selling</p><p> Others have been calling for a general increase in excise rates.  However, further increases in excise rates would render premium and higher-priced alcohol more expensive, which is unnecessary for the purpose of targeting hazardous and harmful drinkers, who purchase larger quantities of cheap alcohol.  It would be just another tax.  A tax increase would not necessarily have the same effect as a compulsory minimum price, because of the risk that taxes would not be passed on in full.  However, minimum unit pricing prevents large multiple retailers, or any retailers, from absorbing increases in excise rates and from using alcohol as a loss leader.</p><p> The appropriate minimum unit pricing will be chosen taking into account estimates from the report of the University of Sheffield and in consultation with the relevant Departments.  The price needs to be set at a level the evidence indicates will reduce the burden of harm from alcohol use.  In short, it needs to be high enough to eliminate very cheap alcohol but not so high that it affects the price of a glass of wine in the pizzeria.</p><p> We must also take into account what Northern Ireland does, so that we do not create a new issue around cross-Border trade.  I know that many members are concerned about the impact that MUP might have on cross-border trade.  The Minister for Health in Northern Ireland, Jim Wells, MLA, has also announced plans to introduce minimum unit pricing for alcohol.  My officials are in contact with their counterparts in the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety on the matter and we are cognisant of the requirement to work together with the North on the implementation of minimum unit pricing.</p><p> Finally, I will give the committee an update on the current European court case regarding minimum unit pricing.  Last February, the Scottish Inner Court of Sessions, Scotland&rsquo;s highest court, referred a number of questions on minimum unit pricing to the European Court of Justice.  The court is due to hold a hearing on this case on 6 May and we expect a judgment by the end of the year.  We intervened in this case and the relevant officials will be attending the hearing in Luxembourg.  We are hopeful that minimum unit pricing will be found to be compatible with EU treaties and rules and it is therefore important that all the necessary steps have been put in place to commence the legislation, if enacted.  However, it is a risk and the court will have to decide which is more important: public health or eliminating barriers to free trade.  It is noteworthy that the EU was initially established as a common market, the European Economic Community, a trade-based organisation, rather than one based on public health.  We will fight as hard as we can to ensure the court makes the right decision.</p><p> Moving on to the regulation of marketing and advertising, protecting children from exposure to alcohol marketing is an important public health goal.  There is a compelling body of research which shows that exposure to alcohol marketing, whether it is on TV, in movies, in public places or through alcohol branded sponsorship, predicts future youth drinking.  Numerous longitudinal studies have found that young people who are exposed to alcohol marketing are more likely to start drinking, or if already drinking, to drink more.  Research also shows that self-regulation is not able to protect young people from exposure to large volumes of alcohol marketing and appealing alcohol advertising.</p><p> The public health (alcohol) Bill will make it illegal to market or advertise alcohol in a manner that is appealing to children.  It provides for the making of regulations on the marketing and advertising of alcohol and includes provisions for restrictions on broadcast marketing and advertising, cinema advertising, outdoor advertising, print media and the regulation of sponsorship by alcohol companies.  This will encompass major sporting events for the first time by putting the existing code of practice for sponsorship by drinks companies on a legal footing with enforcement powers and penalties.  The legislation will contain a commitment that the provisions on marketing and advertising will be reviewed after three years.</p><p> On labelling, research shows that accurate information on the alcohol content of specific beverages is essential to promote awareness of alcohol intake.  However, "standard drink" units are widely misunderstood by the general public.  In order to address this, the Bill will provide that labels on alcohol products will contain health warnings, including for pregnancy; the amount of pure alcohol as measured in grams; and the calorie count.  Under the Bill, pubs and restaurants will also be obliged to provide this information to customers for alcohol products sold on draught or in measures, e.g. pints, glasses of wine and measures of spirits.  Finally, health warnings will also have to be included on all promotional material.</p><p> From a merchandising perspective, at the moment the Minister for Justice and Equality and I are examining the best way to implement the separation of alcohol products from other products in mixed trading premises.  Our aim is to ensure that alcohol products cannot be displayed like ordinary grocery products, but will be subject to strict merchandising requirements.  We want to do it in a manner that is not too onerous on retailers and that will not impose excessive cost on them in order to comply.</p><p> The public health (alcohol) Bill will be enforced by environmental health officers.  Provisions to be enforced include minimum unit pricing; health labelling; the control of marketing and advertising; structural separation of alcohol from other products; and regulations relating to the sale, supply and consumption of alcohol products under section 16 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008.  These pertain to restrictions on advertising, promoting, selling or supplying alcohol at reduced prices or free of charge.</p><p> To conclude, I believe that the public health (alcohol) Bill will act as a powerful enabler for a healthier relationship with alcohol in Ireland.  I know some people believe the measures do not go far enough, but I am confident that it is a bold and major step in the right direction.  As I said earlier, I will seek Government approval to publish the Bill before the summer recess and plan to initiate it in the Houses of the Oireachtas in the autumn.</p><p> I thank the Chairman and all of those who have participated in these public hearings for the valuable contribution they have made to this issue and for the assistance they have provided to me and my officials in the work that lies ahead.  I look forward to receiving the committee's report and reflecting it in the legislation as published.</p></speech>

I should at this juncture welcome to our meeting our guests for the second part of our presentation, namely Mr. Ian O'Sullivan and Ms Eimear Murphy from Col&aacute;iste Treasa in Kanturk, who are the BT Young Scientists of the Year 2015.  They will be contributing to the second part of our meeting.  We also welcome their families and school community to the meeting and thank them for being here this morning.  As members know, their study for the Young Scientist exhibition dealt with the impact of parental alcohol consumption on the drinking behaviour of children and adolescents, which makes it appropriate for what we are discussing this morning.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-23a.3383" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/969" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015042300002#F00300"><p>I am of the view that every one of us as legislators has a common goal in addressing this issue, namely, to secure a significant reduction in the use of alcohol across the population and want every effort to be employed to create a greater knowledge and awareness, particularly among the younger cohort in the population, of the dangers that alcohol abuse presents in the life of any citizen.  The Minister referred to the fact that some of us are arguing for this or for that.  I just want to state that the difference in terms of approach and ideas does not indicate on any of our parts, the Minister's included, any lack of resolve.  It is about what we think may work best.</p><p>I give the Minister the assurance that, even without sight of the legislation, which the Minister has yet to publish, I am not going to be an obstacle to the passage of this legislation, although I am not sold on the certainty of the introduction of minimum unit pricing.  As legislators, we have a job of work to do on this matter, and my colleagues and I will be full participants in seeking to arrive at the best position.  We will not be an obstacle to any address going forward.</p><p> The Minister spoke about different studies and figures.  He mentioned the 20.6% of the population who abstain, but are not included in the Health Research Board's figures which show that more than half of adult drinkers in the population are classified as harmful drinkers.  Can the Minister indicate whether the consumption figures of 10.6 litres per adult in 2013 and 11 litres per adult in 2014 include abstainers, and that the figures are for the general adult population?  It is my observation as a citizen that figures for average consumption fall far short of the reality for so many of our people.  I believe it would be staggering for many if the real picture was exposed.  It is way up the scale from 11 litres per person, for those who are using alcohol as part of their weekly practices.  Just to be absolutely clear, I include myself in that.  Could the Minister comment on that? It is important to point out that Irish drinkers underestimate their alcohol intake and it would be helpful if we could all be exposed to the true facts.  It might also be of help in winning greater public acceptance of the need to address this very serious matter.  The Minister makes the point that drinkers underestimate their alcohol intake by 61%.  That may be, and it may be much more than that.  </p><p> The Minister said the Bill would be ready before the summer recess.  Will the Minister clarify whether individual Members will have sight of it, and does "ready" mean "published"? He talks about the Bill being addressed in the Houses in the autumn, but will Members have sight of it before the recess?  The Bill includes provisions for minimum unit pricing, structural separation in shops, health labelling on alcohol products, restrictions on advertising, regulations on sports sponsorship and enforcement powers for environmental health officers.  There are other views, but I am concerned that the minimum unit pricing approach is not the panacea.  I know it is one of a number of items, and of course there has to be a package - I fully support that - but when the Minister makes the point-----</p></speech>

The Minister makes the point that minimum unit pricing is aimed at those who drink in a harmful and hazardous manner.  I do not believe that will necessarily be the result.  My assessment is that it will mostly affect those on lower income levels.  If one looks at the current cost versus the suggested minimum unit pricing which will result from this legislation, one can see that it most certainly targets drink products which are used mostly by people on low to medium incomes.  Maybe some of those are people who depend on social protection, but I do not believe that the issue of alcohol misuse, and all the terrible negatives that come from it, are confined to one social class.  I fear we are not addressing this in the most holistic way.  I will be addressing the issue through regulation of below-cost selling, which was rejected by the Minister.  I do believe it has to be based on the invoice price, and I believe it is absolutely a sustainable solution that should be part of the overall approach.  I have had negative reactions to my arguments for considering increased excise duties on alcohol, and I know it is not popular.  We need to ring-fence money to address the serious social problems in our communities - to educate people and provide supports for those who are wrestling with serious alcohol abuse and those who are the victims of family members' abuse of alcohol - irrespective of where we are from or where we live.  It is right across the board.  Although I am mindful of what the reaction would be, I make no apology for suggesting increases in excise duties.  It is not for the sole purpose of making alcohol more expensive, but to utilise the additional revenue in the most focused way.  I believe this is essential, and it needs to be confirmed in this legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-23a.3387" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1171" speakername="Jillian van Turnhout" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015042300002#G00500"><p>The Minister is very welcome to the committee.  I have written two European papers on alcohol-related harm.  I was asked to do one of them by the Swedish Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  It  gave me an opportunity to present to the then Minister, whom I could not meet in my role at the time as chief executive of the Children's Rights Alliance.  I am delighted this is being framed as a public health issue.  I believe it is critically important.  There is really strong support for this Bill.  Most contact I have with individuals and organisations is about how we can go further and what more we can do.  We have had too much talk about alcohol and we now need to ensure there is legislative change.</p> <p>  I differ from my colleague Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in on minimum unit pricing, but I do respect his views and we have had our discussions.  We have listed to impressive presentations by Dr. John Holmes and Mr. Colin Angus from the University of Sheffield.  I am convinced on the issue so I will not use my time today on that.</p> <p>  I am concerned that the plan to place the voluntary code for sports sponsorship onto a legal footing is not strong enough.  Let us look back at how the voluntary code came into place.  In 2003, draft legislation had been prepared by the Government and had gone to Cabinet for approval, when all of a sudden the voluntary code was brought in.  The Children's Rights Alliance submission to this committee states: "It is worth noting that the text of the voluntary code mirrors exactly that produced by the industry, including grammatical errors."  I hope the industry does not have the same influence now.  The committee has had presentations on the issue of the voluntary code.  I draw the Minister's attention to audience profiling.  An example was given to the committee about a rugby match and the 25% rule.  I suggest to the Minister that it could be reduced to 10%.  Obviously I would prefer stronger enforcement, or that it was not in the way, but if we are going to do something then we should make it 10%.</p><p>Children are clearly being targeted with that 25%.  We should remove it as much as possible.</p><p> We must also consider digital and online marketing, which seem absent from this proposal.  A few years ago, Diageo announced that 21% of its marketing budget was going towards online marketing.  Recently, Finland introduced legislation banning alcohol apps that contained games, location settings and information on where the nearest place to drink was.  Clearly, these are targeted at children.  It is social engagement.  A young person who visits Youtube sees advertisements for alcohol that I do not see.  I know this from when my nephews and nieces show me clips on Youtube or other social media.  Children are being targeted.  I do not get the same advertisements.  I tend to get the weight loss ones and so forth that seem to target my age demographic.  Children get the alcohol ones.  This is telling and we should be well aware of it.</p><p> Who will carry out the regulation of alcohol marketing and enforcement of penalties?  Will it continue to be the Alcohol Marketing Communications Monitoring Body, AMCMB?  Will the Minister discuss section 16 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act with the Department of Justice and Equality?  It relates to the making of regulations on advertising and promoting.  Perhaps we could commence the section immediately.</p><p> An issue is absent from the Bill that many presentations raised with us, namely, sports sponsorship.  I do not understand why we do not simply set a date.  It is inevitable.  It is telling that neither sports organisations nor the drinks industry will give us figures for sports sponsorship.  Yesterday morning, I attended an interesting briefing given by Ms Katherine Brown of the Institute of Alcohol Studies, IAS, and organised by Alcohol Action Ireland.  She stated, "Alcohol sponsorship of sport is a gateway to children's bedroom doors".  She referred to the posters of our sporting heroes on bedroom doors.  It is a child protection issue.</p><p> What the Minister is doing in respect of labelling is welcome.  At a conference organised by Alcohol Action Ireland on Tuesday, there was an interesting presentation on whether the health warnings should include cancer warnings.  Clear evidence was given in a similar fashion to that in respect of tobacco.  Is this something that the Minister should consider?</p><p> The issue of section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act also arose.  It relates to the separation of alcohol products.  The National Off-Licence Association, NOFFLA, outlined an easy way of doing this.  It provided an architect's diagrams and the like.  It is not as great a difficulty as one might believe.  Why can we not commence this section immediately?</p><p> I was concerned by the emphasis placed on the role of education in some of the submissions to the committee.  They tended to be those linked to the drinks industry.  Education informs our behaviour, but it does not change it.  I cited the example of picking up our mobile telephones while driving.  In the Minister's previous role, he introduced a law and we changed behaviour because people did not want to get caught.  I know that I should not pick up my telephone, but I swear at the Minister at least once per day when I go to pick it up, only to stop because I do not want to get caught.  I know it is wrong, but legislation is necessary.</p></speech>

It is in the boot.  I am concerned about Drink Aware advertising for an education programme manager to visit our schools.  It is an issue for the Department of Education and Skills, but it is also an issue for the Department of Health, which is helping with the SPHE programme.  The HSE has done good work in this regard.  Drink Aware and the drinks industry have no role in our schools.</p></speech>

Have they given him a firm commitment that these will be introduced?  Has he or his officials discussed at what level the minimum prices will be set in Northern Ireland?  My constituency of Louth borders Northern Ireland.  It is important that the regions' minimum unit prices be set at comparable levels.</p> <p>  Proper labelling regarding the health effects of alcohol is vital.  The Minister plans to introduce three pieces of labelling to alcohol products, namely, health warnings, the amount of pure alcohol as measured in grams and the calorie count.  I agree with this plan.  As the Minister rightly pointed out, standard units are widely misunderstood.  If information was displayed on labelling, it would go a long way towards helping consumers make informed decisions on their alcohol consumption.</p></speech>

I will focus on one or two points.  A recent publication by Dr. Orla Crosbie of Cork University Hospital addressed liver damage and cirrhosis of the liver and how the situation had changed in the past 20 years.  Approximately 40% of patients in these categories now are female whereas there would have been few or no female patients 20 years ago.  A frightening finding in the study is that many of these females are young mothers with young children.</p> <p>  I will focus on section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, to which my colleague, Senator van Turnhout, referred.  I raised it as a Commencement matter in the Seanad this week.  If we publish legislation at the end of July, it will have gone through the process by November or December.  Implementation will take a further six to 12 months.  Why can we not consider section 9 of the 2008 Act, which clearly set out the question of the segregation of alcohol products?  According to the Minister's submission, there is an ongoing discussion with the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Can we not implement section 9?  The legislation is already in place.  Section 9 could be implemented by 1 January of next year.  If we go through this legislative process, however, it will take at least a further 12 months.  Why can we not agree what needs to be done in respect of section 9 so that the industry can prepare for it and there can be a clear timeline?  Currently, there is no timeline or any guarantee that we will have passed this legislation by December.  The structures that we have discussed establishing will not be in place by the time the next general election comes around.  As such, there is no guarantee that the legislation will not be changed immediately afterwards.  Section 9 already exists.  We can implement it.  If we put a timeline up to 1 January in place, we will have implemented some change instead of living with the current ifs and buts.  Will the Minister's Department and the Department of Justice and Equality consider my suggestion?</p></speech>

I have two questions.  Are there plans for the regulation of the proximity of off-licences to schools, cr&egrave;ches, youth clubs and resource centres?  I believe the current requirement is 100 m.  I will cite an example of a school in Youghal.  People can come out the front gate, walk across the zebra crossing and go straight through the door of an off-licence.  This situation needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  Will the Minister consider raising the age for purchasing alcohol to 21 years in off-licences while leaving it at 18 years where people can drink responsibly in pubs?  It is less likely that 21, 22 and 23 year olds will purchase alcohol for 16 and 17 year olds.  This suggestion widens the age gap.</p></speech>

The proposed legislation is also welcome and the feedback on it has been positive, but perhaps it does not go far enough.  I will air two issues.</p><p>Obviously, they have been raised previously.  We must grasp the nettle of sports sponsorship as it relates to this area and at least start the process of stopping that area of sports sponsorship.  The other issue, mentioned by Senator van Turnhout, is online advertising.  These are two important aspects.  The proposed legislation needs to be strengthened to take account of these two areas.</p></speech>

I commend the Minister on what is probably one of the most progressive pieces of public health legislation, certainly in the lifetime of the Government.  In conjunction with the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Act 2015, it is up there with the previous legislation on the smoking ban in public houses.  In years to come, we will be able to measure the public health dividend from legislation such as this.  We are certainly trespassing on powerful commercial vested interests in the drinks sector and retail outlets for alcohol.</p> <p>  I wanted to raise specifically the issue of sports sponsorship to which Deputy Healy and others have alluded.  I have spoken to the Minister about this and written to him on it as well after the Government decision to proceed with the legislation.  Is there something slightly contradictory in the proposed legislation as envisaged not dealing with the issue of sports sponsorship?  In his speech the Minister stated, "There is a compelling body of research which shows that exposure to alcohol marketing, whether it is on TV, in movies, in public places or alcohol branded sponsorship, predicts future youth drinking."  There is a lot of funding in advertising.  Senator van Turnhout referred to the online marketing budget making up 21% of Diageo's total marketing budget.  I have heard the Minister rail against the criticism of one specific aspect, which criticism blindly ignores the many progressive areas the legislation deals with.  Is there a danger that as we close off a number of avenues for advertising in particular areas, the closing off of which is welcome, this budget will find its way in greater volumes into sports sponsorship?  If the Minister closes off advertising in cinemas, on billboards and on television at particular times, this money will seek an outlet elsewhere.  It is like the laws of gravity.  It will find an outlet somewhere else.  There is a danger that greater sums of money will be poured into sports sponsorship.  It is not a benevolent gesture by the drinks sector to sponsor sports.  It does it because it recognises there is a return on such investment.  This is the Achilles heel of this progressive legislation.  I would like the Minister to consider that, and while I do not expect a definitive answer on it now, I am aware he is open to further consideration of the issue.</p> <p>  On the argument of minimum unit pricing versus below-cost selling, Senator Colm Burke referred to the fact that with the best will in the world, passing the proposed legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas and producing the various regulations that will follow mean it is likely to be two years before we will have some gain from it.  Is there a case to be made for banning below-cost selling of alcohol under the groceries order or the legislation that banned below-cost selling as an interim measure while we await legal clarity from the European courts on minimum unit pricing, the concept of which I support?  It would be quite easy for us to take such an interim measure.</p></speech>

I want to raise one issue.  I want to highlight the importance of this in another area, that is, mental illness.  Alcohol affects those who have some form of mental illness and it compounds the situation.  Alcohol damages the brain cells and is a cause of certain mental illnesses.  A recent study in one of our counties found that 36% had consumed alcohol at the time they had taken their life.  Another study found that half of those under 35 who committed suicide in three countries had alcohol in their bloodstream as well.  It is accepted internationally that alcohol plays a role in the area of self-harm and suicide.  The World Health Organization states that a person who is currently abusing alcohol is eight times more likely to die by suicide than if he or she was not.</p> <p>  Mental ill health is a vast area, especially in young people.  For example, the brains of those in their teens are developing and alcohol inhibits or affects that.  There can be life-lasting effects if there is a high consumption of alcohol by young people whose bodies are in the development stage, and their brain is part of their bodies.  That has been well researched internationally.</p> <p>  The area of those who have suicidal ideation but are inhibited in taking their lives is also well researched internationally.  Taking alcohol can remove that inhibition.  We often hear of persons who were in great form at a disco and they were never seen in better form, and they have drink taken.  After a certain amount of drink, they look at taking their own lives and they are less inhibited.  Often they go home and take their lives.  We all are aware of such cases.  People are very confused about why something like that would happen but a lot of it has to do with alcohol consumption by those who have a level of mental unwellness.  There is a continuum of what constitutes mental illness.  Not all mental unwellness is mental illness.  This is an area in which we can help in assisting the work of suicide prevention organisations and the office of suicide prevention of the HSE.  The Minister can, through this proposed legislation, contribute to assisting such work in trying to reduce the levels of suicide, self-harming and suicide ideation.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister, Dr. Holohan and Ms Luddy for attending.  I thank the Minister for his speech.  I wholeheartedly support minimum unit pricing.  One of my questions, which has already been asked, was how long it would take to put this in place.</p> <p>  I have two other questions.  The first relates to the structural separation in shops and supermarkets and, I hope, in petrol stations.  Who will supervise and monitor the visible availability of alcohol?  How will it be put in place?  The Minister stated that business would not be put under any extreme pressure if there were costs involved in making a separate area in a supermarket or petrol station.  One of the drawbacks, even in supermarkets and shops I have been in, is that there is a separate area for alcohol which used be at the back but which seems to be creeping up to the front where the service desk is.</p> <p>  How young people view alcohol is a result of the pressure on them which is caused by being unable to cope with many of the difficulties they face.</p><p>There is no mention of education in the report.  Maybe it will appear in another report.  I have heard people saying that education does not make any difference to people who want to drink.  As a mother, I have always spoken to my children about the ill effects of drink, drugs and smoking.  I have achieved some of my goals with them but not all.  If we are going to educate young people about the consumption of alcohol and drug addiction, it starts in the home but it must continue into school.  Is there anything in the Bill for schools and colleges?  I know from my children about the consumption of alcohol on so-called "cheap nights" where the price is a lot lower than it should be.  What about the sale and marketing of alcohol?   </p><p> Education should take place as early as primary school.  I met a little fellow a number of years ago.  He visited me in the youth club one night and I could see he was not in a nice place.  He had drunk a half a bottle of vodka before he came in and he should have been carted off in an ambulance.  Alcohol is readily available.  I welcome the introduction of minimum unit prices but I want to know how it is going to be monitored, particularly in stores, supermarkets and petrol stations.  If businesses are not prepared to pay the cost of moving drink in the aisles, how will it be tackled?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-23a.3405" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015042300002#K00200"><p>I hope I have jotted down all the questions and I am sorry if I miss any.  The analysis of Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in is totally correct.  It is 11 litres per person, but that includes the whole population, including the 20% of people who are teetotallers.  That brings the average down.  We have a higher proportion of teetotallers than other countries.  The intention is that the Bill will be published before the summer recess so that Members will be able to consider it over the recess and propose amendments, but that is not 100% under my control.  Things can get held up at the Office of the Attorney General or the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, meaning that it has to go back to Cabinet and committee, so I cannot promise it, but that is what we are working towards.  I want it to go through before this D&aacute;il and Seanad end.  A lot of work has been put into it and it would be a real shame if it fell to the next D&aacute;il to start from scratch or look at it again.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in made the point that a minimum unit price, MUP, may affect those on lowest incomes the most.  There is a grain of truth in that because people on lower incomes are more likely to buy low-cost alcohol and are therefore more likely to be affected by this measure, though that depends on how much they drink.  If they do not drink at all it does not affect them at all and if they drink a small amount it is only going to affect them to a small extent.  The corollary of that, however, is that people on low incomes are more likely to abuse alcohol and there is a correlation between social class and alcohol abuse.  Those on lower incomes and who are poorer are more likely to abuse alcohol.  In many ways, alcohol contributes to poverty and poverty contributes to alcohol.  Poverty might drive some people to alcohol and alcohol might cause poverty for others, because if one grows up in a household where one's parents abuse alcohol, surely one is much less likely to get a good start in life.  If one drinks heavily in school or college one is not going to do as well.  If one drinks as an adult one is going to miss work and is less likely to get promoted.  There probably is a correlation between poverty and alcohol and between inequality and alcohol, so the fact that it may affect that group more in some ways strengthens the argument for it, not from the point of view of disposable income but from the point of view of public health.</p> <p>  Among the groups that can be counted as low income are students and children.  Students and children do not have a lot of disposable cash and they buy really cheap alcohol with it, so it will affect them more, but it is kind of supposed to, as they are the ones who are most at risk of damaging their health, their mental health and everything else from alcohol consumption.</p> <p>  Senator van Turnhout and others asked about the code of conduct.  At the moment the code of conduct is voluntary and not legally enforceable.  That will be replaced by regulations, by statutory instruments, by law.  It is not that we are going to put the code on a statutory footing, which, as the Senator will know from her experience with Children First, does not necessarily work anyway.  It will be done by regulation and by law.  It will not then be voluntary but will be legally enforceable, and there will be penalties.  Even if the code is not changed - and I am not saying it cannot be strengthened - it will make a difference, because the current code is widely flouted.  For example, one is not supposed to associate alcohol advertising with speed but that is done all the time.  I am ashamed to admit I was at the Bavaria City Racing event.  How could one associate alcohol with high speed to a greater extent than that?  Some of the advertisements associate alcohol with sporting prowess - one drinks a certain beer and can throw a rugby ball or hit a light switch.  That is a total violation of the code.  A similar case is where a player is heading for the try line and the Guinness turns into a ball; he catches it and scores a try.  If he has had that many pints he is not going to be good at the violin or score a try.  In fact, he is more likely to drop the ball.  </p> <p>  We will certainly examine the possibility of using online advertising and apps, and I would be interested if the Senator could give me more information on what they have done in Finland in that regard.  I have a sense, though, that when it comes to online advertising we will only be able to deal with it on a European or an international level.  It is, after all, the World Wide Web.</p> <p>  Enforcement will be carried out by environmental health officers.  They are people who work for the HSE and are part of the health family.  They go into restaurants and shut them down when there are hygiene issues and they are very effective.  They go into the pubs and enforce the smoking ban, at which they are also pretty effective, and they also enforce the regulations around sunbeds.  They will be given this additional, very important role on alcohol.  They will need to be supported and to get an increase in resources.  They are a good bunch of people.  I do not think a lot of people around the country know what an environmental health officer is, but the job they do is enormously important and very valuable.</p> <p>  My understanding is that health labels will be dealt with by regulation and signed off by me as Minister in the same way as the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, signs off on road signs.  I agree that they should probably include a warning about cancer, because alcohol is a major contributory factor in liver cancer, oesophageal cancer and so many other cancers. </p> <p>  Deputy Neville and Senator van Turnhout asked about the commencement of the existing section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008.  That is legislation that belongs to the Department of Justice and Equality, so it would fall to the Minister for Justice and Equality to enact it.  There are two reasons it has not been enacted six or seven years later.  First, it is very onerous and requires a separate till and walls, which is perhaps is a little bit too onerous on some retail outlets.  Second and more significantly, there is no enforcement mechanism.  Even though it is a law, there are no powers to enforce it nor any penalties if it is breached, so it is an ineffectual piece of legislation and that is why it has not been commenced to date.  We will either have to bring in a mechanism to enforce it or just replace it with a new piece of legislation.</p> <p>  Deputy Fitzpatrick asked about the cross-Border issue, about which I am very aware.  We have a North-South sectoral meeting every four to six months with me, the Minister for Health, Mr. Jim Wells MLA and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly.  It is a standing item on the agenda.  We always ask how we are getting on with minimum unit pricing and we then have a discussion about it.  We have discussed the price but have not agreed one.</p> <p>  Deputy McLellan asked about off-licences and their proximity to schools and cr&egrave;ches.  That also falls under the Department of Justice and Equality and would be relevant to the sale of alcohol Bill and to licensing generally.  I think it would be a difficult thing to do.  I come from a very urban constituency and there is virtually nowhere that is not 100 m or 200 m from a cr&egrave;che or a school.  I would perhaps have to go to County Meath to buy a bottle of wine.  One could put it at 50 m or maybe 60 m.  One thing we will look at in that context, however, is whether we will allow advertising within a certain radius of a school.  Again, that will be tricky.</p><p>In urban west Dublin and in many urban areas, schools and cr&egrave;ches are very numerous.</p><p> Changing the age of purchase to 21 would fall under the Department of Justice and Equality legislation.  I would not be convinced as to whether raising the age to 21 would be a good idea and would have to see evidence to support it.</p><p> Deputy Creed spoke about sports sponsorship.  The legislation deals with sports sponsorship by regulating and restricting it very heavily.  However, we decided not to go for an outright ban for numerous reasons, most particularly that as no alternative funding source was identified, it would lead to a loss of income for sport which would then percolate down to local levels.</p></speech>

That is the bottom line.  Some people assume that minimum unit pricing will result in a revenue boost for the Exchequer.  I hope there will not be; I hope minimum unit pricing works to bring down consumption and therefore there is not an increase in revenue.  I actually hope the revenue goes down because if we get alcohol consumption down from 11 litres to 9 litres, that is 20% less alcohol sold so there will be a cost in pure accounting terms.  Obviously, there will be a longer-term gain from better health.</p></speech>

We did not submit a recommendation on sports sponsorship because there was not consensus in the committee.  However, it is the Achilles heel in the Bill.  Those of us involved in sport recognise the importance.  My club in Bishopstown has a bar that helps to fund the activities.  However, at one level it sends the wrong message.  At one level it is promoting public health which is very positive.  However, at the same time we are saying to the sporting organisations, albeit with modifications, that they can continue to get money from these people.  I know it is not the perfect answer.</p></speech>

The Minister was previously Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  If one looks at the iconic images of the visits of President Obama or Queen Elizabeth, they were taken with alcohol involved, which is a mistake.  At one level we are promoting public health.  However, we have issues with Arthur's Day and the emergency departments of our hospitals being full.  In my club, for example, the bar gives us revenue we could not get otherwise.  As a society we need to have a conversation about the message given by the association of alcohol with sport and young people.</p></speech>

I just wonder if there is a risk of going too far into a nanny state space in some of these things.  I will not rubbish the Chairman.  This legislation was bandied about Government for three or four years and it was not possible to get agreement on it.  We are in year five of the Parliament and I wanted to get good stuff done.  As I have said before, and I really mean it, the perfect is often the enemy of the good.  When people are willing to sign up for 85% of what we want we take the 85% and come back for the 15% later.  We will write into the legislation a review after three years.  It is a legislative requirement that the Minister three years after enactment will need to look at the issue and all these issues again.</p> <p>  Changes to the groceries order would need to be done by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  I would not have any objection to using it if that were agreed.  However, our concern is that it would not be effective for the reasons I outlined earlier.  It could also be challenged under competition law and consumer law.  It is a very old order and I am not sure if the primary legislation underpinning it has policies and principles and all the rest of it.</p> <p>  Deputy Catherine Byrne and some of the other contributors mentioned education.  I think there is a very strong role for education.  I am convinced that education on its own does not work, but as part of the package education is very important.  We have seen that with smoking and other things.  There have been very effective education approaches to that.  Perhaps officials from the health and well-being section of the HSE should talk to officials in the Department of Education and Skills about it to see if we can carry out a schools programme.  That would be a good idea.</p></speech>

That is not what the Bill should be about because it misses the point.  Students by and large have no or very little disposable income.  Drink abuse among low-income families and students is more in evidence because it happens in a more public way.  People are going from their homes to a pub.  That would be the case with students.  They are not buying in drink to drink in their homes.  They are not having the negative impact on dependants, young children and older children, and what they are exposed to.</p> <p>  Those who may well have the greatest problem in all this are those who can afford the more expensive alcohol products.  The Minister is not seeing the reality of the lives that they lead and the impact that their problems have on those who are dependent on them.  We need to recognise the raft of different social issues that require address in terms of people on low income and even the student population.  However, it is not about making their access to alcohol more expensive or even in some cases prohibitive.  That is not what the Bill is about.  It may be part of it, but there are many other measures that would make a difference to the lives of people in those circumstances.  We need to look at the issue holistically and not to take our eye off the biggest problem and that is the one that is least exposed in terms of alcohol.</p></speech>

The Minister has said that section 9 of the 2008 Act cannot be implemented.  My understanding is that section 9 is quite specific and that the Act contains provisions whereby if there is any breach of the legislation, fines can be imposed.  I do not understand why it cannot be implemented.  It may be looking for too much from retail outlets.  However, if we get the legislation published and passed by December it could still take a further 12 months for that part of the legislation to be put in place, resulting in a delayed process again.  That is why I am raising section 9.  Why can it not be considered?  We could use section 9 to set out clearly that segregation will come into place by a certain date even at this stage if the new legislation does not go through.  I am concerned about the timeframe issue.</p></speech>

There are penalties in the Intoxicating Liquor Act; however, there are no enforcement powers.  There is nobody who can enforce it, so we could commence it but it could not be enforced, which seems pretty pointless.  What would happen is that all the retailers would say they would wait until the new legislation comes through to see what they will have to do.  The timeline will be around 12 months.  One has to give reasonable notice to people to comply with the legislation.  If we can enact the legislation by the end of the year, giving people about one year's notice to comply with it, that would bring us up to the end of 2016, which is not all that far away.</p></speech>

The current retail code is rubbish, as it qualifies the provision by stating "as far as is practicable," and that is not enough.</p></speech>

I might ask the chief medical officer to comment on this, because he would be able to put across the research better that I would.  My understanding is that it is not only an issue of visibility, but the research does show that the low-income groups spend a higher proportion of their income on alcohol and drink more heavily.  It is not just that it is more visible, or that there are large numbers of wealthy people secretly drinking huge amounts of expensive alcohol.  The research does actually show that those on the lowest incomes are the ones who consume the most alcohol.  Unfortunately, that is so often true in health - it is known as the inverse care law.  Those who need the most health care get the least, and they are the people who always put themselves at the most risk as well.</p></speech>

It is a reality that the distribution across society of the burden of alcohol consumption is not even and falls disproportionately on lower social classes.  It is exactly the same as for all the major lifestyle-related risks, such as tobacco consumption, physical activity and obesity.  That then finds expression in patterns that we are all too familiar with.  We see that the burden of chronic disease falls disproportionately on people in lower social classes.  That is a result of the way in which alcohol consumption is distributed.</p> <p>  The other point that is relevant in the context of consumption patterns is that, of our figure of approximately 11 litres of alcohol purchased per year, which comes from Revenue statistics, the greater portion is purchased in off-licences rather than the on-trade.  Most alcohol that is consumed in this population is purchased in the off-trade.  The pattern of drinking among young people, with their limited income, is significantly facilitated by having access to cheap alcohol and their pattern of purchasing is to buy cheap alcohol from large multiples rather than in pubs.</p></speech>

The standalone off-licences are in a different situation because alcohol is their primary business.  In the mixed trading environment, particularly in large multiples, the ability of people to have access to large volumes of alcohol at very cheap prices is driving a significant pattern of consumption, which has resulted in an enormous shift in the pattern of consumption of alcohol over a decade or two.  The vast majority of alcohol consumption happened in the pub environment when we were younger.  The off-licence or off-trade was not a significant component of our lives.  Most people got off-trade purchases in over-the-counter transactions in on-trade environments, in contrast to the current reality whereby the majority of alcohol consumed in this country is purchased in the off-trade.  In that sense, something that is discriminatory in the sense of targeting more off-trade rather than on-trade purchasing is consistent with our policy objective to reduce the sale of alcohol.</p></speech>

In regard to imposing extra costs on businesses, the Minister did not address the question of businesses that say they cannot afford to create a separate area for the sale of alcohol.

We will work it out in consultation with retailers as to how it can best be done without imposing enormous capital costs on them.  It needs to be done for real.  It has to result in reduced visibility and reduced availability, with alcohol perhaps being kept behind a screen or in cabinets.  There are many ways in which it could be done.  It might be the case that some retailers decide that they do not make all that much money out of the alcohol anyway and it is not worthwhile continuing to stock it.  If that is the case, that is not necessarily a bad thing.</p></speech>

I am delighted to welcome two transition year students, Mr. Ian O'Sullivan and Ms Eimear Murphy, from Col&aacute;iste Treasa, Kanturk, winners of the BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition, who are here to present the innovative research they carried out in their local area on the impact of parental alcohol consumption on the drinking behaviour of children and adolescents.  It is appropriate that they are here, given that yesterday they met the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, as part of the Alcohol Forum, and it is a fitting end to our discussions on the public health (alcohol) Bill.  I also welcome Mr. Martin Davoren of University College Cork, who has supported Mr. O'Sullivan and Ms Murphy in their work, and Mr. Bobby Smith.  I welcome the parents, families and school community representatives of Col&aacute;iste Treasa.

The World Health Organization has identified Europe as the heaviest drinking region in the world.  It is noteworthy that the Irish population consumes more alcohol than the European average.  Alcohol plays a complex role in Irish society.  It represents an integral part of modern culture and is generally consumed for reasons of relaxation, enjoyment and sociability.  However, alcohol is a leading cause of global suffering, implicated in more than 60 diseases and numerous premature deaths each year.  The assistant State pathologist, Dr. Margaret Bolster, has stated that the majority of her cases are alcohol related.<br/><br/>In Ireland, many of those aged between 12 and 18 years are drinking regularly, and young Irish people report being drunk more often than their European counterparts.  It has been reported that young people who drink alcohol before the age of 15 years are four times more likely to develop alcohol dependency than those who wait until they are 21.  Each additional year of delayed drinking reduces the likelihood of alcohol dependence by 14%.  A number of factors influence the age at which individuals start using alcohol.  These include peer pressure, societal factors and parental factors.  Parents serve as role models for their children in imparting important health-related knowledge and appropriate behaviour.  Parents are the most influential factor on their children during their formative years.  The alcohol consumption pattern of the parent observed by the child is taken to be the norm and is a behaviour which they are likely to emulate.  As one child noted in a recent Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, ISPCC, report, &ldquo;If you see your parents get drunk, whether you like it or not, it will have an effect on your life&rdquo;.<br/><br/>A recent systematic review highlights that previous research on the subject of the parent-child relationship and alcohol use have found inconclusive or weak evidence.  Mongan <i>et al</i>noted the need to investigate the relationship between parental attitudes and alcohol consumption and adolescent alcohol consumption in an Irish context.  Personally, we observed different drinking patterns among our peers.  We found this interesting because it is well known that peer pressure is one of the principal factors in alcohol consumption among adolescents.  We realised there must be other influences impacting adolescent drinking behaviour.  Thus, the aim of our research was to investigate the relationship between parental attitude and consumption of alcohol and their adolescents' alcohol consumption.</p></speech>

The topics included in this questionnaire were alcohol use, self-reported height and weight, smoking status and mental health and well-being questions, all of which were previously validated.  The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test for Consumption, AUDIT-C, which is a series three questions that indicate whether or not someone is a hazardous drinker, was employed.  Parental attitude questions were taken from Research New Zealand papers and consisted of a statement with which parents disagreed or agreed or felt neutral about.</p><p>It determined what parents considered to be social norms and also what they thought about their own drinking behaviour.  The questionnaire was distributed to all fifth and sixth year pupils, as well as their parents, in the Kanturk-Mallow local electorate area during the academic year 2014-15.  Each parent and pupil had a corresponding number on their questionnaires in order to link their results.  This gave us a sample size of 982 fifth and sixth year students in eight schools.  We received a response rate of 37%, made up of 360 students and their parents.  Ethical approval for the survey was granted in October from the clinical research ethics committee of the Cork teaching hospitals.  The data was entered in an Excel document and transferred to IBM SPSS Statistics 20 for statistical analysis.  AUDIT-C and BMI scores were calculated according to specific instrument guidelines.  Analysis included descriptive analysis, frequency analysis and binary logistic regression analysis. </p><p> The mean age of adolescents was 16.89 years, the youngest being 15 years and the oldest 19 years.  The mean age of parents participating in the survey was 49.69 years for fathers and 47.53 years for mothers.  Notably, 87% of adolescents reported having a normal BMI, compared to 47% of parents.  In addition, less than 10% of adolescents had smoked 100 cigarettes in their lifetime, and although 46% of the parents surveyed had smoked 100 cigarettes in their lifetime, the majority of these, 72.6%, were ex-smokers. </p><p> Our study focused on hazardous alcohol consumption.  The AUDIT-C results showed that 34% of adolescents surveyed displayed a hazardous drinking pattern.  This was reported by 39.6% of males compared to 29.9% of females.  Some 47% of all parents surveyed were hazardous drinkers.  This was reported by 50% of fathers and 46.8% of mothers.  In regard to parental attitudes, over 90% of parents disagreed with allowing their adolescents to get drunk sometimes and rejected the idea that getting drunk is part of having fun as an adolescent.  Also, more than 80% of all parents surveyed believed they set a good example for their adolescent on alcohol consumption.  Notably, some 16.8% of parents said they would not be worried if their adolescent consumed four pints of alcohol once a month.  Almost one fifth of parents surveyed were not concerned if another parent was to supply their adolescent with alcohol.  More than 40% of parents agreed with allowing their adolescent to drink on special occasions.  It is also notable that mothers were more likely to believe that their adolescent had consumed too much alcohol.</p></speech>

We found that hazardous-drinking adolescents are three times more likely to have a father who is a hazardous drinker, six times more likely to have a father who agrees that it is okay for his child to get drunk sometimes, four times more likely to have a father who agrees that getting drunk is part of having fun as a teenager, five times more likely to have a father who would allow another parent to supply his adolescent with alcohol, almost five times more likely to have a father who would not be concerned by his adolescent consuming four pints of alcohol once a month, and five times more likely to have a father who believes that it is okay for pupils to drink on special occasions.</p> <p>  Similarly, for the mother, we found that if an adolescent is a hazardous drinker then his or her mother is 4.5 times more likely to agree that it is okay for the adolescent to get drunk sometimes, 3.5 times more likely to agree that getting drunk is part of having fun as an adolescent, almost twice as likely to think that it is a good idea to introduce alcohol to adolescents in the home environment, half as likely to think that adolescents should not drink at all, over three times as likely to think that it is okay for adolescents to drink on special occasions, 3.5 times more likely to consent to another parent providing alcohol to her adolescent under supervision, and three times more likely not to be concerned by the adolescent consuming four pints of beer once a month.  Whether the adolescent&rsquo;s mother is a hazardous drinker or believes that she sets a good example for her adolescent has no effect on whether the adolescent is a hazardous drinker.</p> <p>  Multivariate logistic regression applying backward elimination, which takes all variables into consideration, uncovered the most pertinent factors where an adolescent reported hazardous alcohol consumption.  These were, first, having a father who reported hazardous alcohol consumption; second, having a father who believes it is okay for their teenager to get drunk sometimes; third, having a father with reduced well-being; fourth, having a father who is almost four times more likely to report allowing their child to consume alcohol on special occasions; and fifth, having a mother who is over three times more likely to report allowing the child to consume alcohol on special occasions.</p></speech>

Previous research has noted the importance of a minimum age for consumption.  Exposure to alcohol in adolescence can have detrimental effects on brain development and intellectual capabilities and increases the likelihood of later alcohol dependence.  The current study notes that the majority of hazardous adolescent drinkers, 68.2%, were under the legal age of consumption.  Therefore, off-licences and pubs should be monitored continuously.  There needs to be improved policing of the law regarding under age adolescents purchasing alcohol, in addition to responsible bar staff training.</p> <p>  Previous research has noted the impact of advertising and marketing aimed at adolescents in their formative years.  The promotion of alcohol in areas such as sport and music is becoming increasingly prevalent, and evidence shows that alcohol marketing increases the likelihood that adolescents will begin to drink, or drink more if they already consume alcohol.  The protective effects of a full ban on alcohol sponsorship of sporting events have been demonstrated in previous studies.  This evidence-based approach to reducing alcohol-related harm should be introduced by the Government.  We are pleased to see the introduction of a minimum unit price for alcohol, as proposed in the current Bill.  This has been proven to be an effective measure when tackling hazardous alcohol consumption across the population.</p> <p>  Over the previous number of decades, alcohol consumption has continued to increase despite public health efforts.  Education campaigns were regularly favoured when tackling alcohol consumption.  However, these campaigns have been shown to be ineffective.  Currently, the cost to the taxpayer of hazardous alcohol consumption in Ireland is &euro;3.7 billion annually.  By introducing this Bill, the Oireachtas has the opportunity to improve the lives of Irish people.  It has the opportunity to save 88 lives every month which are currently lost to alcohol-related disease.  It provides us with the opportunity to protect vulnerable children affected by their parents' alcohol consumption, as seen in every community across the country.  It provides us with an opportunity to make a difference.</p></speech>

This is a great credit to both of them and to their school in Kanturk.  I congratulate the teaching staff and all involved.  The presentation was excellent and, as they indicated, as legislators we have an opportunity to make an impact.  The witnesses were in the visitors' area during the earlier session.  We all committed to ensuring the passage of the proposed legislation even though we have varying degrees of confidence, or a lack of confidence, in some of the measures.  The critical point made by the Minister is that this will be up for review after three years.  That is where we have the opportunity to measure its effectiveness.  It is down to its effectiveness, which we will debate and discuss.  It is a good thing to have a variety of views reflected here.</p> <p>  I am interested in the correlation between hazardous drinking habits in young people or adolescents and hazardous drinking habits in their parents.  There are a number of statements about this likelihood.  One of the figures is that 34% of adults surveyed displayed hazardous drinking patterns, representing 39.6% of males and 29.9% of females.  The witnesses went on to state that 47% of all parents surveyed were hazardous drinkers.  Did the witnesses extrapolate a percentage for the relationship between the young males, the young females and the parents with hazardous drinking habits?  The figures are not included in the presentation.  Do the witnesses have the figures?  If they do not have them readily available to answer the question, I fully understand.  Perhaps it can be furnished us in the future.  I am curious to know, of the hazardous-drinking parents, how many of the young males with hazardous drinking habits came from those families, and equally for the females.</p><p>It is a very telling point.  There are all sorts of possible outcomes.  I know many young people who have experienced, or are experiencing, difficulties in their home environments because one or both parents drink.  They would be very much opposed to the use of alcohol, never mind its abuse.  There are varying degrees of reaction, down to the individual make-up of the young person, the degree of their exposure and its impact on the quality of life in the home.  What were the witnesses&rsquo; findings in that relationship quotient, as it applied to parents and the young males and females concerned?  I thank the witnesses and congratulate them on their success, and I wish them every success in their future studies and career paths.</p></speech>

I say this with some emotion because their families are present today and I have known them extremely well for many years.  The award gives the witnesses a great opportunity.  They have achieved a great deal.</p> <p>  In the last line of their presentation they said the Oireachtas had an opportunity to make a difference, but the witnesses have made an enormous difference.  There should be a major public discussion about alcohol consumption and abuse, involving everybody - parents and children.  We have been shirking our responsibilities in regard to it.  The witnesses&rsquo; diligent research will have an enormous impact on public health policy for generations to come.  I congratulate them too on the great enthusiasm and dedication with which they have conducted their public meetings in the months since winning the competition.  I also congratulate the management and staff of Col&aacute;iste Treasa in Kanturk, who gave them great help and support.  It is a proud moment for everyone in the school and for the Duhallow region in general.</p> <p>  The night they won and the night they came home there was a sense of genuine goodwill and euphoria, unlike that at many functions I have attended where there are different agendas.  All those involved in this research from University College Cork and Col&aacute;iste Treasa, and most importantly, Ian and Eimear, have made an enormous difference to the serious, genuine and open discussion that our society must have about our relationship with alcohol, as discussed with the Minister for Health at the earlier part of this meeting.  We must tackle our relationship with alcohol for economic as well as personal reasons. </p></speech>

I want to say &ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; but I am not sure whether that is for winning the Young Scientist of the Year Award or for their presentation today.  Both deserve huge congratulations.</p> <p>  All too often, when people talk about alcohol and young people they think about young people&rsquo;s consumption, but the witnesses have turned the issue on its head.  They have provided not only their own evidence but also the statistics on which we need to base our work.  That is very useful.  This is a children&rsquo;s rights issue, for those children who consume alcohol and also because of the indirect effects of alcohol consumption on children and young people, including domestic violence, which has clear links to alcohol.</p> <p>  One figure that jumped out at me is that one-fifth of parents surveyed were not concerned about their child being supplied with alcohol by another parent.  One-fifth of parents are not concerned that other adults can flout the law and buy alcohol for children.  I find that really startling.  I had assumed that the people who did that were not parents.  I hope that figure, as well as the other research, gets headlines.  Parents and adults must think about that and answer serious questions.  Why is it okay to introduce alcohol to children and adolescents when we know its harmful effects?</p> <p>  I am also interested in what Ian and Eimear said about sport and music and the promotion of alcohol.  They were present for our last session on this issue.  They call clearly for a ban on alcohol sponsorship of sports.  We should perhaps send this presentation to the Minister for Health, given that it contains some evidence for this call.</p></speech>

There is a question of normalising alcohol consumption and making it socially acceptable, which is very important and comes across in the study.  We on the committee feel very strongly about the legislation.  I did not think I could feel more strongly, but this presentation shows me as a legislator why we need to do more and to bring the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015 into law.</p> <p>  We also need to shine a spotlight on the role of parents and adults in young people&rsquo;s lives.  That is a call to action to us as legislators when talking about alcohol-related harm or alcohol consumption.  I thank Ian and Eimear for giving me the evidence for that.</p></speech>

When I proposed to the committee that it invite them after they won the Young Scientist of the Year Award I did not think it would be on the same day that the Minister came here.  They can see how significant their research is for framing policy.  This shows the influence their work can have.  It deserves the recognition it is getting, because it is very comprehensive research.  I also thank the staff of their school and their parents for their support, and everyone who took part in the survey, because without the participants they would not have been able to get the information.</p> <p>  While they were doing the survey, and in the time since then, did it come across that parents and young people were aware of the health risks associated with excessive drinking?</p><p>One of the figures included in the research was that 47% had normal a BMI and a breakdown was given between men and women.  I am open to correction on my figures, but it appears that 67.9% of men did not have a normal BMI.  Outside of the alcohol issue, other issues were identified in the health survey that we have overlooked.  This is an issue.  Do Mr. O'Sullivan and Ms Murphy think people were aware of the risks associated with excessive drinking, particularly young people?  They have the experience of conducting all of this research.  What do they consider would have the effect of getting the message across to people that excessive drinking damages health?  I referred to Dr. Orla Crosbie's paper last week in which she identified that young women were coming to her attention with serious liver problems, cirrhosis, which she did not see 20 years ago.  How do we get the message across to young people and parents?</p></speech>

I thank them for their excellent presentation.  It is a huge volume of work and they have shared some interesting but shocking statistics.  We have a major problem in this country with alcohol.  The reason we have a minimum age - 18 years - for consumption is health.  Not alone is it shocking, but it is also outrageous that one fifth of parents surveyed would not be concerned if another parent was to supply their adolescent with alcohol.  The age limit is 18 years of age for a reason and no parent should supply an under-age child with alcohol.  Furthermore, it is outrageous that parents would accept it.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Sullivan and Ms Murphy said there was a need for improved policing of the law on under-age adolescents purchasing alcohol, in addition to having responsible bar staff.  In my view, there is a need for improvement in policing the law in the case of parents supplying under-age children with alcohol.  I cannot get over the fact that the statistic is so high, at 20%.  It is outrageous.  I made a point to the Minister on which he was not sold.  It was about increasing the age at which alcohol could be purchased from an off-licence to 21 years.  I was thinking about the difference in the gap between a 22 and a 23 year old supplying alcohol to a 15 or a 16 year old.  I am beginning to think the Minister might have been right if parents are supplying it.  What do Mr. O'Sullivan and Ms Murphy think of my proposal?</p></speech>

I congratulate them on winning the BT Young Scientist competition.  I include in my congratulations their parents, school and all those who supported them in this endeavour.  The research they have produced is, to say the least, disappointing from the point of view of parents.  In some aspects, it is shocking and highlights for parents and committee members their responsibility when it comes to under-age drinking and over-indulgence in alcohol.  One of the telling paragraphs in the presentation is at the end and it puts the whole thing in a nutshell.  Referring to the Oireachtas, the presentation states:</p><blockquote>It has the opportunity to save 88 lives every month which are currently lost to an alcohol related disease.  It has the opportunity to protect vulnerable children affected by their parent's alcohol consumption as seen in every community across the country.  It has the opportunity to make a difference.</blockquote> <p>I hope we will make the difference, in particular, in the legislation we discussed earlier this morning.  I also hope the presentation, of which the Minister is aware, will feed into the legislation and ensure we will have strong laws in place that will be policed and effective.  I further hope the Minister will take into account the banning of sports sponsorship and question of online advertising.  I thank Mr. O'Sullivan and Ms Murphy for their presentation and again say, &quot;Well done.&quot;</p></speech>

We receive lots of in-depth reports, some of which include many statistics.  Many of them cost a great deal of money to put together, but I have never seen anything as comprehensive as this one, which did not cost a great deal of money to compile.  It took the initiative of two very young people to establish what our drinking habits were, on which I congratulate them.</p> <p>  When the research was conducted and the study concluded, what was the reaction of the students and parents who had participated?  Were Mr. O'Sullivan and Ms Murphy disappointed that of the 982 people who had been given the questionnaire, only 37% had responded?  I might have missed it, but was there a figure for the number of parents who did not drink?  Of the parents surveyed, 47% were hazardous drinkers, something that jumped off the page for me.  I agree with my colleagues about the parents who were not worried that their children might drink even one pint a month.  They were not at all worried that they were actually breaking the law by telling their children to do this.  </p> <p>  This is a wonderful piece of work, for which Mr. O'Sullivan and Ms Murphy deserve every credit.  I had another question, but it has slipped from my mind, which comes with age.  I again thank Mr. O'Sullivan and Ms Murphy, their parents, their school and all those who participated.  If my other question comes back to me, I will come back in and ask it.</p></speech>

As indicated by my constituency colleague, Deputy Michael Moynihan, it is a particular honour for us in the constituency to have the BT Young Scientist winners coming from Col&aacute;iste Treasa in Kanturk.  I salute the achievements of Mr. O'Sullivan and Ms Murphy, their families and school.</p> <p>  As legislators, we are preoccupied with changing the law, but what jumps off the page for me is the fact that changing the law would be relatively easy.  The ingrained nature of alcohol abuse has become a cultural norm and it is much more difficult to change human patterns of behaviour.  We can ban advertising and deal with the issue of cost, but we have a societal issue to which we must face up.  In that context, we would like to think that when history is written, 2015 will be considered to have been a watershed year when the Government, society, academia and the medical profession moved and BT recognised something for the first time in many years.</p><p>For the first time in many years, the nature of the project that won the BT Young Scientist award was not technical, not one that scared the living daylights out of us; rather it was a social project that most of society could acknowledge and respond to by sitting up and taking notice of a problem that was a ticking time bomb.  According to the final paragraph in the submission, it is costing us &euro;3.7 billion.  The culmination of everything I have outlined will ensure 2015 will be a watershed moment.  However, changing the law is much easier than changing the cultural norms evident in the research.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the final paragraph reads: </p><blockquote>Education campaigns were regularly favoured when tackling alcohol consumption.  However, these campaigns have been shown to be ineffective.  </blockquote><p>Is this a criticism of the principle behind education campaigns?  I am aware, as I am sure our guests' school community are, of the inclination to add to schools' responsibilities; for example, they must educate students about alcohol awareness, the importance of fitness, etc.  Responsibility for solving all ills is dumped on schools, but is that the nature of how we try to inform younger people?  Do our guests share my opinion that it is not that education does not have a role to play but that we must act at a much earlier age?  At secondary school level it is probably too late.  I am in favour of doing this in primary school and confronting fifth and sixth class children with graphic presentations showing the consequences of alcohol abuse.  With due respect to the Pioneer movement which does excellent work, I am unsure whether its format - perhaps I have a dated perception of the movement - of highlighting the evils of alcohol abuse will change people.  Instead, role models, be they sports people or reformed alcoholics, could confront young people with the reality of what it is like to be that person who suffers from alcohol abuse and show its impact on them personally, their families, communities, health, financial standing and relationships with their partners and children.  It is not that education has failed, rather it is down to the way we have done it.  I would be in favour of earlier and a more graphic confrontation of the issue in the education system.<br/><br/>I congratulate our guests.  It is tremendous research that, in essence, summarises the problems we face.  Changing the law would be the easy part; changing societal norms willl be much more challenging.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-23a.3464" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bobby Smith" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015042300002#R00700"><p>I add my congratulations to Mr. O'Sullivan and Ms Murphy.  As someone who has conducted some research in this area, I was impressed and a little jealous when I read the report.  It was an area of study I had considered exploring, but had never been able to come up with an easy way of doing it.  This is not to say Mr. O'Sullivan and Ms Murphy's methodology was easy; it is comprehensive.  It is fabulous that they obtained information from teenagers and parents.  Others have considered parents or teenagers alone, but having both is what makes it fascinating.  It is great to have Irish evidence that confirms what has been observed internationally, that parents exert a significant influence and that liberal or casual attitudes on the part of parents towards their own or their teenagers' drinking increase risk.</p> <p>  Senator Jillian van Turnhout and Deputy Sandra McLellan appeared upset and surprised at the number of parents who had seemed to be providing alcohol for teenagers.  I speak to parents regularly in schools.  By the time teenagers reach the age of 16 or 17 years, many parents believe they are doing the right thing by giving their children alcohol.  Once they have made that decision, some of them also believe it is okay to allow other parents to offer drink in what they view as a controlled environment.  For whatever reason, they have been caused to believe drinking by teenagers is inevitable.  As a result, they give permission in a misguided effort to exert control.  However, the international evidence and this new Irish evidence indicates that once teenagers are given permission by parents to drink alcohol, they seem to give themselves permission to drink even more than they are already drinking.  Rather than helping, it makes matters worse.  There is, therefore, a lack of understanding.  There is a middle class notion that, by giving kids alcohol at home, one is somehow doing the right thing when, in fact, it does not work.</p> <p>  To respond to Deputy Michael Creed's comment on the Holy Grail, the ultimate challenge is to try to change cultural attitudes, not just towards drink particularly but specifically to getting drunk.  As a society, we have a particularly tolerant attitude towards getting drunk, whether one is 16 or 60 years of age.  However, I am optimistic that legislation is an important first step.  For example, in terms of drink driving, it seems that the legislation came first and the shift in attitude followed.  It is a clear message from our leaders - that is what committee members are - for the first time ever in identifying alcohol as a health issue and putting in place measures to begin turning the tide.  This will assist the public.  In fact, there already appears to be momentum among the public towards recognising this as a health issue, about which we as individuals, adults, teenagers and parents need to do more.</p></speech>

The Bill is a great first step in tackling in a meaningful way Ireland's relationship with alcohol.  For a long time price has been shown to have an impact on consumption patterns.  In the past 20 years, if the rate of excise duty decreased, the level of consumption increased.  The introduction of minimum pricing can drive the issue forward.</p> <p>  Questions arose about the response rate to the survey, at approximately 37%.  In surveys such as this which includes adolescents and their parents and in respect of which informed consent was gained it is difficult to achieve very high response rates.  As a local electoral area was sampled, however, it is representative of the general population, with an urban-rural mix.  It provides a comprehensive overview of alcohol consumption patterns among adolescents and their parents.  It also maps nicely into the report of the Health Research Board, with the consumption patterns among parents being similar.</p></speech>

We could not divide male adolescents from female adolescents because their numbers were too small.  If we return to this work, we would like to examine that point.  We did not ask whether people knew what the effects of alcohol were.  As such, we do not know whether they knew.  </p> <p>  We were also asked why we did not examine hazardous drinking by adolescents and parents.  We used the system of univariate logistic regression which gives stronger evidence.</p></speech>

Given the nature of our study, we suggest the introduction of a parenting programme which has shown evidence of being effective in reducing alcohol use in pre-teens and adolescents.  It would be about letting parents know, instead of adolescents.  Parents have a significant effect on their adolescents.</p> <p>  Increasing the age limit to 21 years was mentioned.  Improved policing of the current age limit would be better.  We could change the age limit, but it might not make a difference if it was not enforced.  We know that most people buy alcohol for themselves.  They do not have to get others to buy it for them.</p></speech>

We are, therefore, starting to see a real shift in pattern because children of primary and secondary school age are so overly exposed to alcohol advertising through sports, TV advertising, print media advertisements and billboard advertisements.  These advertisements are not aimed at a specific group, but at everybody.  We see a link between this and what children recognise.</p></speech>
