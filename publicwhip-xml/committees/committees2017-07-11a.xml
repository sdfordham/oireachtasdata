    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-11a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="17:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017071100002#F00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for inviting me here today.  I will make an opening statement and then do my best to answer any questions members may have.  In the overall context of Brexit, the priority areas for the Government are clear.  This is about our citizens, our economy, Northern Ireland, the common travel area and the future of the European Union, EU, itself.  We are, and will remain, a strong and committed member of the EU.  The Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs are actively engaged with their European counterparts, as am I, together with other Ministers and senior officials.  It will be important for all sides to act responsibly and to approach these negotiations in a constructive, positive and ambitious frame of mind, with a willingness to find compromise.</p><p>There are high expectations among parts of the UK industry but &ndash; and this is important - to date the UK Government has not explicitly said what changes it may seek to the <i>status quo</i>other than the announcement to leave the 1964 London Convention.  In theory, the UK could restrict access to their waters or seek to gain larger quota shares at the expense of others or both.  However, that could only happen if the UK was content to ignore the potential repercussions that would certainly arise from the EU side.  From an Irish perspective, all we can do is continue to prepare for every eventuality and remain clear as to our objectives.  Any attempts to restrict our existing rights and entitlements will be strenuously resisted and that is why we will insist that fisheries must form part of the wider trade negotiations.</p><p>A range of serious challenges are presented by the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU.  As I have said previously, for the fisheries sector Brexit poses a very specific set of serious threats over and above the trade implications common to most sectors.  If we no longer have access to UK waters or we see a significant drop in our quotas, the trade implications will be the least of our problems.  That is of course not to underplay the importance of a good trade outcome for the fisheries sector but rather to emphasise that this sector faces separate challenges that are unique.  The United Kingdom's fishing industry has made no secret of its desire for a hard Brexit on fish to ensure that non-UK fishermen will no longer have access to the United Kingdom zone and that all fish in that zone, currently shared with EU partners, will be theirs and only theirs for the taking.  Needless to say, such an extreme outcome would be a fundamental threat to the well-being of our sector.  On average, 34% of the Irish landings are taken from UK waters.  For our largest fishery, mackerel, 64% is taken in UK waters and for our second biggest fishery, prawns, 43% is taken in UK waters.  Together, these two fisheries take up nearly half of the total value of our annual quotas.</p><p>A key challenge for the Government will be to ensure that fisheries and the wider seafood sector concerns are high on the EU agenda and to ensure that our sector is not isolated in the overall negotiations on a new  European Union-United Kingdom relationship.  Whereas the action by the United Kingdom in announcing its withdrawal from the 1964 London Fisheries Convention was not unexpected, the signal it suggests of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s intent to take a hard line on fisheries in the context of Brexit is, as I have said, both unwelcome and unhelpful.  It is important to recognise there are no immediate direct impacts for the Irish fishing industry from this action and it will not take effect for two years.  The Irish fleet is not significantly dependent on this limited access and the level of United Kingdom activity in our six to 12-mile zone is also very low.  Notwithstanding this, I acknowledge that for those who are active in the space, it is a worrying time.  It is the message of intent and the potential implications of that intent in the wider 12 to 200-mile zone that causes concern for the negotiations to come.  I will deal with the convention in more detail later in my statement.  I spoke with Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Mr. Michael Gove, last week and stressed to him the importance of long-established fishing patterns by the Irish fishing fleet and the importance of these being acknowledged and protected in the context of Brexit.</p><p>For the Government there are two clear objectives when it comes to fisheries and Brexit, namely, the maintenance of our existing quota shares and our existing rights of access.  These have been and will continue to be my overriding priorities.  To achieve these objectives, we must have unity of purpose across member states directly concerned and across the fishing industry.  Disunity will only strengthen those in the United Kingdom that seek to exclude all European Union fleets.  As the negotiations develop, unilateral sectoral announcements like this one will be dealt with, as this will be, within the Brexit negotiations and there will be no room or intent to address matters in isolation.  Apart from the United Kingdom&rsquo;s huge reliance on and self-interest in the European Union market for a whole range of products and services, it will be hard to ignore the fact that it relies on the European Union for 70% of its seafood exports.</p><p>I am working closely with our fishing industry and have had two well-attended public discussions on the potential impact of Brexit on the seafood industry in Dublin and Galway.  I have also been working closely with both Mr. Michel Barnier and my fellow Ministers across the EU and I am glad to say we are united in our determination to protect our collective interests.  We, of course, have differences with our partners on a number of issues, which is normal, but on Brexit and the threat it poses to our fleets, we are united.  During Mr. Barnier&rsquo;s recent visit to Ireland, I again made it clear to him that fisheries are a priority for the Irish Government.  I am satisfied that Mr. Barnier understands the issues and significance of Brexit for Ireland's fisheries sector.  Mr. Barnier also supports my view that fisheries negotiations must be progressed in the context of the wider trade negotiations and agreed that transitional arrangements are likely to be important for the fisheries sector.  I hope the committee will agree that the Government is cognisant of the potential implications Brexit may have on our fishing industry and every effort is being made to mitigate these implications.</p><p>I will now turn my attention to the specific issue of the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill.  As the committee has been made aware, on 27 October 2016, the Supreme Court issued a judgment in a case taken by a number of mussel seed fishermen in which it determined that fishing by Northern Ireland vessels within the zero to six nautical mile zone of the territorial waters of the State is not permitted by law.  It is important to note that the Supreme Court upheld the High Court finding that the <i>voisinage</i>arrangements are not invalid but that, as it stands, there is insufficient provision for them in domestic law.  The <i>voisinage</i>, or &quot;neighbourhood&quot;, arrangements between Ireland and Northern Ireland have provided reciprocal fishing access for more than 50 years.  These arrangements have allowed boats from Northern Ireland to fish in coastal waters in Ireland.  They have also allowed and continue to allow Irish-registered fishing boats access to fish in coastal waters in Northern Ireland.  The Government approved the publication of the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill 2017 to address the issues raised by the Supreme Court judgment and the Bill was published on 13 February 2017.  If enacted and commenced, the Bill will fulfil Ireland&rsquo;s obligations and give the <i>voisinage</i>arrangements a proper legal footing.  Given the nature of the Bill, the Oireachtas Business Committee agreed to let the Bill proceed without pre-legislative scrutiny.  The Bill is being debated in the Seanad and remains on Second Stage.</p><p>The committee has asked for an update on the position regarding the mussel seed allocations and particularly those for Lough Foyle.  </p></speech>

The members are happy enough to discuss it later if that is okay.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-11a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="17:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017071100002#F00400"><p>In that case I will conclude my opening remarks.  I appreciate the interests of members in this issue.  It is particularly challenging for the fishing industry.  There is extensive consultation by the industry with my Department on these matters and there is a substantially agreed position by the industry in the context of Brexit.  We look forward to trying to progress the interests of the fishing community in the context of those negotiations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-11a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1244" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="17:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017071100002#F00500"><p>I thank the Minister and his officials for coming in to discuss this important development and the overall threat to our fishing sector as a result of Brexit.  As the Minister correctly pointed out, although agriculture and food are often discussed, the stakes for fishing - more than any other sector - are exceptionally high with regard to a potential downside or worst-case scenario from Brexit.</p><p>The Minister said the approach to negotiations would involve engagement and co-operation with the EU 27.  Based on his engagement with other member states so far, is the Minister confident that a united approach is being taken?  The maps provided to us today remind us how close British waters are to the Donegal coast and fishermen will enter British waters as soon as they leave port.  In the worst-case scenario they will be cut off from them.  Other EU fishing nations also face the spectre of being excluded from British waters and this will have an impact on fisheries management, on account of having to work within a smaller catchment area.  There will be a negative impact similar to that of quotas so there needs to be a united front in the negotiations with Britain and Northern Ireland and a strong campaign to retain access to British waters.  From a trade and tariff point of view, we should leverage the fact that 80% of fish caught by the UK fleet is exported to the EU. so that we can ensure a good outcome for our fishing sector.  Can the Minister say how united the EU approach is and how strong the fishing lobby will be in the negotiation?<br/><br/>On <i>voisinage</i>and the decision to withdraw from the London Fisheries Convention, the Minister has brought forward legislation which is on Second Stage in the Seanad.  What is the Minister's approach now, given that Britain has indicated that it wants to withdraw from it altogether?  What are his intentions for the Bill?  Can he clarify where the Irish fleeting fleet stands in an EU context?  What is the situation as regards access for other nations to Irish waters?  What proportion of the fish in our waters do we catch?  Does the Minister have any data on how important Irish and EU waters are to the British fishing fleet and the overall value of Irish fishing waters?  Are there any figures for the annual fish catch within Irish waters and what proportion are caught by Irish boats?<br/><br/>My final question is on the engagement between the Government and the UK Government about jurisdiction on Lough Foyle.  I believe there is agreement on operations in Carlingford but can the Minister give an update on the situation as regards Lough Foyle?  What are the implications of a hard Brexit for the Lough Foyle area, given its unique circumstances?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-11a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1400" speakername="P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn" time="17:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017071100002#G00200"><p>The announcement of the British Government relating to the London Fisheries Convention is a game changer.  The Minister outlined his approach to <i>voisinage</i>in the Sea Fisheries (Amendment) Bill but this is a game changer and I am hoping for clearer responses from the Minister than what we heard in his presentation.  How will he defend the Irish national interest?  How will he defend our fishing communities around the coast?  We cannot accept what happened with the London Fisheries Convention and allow Europe to negotiate on our behalf without the Common Fisheries Policy being on the table.  All the Irish fishing organisations who were before this committee stated their concern about the impact on their catch from UK waters.  We cannot sit back and allow Britain to use this in the negotiations without having any strategy to deal with it.  I would like the Minister give a statement making it clear that the Common Fisheries Policy is on the table.  Maybe he is doing this in private but I would like to hear it.  It has to be on the table.  If a country stands to lose so much of its catch the status quo has to be torn up.  There needs to be a reality check.  The British have put this on the table as a negotiating tactic, a chip, and I would like to hear a more forthright position from our Government.</p><p>The Minister should read the transcript of the presentations of every single fishing organisation to this committee on the subject of the Sea Fisheries (Amendment) Bill because they are shocking and damning of whoever drafted the Bill in such a hurry.  None of the organisations was consulted about something that will have a very serious impact on their livelihoods.  There is already huge anger around our coasts about the poor share we have in the catch from our own waters. </p></speech>

He said the <i>voisinage</i>issue was part of the overall picture.  From here on in, everything needs to be on the table.  We need to have a conversation about fisheries policies around these islands.  We have to defend Irish national interests.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-11a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="17:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017071100002#G00500"><p>That depends how one defines the Irish national interest.  It is strange that a republican party is not taking a 32-county approach.  I wonder if the Senator's colleague next to him agrees with his interpretation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-11a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1400" speakername="P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn" time="17:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017071100002#G00600"><p>Officials in the Department have put policies in place.  What is the overall value of the catch taken from Irish waters, including by supertrawlers from all other nations?  What percentage of that catch do we take and what has it been over all the years when we have been members of the European Union and the Common Fisheries Policy?  The British have asserted their national interests and we need to assert ours.  Our fishing communities around the coast are expecting this to happen.  The transcript of the presentations by the various fishing organisations to which I referred are a damning indictment of the approach taken by Department officials.  The organisation in question were not consulted about a very important piece of legislation.  I believe the Minister acted in good faith and has good motives but when the British Government announced it was withdrawing from the London Fisheries Convention it was clear that our approach had to be much firmer.  I am expecting more forthright language and more defence of our national interests in the time ahead.</p> <p>  The British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, MP, declared that the whole of Lough Foyle was within the United Kingdom.  I secured a Seanad debate on this and the Minister of State said he had contacted the British Government but the issue has not been resolved and it makes the issue of fishing rights very complicated.</p><p>If the British are saying the whole of Lough Foyle is within the United Kingdom and if Britain is withdrawing from the London Fisheries Convention, the Minister will be aware that this will cause great alarm.  I would like a firm statement from the Government on this matter.  I appreciate that Irish Governments have always contested Britain's position on Lough Foyle and that the matter remains unresolved despite negotiations that have been ongoing for years.  The Loughs Agency, for example, has not been given the powers it needs because these issues have not been resolved.  I ask for a firm statement on the status of the issue.</p><p> I reiterate that I believe the Minister's motives and agenda are good in terms of the reasons for the legislation he drafts and the approach he has taken.  He may not like to hear this but he should read the transcripts from the committee's meetings on the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill.  They feature the public statements made by the fishing organisations.  Can he imagine what they are saying to us in private about the officials tasked with defending Irish national interests in the areas of fisheries and the immense resource around our coast?  I want the Minister to understand the level of anger on this issue and for the approach the fishing organisations have taken to the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill.  That is the historical approach. </p><p> I look forward to the Minister's responses and ask him to listen to us.  He must act not only on the threat of Brexit but also, strangely enough, the opportunity it presents in terms of reopening the entire discussion on the Common Fisheries Policy and the way in which the immense resources around our coast are divvied up.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-11a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="17:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017071100002#H00200"><p>I thank Senator Mac Lochlainn and Deputy McConalogue.  There is absolute unity among the 27 member states on the approach to fisheries.  I qualify that statement by pointing out that fishing is not an issue for a significant number of member states.  In the context of my overall engagement on Brexit-related matters across the Department's range of responsibilities, some member states are impacted upon by Brexit while others are not especially excited about the issue.  I refer, in particular, to countries in southern Europe and member states that joined to the European Union more recently.  For these countries, Brexit is a remote issue.</p> <p>  Our approach to the negotiations started at home and involves extensive engagement through consultative forums in the Department and sectoral dialogue organised through the fishing sector to create an agreed position on Brexit with the industry.  It is entirely inaccurate to suggest that my Department and the fishing industry are at polar opposites of the spectrum in respect of the approaches we are taking to the negotiations.  That is not the case and if the Senator has any doubt about that, he should note that I have shared platforms with representatives of the fishing industry, most recently at Seafest in Galway.</p> <p>  With the possible exception of one, all the relevant organisations agree that we need to keep the Brexit negotiations separate from the next round of discussions on reform of the Common Fisheries Policy.  This approach makes sense.  The member states that would be most adversely impacted upon by the United Kingdom adopting "lifting-the-drawbridge" approach to its territorial waters post-Brexit include France, Spain, the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, Belgium, Sweden and Ireland.  I have had the privilege of attending one December Council meeting and we will continue to fight tooth and nail at every December Council, including next December's meeting, to ensure that we secure the best possible deal for Irish fishermen in the current framework of the Common Fisheries Policy.  While every country wold like to secure more from these negotiations, that is the construct of the current Common Fisheries Policy.</p> <p>  It would be wildly inappropriate to try to put the Common Fisheries Policy up for renegotiation when we are trying to build a common platform with the member states to which I referred, all of which share our analysis on Brexit matters and are equally impacted upon by the volume and value of fish they take from European waters.  Why is that the case?  The reason is that to do otherwise would mean stating on the one hand that we share their analysis of Brexit and seek to achieve the same outcome as they do, while, on the other, trying to pick their pockets by taking some of the fish allocated to them under the Common Fisheries Policy.  That is not the way to win friends and influence people.  We would quickly find ourselves isolated in the context of the platform we have built with like-minded members states.</p> <p>  There is an issue that needs to be addressed in the next round of reform of the Common Fisheries Policy.  Running the Brexit and Common Fisheries Policy reform processes in parallel would undermine the cohesion that exists in the analysis of the problem for member states, as well as the desired outcome.  There is absolute unity on this among the governments of the affected member states which are drawn from a range of ideologies.  This analysis is also shared by the industry, which is why I shared a platform in Galway recently with representatives of the Danish and Belgian fishing industries, alongside representatives of the Irish fishing industry.  They articulated a common cause in the industry alliance in addition to the common cause among member state governments and Ministers whom I have met.  I have met nearly all of the relevant Ministers of the member states to which I referred and  I will bring the French Minister for fisheries up to speed on the position on Friday next.  He has only recently been appointed and I previously met his two predecessors.</p> <p>  We are in serious engagement with the other affected member states.  We share our analysis of the problems we face and feed this analysis into the Barnier negotiating team as an agreed position.  Our primary concerns are access to fishing grounds, quotas and the possible consequences should member states be displaced from UK fishing waters and shift their fishing efforts elsewhere.  Under the Common Fisheries Policy, member states do not enjoy a guaranteed or automatic right to fish for stocks in other waters in the event that they are excluded from UK waters.  We have been assiduously building a coalition of willing and like-minded member states on the issue of Brexit and feeding this shared position into the Barnier negotiating team.</p> <p>  We have made clear statements on the issues of access, quotas and displacement.  In truth, the UK has a very strong hand.  If the EU takes a silo approach to the negotiations, the UK will hold most of the aces.  Our stated position is that it is not sufficient to say we want continued access to UK territorial waters.  We want the negotiations to be conducted not in isolation but as part of the broader trade agreement.  If, for example, financial services companies in London want to passport their products into the European Union or if Britain wants to sell Nissan cars manufactured in Sunderland in the EU, fishing should be part of the bigger trade negotiation.</p> <p>  Members will have heard UK politicians state a number of times that no deal is better than a bad deal.  I understand that the World Trade Organization tariffs that would apply to fisheries in the event of no deal being reached and a hard Brexit would be set at 4%.  The UK exports 70% of its catch to the EU.  Given global demand for fisheries, if Britain retained access to EU markets, a tariff of 4% would not be an impediment.  As such, it would gain all of the riches with very little consequence.  What we are doing is building an agreement with other member states.  We want to park all the issues in respect of the Common Fisheries Policy until we secure an agreement on Brexit.  The Irish industry is involved in an industry alliance across like-minded and affected member states.</p></speech>

Has the Common Fisheries Policy and the division of Irish waters under that policy been a good deal for Ireland?  Is the <i>status quo</i>a good deal?</p><p>The difficulty is that while we say we will try to form a Common Position in Europe to negotiate with Britain on all of this, those in fishing communities around our coast do not believe we ever got a good deal.  That is the difficulty.  They believe that, yet again, their priorities will be sacrificed for what is seen as the greater good.  I am sure the Minister will appreciate why this mistrust exists.  It might not be manifested at a large platform when everyone is trying to be as diplomatic as possible to defend their interests, but privately there is a sense, as the Minister knows, that we never got a good deal on our fisheries or our waters.  That particular sector was sacrificed for what was seen as the greater good and the fear is that this will happen again.  That is the core issue.</p></speech>

That is the concept behind the Common Fisheries Policy.  It is about access to EU member states' waters.  I appreciate the point the Senator makes, namely, that the industry got a bad deal on accession.  I have heard this from the fishing industry on a number of occasions and I know it has a certain currency in the media also.  The interesting thing is that the Common Fisheries Policy did not exist on accession.  It did not exist until the mid-1980s, which was ten years after we joined.  In fact, the Irish fishing industry on accession was, by and large, if not almost exclusively, operating inside the 12-mile zone.  The industry today is multiples greater in size and value than it was when we joined.  We have also managed to keep the quota as a public rather than a private asset.</p></speech>

In respect of the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, the most important point to remember is that the purpose of that legislation was just to reinstate what had previously existed, not in law but in practice, for many years.  In terms of the rationale behind that legislation, Senator Mac Lochlainn talked about defending the Irish national fishing industry.  It depends on how one defines "Irish".</p></speech>

The wee boatman in County Down is very welcome.  We have no problem with the wee boatman in County Derry or County Antrim.  They can knock themselves out and come and fish in Irish waters, but not Dutch multinationals.  People using an address in the North of Ireland to plunder the natural resource and displace Irish fishermen are not welcome.</p></speech>

In terms of what we had under <i>voisinage</i>, if people met the requirements to register their boat here, and we are not all in agreement about the image the Deputy portrays of the small man fishing in Castletownbere, Dingle, Rossaveal or anywhere else in between, they could go to Northern Ireland.  Also, as existed in practice up to 27 November last year, in respect of the registration of boats in Northern Ireland to the satisfaction of the Northern Ireland authorities, they could equally come South.  The current position, arising from the Supreme Court ruling, is that those boats in the North can no longer come South, but we still enjoy the privilege of <i>voisinage</i>in respect of our entitlement to go North.</p><p>In the context of an all-island approach, and one of the Supreme Court judges made reference to this, it seemed to be a practical move to have this all-island approach to fisheries under <i>voisinage</i>.  Notwithstanding the evolution of the size and shape of the fishing industry over the years, if someone had to meet a certain criteria to be registered in Northern Ireland, and in the South, we would extend to them on a reciprocal basis the privileges we enjoy, and still enjoy, under <i>voisinage</i>in Northern Ireland.  That was the purpose of it.  I felt an all-island, inclusive approach to matters, which I thought the Senator might share-----</p></speech>

I felt it was the right thing to do for those reasons.  However, in the context of the Brexit negotiations, why would we gratuitously offend our nearest neighbour by not restoring what had existed in practice for many years?  I admit we have to reflect further now on the basis that the UK has decided to unilaterally withdraw from the London Fisheries Convention.  That does raise issues, but there are consequences also, in the context of that judgment, which are much more extensive than might appear at first hand.  That was the rationale for the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill.</p> <p>  I want to deal with the issue of Lough Foyle.  This is a jurisdictional issue and the Republic of Ireland is unapologetic in maintaining our claim of jurisdiction in Foyle.  We have been trying to progress that almost since the foundation of the State, and to date there has been no meeting of minds on it.  It is not an issue on which my Department is the prime mover in terms of the prosecution of that interest, but it has been and remains our objective to establish our jurisdiction in respect of Foyle.  It has not been resolved to date.  We are not recoiling from that.  We are not moving one iota from that.  That is our stated objective.</p></speech>

In the context of the London Fisheries Convention announcement, has the Government been in contact with the British Government on the specific issue of Lough Foyle?  In fairness, the Government has not made provocative statements about Lough Foyle.  The British Government has done so.  The whole of Lough Foyle is within the United Kingdom so if the Minister marries that statement with the London Fisheries Convention announcement, will he take the opportunity to convey the concern of the Irish Government about those positions and make it clear that we do not accept any claim over the fisheries of Lough Foyle?</p></speech>

I hope to have a meeting with him in the not too distant future to discuss all of these matters in greater detail.  In a brief telephone conversation, I raised with him our concerns that long-established fishing patterns would fall victim to the approach they are pursuing in the context of Brexit.  Whereas it is fair to say we got a good hearing, I did not get any recoil from them from the stated position they have taken publicly or indeed that their industry is trying to pursue also.  We are not in negotiation directly.  We are in negotiation through the European Union and what we are putting most emphasis on is creating awareness at European Union level of all the complex issues surrounding Brexit.  It is not entirely surprising that the United Kingdom would leave the London Fisheries Convention in the context of its approach to Brexit, given all the utterances they have made.  It has raised the temperature and it makes it more difficult to get a clear line of sight as to its ultimate approach.  Depending on who one listens to and the paper one reads, one gets a different interpretation of the kind of Brexit being prosecuted in the UK on any given day.  It is particularly challenging.</p><p>To come back to the central tenet, we are very clear in terms of what we want from Brexit.  The rationale behind the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill in the first instance was to reciprocate what was already available to us going North.  However, we also felt that in the context of the overall picture on Brexit, that we would be out of step.  Given that they have articulated since we published their intention, it is something on which we have to reflect.  On the all-island basis, however, there is still merit that we should reflect on in an all-island approach to these matters.  I would welcome the Senator's further consideration of our approach in that regard.</p><p>A voice missing in all of this, in the context of the all-island approach, is an Executive in Northern Ireland.  I appreciate all the efforts and difficulties around that, but it would be very interesting to hear the views of members of a Northern Executive in the context of <i>voisinage</i>, if we had them around the table.  In the very brief period between the court ruling and the collapse of the Executive in Northern Ireland, they were very clear in their request that we restore legally the all-island arrangement on these matters as quickly as possible.  Unfortunately, that voice has been missing for the past several months and I hope it is back on stage as quickly as possible.  I think I have-----</p></speech>

Members have raised some pertinent issues.  It was very clear from the outset that those in the United Kingdom in favour of Brexit wished to assume exclusive control of Britain's fishing rights and that the 6 to 12 mile zone was, therefore, going to be of critical importance.  It was also clear that the London Fisheries Convention would be part of the policy outline as a precursor to Brexit negotiations.  If Ireland were in that situation, the Government would probably what the British Government has done.  At the end of negotiations to leave the EU, Britain will disengage from the Common Fisheries Policy.  If that happens and the London Fisheries Convention remains in place, the 6 to 12 mile zone will still be in existence and there will , therefore, be a contradiction.  One can understand why that approach was taken.</p><p>Notwithstanding that the Minister has made a very reasoned and strong argument in terms of the Supreme Court judgment, the <i>voisinage</i>agreements and the need to accelerate the restoration of the situation that previously existed as custom and practice as a result of the exchange of documents or letters if not legally, it was foolhardy to go ahead with that before everything is crystallised.  In April 2016, I said in the D&aacute;il that there would soon be a new Parliament.  Whatever about the longevity of the current Parliament, I anticipate that when the next one is elected in five years' time or whatever, Britain will still not be out of the EU.  That is the problem.  As a result, the London Fisheries Convention will have to remain in place for another five, six or seven years.  It took the small country of Saint Barth&eacute;l&eacute;my three or four years to leave the EU.  It only had approximately 100 agreements with the EU while the United Kingdom has approximately 12,500.  They could not all be dealt with even if they were worked on for 24 hours a day in the coming years.  Brexit will be a very slow process.</p><p>It would have been wiser for the Minister to have stalled the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill in order to allow an overview to be acquired.  I was always against the alacrity with which the Minister pursued the Bill.  As Senator MacLochlainn said, the Minister has the best of motives and, as he comes from near Castletownbere, he is well aware of what is going on in the fishing industry.  I am an inlander and a midlander and, as a result, I am not as proficient in my knowledge of the fishing industry as many other members.  I defer to their greater knowledge.  However, many people have said to me that the Common Fisheries Policy was not a great deal for Ireland.  People have often compared it to giving away the rights to our oil, other natural resources and so on.  If one cannot harvest it, it might not have worked out.  Nevertheless, Ireland lost out significantly in the original negotiations.  No matter how good a negotiator the Minister is - and I have no doubt he will do his best - he will never retrieve what was lost.  There is no point crying over spilt milk.  One cannot unscramble an egg.  However, there has to be a concomitant negotiation in regard to fisheries as part of the overall trade.  That will be very important in the context of trying to maintain the portion of the population who are trying to eke out a living from the fishing industry.  In terms of the Bill, there are two separate things but they are parallel and collide at a point.  It would have been beneficial if, rather than rushing the legislation through, the Minister engaged constructively with various stakeholders who have an input into various things.  While the Department and the Minister's officials see one aspect to the issue, sometimes by taking an overview one gets a better result.  One might not get agreement from all participants.  Going by my experience, one would not because I have listened to fisheries groups before and there were as many views as there were fishermen, similar to how, if the views of farmers were to be canvassed, a small farmer would not agree with a big farmer.  I would be inclined to take the side the smaller fishermen trying to make a living.  While multimillion pound boats are expensive for their owners to purchase, I am more concerned by the lot of fishermen with boats worth &euro;400,000 or &euro;500,000.  I am probably out of sync.</p><p>Surely the starting point from a political perspective is to foster good relations with like-minded member states.  In order to do that, there should be a political consensus in Ireland and the Minister should enter into European negotiations with full backing and a political view representing the wider interests in terms of the fishing industry rather than a governmental or departmental view.  I am no expert.  I am more familiar with inland fisheries, which is also an important sector, although that is not well recognised.  I say that to the Minister in passing.</p><p>I am worried by the registration process, which does not appear to be airtight.  One can register from anywhere, come in and have a boat and avail of the 0 to 6 mile zone and so on.  Senator MacLochlainn made the point more eloquently and knowledgeably than I.  There is a fear on issue.  Perhaps those processes could be explored in a positive way at a consultative forum.  I would like to see that happen.  There is a seanfhocail that says that if one acts in haste, one repents at leisure.  Sometimes one might legislate and repent for a very long time in a state of crux, fear and apprehension.  The Minister should invite people to offer views as to how the Bill can be made more progressive in order to encompass, address and allay some of the fears on the issue.  Some of those fears may be unfounded but when people have fears, they express them strongly.  They should be given an opportunity to express and articulate them, particularly people who have gone to the well, put their money in their pockets and made a massive financial sacrifice that could bring them down in terms of  putting their necks on the line and being wiped out as a result of court cases.  I learned much from the Supreme Court judgment, which I read carefully.  Some of the points made by the Minister in that regard are correct but, nevertheless, people affected also have issues in terms of the outcome.  The process is not finished and members cannot stray into what may happen next - I will not do so - but there should be an Oireachtas cross-party forum that can make a submission which carries the weight of the Oireachtas to help the Minister on his way because dealing with this issue will be a rocky ride.  I hope the Minister has a lengthy spell in office.  I do not want to see his time shortened but he will be long gone from office before the end of the road is reached.  I hope he serves as both a Minister and a Deputy for a long time but I have never resiled from the view that this process could take between five and ten years, which is a long time for the many people apprehensive as to the outcome.  I am sick and tired of people prognosticating about what will happen.  Uncertainty is the only certainty, which is a very worrying development for all concerned, including governments.</p></speech>

In many ways, it was expected.  It was a game of chess and we were expecting this move but we now anticipate a very turbulent time.  Confidence will be key in the fishing industry in the coming years.  As a previous speaker indicated, it will take time to have the issues regarding Brexit resolved.  The two-year timeline proposed by the UK is deeply optimistic to say the least.  What we need from the discussions in the coming months is a confidence that we can bring to the market and the industry because there was a deep fear when this was announced that it would impact upon us in months if not years.  However, it is very important to realise that these are all tied in to the actual fishing policies themselves and, as a result, there will be no real movement on the matter until the entire Brexit issue is sorted out.</p> <p>  A report on Brexit has been compiled by the Seanad Select Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union addressing what the committee believes to be the pitfalls.  Fisheries was mentioned in that regard.  It is an important report.</p><p>We really need to see a timeline to ensure people are not too anxious that the two-year limit will be imposed.  This is going to take time to sort out and a rush into it would not be appropriate.</p></speech>

The UK can withdraw from the London Fisheries Convention in two years.  I share the analysis that it will be much longer withdrawing from the European Union but from the notification date, it can be gone from the London Fisheries Convention in two years.  This is further complicated, in a way that baffles us legally somewhat, in so far that the UK has stated it wants to retain the <i>voisinage</i>element of the London Fisheries Convention.  The announcement it made most recently concerned the six to 12-mile zone and the <i>voisinage </i>process concerns the zero to six-mile zone.  It is the one that the Bill deals with.  The UK has stated it wants to retain <i>voisinage</i>arrangements.  It remains to be seen whether it can legally do this.</p></speech>

We will have to reflect on where all that fits into in the context of Brexit negotiations.  Have no doubt that there are casualties to not proceeding with the arrangement as well.  There are people who wish to have the entitlements they had previously reinstated.  It is particularly difficult.</p><p>I appreciate the report the committee did and the views expressed here as part of the overall Brexit consultation process.  As I stated, these negotiations are going to go on for quite a while.  The input at different stages will be really important.  The fundamental objective in the analysis of the issue and how we prosecute it is substantially done as we are building an alliance with member states, which is mirrored in the alliance of industry.  There is another matter in the form of the Common Fisheries Policy.  I take the point about having big and small guys.  It might be true although not entirely accurate, as any generalisation is dangerous, but on accession our fishing industry was primarily all those small guys.  They are in the inshore fisheries sector.  We have established a forum for inshore fisheries and, by and large, these people fish non-quota species.  They are not really in the firing line in the Brexit context because of the non-quota species, and they are not in UK territorial waters.  Nevertheless, they are a very important part of the local economy, particularly outside the six established fishing centres.  There is Ballycotton and other smaller piers and they play a very important part.  We must ensure that with policy we are aware of their interests.  Brexit will have an effect on this but we must reflect further on how we deal with the Supreme Court ruling in the context of the UK's decision.</p></speech>

I fully appreciate where he is coming from with regard to the Common Fisheries Policy, as there must be some kind of common approach with all the other EU member states.  We can term what we are looking at as UK waters - until now, they were all EU waters - and it represents 17% of the overall EU fisheries, including the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea and all that.  We can take just the North Atlantic section, which is really what we are talking about, and it represents up to 30% of it or more.  In that context, it is hard to see how one cannot look at the Common Fisheries Policy, as we are looking at such a large lump of it being taken away.</p> <p>  The agreement, which amounted to a number of letters signed in the 1960s, set up a practice that had no legal standing at a time when all the island of Ireland was outside the EU, and later when the island of Ireland was inside the EU.  The big difference now is that a section of the island of Ireland will be outside the EU when the remainder is inside the EU.  That is what is throwing up the controversy.  I understand where the Minister is coming from in trying to put back in place the notion of fishermen, and particularly small fishermen on parts of the island, being able to fish up and down the coast.  That is perfectly understandable.  The difficulty is that Brexit throws it up in the air.  There is also the possibility of other vessels and people coming in and registering from overseas; for examples, Dutch vessels could be registered in Northern Ireland and have the right to fish in Irish waters.</p></speech>

We should look at this stage to see if the Bill can be amended to try to deal with those matters.  Is that possible?  We do not know.  As has been pointed out already, we do know so much about this.  It is almost an impossible position, and that is the problem with Brexit.  It has everybody left in such a confused state as to what the impact will be.  There are consequences we will not see and in turn there will be consequences arising from those.  I appreciate what the Minister is saying.</p><p>There are two points.  There is a large section of the North Atlantic waters that will be pulled from the Common Fisheries Policy, which will leave us in a position where we will need to look at the policy again.  I do not see how we can avoid that.  The <i>voisinage</i>process must be amended in some way as it is currently a little too loose when we think of what could happen coming down the road.</p></speech>

The two clear objectives are maintaining our existing quota share and our existing right to access.  This must be continued.  As I see it, there are a number of negotiations ongoing.  There is the negotiation between member states and the UK and after that comes a second round of negotiation, depending on the outcome of that first negotiation.  That will mean the Common Fisheries Policy will have to be revisited.  The Minister states that with regard to the UK territorial waters, we will lose nearly half of our total value of annual quota.  The Irish fishery income would be reduced by half.  The impact of that would be far greater here than in any of the other member states.</p><p>It has huge implications for our coastal communities, particularly for the two species mentioned with mackerel at 64% and prawns at 43%.  The second negotiation will have to be renegotiating the Common Fisheries Policy.  It must be renegotiated to ensure that we will have a viable industry for the future.  I listened to the interaction between Senator Mac Lochlainn and the Minister and his officials.  Senator Mac Lochlainn raised very important points relating to the quantity and type of fish being taken from the territorial waters of the Twenty-six Counties.  We cannot get an answer on that, yet the Minister can tell us that 64% of mackerel and 43% of prawns are taken from the UK territorial waters.  He cannot tell us the quantity of fish taken from the territorial waters of the Twenty-six Counties and who gets it.<br/><br/>I will put a question to the Minister's officials and I want an answer.  What is the amount of fish taken from the territorial waters of the Twenty-six Counties, who are the beneficiaries of that, what is the market value of the species taken from those waters and what is the contrast with what Irish registered and owned vessels take from those waters and its value?  I will not accept that this information cannot be given to us.  I can go on the Internet and see what vessels are fishing off the west coast and where they are fishing.  All those vessels have log books.  They know exactly what they are allowed to catch, what they catch and where the catch is landed.  What percentage of fish taken from the territorial waters of the Twenty-six Counties is landed in the island of Ireland?<br/><br/>I also have a question on the <i>voisinage</i>agreement.  Can that proceed this side of Brexit being concluded?  In my view, everything had to stop after the British Government activated Article 50.  Perhaps the Minister will explain it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-11a.92" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1425" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="17:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017071100002#N00200"><p>I wish to voice my concern in the wake of the unilateral decision by the UK Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to withdraw from the London agreement.  It definitely sent shock waves around the community of Irish fishermen and generates fear about the future of Brexit negotiations.  Potentially, in a worst-case scenario the fishermen are facing being shut out of particular waters which are profitable for them at present and also competing with UK fishermen who will not be constrained by quotas.  The Minister described it in terms of the hand the UK has with regard to fisheries, as opposed to many other sectors.  It appears to me to be quite strong.  The UK has many strong cards to play and I understand why Irish fishermen would be very concerned about how they will fare into the future and post Brexit.  There is a rightful concern that the overall priorities of the European Union will not be significant casualties of this.  I am heartened by the Minister's breakdown of the coalition of like-minded countries and so forth.  As an earlier speaker said, much is unknown.  However, we must steer the ship, so to speak, in the right direction and be flexible to achieve the right result.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned trying to protect fisheries in the context of the overall wider negotiations.  Member states have different cards and the UK will be looking for things in other areas, so we must ensure we strike the best deal we can.  However, I have some questions about the wider negotiations.  My colleague, Senator Lombard, mentioned the report of the Seanad select committee on the consequences of Brexit and possible solutions, which will have been presented to the Minister.  Undoubtedly, regardless of what happens, Brexit will mean a diminishing or weakening of our position in the case of fisheries and many of our other trade sectors.  It is not good news.  The issue is how we can support fishermen in this case.  I do not know how they might diversify.  The Minister referred to displacement.  What cushion can be put in place for fishermen in view of the shortfall?</p> <p>  In that context, one of the suggestions in the report was a temporary framework for state aid rules.  Such a framework does not simply happen overnight.  As we face into negotiations, is this one of the Minister's or the Government's priorities?  We need fiscal space to provide the financial assistance that fishermen and other sectors will require, especially our small and medium enterprises, SMEs.  However, that fiscal space can be constrained because we are operating under the fiscal compact rules.  Is there an intention on the part of the Government to seek a derogation from that to give us more flexibility to provide money to support the sectors, particularly the fishermen who will need to be supported as we move forward?  They are facing a real problem.  In my view they stand out more than many other sectors.  In many other sectors we are speculating, but the consequences are very stark for fishermen.</p> <p>  I realise the Minister, his team and the Government are doing their best and trying to get the best they can for fishermen and, indeed, all our trading sectors.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on a temporary framework for state aid rules.  Such a framework was put in place at the time of the banking crisis, so there is precedent.  How will we get more money to spend on supporting fishermen and on initiatives that will ease the situation and provide a cushion for them?  Any derogation from EU rules appears to take a long time to come into being.  Is that being considered in the overall Brexit negotiations?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-11a.93" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="17:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017071100002#N00300"><p>Deputy Kenny accurately summarised the situation.  This is extraordinarily complex.  If one stands back from the complexity for a moment and considers if one were starting with a blank sheet of paper, which we are not, would it be desirable to have a situation where we had reciprocal arrangements between the North and South?  It is interesting to consider the Supreme Court ruling.  Mr. Justice O'Donnell called the cross-Border approach in fisheries an important area of co-operation between the two jurisdictions and said there is much to applaud in this.  He went on to say that such co-operation is arguably an implementation of the constitutional provisions which have been in place since 1999, which expressly contemplate cross-Border co-operation in a number of areas.  We are talking about the zero to six miles, not the enormous resource outside the 12 mile zone where most of scaled fishing activity takes place.  It is hard to argue that we should not have that reciprocal arrangement.  Leaving aside all the consequences and complexities that flow from the judgment, it is still worth bearing that in mind and also taking into account what he refers to as the appropriate areas of co-operation as envisaged under the new constitutional arrangements since the Good Friday Agreement.</p><p>They are important.  Deputy Ferris made the point about the fish numbers or catches for mackerel and prawns in EU areas.  Deputy Ferris knows this, but if one looks at the fishing zones and boxes and one superimposes the zero to six mile and six to 12 mile zones, it takes an enormous amount of effort.  In the context of Brexit, considerable effort was put into evaluating our exposure.  It is interesting to note in the context of that exposure, while we are significantly exposed, we are not the most highly exposed in percentage terms.  Among EU states most dependent on landings from the UK zone, in percentage value terms, Belgium is at 50%, Ireland is at 34%, Denmark is at 30%, Netherlands is at 28%, France is at 19%, and Germany is at 18%.  In absolute value terms, France is the most exposed at &euro;170 million.  </p><p> To these member states and others that I did not mention, all of which have an exposure of one degree or another, we have emphasised that we face a shared problem and have a shared objective in negotiations.  We are working on the figures Deputy Ferris asked about, but it is not an easy exercise.  The zero to six mile and six to 12 mile zones cut across the boxes under which ISIS operate in terms of closed and open areas, and the fishing endeavour that goes on under those at any given time.  We are working to get that figure - it is not the case that we are hiding anything - and once the analysis is complete, we will share it. </p><p> If I understood Deputy Ferris's analysis of the Common Fisheries Policy, he is correct.  During the negotiations for next round of the Common Fisheries Policy, we will argue for the best possible outcome for Ireland.  The last one started in 2009 and finished in 2013 so it is a long process.  It would be counterproductive to open another front now, which, to be fair to Deputy Ferris, I do not think he is advocating.  Once we see the direction in which fisheries is going in the Brexit negotiations, it is possible that those negotiations could start.  We will be prepared for those in the context of getting the best deal possible for Ireland, but to open up a second front is not conducive to securing the best possible deal.</p><p> On Senator Mullherin's questions and observations regarding alternatives for coastal communities, during the last Common Fisheries Policy negotiations, we secured access to &euro;240 million under the European maritime fisheries fund, EMFF.  Spending is taking place in many areas.  For example, under flags, local development companies are funded under the maritime fisheries fund.  Local communities are asked to arrive at suggestions that will enhance the viability and sustainability of their communities.  It is similar to Leader for coastal communities.  Also under EMFF, there is much investment in onshore infrastructure to facilitate landings not only by Irish boats, but also other boats.  For example, if a French or Spanish vessel was closer to an Irish port rather than their home port, it might be able to land its fish and have it processed here and exported directly to their desired market, which gives onshore employment here.  As such, we are putting in infrastructure through EMFF in places such as Killybegs, Rossaveal, Dingle, and Castletownbere, so that these critical ports are benefitting from investment under EMFF.  </p><p> That is all important and significant but the most important issue is the Brexit negotiations.  Critical aspects of the negotiations will include working together, feeding into the Barnier negotiating team, sharing the analysis, ensuring that it is conducted in the broadest possible trade negotiations and not in isolation, ensuring that we retain access and retain our quota share.  Even if Brexit had not been happening, we would be seeking to improve the economic opportunity in those coastal communities through the maritime fisheries fund, which is worth &euro;240 million.  That is really important in diversifying the employment opportunities onshore as well as improving the efficiency of our fishing industry through assisting in new technologies on boats and so on.</p></speech>

He mentioned some of the bigger ports which are critical for fishermen but there are many piers and harbours along our coast.  This year, the Minister made two announcements about funding which is to be welcomed.  There is probably more funding than ever going into piers and harbours but in Mayo, which is on the smaller scale, there is much coastal erosion.  Local authorities' access to funding can be very <i>ad hoc</i>.  I wrote to the Minister about one particular harbour in Rathlackin.  A road goes up to it; it is right beside the pier.</p></speech>

A bigger investment by the State will then be necessary because it is a public road.  No one will use the harbour.  It might be something that the Minister could talk about with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  The money is critical to coastal communities which derive income from the use of piers and harbours.  The money that is given is welcome but sometimes trying to see some progress is like pulling hen's teeth.</p></speech>

The Department owns the six major fishing piers.  That is our primary area of responsibility.  We have a modest fund for assisting local authorities which are responsible for the other piers, from which we have made allocations.  I think it is capped at &euro;150,000.</p></speech>

I will give a brief introduction and background to the legislation before moving on to discuss the substance.  I would first like to thank the Chairman of this committee, Deputy Naughton, for inviting the Department to participate in today's meeting.  I hope that today's exchange will be of benefit to the committee in its consideration of the proposed amendments to the Broadcasting Act.  I will make a brief opening statement and then, following the contributions from RT&Eacute;, TG4 and the BAI, my colleagues and I will be available to answer questions.</p> <p>  Following a request from the Minister, this committee agreed last October to review the issue of the future funding of public service media.  This culminated in a very useful consultative forum at Dublin Castle last Friday, which in turn helped to educate and inform stakeholders about the challenges facing public sector broadcasting.  When the Minister wrote to the committee on this issue, he indicated that he would also be bringing forward legislative amendments to the Broadcasting Act 2009 to deal with some of the shorter-term funding issues.  Since then, the Minister has sent the draft scheme of the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2017 to this committee for pre-legislative scrutiny.</p><p>Committee members have already been provided with some briefing on the heads of the Bill.  In addition to scrutiny of the Bill, the Minister requested that the committee consider the issue of retransmission fees, which are not currently included in the legislative amendments.  I propose to set out the key elements of the Bill and an outline of the need for consideration of retransmission fees.  The draft scheme of the Bill contains a total of seven heads, which deal with the funding of broadcasters and improving TV licence fee collection.  I will set out the most significant proposed amendments.  </p><p> One of the difficulties associated with the current TV licence system is the unacceptably high level of evasion, which is estimated to be more than 14.6%.  This is very high by European standards with, for example, the UK having an evasion rate of 7%.  The figure in Ireland equates to a loss of approximately &euro;40 million per annum to public service broadcasting, which includes the broadcasting fund that supports the independent audiovisual production sector.  The evasion rate in the UK fell from 13% in 1991 to the current 7% after the BBC engaged commercial companies to undertake the licence fee collection role.  On the basis of legal advice received from the Office of the Attorney General, however, it is clear that the current legislation does not allow for the Minister to appoint a TV licence agent by way of public tender.  The proposed amendments to section 145 would rectify this situation.  </p><p> The proposed amendments to sections 33 and 123 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 are designed to allow for the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, to be allocated public funding from TV licence fee receipts towards meeting its operating expenses.  A further amendment in section 33 provides criteria that the authority can consider when determining the granting of exemptions, deferrals or reductions in the levy for individual broadcasters or classes of broadcaster.  It is intended that the consequent reductions in levy contributions would be applied across the board by the BAI in order that all broadcasters would benefit in equal proportion from the measure.  It is proposed that smaller community radio stations will be exempt from the levy altogether.  </p><p> The section 71 licensing process was established in the 2009 Act as a means of encouraging new market entrants, and particularly with regard to new and innovative forms of audiovisual media that might have a smaller audience appeal.  As such, it was determined that section 71 broadcasters would not be subject to paying the BAI levy.  Section 71 is, however, the only way in which new entrants, including traditional linear broadcasters, can establish themselves to provide broadcasting services in Ireland.  Given the likelihood that some UKbased broadcasters will look to establish a base in Ireland following Brexit, it is considered that the current provision should be amended in anticipation of this possibility.  This head, therefore, proposes providing the BAI with greater flexibility in determining the classes or types of section 71 contracts that might need to be issued in a postBrexit scenario.  The proposal and provides for amending the levy provisions to allow for the possibility of bringing section 71 broadcasters within the scope of the BAI levy.  This would ensure that, where appropriate, such services can be required to contribute towards the costs of their regulation, which would serve to reduce the burden upon other broadcasters paying the levy.  </p><p> It is proposed to amend the provisions of section 154 to allow for the creation of a new funding scheme that would allow the granting of bursaries to journalists in local or community radio stations.  The purpose of the scheme is to promote the development of good journalistic practices and standards in local radio.  The proposed amendment takes account of the BAI's objective to "provide a regulatory environment that will sustain independent and impartial journalism" set out in section 25(1)(d).  The authority would determine the number and amount of bursaries.</p><p> It is proposed to repeal the current exemption for cable platforms that is provided in section 103 of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 on the basis that there is no longer a public policy objective served in maintaining this exception.  This exemption was originally introduced in the late 1980s to support the roll-out of cable television services in Ireland.  This task has largely been achieved and, in any case, television services are now available over a wide range of platforms, including satellite.  The exemption only relates to Irish broadcasters.  The cable operators are not exempt from clearing rights in respect of any of the UK channels that they carry.  The way the system currently works is that RTE, TV3 and TG4 clear both the broadcast rights and the content rights for all platforms.  By repealing this provision, the rights holders for the content would have the flexibility to negotiate the clearance of their rights with the broadcasters or directly with the platform operators, whichever was deemed most beneficial to them.  The broadcasters would also be free of the onus to clear all of the rights for every platform.  The amendment would also remove the anomalous situation where a platform operator can exploit this provision to retransmit content which the public service broadcasters do not have the right to broadcast outside of their own network.  It is worth noting that a similar approach has been taken in the UK Digital Economy Act, which was enacted at the end of April this year.  </p><p> I will now address retransmission fees.  The issue of amending section 77 to allow Irish broadcasters subject to "must offer/must carry" obligations - RTE, TV3 and TG4 - to negotiate adequate compensation for the content they provide to television service providers has been identified by RTE as a potential significant source of revenue for public service broadcasters.  A legislative amendment would be required in order that broadcasters can seek to agree financial terms with relevant platform operators, including Eir, Sky, Virgin Media and Vodafone.  The platform operators are not in favour of amending the existing regime in this area.  The Minister is of the view that it would not be prudent to progress any legislative proposal without detailed consideration being undertaken.  He had advised the Cabinet of his intention to ask this committee to engage with both the public service broadcasters and the platform operators on the issue of retransmission fees.  </p><p> I hope this submission assists the committee's consideration of the draft legislation and I look forward to answering any questions members may have.  </p></speech>

We welcome the principles contained within the proposed Bill, which we believe will be of benefit to the public, commercial and community broadcasting sectors in Ireland.  A number of the heads, including the specific wording of a number of proposed sections, require further consideration and clarification and we envisage assisting the committee and the Department as this goes through the legislative process.  I will comment on some specific heads concentrating on some more than others because they relate to us.</p> <p>  There are three elements to head 2 covering working capital arrangements for the BAI, the potential extension of the levy order to section 71 contractors and a proposal to allow the BAI to be part-funded from the licence fee.  The BAI has sought the element relating to working capital for some time and it strongly supports the proposal.  It is somewhat complex and relates to when the BAI was first established and the fact that the levy is payable in arrears.  It left us short of working capital at the very beginning.  We have addressed that thorough a borrowing facility every year.  As this proposal would remove the requirement to go through a borrowing arrangement every year, we would welcome it.  We see it as a minor amendment that will be of benefit to us.  </p> <p>  We welcome the proposal to include section 71 contractors within the levy order provisions.  We understand the background.  In respect of the background to excluding them back in 2009, the idea was to encourage new entrants into the marketplace.  We did not have many new entrants based in this jurisdiction and the provision was designed to encourage those.  It is important that we still have that provision.  This is why it is important that the discretion and flexibility within the proposed section 33(4)(A) of the head are maintained because there will be a different mix of broadcasters.  We might have potentially larger broadcasters from the UK coming in and it is certainly appropriate that there be a levy provision on those but, hopefully, we will see the development of smaller, niche, minority broadcasters.  It would be difficult for these broadcasters to become established if we were to impose significant burdens on them.  We welcome the fact that it is happening but we think the flexibility the Department has put into the head makes a lot of sense and we very much support that.</p> <p>  The BAI notes the potential for up to 50% of the levy funding to be provided from the licence fee.  We welcome the principle of reducing the financial burden on the commercial and community broadcasting sectors and TG4 under this proposal.  We would express a concern around RTE in respect of this because there is potentially a net loss through this proposal.  RTE does pay us a levy as well.  If the money is taken from the licence fee and there is no recompensing mechanism, there will be a net loss to RTE on that.</p><p>The BAI, in its annual reviews of RTE funding over the past few years has recommended small increases in that funding but if this was to be implemented without there being some mechanism to offset it, be it through the increase in tackling evasion or an increase in the current level of the licence fee funding that goes to them, the principle would go some way to addressing it.  We agree with the principle and it is very valuable from our point of view that there is funding given to the broadcasting sectors, public, commercial and community, because they are challenged.  We would caution, however, that before it is implemented to the extent envisaged the question of how the net loss that RTE would suffer would be addressed. </p><p> Head 3 addresses the lacuna in the current Act around the section 70 contractor, which is TV3.  We support the principle that every service transmitted should operate with a licence whether provided in Ireland or another EU jurisdiction.  We welcome the principle under this head.  </p><p> I have captured many of my points about head 4 in my response to head 2, which concerns the safeguarding of any loss of income that would arise from RTE as a result of that.  The timing will be important in respect of how and when we introduce the new levy provisions.  </p><p> We have no current role in the matters envisaged in head 5 and I do not envisage the Department will give us a current role and we are happy with that.  We endorse everything the Department has said about, and any initiative that supports, tackling the high levels of licence fee evasion but we do not particularly want the task. </p><p> We strongly endorse the provisions under head 6, the bursary for journalism in the community sector.  It is intended that this will be done through the broadcasting funding scheme.  It does support our objective within the Act of sustaining independent and impartial journalism.  It has the potential to support the sustainability of local community radio sectors which have obligations around news and current affairs and I think this will help to support those, particularly local radio services which provide strong commitments to news and current affairs.  It also should support increased diversity for audiences.  There are several reasons for seeing this as a very positive development and we strongly support the provisions under head 6.  The issue of copyright addressed under this head is not currently within our remit.  We would like to reserve our position and explore the proposal further before taking a formal position on this. </p><p> Deputy Ryan asked me about the retransmission fees last week.  I have not changed my view in the week.  We support the principle of platform operators being charged retransmission fees which would recognise the value of the content being created by the public service broadcasters and other free to air broadcasters.  The content provided by these services is a key driver of consumer support for the packages provided by platform operators.  In a time of funding challenges for broadcasters under existing models, it would appear a legitimate mechanism for the provision of additional funding to support content creation.  We do think, however, as do our colleagues in the Department, that there are strongly held views among the platform operators in opposition to this proposal.  We suggest that there may be a requirement for further analysis, for example, international comparators or perhaps an impact assessment of what the proposal might entail.  This might be undertaken in advance of any decision being taken to amend the legislation.  I emphasise that we support the principle of charging retransmission fees.  We are happy to answer any questions the committee may have. </p></speech>

There is a funding challenge for all of us, the smaller one is the bigger the challenge.  We therefore welcome any proposals.</p> <p>  It was wonderful to hear all the great ideas that came forward at last Friday's forum.  I congratulate the committee on organising it.  We would be slightly agnostic on some of the proposals here.  Continual slicing of the licence fee may sometimes seem to be a solution but I am not sure it is the robust multi-annual, viable long-term solution that is required for some of the challenges we face.  I am not sure that making the carriage proposal obligatory will necessarily work to the advantage of small broadcasters such as our organisation.  I have sat in a room negotiating with some of the major platform providers on key questions and it is not an easy conversation.  Sometimes one has to be very agile in doing that.  Would it be worth pursuing the idea of making such carriage fee voluntary rather than mandatory?  There are bigger broadcasters than us in this room and perhaps the conversations are easier when they sit across the table from some of these multinational companies.  I welcome any proposal that gives us more funding, obviously, I would be foolish not to.  I would however be less than honest if I did not say that it is not easy for an organisation of the scale of TG4 to negotiate in any meaningful way about large sums of money without knowing that there is something else the big player can do to another part of its activities that may be to its detriment. </p> <p>  Sin a bhfuil le r&aacute; agam.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-11a.125" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Dee Forbes" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017071100002#D00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for inviting us here today for what we hope will be a really good and robust discussion.  With me here today are colleagues from RTE, Brian Dalton, managing director corporate affairs; Aisling McCabe, our head of platforms and strategy, and Eleanor Bleahene from our legal team.  In addition we have asked two colleagues from the international media strategy firm Mediatique, Mathew Horsman and Paul Fleming, to join us, to help provide some important context on the specific issues of copyright reform and retransmission fees, which is a complex area.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, I was away last week so I missed the future broadcast event the committee held last Friday in Dublin Castle but I have had incredibly positive feedback from colleagues and others on the day.  I echo the congratulations to the committee on having planned such an event.  It seems there was broad agreement on the need for an independent, publicly-funded national media organisation to continue to play a central role in Irish life.  It also seems there was a degree of consensus that the TV licence fee is in need of significant reform and modernisation.  That is very welcome.</p> <p>  I am also delighted that the committee has engaged in a thoughtful process to understand the very real challenges facing public service broadcasting here in Ireland.  RTE welcomes discussions on these issues, and if we can be of any help to the committee as it thinks more about this in the coming weeks we would be very happy to help. </p> <p>  As Ireland's largest public service broadcaster operating in an industry facing unprecedented change, the committee is aware of the many challenges facing RTE.  We will shortly be publishing our annual report for 2016.  The committee may have seen some of it already.  While 2016 was a strong year in terms of audience it was also a challenging year in terms of finance.  The exact details will be published next week and will show a deficit for 2016.</p><p>As I said the last time I was here, most of these challenges are for both RTE and the broadcasting sector to solve.  We must continue to engage audiences with great programming and strong journalism.  We must make the most of newer technologies to connect and interact with, and be relevant to, audiences in new ways.  We must invest in our infrastructure and digital technology to position RTE for the future.  We must restructure to create a more integrated organisation and, like every organisation, continually fight to reduce our costs.  We must also develop new sources of commercial revenue to help sustain the public services and programming Irish audiences continue to really value.  All of these areas are for us to address and while many of these are in progress, I look forward to outlining to members our new five-year strategy later in the year, once we have completed it.</p><p> The one aspect of public service broadcasting that is outside our control is the TV licence system.  That is the responsibility of the Minister, Government and this House, and RTE cannot fix it though we are reliant on it for over 50% of our revenue.  Some commentators seem to think that we should not continue to advocate for reform of the TV licence system, even though everyone knows, as was confirmed again by Friday&rsquo;s discussions, that it is fundamentally broken.  The reason we keep advocating for reform is because there has been no reform.  The current uncertainty around the TV licence fee system, both in its current performance and in how and when it might be reformed, is making it almost impossible for RTE and those reliant on us to plan for the next year ahead, let alone the next five years as is expected by our regulator and the Department.  The cost of the TV licence fee has now not been increased in a decade.  This is unlike virtually every other public or private utility.  To keep pace with inflation, stamps have increased in price, newspapers, pay TV subscriptions, health insurance, phone bills, hospital fees, electricity, broadband, bus fares - almost anything one can think of, so why not the TV licence?</p><p> During 2016, on average, Irish adults spent an hour watching RTE television and an additional hour listening to RTE radio every day.  RTE&rsquo;s online and mobile services are also among the most popular and frequently used in the country.  Currently at &euro;160, the TV licence costs Irish households 44 cent a day.  The most vulnerable in Ireland have their TV licence paid through the household benefits package.  If the TV licence fee had simply kept pace with inflation since it was last raised, as it is supposed to do as set out in legislation, the TV licence today would be at &euro;175 per household per year, or rather 47 cent per day, still just over one quarter of the cost of daily broadsheet newspaper.  That change alone would bring in an additional &euro;15 million to public service broadcasting, to both RTE and the independent production sector which is very reliant on that income.  Licence fee evasion in Ireland is among the highest in Europe at approximately 15%, with some &euro;40 million being lost each year to public service broadcasting and programming in both RTE and the independent production sector.  A further &euro;20 million is being lost each year through outdated TV licence exemptions, no longer reflective of how people are consuming TV.  These exemptions were written before the iPad even existed or a whole host of TV services like Sky Go, RTE Player and TG4 Player had become so prevalent.</p><p> The failure to reform and modernise the current TV licence system is now clearly unfair on those who do pay it and who are subsidising those who do not.  It is costing jobs across the sector, is causing a stark reduction in Irish-made TV programming, threatens the provision of trusted news and current affairs and has a stifling effect on the potential of the Irish broadcasting sector as whole.  Sensible and achievable reforms, many of which have been introduced in other European countries, could transform the sector here in Ireland and help to ensure the long-term viability of a strong Irish broadcasting voice.</p><p> I was encouraged by Deputy Dooley&rsquo;s reported comments last week that the Irish television licence fee system needs to be completely reformed to ensure proper funding for public service broadcasting.  In the context of comprehensive reform, I agree with him that it would be appropriate for a sensible discussion about how the increased proceeds of that reform might support public service broadcasting and programming, both inside and outside RTE.  I very much hope that the committee will encourage decisive action and advocate for comprehensive reform, because without it much of the ambition that I know many in RTE have for public service media, and indeed that many members of this committee have for us, will simply be impossible to achieve.</p><p> In this context, we welcome the opportunity to give the committee our perspective on the proposed legislation and to give our views on the issue of retransmission fees, which we strongly feel should be accommodated within this amendment Bill.  Indeed, as members will see from our own suggested amendments, they are relatively straightforward and they are sought in a context where RTE and other Irish free-to-air broadcasters must offer their channels to any appropriate network, no matter how small or how large.  The key change we are looking for is the insertion of two words into section 77(11) and section 77(12) of the Broadcasting Act, which when allied with the Minister&rsquo;s proposed changes to copyright legislation would simply provide for an entitlement for RTE to be paid for what it is obliged to offer.  This would finally level the playing field for fair negotiation between Irish broadcasters and TV platforms.  Sky, Virgin, Eir and Vodafone are key partners for RTE and other Irish broadcasters.  We have worked, and will continue to work, well together - it is in all our interests.  These pay TV platforms, crucially, allow us to maximise our reach with audiences, a key tenet of public service broadcasting, and allow us to generate commercial impacts.  In turn, as Mr. Horsman and Mr. Fleming will illustrate in detail shortly, we are creating very significant commercial value for them.  In our view the relationship, largely because of the law, is now very imbalanced in favour of platforms.</p><p> Creating a level playing field by amending legislation is not a guarantee of any outcome.  It is not a handout and it is not double taxation as the platforms may allege, but it will allow for a fair commercial negotiation on the basis of value.  Not only could these reforms help RTE maximise its commercial revenues, as it is required to do by law, it could also provide crucial new revenues to all Irish broadcasters, essential to ensure continued investment in Irish programming and the Irish independent production sector.  These reforms would also ensure that broadcasters can protect the value of their channels and programming from a whole new category of market entrants.</p><p> Access for consumers to broadcaster channels on pay TV services is changing at a rapid pace.  In recent years, the simple onscreen TV guide is increasingly being pushed to the side with home screens, which offer consumers all sorts of choices from on-demand programming, Internet services and movies and other services competing for the attention of audiences.  It is reasonable to ask whether the existing pay TV providers in Ireland would have been able to grow such successful businesses here without free access to Irish free-to-air channels, the channels that remain, despite so much change, by far the most popular in pay TV homes.  As of today, under existing must-offer legislation, should Facebook, Google, Amazon or Apple want to launch a TV proposition in Ireland, they could simply ask for our linear TV channels and we would be obliged in law to offer our channels to them free of any fees.  While there may have been a rationale many years ago to support the growth of different forms of TV access, is it reasonable for this to continue now not just for the existing players, but potentially for a whole new set of operators, many of whom are some of the most well-resourced media companies in the world?</p><p> Members will have seen from our submissions in advance of this session that we have included two detailed papers relating to copyright reform and retransmission fees.  One details our specific suggested legislative amendments and the other, from Mediatique, is a detailed submission which we believe sets out a fair description of the current arrangements between broadcasters and platforms in Ireland, and strongly makes the case for a fairer system.  We are conscious that these are complex issues and that is why we have asked Mr. Horsman and Mr. Fleming to come in, walk members through their submission and give them the opportunity to ask questions on both the international context and the benefits of a levelling the playing field between broadcasters and platforms.</p><p>Before I do that I wish to briefly comment on the other aspects of the amendment Bill as currently presented.  All of us here, including my colleagues around the table, share an ambition for Ireland to produce much more diverse and high-quality Irish programming and content to benefit the viewer; for there to be strong, fair, independent broadcast journalism and investigative reporting; for there to be more investment in key genres like TV drama and children's programming and in innovation; for there to be a thriving and creative independent production sector; and for there to be a plurality of voices, viewpoints and viable outlets and sources in Irish broadcast media at both local and national level.</p><p> Overall, given the scale of reform I believe everyone here considers necessary with regard to the TV licence fee in particular, if this version of the Irish media landscape is to happen, we are somewhat disappointed at the scope of ambition and likely impact of the proposed Bill.  That is not to say there are not some welcome developments, because there are, but there an opportunity to do more.</p><p> RTE believes strongly in the central role of the broadcasting regulator, the BAI.  Its role is becoming more complex as technology evolves and audiences are consuming media in more fragmented ways.  Clearly the BAI needs to be resourced properly to fulfil its role.  Making adjustments to facilitate the BAI regulating new broadcast services that may move to Ireland due to Brexit makes eminent sense, as indeed it makes sense to amend legislation to give the BAI discretion on section 71 licenceholders in respect of the BAI levy.</p><p> However head 4 of the proposed Bill is of concern to us.  Given the context of a host of independent reviews - many of them conducted by the BAI itself - stating that RTE should receive increased public funding, we were somewhat surprised that an outcome of the Bill as proposed would result in a further cut in public funding to RTE.  If, as stated, the current BAI levy was to be part-funded up to 50% from the TV licence fee, it would result, by our calculations, in a net loss of approximately &euro;1.6 million to RTE per year.  That monetary figure could grow further should the BAI's costs increase.</p><p> We are very aware of the financial pressures currently on all broadcasters and would welcome measures to relieve the regulatory cost burden for everyone, but to do so in a way that has the net effect of reducing RTE's public funding further hardly seems either fair or consistent with all the independent reviews suggesting the reverse needs to happen.  We believe that any move to use TV licence fee revenues to directly pay for the BAI's costs should only happen after real TV licence fee reform begins to deliver increased revenues.</p><p> RTE welcomes the move to consider the TV licence collection arrangements.  However, in respect of head 5 of the Bill as set out, it appears that should the Minister appoint an issuing agent following a public competition, it would not be given the enforcement powers, under section 145, to do the job.  RTE would welcome further clarification from the Department as regards the proposed amendments here and what purpose they serve.</p><p> As for head 6, RT&Eacute; welcomes the initiative to support the development of young journalists through a new bursary scheme administered by the BAI.  The scope and scale of this scheme is, however, unclear, nor is it clear how it might impact on the funding allocated to other BAI schemes.  RTE would welcome clarification from the Department as to what is being planned.</p><p> RTE greatly welcomes head 7, which proposes the removal of the copyright exemption that currently applies to cable operators.  RTE has been advocating for such a measure for a number of years now and it is a welcome development.  I will now hand over to Mr. Horsman and Mr. Fleming from Mediatique to take the committee through some detail on the transmission fees.</p></speech>

Hopefully, all the answers members ever had about retransmission are in there.  I will make a few opening comments and then Mr. Fleming will take us through some of the modelling we have done to look at retransmission fees and then I will come back and talk a bit about the overall revenue impact and what is going on in the Irish market.</p> <p>  At Mediatique we have worked on retransmission consent for some years now.  We started in 2012 for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp;amp; Sport, DCMS, where we did one of the first big reports in the UK on this topic.  We have worked for other broadcasters in the UK - Channel 4, the BBC and ITV.  Most recently, we have been working with RTE.  We have been working with the team here on this issue since 2014.  Our background is that we look at this pretty objectively.</p> <p>  What I am about to say is the view of Mediatique, albeit we are here at the invitation of RTE.  There is an imbalance in the Irish market between free-to-air channels on the one hand and pay TV platforms on the other.  There is no doubt about the imbalance.  Pay TV operators in particular benefit from access to the linear channels, the underlying RTE 1 and RTE 2 channels, and all the associated services that come with that, which help pay TV operators sustain the subscription revenues they get from their users.  It would not be as attractive were not for RTE channels being available, which as we heard from Ms Forbes are very popular channels, but also the content on those channels is there to be time shifted and watched on a personal video recorder.  The content can be available through a player proposition from RTE.  All of those services are hugely fundamental to the value proposition that is offered by Sky and Virgin in particular in this country and yet they do not pay anything for the underlying channels.</p> <p>  RTE has been held back from openly negotiating the terms of those particular services going to the pay TV operators because of the copyright exemption and because of the "must-offer, must-carry" issues about which many people in the room have been talking.  What we are going to address is what might need to happen for those payments to be made.  I should point out that I hear a lot from Virgin and Sky as we are very close to them in the UK and they will probably check with me first about what they will tell the committee.  Payments are made in the US and in European countries and territories.  It is not unbelievable that payments would be made by pay TV operators for free-to-air public service broadcasting services.  We include a review of the markets where that is the case.  We can talk about them if members wish.  We talk about one particular market where retransmission fees are huge, namely, the least regulated broadcast market in the world, the US, where retransmission fees this year will be $7 billion paid by the pay TV operators to free-to-air channels in return for having the right to put those channels on their platforms.</p> <p>  I am not as expert on the US market as the person whom I am about to quote.  Here is something to conjure with:  "Asking cable companies and other distribution partners to pay a small portion of the profits they make by reselling broadcast channels, the most-watched channels on their systems, will help to ensure the health of the over-the-air industry in America."  So said one Rupert Murdoch to the News Corporation annual meeting in 2009.  Fox, the free-to-air service in the US, is heavily helped by retransmission fees.  Where Mr. Murdoch has channels to sell, he thinks retransmission is a quite a good idea.  Where he has a platform, such as in Ireland and in the UK, he is not so interested in the retransmission system.  That is interesting from our point of view.</p> <p>  Why is this coming up now?  Why is there suddenly this talk about retransmission fees?  In fact, it is not quite sudden because as members have just heard, we have been talking about this issue since 2012 in the UK and since 2014 in Ireland.  There are some issues that have to be addressed.  The business models of the broadcasters are increasingly under pressure and they are being put under pressure by the very propositions that pay TV operators provide to their consumers.  Members should not get us wrong; it is terrific that these wonderful platforms are launched and they have time-shifting capabilities, Internet protocol, IP, delivered services over the top or within the services themselves.  That is terrific for the consumer.  The consumer is happily paying between &euro;30 and &euro;50 a month for the services overall.</p><p>That includes pay TV channels, sport and everything else.  The part of that proposition in the value is derived from the channels for which they pay nothing.  This weakening of the business model which the committee has heard of from many people in the room today is only going to accelerate through changes in things like navigation, home screens and the like where it is harder and harder to find the content the Government has intervened to ensure is produced, namely, original Irish content made by RTE in particular.</p><p> The other "why now?" point is very much up to the committee.  It is first of all the reform of section 103 to recognise this particular exemption for cable operators is no longer fit for purpose given what is happening in the overall marketplace.  I suspect that argument has been won.  It has certainly been won in the UK in the Digital Economy Act passed earlier this year and mentioned by the previous speaker.  According to the Act, it will be the case from this month or early next month that there is no copyright exemption for cable operators in the UK.  That will be the starting gun for really serious negotiations between broadcasters and the pay TV operators, in particular initially Virgin, as a result of these changes.</p><p> There are other things going on in the UK which I am very happy to share with the committee if it so desires.  Before we get into the numbers, the point we are trying to make is that negotiation is now possible or may be as a result of section 103 and just a few changes in the enabling legislation around "must offer" which are necessary to create the conditions for a level playing field whereby broadcasters, in particular RTE, and the platform operators at least enter negotiations on an equitable and fair basis.  That is not the case currently.  Perhaps it would be easier to see a positive outcome for RTE and broadcasters were these changes made.  They are no guarantee of this happening nor are they mandated payments, but it would allow free and open negotiations to occur between, in this case, RTE and the platform operators.</p><p> A question we have asked ourselves is how much we are talking about and what it is in relation to other payments that go on in the Irish market.  First, we have to concede one important point, which the platform operators like to point out.  Both channel suppliers and platform operators benefit from the channels being available on those platforms.  The channels can charge advertisers reached via the platform to generate advertising revenues, while the platform gets to derive subscription income by being able to offer a full range of popular services.  The question is who benefits most.  Absent these commercial negotiations, the only way to estimate is to ask consumers what they would do if certain services were no longer available on the platform.  That is the big test.  In other words, what revenues from advertising and subscription are at risk if the channels were not carried?  The flip side of these negotiations for the channels on the platform is what would happen if they were not there.  With RTE, we asked consumers in the Irish market in 2014 and again in 2016 and Mr. Fleming will take us through the results of that survey.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-11a.134" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Fleming" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017071100002#G00200"><p>In order to test the value that accrues on both sides, namely, the platform on the one hand and the free-to-air channel on the other, RTE undertook two surveys in 2014 and 2016, respectively.  The key message is on page 6 of the document circulated.  We can answer any questions in detail from the committee.  The survey asked subscribers what they would do if the free-to-air channels were no longer available on the Sky and Virgin platforms and 50% of Sky homes in 2014 and 2016 said they would leave the platform.  Equally, somewhere between 60% and 70% of Virgin media homes said they would leave the platform.  A further significant proportion of homes of 15% to 17% in relation to Sky and 17% to 18% in relation to Virgin Media said they would stay on the platform but expect a discount in the price they pay on a monthly basis of somewhere in the region of 20% to 30%.  What underpins this is the importance of the free-to-air channels to those subscribers.  According to the data at the bottom of the page, 57% of people said RTE 1 was the most important channel to them on the Sky platform.  A similar percentage is true for Virgin Media.</p> <p>  To some extent, this underpins the reason people make these decisions on leaving a platform if RTE and other free-to-air channels are no longer available.  In effect, a large proportion of the value Sky and Virgin generate is underpinned by the fact that they carry the free-to-air channels.  Of course, there is value for RTE also because a material percentage of people, 30% in relation to Sky, said they would stay on the platform if RTE was no longer available.  They would either cease to watch RTE altogether or they would make alternative arrangements to watch it on Saorview or via another device.  As such, there is a potential revenue risk to RTE from no longer being on the platform in that they would lose access to viewers and, hence, advertising revenue.  As Mr. Horsman said, there is value for both sides and potential risks to revenue for both sides.  Our analysis is about determining how large these risks are on both sides and what the relative value at stake was.</p> <p>  Turning to page 7, we can run the committee through some of the headline statistics.  The Irish situation is set out on the left hand side.  We looked at a number of scenarios.  We looked at RTE coming off Sky and Virgin and then at all the free-to-air channels coming off.  In each case, the value to the platform is materially larger than it is to the free-to-air broadcaster.  That suggests the revenue at risk from the loss of subscribers and having to impose discounts is far greater than the potential loss of advertising revenues to RTE and the other free-to-air channels.  Given these benefits, a fair settlement if commercial negotiations were possible, might suggest the midway point between those two by splitting the difference.  This implies a payment from the platform operator to the free-to-air broadcaster in each case.</p> <p>  As Mr. Horsman said, we undertook a similar exercise in the UK in 2014 on behalf of Channel 4 and ITV across similar scenarios.  We looked at all the PSBs or FTA broadcasters and just ITV and Channel 4 as the main commercial broadcasters.  The patterns are more or less the same.  The benefits to the platform are materially larger than the benefits to the free-to-air broadcaster which implies a payment from platforms to FTA broadcasters under some kind of commercial agreement.  In practice, of course, outcomes will vary depending on the time, risk attitude and nature of the people involved in a negotiation.  We have attempted here to simulate what we think a commercial negotiation might look like.  In practical terms, it is impossible to model what the actual outcome of commercial negotiations will be.  We have tried to simulate what it might look like.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-11a.135" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mathew Horsman" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017071100002#G00300"><p>This gives us a kind of indicative quantum but also, and crucially for us, the flow.  The direction of the flow of funds in all the examples is from the channel groups to the platforms.  That has been true, which is what drives the US market where $7 billion is spent for that.  In every case where there has been disagreement or a dispute, it is routinely settled in favour of the free-to-air channel.  People do not want a cable offering which does not include the most popular channels if they can easily, as it were, cross the street and get it from somewhere else.  In a competitive market, that is a great restraint on the ability to simply get rid of services, place the whole system into blackout and live with it.  That is not going to happen because the platforms will want to continue to have access to the channels.</p> <p>  One of the reasons we provided figures for 2014 and 2016 is that in carrying out a survey at any given time, one finds that while there are similar outcomes, it is a slightly different outcome each time.  That is because it depends on how many people subscribe at the time of the analysis, what is happening to advertising, how much RTE is charging for it and what variables go into the model.  It will always be a little different.  What we propose here is a kind of methodology for starting to have a sensible discussion about what payment flows might be possible.  It would really be down to the team to negotiate the outcome.  It would not be down to the analysts and consultants.  This gives one a sense of what might be at risk and at play.</p> <p>  People may be thinking in looking at the figures that &euro;18 million is a lot for Virgin to pay to RTE for example.  Let us skip right to page 11 as we are running out of time, albeit there is a great deal more in the presentations.  We encourage members to ask any questions.  They might be wondering what &euro;18 million to even &euro;30 million means in the context of the overall market.  We did a very simple exercise at the top of page 11.  We looked at the licence fee.  This is what we are calling the licence fee for television as opposed to other services which are funded by the licence fee.</p><p>This is taking RTE's TV spend plus Sound &amp;amp; Vision and TG4 all grouped as being the TV licence fee.  The committee will not recognise it from most of the published figures.  We then set the advertising market, not counting sponsorship, at approximately &euro;184 million in 2016.  Sponsorship is approximately &euro;12 million.  Regarding subscription, nobody reports any of these numbers properly so nobody really knows.  However, we have a pretty good sense of these things and we think it is approximately &euro;560 million in 2016 and &euro;30 million in other areas, such Netflix, Amazon and some of the new entrants to the Irish market.  That is a short &euro;1 billion.  It is a big number next to the &euro;18 million we discussed for the fees that might be paid by Virgin to RTE.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that there is also further detail below the line before going to the final page, which is that not only RTE but many other people charge for advertising in the Irish market.  In addition to RTE and TV3, there are the opt-out channels.  I am sure everyone has thought a great deal about those.  That market was worth almost nothing a few years ago but it is now worth &euro;40 million.  Of that, we think approximately &euro;25 million is paid to Sky for its channels.  Those are channels that have opt-out Irish advertisements and no Irish content to speak of.  We will return to that issue.  They are taking money out of the market.  Pit that against the context of talking about perhaps &euro;18 million in the example we gave earlier.  It gives a sense of the order of magnitude of this.<br/><br/>It is also worth asking about what would happen if payments were made.  If the end game is the sustainability of the public service model in Ireland, and we have talked a great deal about the licence fee and other elements, what happens to this money?  Does it sustain the market for public service outcomes?  One proxy for public service outcomes in our book is how much origination is being funded in a local market, particularly one which is a smaller nation that has a linguistically porous border with a big market that is able to export channels such as E4 and others that have come into the market with no commitment to content expenditure.<br/><br/>We basically added it up.  Again, these matters are not properly written up anywhere so we had to make some assumptions, and we will be happy to have a discussion with Sky, let alone the committee, on these issues.  We know the expenditure of Sky on content for the UK and Ireland.  It is a big number - &pound;3.3 billion was spent by Sky last year on content.  Of that, &pound;2 billion is for sport.  There are other categories such as movies, acquired content and so forth.  We then did a <i>pro rata</i>analysis of that to the size of the Irish market, which is shown in that column.  We then took Sky at its word, because it suggested that it spends &pound;20 million in the Irish market on original content.  It is not a number that we recognise, and it is fair to say that many people in the industry do not recognise it, but let us say that it is the right number.  That would mean that out of every euro Sky generates in revenue, 5 cent is spent on original content in Ireland.  The equivalent number for Virgin would be 20 cent on the euro and if that extra euro went into the RTE ledger it would be 83 cent.  In other words, 83% of the attributable revenues RTE generates is spent on original content.  It is likely, if one looks at the historical perspective if nothing else, that something that gives the possibility of having funds flow to RTE will have better outcomes than if the money stays with the platforms that do not invest appreciably in local content.<br/><br/>There is a great deal of detail in the back of the pack showing how the model works, and we provide many observations on the UK market.  I believe what has happened there is of interest to the committee with regard to decisions on retransmission, prominence in navigation and priority issues around channels and listings.  I will be happy to have a conversation on that, but I will conclude the formal element of the presentation now.</p></speech>

I will ask my questions and then call on Deputies Dooley and Stanley.  Perhaps the witnesses will take note of the questions as they are asked.  There will probably be some for everybody in the audience.</p> <p>  My first question is for the representatives of the Department and the BAI regarding the levy order.  I note that the last levy order was made in 2010.  Have there been any reviews of that order over the past seven years, given that the BAI has been struggling to maintain a sufficient level of working capital?  A concern has been raised by RTE about the fact that the BAI levy will be partly funded by the television licence fee receipts.  Will that result in a further reduction of TV licence fee receipts for the public service broadcasters?  The Department's representatives might wish to reply on that genuine concern.  On the issuing agents appointed by the Minister, what function will they have if they do not have any powers to bring proceedings for offences under sections 147(3) and 148?  How will that work?</p> <p>  I thank the representatives for their presentations on the retransmission fees and on what is happening internationally.  Would it be fair to say that there is a mutual benefit between the broadcasters and the platforms?  A survey of members of the public on how they would react if they no longer had access to free-to-air services has been done.  Some of them said they would want a discount.  That is where the risk of the negotiations arises.  There will be many risks involved.  I note TG4's concern about the electronic programme guide, EPG, and the priority given to channels in the event of transmission fees being charged.  How would that impact?  Is it possible that other TV platforms could move public service broadcasters down the priority list?  What safeguards could be put in place in that regard, because that is a huge part of our public service broadcasting obligations?  People are already paying for their television licence, so they might feel that they would be paying twice.  The witnesses alluded to this.  Some of the customers in the survey said they would like a discount.  They are already paying for it in one respect.  Perhaps they would comment on that.  Who would calculate the transmission fee or how would that happen?  Is there a view on that if transmission fees were in place?</p> <p>  Perhaps the witnesses will bank those questions as I will now call on Deputy Dooley.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-11a.138" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1274" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017071100002#H00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  They are helpful for us in trying to move this legislation forward.  My first comments will be to the Department's representatives.  The comments are somewhat political but the witnesses are representing the Minister.  I presume they are here to present his views and ideas, rather than necessarily the Department's views.  The scale of the problem facing public service broadcasters is enormous.  In Dublin Castle last Friday, there was a public hearing from many different parts of the sector and it was clear that public service broadcasters are facing an enormous problem and that time is effectively running out.  Legislators must ask themselves whether they believe in public service broadcasting and, if they do, whether they are prepared to commit to the challenge they face to address that, which is principally in terms of providing the appropriate funding.</p> <p>  To be honest, this legislation is tinkering around the edges.  It is short term.  From the Minister's perspective it might be a way of kicking the proverbial can down the road, beyond the length of his mandate.  If the Minister and the Government were serious about addressing the deficit in the funding of public service broadcasting, there would have been a far more comprehensive legislative measure and they would use the facilities of this committee to engage with stakeholders.  However, we are being asked to engage with stakeholders, and the stakeholders are here today, for something that is effectively bread and butter.  There is nothing in this.  Even the retransmission piece is not part of it and is kicked out at the end.  The legislation is a sham.  It fails to address the crisis that exists and which was addressed well last Friday.  It is just using the committee to front end the minor elements that might be somewhat contentious, although there are no real contentious issues here.  That is my opening comment, although I still have some questions about it.</p> <p>  The TV3 piece in head 3 and others is straightforward.  Like the Chairman, I have a concern about the BAI being funded.  If definitely requires more funding but funding out of the TV licence in advance of there being any increases in the revenue from TV licences is regrettable.</p><p>RTE outlined the potential cost, and although it is important to take the burden from local and community radios, heaping it back on an already overburdened and underfunded public service broadcaster is not the way to go.  Will we get some assurance that this will effectively be new money coming from an increase in the collection of licence fees and it will not apply until after the roll from the licence fee increases significantly?</p><p> I have questions about the appointment of a third party licence fee agent.  Will the witness tell us how that will pan out?  What are the bursaries to journalists on local radio stations about?  In principle, it is a nice idea but it does not address the crisis facing local media in general, whether it is print or local radio.  Could we look at addressing that in a much more comprehensive way?  The retransmission fee should be addressed as part of this Bill and I strongly advocate that the officials go back to the Minister to reconsider it.  This is a question to RTE and its agents.  It is really looking for the capacity to negotiate.  That is all.  Very helpful information has been provided to us.  It is useful to us but more relevant to RTE in terms of developing its negotiating position, which is fine.  I think all it is asking of the Legislature is to let us have a free hand in negotiating with the dominant player.  This is all good information but it should not require much more input from us.  We can bring in the stakeholders and I am sure they will kick up a fuss, talking about the impact it will have on viewers.  I assume they will talk of passing on the cost to the consumers in an effort to frighten the horses.  It is a matter that RTE can negotiate with them.  It does not want to lose any viewers, as laid out in the documentation, which is being made public.  It is clear that the body is constrained in terms of what can be charged to platforms.</p><p> What I am getting today is we must go back to the Department and Minister.  They need to step up to the plate and address the crisis facing public service broadcasting.  Frankly, with the pace of change and rate of development of technology, we will otherwise still be scratching our heads when the market will have moved on.  Public service broadcasting will not be in a position to invest in the creative sector.  We heard much about that on Friday.  There is a benefit provided to culture and history from home-grown programmes.  It will be too late if we do not move quickly.  It is very clear time is not on our side.  The retransmission fees seem to be the most important element, although they are not talked about, and we should allow the company to negotiate and figure it out.  We do not have to involve ourselves and we have enough to do.  We do not have to deal with what is paid or not paid, or what is viewed or not.  We should let it on with the business.  It clearly needs to be done.</p></speech>

It has been worthwhile and the engagement on Friday was also worthwhile.  This is essentially about money and sustainability.  I would like to mention language for a moment.  The engagement on Friday was very good and I do not know about anybody else, but the phrase "consumers consuming products" conjures for me the image of machines in a factory, with material going in one side and coming out in another shape.  Perhaps we could speak of people accessing programmes or citizens viewing or listening.  That would be helpful.  Language can sometimes frame a debate.</p> <p>  I disagree a little with Deputy Dooley about the Minister's responsibilities as we have a responsibility to ensure we get this Bill right.  All of our guests today, including those from the Department, RTE and TG4, have responsibilities, but we have a big responsibility to ensure we get legislation right.  We have reached decision time and we must make up our minds as to whether we want good quality public sector broadcasting, good programming and to ensure the quality of services that are there.  By any standard, there are pressures.</p> <p>  There is a high rate of evasion in the collection of the licence fee and I am not sure we are coming at this from the right direction.  Is there a better way of capturing the licence fee?  I made some suggestions about this in the past and am happy to do so again as it is important.  I am mindful of changes in technology.  I might be a bit old-fashioned as I go home to look at the television, flicking between a few channels.  That is about it.  I know people access television in different ways.  Perhaps we could be a bit more innovative in thinking about it.</p> <p>  As I understand it, what the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland is seeking would provide &euro;1.6 million extra.  Is the annual budget &euro;3.2 million?</p></speech>

I have concerns as it would be another slice taken from the licence fee.  The copyright changes would be good as companies broadcast material without having to clear copyright.</p> <p>  The Department indicated the evasion rate in Britain fell after the BBC engaged commercial operators to collect fees.  I have a concern about people like the Viper or people like him showing up at people's doors to collect money.  I am not arguing that the An Post system does not need to be fixed and I can see the problems in it.  I am concerned about some of the people who might tender for the contract to collect this money or the methods they might use on dark winter evenings, knocking on the doors of single parents to collect fees.  This feeds back into my earlier point in that we might be looking at this the wrong way around.  If we are looking at putting licence fee collection to a free-for-all, I would have concerns about it.  Over what period did the evasion rate in Britain decrease?  Were complaints procedures put in place if there was dissatisfaction with a company or contractor?</p> <p>  The retransmission fee and copyright changes must be the centrepiece of this process.  I agree with Deputy Dooley about the fee.  As I look more at this and how the sector it works, I can see it as an emerging gap in revenue for those who produce good quality broadcasting and new programming.  Overall, we have a major responsibility with this Bill as we have reached a crunch point.  This cannot be allowed to go on much longer.  Like many other matters, the can has been kicked down the road.  At this stage the can is fairly well battered.  We need to sort this out.  We should be a bit more careful with language and try to speak about people, as opposed to consumers.</p></speech>

I echo the opinion that the forum on Friday was useful in advance of this discussion.  I also echo Deputy Dooley's comments as a certain sense of urgency comes from this, certainly from the members of the committee who were present.</p><p>There is a lot that is good in our broadcasting system and we want to protect it.  It was suggested that we should take our time but I have a concern that we are not going quickly enough.  On the question of transmission rights, my children, who are aged 14 and 17, have hacked into my email account and increased our subscription to Netflix, which they do on a regular basis because they want to go from a one-carry to a two-carry device.  I will give out to them when I go home but they will put it back up again tomorrow.  I believe the &euro;30 million for Netflix is going to be much higher because it is changing at a rate of knots.</p><p> I was going home through UCD the other night and the bus shelters were advertising Now TV, and no-contract Game of Thrones.  Mates of mine watched the Lions game on a &euro;10 ticket and I feel we should have been renegotiating with Sky and Virgin five years ago because a negotiating position may go very quickly as companies move to the no-contract rule.  My instinct is that we should get content providers to pay their fair share.  It is not just about Rupert Murdoch.  I listened to a lecture at the Institute of International and European Affairs by an academic from Princeton, Susan Crawford, a few years ago.  She is an expert in how these networks are developing and she made the point very forcefully that the networks had to pay their fair share.</p><p> How many Saorview viewers are there?  When are the negotiations due to take place with Sky and-or Virgin?  What is the length of the deals with them - three years, five years, seven years?  What will be different if we give the contract for the licence to someone other than An Post?  What makes us think somebody else would be successful and produce a big increase in revenue?  What additional powers would we want?  The broadcasting powers made the system more lenient but does the Department have any other mechanism to increase recoverability?</p><p> It was reported in the papers recently that Facebook is looking at going into TV.  What negotiations has Facebook had with RTE, or the BAI or others?  Is there a prospect it will enter into the on-demand, no-contract TV world that seems to be evolving very quickly?  Maybe the process has only started and it has not trickled down to Ireland yet.  It is very unusual to throw open a piece of legislation to the committee.  How come the Department has not taken a position on it?  My advice would be to give the power to negotiate, though we should have done it several years ago.</p></speech>

On the legislation, the Minister has acknowledged that the sector is at a tipping point and has acknowledged the difficult financial situation facing everybody in the sector.  Every piece of legislation represents a balance of many different things and the Minister was very conscious of RTE and the other players.  As regards the BAI levy he is keen to do something for entities which are under pressure, such as local radio, and that is why the TV licence collection system is being put out to tender.  This is a big undertaking for us as it has never been put out to tender.  As Deputy Ryan said, we need to understand the full impact of what we are doing.  The reason we have been careful about changing the legislation is that if we put it out to tender we could select a private sector player and it is not possible for them to avoid doing some reconviction so we would need to work out that bit of it.  We did a market testing exercise, in the form of a request for information, RFI, to get a feel for the market and there were ten people who were interested in TV licence collection so we need to evaluate that and learn from it.</p> <p>  In answer to Deputy Dooley, I think the Minister does understand and we acknowledge that this is a short-term measure, with more fundamental things having to be done in the area.  We are conscious of the degree of evasion and that is the first thing the Minister has decided to tackle by putting it out to tender.  There is technology to enable us to collect the TV licence in a different way and Capita uses it in the UK.  We did the RFI to learn what was out there.  </p></speech>

It will be a tender on something that is quite sensitive so we are trying to get it right, rather than rushing it.  The Minister will decide what the timescale is but we are working through what we learned from the RFI.  We cannot do anything until the legislation is enacted because only An Post can do it at the moment.  The timeline depends on the enactment of the legislation.  We have to start designing the tender documentation and go out to the market but nothing can be awarded until the legislation is enacted.</p> <p>  The response from RTE on retransmisssion was very comprehensive and useful.  There are other entities such as Sky who have a different view so the Minister was very keen for the committee to have a full evaluation of retransmission fees to inform him as to whether something on that subject should go into the legislation.</p> <p>  In answer to Deputy Stanley's question, if it goes out to tender we are keen to ensure the right sort of people get the licence.  Any contract would be carefully crafted to make sure there were protections for people and there would be no free-for-all.  The Minister is keen that the option of paying for the TV licence through the post office network will continue in any event.  An Post is as entitled as anybody else to tender for this business and it is not out of the picture.</p> <p>  I was asked about additional powers and they can be looked at if necessary but we will do that when we look at the tender documentation.  Other questions may be more appropriate for RTE.</p></speech>

The levy is deemed by most people to be a fair system.  They do not like paying it but the regulatory burden is based on the level of regulation and I do not believe anyone has an issue with the system.</p><p>From that point of view it is fair.  Will it result in a reduction to RTE?  It will, although we are unsure of the actual figure.  It is a 50% reduction in what they currently pay, but then the broadcaster would lose on the total.  It would result in a reduction of somewhere between &euro;1.4 million and &euro;1.6 million.  That would be the loss on the basis of what we are talking about.</p><p> Deputy Stanley referred to the current budget.  We do not envisage the budget of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland increasing.  The budget is &euro;4.8 million, give or take a little.  That will not increase.  The way the Bill would operate means that the levy would provide &euro;2.4 million and the rest would come from the licence fee.  We do not see this arrangement creating extra funds from BAI.</p><p> Deputy Ryan asked about re-transmission.  We support the principle - we are clear on that.  We talked about a regulatory impact assessment and international comparators.  It is clear that much work has been done in this area and we should welcome that this work has been done.  In any legislation of this nature the regulatory impact is important - I am not kicking to touch.</p></speech>

Mr. Horsman and Ms Forbes outlined in their opening statements how these are important platforms for RTE.  We reach mass audiences through them and we generate commercial impacts.</p> <p>  Is the relationship mutually beneficial?  The answer to that is "No".  There is an imbalance in the relationship.  Mr. Horsman has demonstrated the scale of the subscription revenues in this market.  The figure is &euro;560 million.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the risk to platforms.  Ireland has the highest pay-television market in Europe.  Two thirds of Irish homes have a pay-television subscription.  We pay on average &euro;30 per month for a basic pack.  The Irish free-to-air channels are the most popular within those packs.</p> <p>  This is about putting value back into Irish content.  By comparison, within the US market approximately 2% of total subscription revenues go to re-transmission fees.  We are talking about a negligible cost to the operator and probably nothing to the consumer.</p> <p>  You raised an important point about the priority of channels in the electronic programming guide and the safeguards for consumers, Chairman.  That is close to our hearts.  It is already under threat.  We have talked about the changing interface.  People can go in and see it, but it is difficult to find channels sometimes.  My understanding is that currently there are no safeguards in the legislation around prioritisation of channels on television interfaces.  We negotiate that and sometimes they are difficult negotiations.  We see that as part of the negotiation.  If a platform knows that its audience or people or customers are watching certain channels, then it in the interests of the platform to keep those channels in a priority position.  It is not for debate today but we believe that as part of public policy there is an important point to be made and for discussion with the BAI around regulation of prioritisation of access and findability of publically-funded and public service media content across all devices and platforms.</p></speech>

People are paying a licence fee as a contribution towards public service media.  RTE is a dual-funded organisation.  We have obligations to secure commercial revenue.  I will go back to the earlier point.  These platforms are getting money on the basis of not paying any intellectual property for Irish content.  We have seen 83% of RTE revenue going to investment in Irish content and we want to put more into that.  That is the point &ndash; it is not double taxation.</p></speech>

The must-carry provision, which has always been there, has not been invoked in the UK because it has not been needed.  This is because there was an exemption on copyright.</p> <p>  My only point about the quantum in terms of the calculation is that it will get calculated as a function of two willing parties, that is to say, the supplier and platform coming to terms.

I will take that question first.  Saorview is in 660,000 Irish homes.  Of these, some 192,000 are primary homes, meaning they have Saorview as primary sets.  Approximately 200,000 pay-television homes also have Saorview as a secondary box.  The other homes are freesat.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the Sky negotiations.  We have a deal with Sky that has several years to run, but we would only be dealing with any one platform at one time.  I am keen to add that we have negotiations with platforms on an ongoing basis.

Our tendency to negotiate is sometimes influenced by our ability to negotiate.  The must-offer provision obliges RTE to provide its services to a network provider that would take in cable on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.  Effectively, this means for free.  We have a re-transmission arrangement with Virgin.  That will be reviewed on an ongoing basis.  Frankly, it is pending the outcome of RTE's request for a legislative review of the proposals, the wording around must-offer provisions, the removal of the copyright and section 103 must-carry provisions.</p> <p>  As Mr. Horsman outlined earlier, this race has been run in the UK.  It has been repealed effectively by the way of the UK Digital Economy Act.  The European Court of Justice has said that the provision in question is inconsistent with the provisions of the information society directive.  We have a similar provision in section 103.  As it stands, Ireland runs the risk of having proceedings taken against it if the provision continues to exist on the Statute Book.</p> <p>  RTE takes the view that it is a no-brainer to repeal it.  The repeal is long overdue.  The European Court of Justice has already said that it is incompatible with the provisions of the information society directive.</p></speech>

I have a simple thought in terms of how we pinch this investment in broadcasting - although "broadcasting" is the wrong word because we are referring to media.</p> <p>  One of the strongest arguments coming out of our event forum on Friday was that this is an industrial development strategy.  This is because we want to be good in the independent sector in particular and in the whole creative sector as well.</p><p>We have every reason to be good at it.  As I said, we have an independent, high-quality journalism, media, current affairs and news system.  TG4 and others have done much to start a nascent independent production sector.  It is very much an industrial strategy and it seems that this is one of the political arguments to support broadcasting.  Obviously, there are the democratic and other aspects to having a free and local press.  In that regard, I know that the previous director general, Noel Curran, had very much opened the possibility of opening up the RTE archives to Irish industry, specifically the Irish creative sector, as one part of a new and ongoing strategy.  If it were possible to fund RTE more securely, would that still be considered one of the possibilities in the context of the strategy that might be prepared?  If so, it seems that an open-access archive system would go a long way towards supporting all independent creators.</p><p> I wish to return to sports rights but in the context of a creative industrial strategy.  I would be interested to know how successful RTE's GAAGO has been.  I do not know what the figures are, and this is going into the other issue of whether or not one pays for TV sport, but it seems that putting GAAGO out internationally as a free service on an international player would fit into our national strategy and would justify much of our expenditure on some broadcasting if these kinds of games were available free to air globally.  This would form part of an industrial enterprise strategy, which is one of the most important things we need to work on.</p></speech>

Never has the time been so ripe for this to happen because I think we would all agree that we are seeing a resurgence in the quality of broadcast content around the world.  We are in a golden era of television, and where else should that be happening to a large degree but here in Ireland?  We are a nation of storytellers, we tell great stories and it is a shame that, because of funding, we are not really able to compete on the same level as the likes of Denmark and Israel, which have made really determined and concerted efforts to build that sector, as has the UK.  Anything that will help us in this regard is welcome, and we are certainly looking at the matter.  At a previous forum for Creative Ireland, I talked about coming up with the need for a contestable fund for Irish drama, for example.  We need desperately to invest in that category - and others, by the way - to regenerate activity in it.</p> <p>  Deputy Eamon Ryan's comments about the archive are very timely because this will all come out as part of that strategy, which is in development, and exactly where we intend to go with the archive will come out in September.  The archive is hugely important to the strategy.  We see the archive's huge value, not just to RTE but also to the nation, so I agree with the Deputy's sentiment that there is more in that.  What we must do as part of our strategy is understand how we will fund the archive for the future and deliver that.</p> <p>  Finally, GAAGO, as a commercial entity and a venture we have together with the GAA, is doing pretty well.  We would like to see more subscribers around the world but that is really down to people being aware of its availability.  It is very strong in places such as the US and Australia.  There is absolutely potential for growth but it is a pay proposition, given that it is a rights discussion with the GAA.  We have a very good relationship with the GAA.  It is something in which we see more potential to bring the national game around the world but it is a commercial enterprise.</p></speech>

They forget that it was the decision of Croke Park.  I recall being a member of the committee at the time the deal was done.  We brought the GAA in here and it was at pains to make the point that it was really about extending the reach of the games to the UK market and beyond.  It has not transpired like that.  I receive letters, emails and calls from people who say it is entirely unfair for elderly people who do not enjoy watching matches in pubs and do not have access to Sky.  We hear of people in their late 70s and early 80s who are immobile and, in some cases, confined to wheelchairs, who love the Gaelic games and who like to see their counties play.  Sadly, it was a very retrograde step taken by the GAA, in my view, aimed solely at generating increased profits at a time when Gaelic games were seeing a resurgence, generating much more revenue through additional deals.  It was a step too far.  I hope we have the GAA back before the committee in advance of the next round of negotiations.  Perhaps the committee could undertake to facilitate this in due course.  The GAA should, recognising its current position, seek to ensure that all games are available through RTE.  This would further add to the expectation of Irish viewers about what public service broadcasting is and an organisation such as the GAA should play its role in that regard.  It still will not change the outcome of the match between Clare and Cork at the weekend, but perhaps there are times when one would not want to see that.</p></speech>

Facebook is indeed considering being a content provider for the next stage in its evolution.  Hulu, of which the committee might have heard and which is, I suppose, kind of another US version of Netflix, is coming to the UK as a next step and possibly at the same time to Ireland, as is often the case.  My observation is twofold.  First, the trend is for so-called skinny bundles of content rather than fat bundles so the pay TV operators are also under some pressure.  They are having to think about re-tiering and changing their propositions a little in order to meet the consumer resistance - sorry, the people's resistance - to paying additional funds for content.  As a result, there is a little pressure going on even among the pay TV operators.  The issue that comes back with Facebook and Google and the entry of Hulu, Amazon and all these other players into the market is that this will only get worse and more and more complicated for RTE.  Right now, the joint 800,000 or 900,000 homes that take a pay TV operator service from the current offering bodies - Virgin, Sky and Eir - are important today and will be for some years to come.  At the same time, there is the amplifying effect of these new entrants also coming in, demanding their RTE content.  This issue of access by any player in the pay TV environment to these RTE services must be sorted out or else there will not be a sustainable model for RTE and other public service broadcasters.  What is the point in having an intervention of the current size if the content cannot be found?  That is the other point on this: it must be findable and it must be sustained.</p></speech>

This is the start of a process; there will be many more deliberations as legislation advances through the different stages.  Even prior to that, we intend to meet at the next engagement with the other stakeholders, including TV3 and platform operators Eir, Sky, Virgin Media and Vodafone on the other side of the debate.  They will come before us possibly at the start of the next term, if not before.  I thank the witnesses.  I know that a number of them participated in the forum on public service broadcasting which the committee held last Friday.</p><p>I think it went extremely well.  I know that a number of the witnesses were present so I thank them for their participation and input.  The forum had a successful outcome and certainly informed the debate.

It is an administrative scheme which was established in 1968.  It was created to facilitate equality of access to primary and post-primary education for those children who, because of where they resided, might otherwise have had a difficulty in attending school regularly.</p> <p>  School transport is a significant national operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department for Education and Skills.  During the 2016-17 school year in the region of 116,000 children, including some 12,000 with special educational needs, were transported in approximately 4,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country, covering over 100 million km annually.</p><p>In 2016 the total cost of school transport amounted to approximately &euro;182 million.  This included the cost of direct transport services, grant payments and funding to schools for the employment of escorts to accompany children with special educational needs whose care and safety needs were such as to require the support of an escort.</p><p> The purpose of the Department's school transport scheme is, having regard to the available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.  In general, children are eligible for school transport if they are attending their nearest school and satisfy the requisite distance criteria.  Families of eligible children for whom there is no school transport service available are eligible for the remote area grant towards the cost of making private transport arrangements.  In general, children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for it on a concessionary basis, subject to a number of terms and conditions detailed in the scheme.</p><p> Changes to the school transport scheme were announced in budget 2011 and derived from recommendations made in a comprehensive value for money review of the scheme.  The changes announced included the cessation of the closed-central school rule, CSR, at primary level, the cessation of the catchment boundary area system to determine eligibility at post-primary level and an increase, from seven to ten, in the minimum number of eligible children required to establish or retain a service.  The school transport scheme is in a transitional phase which began in the 2011-12 school year in which children in the same family or area have school transport eligibility to different schools.  </p><p> The purpose of the Department's school transport scheme for children with special educational needs is, having regard to the available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children with special educational needs arising from a diagnosed disability.  In general, these children are eligible for school transport if they are attending the nearest recognised mainstream school or unit that is or can be resourced to meet their special educational needs under the Department's criteria.  Eligibility is determined following consultation with the National Council for Special Education through its network of special educational needs organisers, SENOs.  The Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann are very conscious of the specialised nature of transport provision for children with special educational needs under the scheme.  This is reflected in the standard of service provided and by Bus &Eacute;ireann factoring the individual requirements of the children concerned into the planning of services which generally operate on a door to door basis.  The number of children availing of the special educational needs scheme has increased by 3,333, from 8,317 in 2012 to 11,650 in 2016, and the overall costs of the scheme, including grants, payments to contractors and funding for school transport escorts, have risen by almost &euro;26 million, from &euro;57.7 million to almost &euro;83.5 million in the same period.</p><p> School transport is provided using a mix of Bus &Eacute;ireann vehicles and private contractors.  A total of 90% of the vehicles used to provide services under the school transport scheme, currently equivalent to over 4,000 vehicles, are provided by private operators under contract to Bus &Eacute;ireann at a cost of approximately &euro;123 million in 2016.  The general aim is to re-tender all existing subcontracted work a minimum of once every five years at the rate of about 20% a year, with a five-year contract awarded to the successful tenderer on each occasion.  </p><p> The school transport scheme is very significant in transporting over 116,000 children on a daily basis at a cost of over &euro;182 million.  The criteria are applied equitably on a national basis.  I thank members of the committee for giving me this opportunity and of their time.</p></speech>

I believe we provide the State with an efficient, effective, safe and reliable school transport service that carries almost 116,000 schoolchildren every day of the school term on 4,500 vehicles travelling over 6,500 routes that serve 3,000 schools.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is one of the largest supporters of rural Ireland, with over &euro;123 million being paid in 2016 to 1,300 school transport contractors nationwide.  This provides thousands of jobs in communities across the country and makes Bus &Eacute;ireann one of the most experienced school transport service providers and managers internationally.</p> <p>  The delivery of the school transport scheme is complex, but its purpose is simple in supporting access to education.  More than 40 million individual journeys are made by schoolchildren under the scheme annually.  It is a classic public private partnership where more than 90% of the vehicles used every school day are provided by private operators on a network planned and co-ordinated by Bus &Eacute;ireann in compliance with rules and guidelines set by the Department of Education and Skills.  The operation of a safe school transport service provided in an efficient and effective manner is the highest priority for Bus &Eacute;ireann in its management of the school transport scheme.  </p> <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann operates three separate schemes on behalf of the Department, each with its own distinct criteria, under the umbrella of the national school transport scheme.  They are the primary school transport scheme, the post-primary school transport scheme and the school transport scheme for children with special educational needs arising from a diagnosed disability.</p> <p>  In the past decade in particular, the school transport scheme has expanded dramatically in terms of vehicle numbers as the number of services provided under the scheme increased from 1,700 contractor vehicles in 1998 to almost 4,100 today.  In 2016 a record number of 410 new services were introduced by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills, which is equivalent to an average of more than two new services every school day, the vast majority of which were for children with special educational needs.  At the same time, the number of Bus &Eacute;ireann school buses providing services has reduced, from 537 in 2009 to 381 in 2016, a reduction of 30% in daily commitments.  Contractor services have replaced these vehicles and all newly sanctioned services are opened to public tender by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  </p> <p>  In 2011 a revised tendering process was introduced for the provision of contracted services.  Under the revised process, 100% of existing contracted work is subject to tender at least once in every five years on the basis of an average of 20% per year.  Successful operators under this process are awarded a five-year contract.  The tendering process allows Bus &Eacute;ireann to achieve the procurement objectives of value for money, access to contracts for all interested parties, transparency on how contracts are awarded and equality of treatment.  It is also in line with Government policy where the expenditure of public funds is concerned.  Between 2009 and 2016, the cost to the Exchequer of providing school transport services declined by &euro;4.5 million to &euro;154.8 million.  During this period the number of daily services increased by almost 1,800, or approximately 40%.  Further savings are projected to be achieved in 2017-18 following the implementation of the Labour Court's recommendations agreed to by Bus &Eacute;ireann staff in May this year.  It is important to note that the scheme is administered by Bus &Eacute;ireann on a cost recovery basis only.</p> <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann manages the school transport scheme impartially and in a uniform fashion nationally on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills and does not have unilateral discretion to make local decisions that may be inconsistent with national policy.</p><p>The eligibility criteria that must be satisfied by students who wish to avail of the scheme is set out under the guidelines of the scheme and implemented accordingly by Bus &Eacute;ireann as required by the Department.  Catchment areas for school transport purposes were abolished by the Government under the post-primary scheme changes announced in the 2011 budget, which indicated that from the 2012 and 2013 school year, the use of the catchment boundary system would cease for all new post-primary children.  Eligibility for all new children entering post-primary school transport is now on the basis of the nearest appropriate post-primary centre, having regard to ethos and language.  Existing arrangements remained in place for existing post-primary pupils at he time of these changes for the duration of their schooling.</p><p> With special needs requirements, the principle of tailoring school transport services where possible and where economically feasible to meet the individual needs of children carried under this scheme is applied not only where children in wheelchairs are concerned but to the transport needs of children attending the wide range of special schools and classes we serve under this scheme in conjunction with the Department.  We currently utilise over 2,000 vehicles every day to provide services on some 2,300 routes for approximately 12,000 children with special educational needs, the vast majority of which provide services on a door-to-door basis.</p><p> My comments are a brief overview of the school transport scheme, which is a very complex undertaking for us, but one which Bus &Eacute;ireann has been immensely proud to deliver on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.  We have been operating this scheme and carrying the children of the State for 50 years as of this year, and we are passionately committed to providing this service for many years to come.  I take this opportunity to thank all the members for the opportunity to address them today and I am happy to deal with any questions in due course.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-11a.200" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. S&eacute; Goulding" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017071100002#G00200"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend this afternoon's meeting.  I am accompanied by my colleague, Ms Noelle Connolly, head of local services at the National Council for Special Education, NCSE.  The NCSE has a national network of special educational needs organisers, SENOs, who work with parents and schools to provide advice and resources to schools for students with special educational needs.  One of their roles includes processing applications for special school transport arrangements for students who are unable, for a variety of reasons, to avail of school transport under the general school transport scheme.<br/><br/>The majority of students with special educational needs are educated in the mainstream setting and can avail of the Department of Education and Skills general school transport scheme.  However, some students in mainstream schools may have particular difficulties arising from their disabilities which mean that they cannot use the school bus provided under the general school transport scheme.  For example they may require a wheelchair-accessible bus.  There are also approximately 15,000 students who are enrolled in a special class in a mainstream school or in a special school.  The Department&rsquo;s scheme allows for special transport arrangements to be put in place in order that transport may be provided to the nearest school that is, or can be resourced, to meet the special educational needs of the student concerned.  The role of the NCSE is to confirm to the Department that the school in question is the nearest such school.<br/><br/>When a school submits an application for special school transport, it will have sought and obtained parental or guardian consent beforehand.  On average, the NCSE receives approximately. 3,500 such applications annually from schools and all applications are accompanied by the relevant professional reports, which will have assessed the student with a diagnosed disability that meets the departmental criteria for support and also confirms that the student&rsquo;s needs are such that he or she cannot avail of the general school transport scheme.  In those cases, where the student requires a special class or special school placement, this would also be referenced in the professional reports.  Sometimes the needs of the students are such that they cannot avail of the school bus.  For example they may need to be transported by taxi, and in such cases the school would have to outline the reasons for this and also provide a professional report that supports this.<br/><br/>The school transport scheme also provides that schools may also apply to the SENO for an escort to assist the student with special educational needs.  In such cases, the school would set out the case for such a provision, for example, where a student has significant medical or behavioural reasons for such transport, and again the application would be accompanied by a professional report confirming the need.  The SENO reports on these matters to the Department, which then makes a formal decision on the application for transport before informing the school.  The scheme generally works well and it is only in a small number of cases that difficulties may arise in the application, and these would mainly relate to a position where the student is enrolled in a school that is not the nearest school which is or can be resourced to meet the student's needs.  In such circumstances, the SENO has no discretion as special transport arrangements can only be put in place to the nearer school.<br/><br/>The NCSE has a role in providing policy advice to the Minister for Education and Skills relating to the education of students with special educational needs and the role of the school transport scheme has been considered briefly in this context.  The NCSE acknowledges the significant effort, commitment and investment by the Department in providing special transport arrangements.  There is no doubt these arrangements are costly but without them, many students with special educational needs would not be able to attend school.  The NCSE considers that in general, the special transport scheme works well and parents appreciate the service.  However, in our policy advice to the Minister on supporting students with autism spectrum disorder in schools, the NCSE recognised that parents encounter difficulties where they choose to send their child to a special school that is not the nearest school that can be or is resourced to meet the child&rsquo;s special educational needs.  This may be because therapy supports are not available in the nearest school.<br/><br/>Another concern can be where bus drivers, bus escorts or other school staff have not received autism awareness training.  Consequently, there may not be a full understanding of how the most innocuous interaction may cause distress to some students with autism.  A further concern occasionally arises with transport between school and respite homes as it has been brought to the attention of the NCSE that some students are not transported from their respite centre to and from school.  This can place pressure on parents when the child is in respite to put in place their own transport arrangements and can impact on the full value of the respite provided.<br/><br/>The NCSE policy advice paper Supporting Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder<i>, </i>made the following recommendations.  School personnel working with students with autism spectrum disorder, ASD, including bus escorts, drivers and caretakers should receive training to promote and develop a common basic understanding of ASD and how it may affect students  The Departments of Health and Education and Skills should jointly consider and put in place appropriate practical arrangements for students with complex special educational needs to be transported to and from care settings to school on the same basis that they are transported from their homes, and, pending full roll-out of the Health Service Executive's progressing disabilities policy, to alternative special schools and special classes where the executive is unable to provide the necessary therapy supports for a student in his or her local school.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-11a.201" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Breda Corr" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017071100002#G00300"><p>I will probably repeat some of Mr. Goulding's comments.  I thank the committee for affording me the opportunity to give the views of our members today.  For those who I have not seen before, the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education, NABMSE is the recognised management voice of special education in Ireland and we provide countrywide representation for boards of management of special schools and mainstream, primary and post-primary schools providing education for pupils with special educational needs.  We represent over 200 schools.</p> <p>  Our members welcome the role and co-operation of the school transport section of the Department of Education and Skills and local Bus &Eacute;ireann staff in the operation of the school transport scheme for students with special educational needs.  This co-operation and relationship has always been the cornerstone of the efficient operation of the scheme for schools on the ground.  In the NCSE policy advice paper referred to by Mr. Goulding, it states, "the special transport scheme was considered to work well and to be an important asset for parents and students".  We agree with that.  However, in research undertaken by ourselves in 2011, we recognised that the student's ability to participate in school is influenced by events and conditions on the bus journey.  This research also noted that the skill of the bus escort in ensuring a successful journey is often challenged by the duration of the journey and appropriateness of the bus in accommodating the child&rsquo;s specific needs.</p> <p>  In this statement I will concentrate on four matters.  These are the day to day management of school transport in the special education setting; the selection criteria or rules relating to the awarding of contracts; catchment areas and the impact on special educational needs; and eligibility of students who can avail of the service.</p><p>I will give some background and context about transport for students with special educational needs.  Due to the geographically dispersed location of both mainstream and special schools in Ireland, as the committee has heard from other witnesses, a significant number of students avail of the school transport scheme.  I am not going to go into much more of it.  The service is operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.  The special education needs organiser, SENO, advises the Department if a child&rsquo;s care and safety needs are such that the child requires the support of a bus escort, and the SENO allocates funding to schools, for the employment of bus escorts by the school - which is important - to accompany children on the bus journey to and from school.  The role of the bus escort in circulars issued by the Department is described with reference to the need for children with special educational needs to be escorted while travelling on school buses and taxis, needing help with embarking and disembarking from the bus and needing help and supervision on the journey.  Bus escorts also act as a vital link between home and school.</p><p> In contrast to other jurisdictions, there is no reference to the level of training that bus escorts should be expected to engage in to do their job effectively, nor is any training provided for bus escorts.  Perhaps some is provided on a local level.  Some of the issues that have arisen in the provision of school transport for children with special educational needs in the day-to-day management of school transport are these.  Having staff on the buses with different employers can be difficult when procedures and protocols are not agreed and followed.  Some schools have expressed a preference for the Department to pay bus escorts directly.  There can be difficulties when buses and drivers are changed without prior notice to the school.  Many pupils with special educational needs are transported in taxis.  Some schools have found that, when an issue arises, there may be no personnel in that office who are familiar with the school transport arrangements.</p><p> There are many stages in the approval process for pupils with special educational needs.  This can take some time and schools are often not informed of the progress of the application, nor do they receive an approval in writing in many cases.  Thus, schools and parents are often not informed of the final decision until the beginning of the school year.  That is extremely stressful for parents who do not know at what time or by whom their child is being picked up for school.  On the selection criteria and awarding of contracts, many school contracts are changed and awarded without any notice to the school.  Very often, the school is only aware of the change in contract when the contractor loses the route or when a different bus driver arrives.  This leaves no time to prepare children with special educational needs for this, causing difficulties for everyone involved.</p><p> Research demonstrates clearly that children with special educational needs experience most challenges during unstructured periods of the school day such as recess, transition periods and travelling on school transport.  Many bus routes are too long, causing difficulties for students with special educational needs.  Some students can be on buses for well over three hours per day, which is very long.  This has been raised by Mr. S&eacute; Goulding already, and is in the policy paper.  Some schools have also found that additional students can be added to routes without notice, making routes longer.  Change in routine is not good for children with special educational needs and can cause difficulty for schools.  An issue raised in the consultation, which Mr. S&eacute; Goulding referred to, was respite.  I am not going to go into any great detail about that.</p><p> Eligibility criteria is a matter which has been mentioned by speakers already.  School transport is awarded to students on the basis that the student is attending the nearest school or special class which can be resourced to meet his or her needs.  However, this can cause problems when parents consider that the nearest special school best suits the needs of the student, and there is another school nearer to the child&rsquo;s home.  This may mean that the student is not eligible, and that is difficult.  We do not expect people to drive from Roscrea to Limerick, for argument's sake, but there is an issue there that could be considered.</p><p> I have some suggestions.  On the selection criteria, we are mindful of procurement rules that apply to the provision of school transport and the requirement for routes to be put to tender.  However, in the tendering of these routes and awarding of contracts, the following should be considered in the provision of transport for students with special educational needs.  The experience of the operator and driver in the provision of transport and working with people with special educational needs and disabilities should be considered.  The ability to provide wheelchair accessible buses can be a problem in some areas and is a problem nationally.  Alternative arrangements could be put in place to provide suitable buses in the event of a breakdown, since that causes trouble with schools as well.  Arrangements could be put in place for the replacement of the bus driver.  Protocols could be put in place to deal with accidents on the bus.  There needs to be willingness to engage in training, for example, to understand students with special educational needs, and so on.</p><p> On routes, catchment areas and applications, the length of the bus journey should be considered when planning the route.  Schools should be consulted and informed of any changes to a bus route, additional students on the route and changes in bus drivers well in advance so that pupils can be prepared.  There needs to be a tracking system for school transport applications.  Schools should be provided with an acknowledgement of receipt of the application.  Many do not even get that.  There needs to be a progress report on applications and a letter from Bus &Eacute;ireann - more work for Bus &Eacute;ireann - giving details of the bus provider on approval of the application.  Recommendation 6.3 of the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, policy advice paper should be implemented without delay.  This recommendation refers to transport to and from respite settings, and for students with complex needs to be transported to alternative special schools and classes where the HSE is unable to provide therapy supports.</p><p> The next section covers training for bus personnel.  Recommendation 6.2 of the NCSE policy advice paper points out that personnel should be trained, and Mr. S&eacute; Goulding alluded to that already.  We consider that this recommendation should apply to all students with special educational needs, not just those with an autism spectrum disorder, ASD.  There have have been developments in training for bus escorts.  St. Angela&rsquo;s College in Sligo developed a pilot training programme for bus escorts at our request and in partnership with us.  This project emanated from the summary report of an interdepartmental working group which formed in Sligo in 2005 to provide for all those involved in school transport of children with special educational needs to work together.  This group comprised members from the Department of Education and Skills, principals of special schools in Sligo, Bus &Eacute;ireann and a parent representative.  Discussions with bus escorts and occupational therapists also informed the work of the group.</p><p> I am happy to say that we rolled out a pilot project in Galway in 2013 and a former member of this committee, then Minister of State with responsibility for training and skills, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon, awarded the certificates for it.  An independent evaluation was carried out by Dr. Emer Ring of Mary Immaculate College.  I am not going to go into her recommendation, but she basically recommends that a specific training programme can impact on the bus escort's ability to have a positive influence on the children with special educational needs, and it should be considered for a national roll-out.  We have been talking to the Department about this and we hope that those discussions will yield some results.  St. Angela&rsquo;s College has amended this programme to ensure that the specific recommendations are implemented.  It is now willing and ready to roll out this programme as continual professional development.</p><p> I hope that this statement gives the committee some insights into the issues affecting students with special educational needs, and those are our proposed suggestions.  We look forward to working with all partners on these proposals for the improvement of the school transport experience for all students.</p></speech>

Much of what I am going to say has been said before, but I will go through it.</p> <p>  The current school transport scheme works extremely well for a large number of children and families.  However, there are some issues that parents have raised with us over the years.  Some are more general and some are specifically in the area of special educational needs.  I will start with more general issues.</p> <p>  The issues with catchment areas mainly apply to four areas, which include a lack of clarity about appropriate routes and a lack of flexibility in administering the system.  Those two issues, when parents ring us, generally apply to local knowledge about routes.  For example, people say that one would never go that way because the traffic is bad.  That is the kind of discussion that we have.  There is also a lack of awareness regarding the appeals procedure.  Many parents are not aware that there is an ability to appeal against decisions made.</p> <p>  The other main general area is health and safety.  There are concerns among parents about the health and safety of children availing of the school transport system.  These include the lack of adult supervision on school buses.  Currently, the only adult on a school bus is the driver, who is clearly not in a position to supervise the children travelling on the bus.</p><p>It is important for the physical safety of the children that there is an adult supervisor on all school buses carrying primary school aged children to ensure they are seated and wearing their seat belts at all times.  It is also important for other safety reasons regarding behaviours such as bullying that there is adult supervision on school buses.  The journey for a child who is being bullied on school transport can be very difficult and parents have reported difficulty in their child's school attendance solely due to the journey to and from school.<br/><br/>Concerns regarding road safety have also been brought to our attention.  School gates are often a very busy area at primary school arrival and dismissal times.  It is vital that proper protective factors are put in place as part of the school transport system that ensures children are kept safe on the roads in the area of the school.  These could include warning systems on school buses that alert people when children are leaving or getting on the bus, regulations that prevent the overtaking of parked school buses and speed restrictions around schools at appropriate times of the day.<br/><br/>There is also an availability issue.  Children in junior and senior infants generally finish one hour earlier than the other classes in the school.  In many instances, transport is not available for these children until the other classes have finished.  In regard to children with special educational needs, there is an issue around<b></b>eligibility criteria with regard to the nearest suitable school.  The main issue parents have highlighted to NPC regarding these eligibility criteria relates to the &quot;nearest recognised school&quot; element. The nearest recognised school that can be resourced may not be the most suitable school from the parents' point of view.  We have spoken to parents who have identified a school which they believe fits their child's needs most closely but it is not the nearest school and, therefore, the child will not be eligible for transport.  While NPC understands that the scheme cannot be completely open ended to accommodate all parents' wishes, more flexibility in eligibility criteria would assist better decisions being made in the interests of children.<br/><br/>On the length of time spent travelling to school, in some cases more than one child is availing of the transport to a particular school.  This can result in very long journeys to school for children who are coming from different areas.  Parents have reported daily round trips of up to three hours for what would otherwise be a 20 minute drive.<b></b>On transport escorts, many children need escorts when travelling to school.  Parents report that at times schools have difficulty in recruiting appropriate escorts.  In addition to the recruitment difficulties parents are concerned that it is not mandatory that transport escorts receive training with regard to the particular needs of the child they are escorting.  On time and availability of service, there are two issues regarding time and availability that parents report to NPC as causing difficulties for them.  First, children who are eligible for July provision and attend their own school for this provision will not be able to avail of transport and, second, children in junior and senior infants whose day finishes one hour earlier than the rest of the school may not be able to avail of transport at the appropriate time.<br/><br/>In addition to the areas highlighted above regarding the current provision of school transport, NPC believes that a review should be undertaken of school transport.  This should include a feasibility report on the delivery of a comprehensive school transport system that is available to all children who need to travel to and from school.  Parents consistently inform NPC that a half empty bus travels past their home going to their child&rsquo;s school that they would be happy to pay for; a bus is at risk of being cancelled due to lack of eligible children in an area; a good bus system in the city areas would reduce traffic congestion and parents would be happy to pay.  A full review of school transport should examine these and other issues fully and develop a transport plan that is fit for school children into the future.  The school transport system is vital to many children and families in their ability to access primary education.  NPC welcomes this review of the school transport system and hopes that it further enhances what is a fundamental service.</p></speech>

I will now open up the meeting to questions from members of the committee, following which I will invite Deputies and Senators who are not members to put their questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-11a.207" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1242" speakername="Catherine Martin" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017071100002#J00300"><p>I thank all of the witnesses for their presentations.  My first question is directed to the representatives of the Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  What is being done to ensure that drivers and escorts have the relevant training in special education needs?  Having taught in many schools for children with special educational needs, I know that not only teachers but all staff need training in special educational needs because when it comes to many of the basic interactions we take for granted, without an understanding of disabilities, in particular autism spectrum disorder, issues can escalate.  We should be seeking to ensure that all drivers and escorts undergo basic training in this area.</p> <p>  In regard to the establishment of "nearest recognised school", one of the criteria is that a copy be provided of the decision reached following an appeal under section 29 in respect of refusal of entry to a school.  Often, a primary school will have only one class which fills up quickly every year such that it is obvious to a parent that a child will not get a place in that school and so the parent does not engage in the section 29 process.  Is there any leeway in such cases?  In other words, is there any point putting the parent and the school through a section 29 process when it is obvious to everybody there is no way the child can be accommodated in the school?</p> <p>  A school in my constituency, Ballinteer Educate Together, is awaiting a permanent building and is to be relocated outside of the catchment area to Churchtown, which is beyond the 3.2 km for parents to travel.  Other schools that are temporarily located are also being moved outside of their catchment areas when planning permissions are unsuccessful.  The children currently attending the Ballinteer Educate school are able to walk to the school but following its relocation to Churchtown they will not be able to do so.  Many of their parents do not have cars and so the children will need school transport.  What arrangements, if any, are put in place where this happens?  </p> <p>  In regard to special educational needs, the phrase "nearest school which is or can be resourced to meet their needs" was mentioned.  Am I correct that if a parent identifies the nearest school as not having the resources to meet his or her child's needs that school can be so resourced?  If I have a child with special educational needs I would be seeking to enrol him or her in a the school that has special education needs provision in place which has been tried, tested and is working.  In terms of special needs allocations, if a parent seeks provision on behalf of a child at what point does the school apply for the resources identified?</p> <p>  At a recent cross-party meeting on school transport, I raised with the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, the issue of the 4,000 school transport vehicles and the 100 million km. covered by them annually.  What consideration, if any, is being given to the use of bio-fuels or electric vehicles?  As a country, we need to reduce our emissions and this small change could help us in achieving our climate change targets.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-11a.208" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1384" speakername="Maria Byrne" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017071100002#J00400"><p>I, too, thank all of the witnesses for their presentations.  I also want to raise a number of local issues.  I have been contacted by parents in Tipperary who have to drive their children two and a half miles to the nearest bus stop.  There are other children whose parents have to do likewise.  It does not make sense that so many children have to be driven two and a half miles to meet the school bus.  I accept it is not possible to cover all areas on a route but surely in a situation where there are up to 12 children attending the same school living in a particular area, as in this case, it should be possible for the bus to divert to that area to pick them up.</p> <p>  Similar to the issue raised by Deputy Martin in regard to Ballinteer Educate Together, Gaelscoil an Raithin in Limerick is awaiting a permanent site and is due to relocate in September to Mungret, which is 4 km. from its current location.  Mungret is not served by Bus &Eacute;ireann and or the school transport system.  Up to now, most parents have been able to walk their children to the school at its current location because they live in the catchment area but they will not be able to do so when it is relocated.  Are there any plans in place in this regard in terms of school transport?  I have contacted the school transport division and I have been told there are no such plans in place.  </p> <p>  There are number of children in my area who do not attend their nearest school, rather they attend another school on the far side of the city because it has more smaller classes and some of them have special needs.</p><p>The school bus passes them, where they gather at a bus stop, to start the route further down the road, but because they are a little further away, they do not meet the criteria.  Approximately eight of them gather every morning and the parents take them to school on a rota basis.  Every morning the bus passes them, but it is not part of the route.  These practical issues need to be looked at.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-11a.210" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1340" speakername="Carol Nolan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017071100002#K00200"><p>I thank all of the contributors to the discussion.  This is a huge issue in my constituency which covers County Offaly and north Tipperary and of concern to many parents.  I have been contacted by many of them about it even before they have received decisions.  The way many of them were treated last year was nothing short of a disgrace.  There is no flexibility whatsoever in the system and that is my main concern.  It disregards social and community links.  We have had a situation where children in County Offaly have been told to attend the nearest school which is in County Westmeath, even though many of them are connected with GAA clubs in County Offaly, which are at the heart of rural communities.  This totally disregards rural communities, for which there is a lack of respect and understanding.  I have made a comprehensive submission to the Minister of State, Deputy John Halligan, a copy of which I have with me, and if anyone from Bus &Eacute;ireann would like to see a copy, he or she can most certainly do so as it is full of solutions.  I am not complaining just for the sake of it and do have solutions to offer.</p> <p>  The system, in its current form, just does not work.  Parents complain every year and I am sure Bus &Eacute;ireann is inundated with complaints.  I recognise the fact that it has provided more buses for children with special needs, which I welcome, but there are flaws in the system which is failing children and rural communities.  We need to work out the proper way forward.</p> <p>  I find it astounding that not one of the almost 600 appeals to the school transport appeals board since 2014 has been upheld.  What does this say to those appealing?  In general, parents do not go through this mechanism unless they feel really aggrieved and believe they must do so.  Does the Department have a breakdown of appeals?  Is there a noticeable trend in the type of appeal submitted?  Is an annual report provided for the Department on the decision-making?  If so, I would like to see it because there should be transparency.  Is the board subject to scrutiny by the Ombudsman?  Have appeals been made to the Ombudsman?</p> <p>  I ask the Department, in particular, to reaffirm the commitment that there will be no downsizing of buses this year.  That is what we were led to believe would happen last year.</p> <p>  Given the trend of an increase in the numbers of pupils availing of it, is it likely, in the absence of increased capacity in the school bus service, that those availing of the concessionary transport scheme will lose seats?  What percentage of new applicants are seeking to avail of the scheme this year?  What percentage of those granted a school transport place for the first time last year were concessionary transport scheme bus pass holders?</p> <p>  The previous review of the school transport service was very disappointing and did little to address this growing issue.  As I stated, the nearest school rule is failing communities and we need to work through it in a pragmatic manner.  Much of what is happening is not pragmatic and does not make sense.  We have a school route in County Donegal that takes the children over a mountain pass.  We speak about health and safety in schools all of the time and the Department sends circular after circular, but we see this as ridiculous.  It does not make sense to me and must be tackled head on.</p> <p>  A report was to be published in June and I would like to know the reason for the hold-up.  I have to meet parents to explain what is happening and would like to be updated before I meet them.</p></speech>

The meeting has been very worthwhile and informative.  </p> <p>  Deputy Carol Nolan spoke for me and, I am sure, many others.  When we came back last September, there was complete mayhem.  Deputies and Senators from all parties all had the same story to tell, that the school transport service was not fit for purpose and I take no pleasure in saying this to the delegates.  As a result of pressure being exerted from all angles, a review was promised, but it took a while for it to be completed.  However, it was obvious to everybody before the review commenced that there was a problem, but when the review was completed, the word was that there was no issue and that it was business as usual.  This was very disappointing for all concerned.  As Deputy Carol Nolan outlined, there is a problem which collectively we need to address.  No schoolchild who is passed by a school bus should be left behind by it.  That is absolutely crazy and it makes no sense.  The committee should be about recognising that there is a problem and collectively trying to address it.  This is something that I hope will come from today's discussion.</p> <p>  On the roles of Bus &Eacute;ireann and the subcontractors, I briefly read a submission made by the Coach Tourism and Transport Council of Ireland which is not represented at this meeting.  I do not know whether our guests have had an opportunity to read it, but it might be useful to circulate a copy to them as some interesting points are made in it which I have noted.  </p> <p>  How often are the specific assigned routes reviewed?  A family from County Monaghan have told me that a particular route has been in operation for eight years but that the built environment has changed considerably in that period, meaning that there are more children seeking to use it.  What needs to happen for a review of a route to take place?</p> <p>  The submission received from the Coach Tourism and Transport Council of Ireland speaks about facilities on buses to cater children with special needs and wheelchair accessibility.  Are the delegates satisfied that the fleet operated - some 90% has been subcontracted to private companies - has been adapted adequately to cater for children with special needs?</p></speech>

This caused not alone huge inconvenience but also huge shock.  I hope there will be no surprises this year.  We have a "no surprises" clause in the confidence and supply agreement and I would like to think it extends to this issue.  It caused a lot of angst last year.</p> <p>  I thank Ms Corr from NABMSE for attending the meeting and all the work it did for us on the schools admission Bill, for which we were very grateful.  The school transport system is a very important part of the system of free education.  We know that it is limited, but it seems as if some of the rules have been very strictly enforced in recent years . </p> <p>  I do not know whether the particular issue of oversubscribed schools has been raised.  For example, Deputy Eugene Murphy has told me that children in Tarmonbarry in Longford cannot always get into the local school.  This means that they must attend a school in Strokestown or somewhere else which seems to be a problem.  Do the rules allow for oversubscription in the nearest school?</p></speech>

I am not a member of the committee and this is the first time I have engaged in a committee other than the one of which I am a member.  I am here because of the pure frustration I felt after last year's onslaught, for which nobody could ever have prepared me as a newly elected representative.  Ms McElduff and I exchanged numerous emails throughout last summer and at the end of the summer holidays I was still battling the school bus crisis.  What happened was shameful and disgraceful.  Parents were living in hope the review would bring them salvation, but it did not.  What has the Department learned in the past 12 months?  Where should the policy change?  What should the committee take to the Department of Education and Skills to get it to change the policy?  The Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon, has highlighted as the top issue affecting children the rural school transport service.</p><p>It is a live issue.</p><p> As my party's spokesperson on children, I want to know what the Department has learned and taken on board from the recommendations of the Ombudsman for Children?  Is the Department considering the introduction of tolerance levels?  Currently, we are very restricted.  The requirement is that there must be ten concessionary children in order for a service to be provided.  In terms of qualification for a service, would a tolerance level ranging from seven to ten, eight to ten or nine to ten children be considered?  What changes in most rural schools year in and year out is flexibility in coping with change.  We lost a school bus service in my area last year - Ms Niamh McElduff is well aware of this - because the number of eligible children decreased to eight.  The number has increased to ten this year and the service will be restored.  It was shocking that the service was lost last year.</p><p> Parents and teachers are caught in a catch-22 situation in that teachers will not say that they have an issue in their rural schools because that would flag such schools as being at risk.  Parents might not think twice about sending their children to a particular school but if it does not have a transport service, then it is a school at risk.  Commentary cannot be made on that because we do not want to advertise the enrolment.  Teachers do not come forward and engage in the big media campaign - which I would have recommended that they should have done - for the fear of schools losing enrolments.</p><p> My colleague, Senator Gallagher, spoke about reviews.  When was the last time the Department carried out a review?  How often are reviews carried out?  Population changes occur in catchment areas.</p><p> Deputy Nolan spoke about dividing parishes.  We do not do that in rural Ireland.  If one plays with Portumna GAA, one sticks with playing there, one does not move to play with Mullagh GAA.  It is as basic as that.  One is loyal to one's community and, as a result, parents make do, but that is not good enough.</p><p> Another factor came to light last year.  I am going to mention this even though it might not be the right thing to say.  People question why, for example, assistance and a bus service can be provided to transport only one child with disabilities in circumstances where the bus passes right by their front doors and their children attend the same school.  There should be none of that, no judging of other people.  The reason it happens is because the parents are not getting co-operation from the Department and then they contact Bus &Eacute;ireann and their public representatives.  This meeting is about the Department.  What has the Department done in the past 12 months to ease the pressure on children trying to get access to schools.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  Many members have covered a large number of the concerns to which I had intended to refer.  I will not reiterate what has been said.  The policy relating to the scheme, which is somewhat of a side issue, has not been raised.  I have received several emails on this matter and the committee may have received correspondence on it.  The Chairman said that the officials cannot comment on policy matters.  They might elaborate on the policy, however, because I did not know that one existed.</p> <p>  People have raised concerns about the disparity in terms of the transport allocation to non-religious families under the ethos provision of the Department's transport policy.  Families of children who were previously allocated transport to primary school based on being part of a minority religion or none found they were no longer eligible for that transport when they moved to second level.  The officials might provide some insight into that policy and the way the selection process in terms of religion happens.  Three religions were named when people requested to know what was a minority religion.  What is the selection process in terms of children of minority religions, especially having regard to the change in demographics, and has that process been reviewed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-11a.217" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1284" speakername="Aindrias Moynihan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017071100002#L00400"><p>I accept that many points have been covered but I need to raise a few particular issues.  As other members have said, this is a red-hot issue and I have found that to be the case right through the summer and into September in my constituency of Cork North-West in places such as Newcestown and Aubane near Millstreet.  The issue of whether their children will have a school transport service is a constant anxiety for parents.  It is also is of concern for parents in many other areas stretching from Coachford out to Macroom.</p> <p>  I want to focus on transport for students with special educational needs and those who might need medication administered at school and who would have the facility of a nurse at school.  Their parents have told me that they are not able to use school transport unless a nurse is available on the school bus because it would not be possible for the child to have the medication administered in the case of an emergency.  In order for children to avail of school transport, are nurses provided on school buses or are carers or drivers trained to administer various medications if students need them?  Where parents have a preference for a particular religious ethos and want to send their children a convent school instead of the education and training board, ETB school, that does not seem to be taken into consideration.  Some parents in Macroom wanted to send their children to the local convent school but the Coachford ETB school was closer and their children were not accommodated.  The latter does not appear to reflect what is in the rules.  That is what I have been told by parents but it should not be that way  The witnesses might comment on that.</p> <p>  On the criterion relating to the shortest traversable route, even though the school bus may not travel that route, a student's eligibility is measured by this.  For example, if there is a one-way street or no right turn and if one can travel to school by one route but cannot return the same way, I have heard that Bus &Eacute;ireann will only measure the route that is convenient to it.  The journey measurement should at least be an average over the distance.  A classic example of this is where traffic joins the N22 at Ovens school.  There is no right turn to go back towards Ballincollig, one has to go up around Casey's Road or over Kilumney.  Turning right at that point is not an option and it adds 1 km or 1.5 km to people's journeys.  There should be at least an averaging of the return journey instead of applying the shortest route principle.</p> <p>  The criterion which stipulates the minimum number of eligible passengers is one with which Aubane near Millstreet and many other places would have a particular issue.  This matter was highlighted in the review.  While much of the review conducted last year indicated it was a case of business as usual, this was one of the criteria to which consideration would be given to there being a degree of flexibility.  Has there been any reduction on that or what is the plan for reducing it?  It was one of the few issues to be considered.</p> <p>  The stipulation regarding the central school is often lumped in with that relating to the school that is closest.  Despite what the name suggests, when other schools in a catchment area have closed, the central school is not necessarily the central or middle school and may be off to one side of the catchment area as in the case of Newcestown in Cork.  Families over several generations would have associations - through the parish, the school and the wider community - with the central school, yet when the rule was changed and the shortest distance was applied, it has meant that parents on the eastern end of Newcestown catchment area are being told that their children have to attend schools in other areas such as Cloughduv or Laragh in towards Bandon.  Those are not communities with which those families would have associated.  Their school, football, hurling and everything is in Newcestown.  The same situation is replicated throughout the country.  The witnesses must take local associations into consideration.</p><p>For example, there could be a case for having some flexibility in the form of several metres, a couple of hundred metres or a kilometre of a band around the shortest distance in order to accommodate the situation and to allow rural communities to retain their identity.</p></speech>

I agree with everything that has been said by speakers so far.  There is much commonality across the issues.  It is unusual to have such a number of non-members attending committee meetings but it is a sign of how passionate people feel about the issue and the fact that people are experiencing difficulty with the system.  The high level of attendance in itself says a lot about the system.</p><p>School transport is one of the most frequently raised issues in my constituency office.  It is also one of the most frustrating.  As practising politicians we deal with all kinds of different issues but we can usually make some progress on them or at least get information or a response of some kind.  School transport is one of the few issues where one feels one is banging one's head against a wall trying to get any information or updates.  Before I was elected to the House I was a public representative on the council and I dealt with the same issues in terms of the Bus &Eacute;ireann interface and the lines we are encouraged to use.  I hate having to say it but it was extremely difficult to get an answer.  I do not even mean the right answer, I mean any answer.  When one telephoned a number it rang out and eventually one left a voice message.  A few months later one would possibly get a call back but usually one would not.  That was my experience until recently.</p><p>Such was the extent of my frustration I got the Minister of State, Deputy John Halligan, involved.  He is the Minister of State with responsibility for school transport.  I met him some months ago and expressed my concerns and frustrations to him about the interface with the company and getting information.  The Minister of State took the points on board.  He said a revamped communications system and interface were being rolled out.  I have engaged with it and it is probably a little bit better but there is some distance to go in terms of how parents and public representatives interface on school transport.  It should not be up to public representatives.  Parents of school-going children should be able to interface with Bus &Eacute;ireann and the Department of Education and Skills themselves without ever having to invoke us.  We should only be contacted in exceptional circumstances but, unfortunately, the interface is so poor that parents do not know how to do that or if they do, they do not get any response and they end up coming to me and my colleagues and we try our best to do something.  We often find we make a little more progress than they did.</p><p>I have contacted Bus &Eacute;ireann representatives via the email interface, <i>buseireann.ie</i>, recently and it is okay but it can take a while and can be haphazard.  One issue I raised was responded to reasonably quickly, as in a few weeks, but another took over a month and it was not entirely satisfactory, but at least it was an improvement that there was an answer even if it was not the desired answer.  I give credit to Bus &Eacute;ireann for that.</p><p>I do not wish to overlap with the issues raised by previous speakers but I agree with many of the points made such as the arbitrariness of the rule on the nearest school.  Other speakers referred to the linkage and the tradition among families where generations have gone from a particular primary school to a particular secondary school or the fact that a community goes to school in a particular place because of the sporting ties, cultural ties, parish ties, historical affinity or other traditions of parents or grandparents going to a school.  There are all kinds of reasons more complex than the pure linear distance from A to B, which seems to be a crude measure.</p><p>It is very unfair to say to a parent that a child had a discretionary place on a bus route for the past three, four or even five years in some cases but that it is not available this year because the route was re-tendered, the bus is smaller this year than it was last year and there are fewer places available on it.  The view is that it is hard luck but the child cannot get a place even though he or she got one last year and the year before and perhaps a sibling did also.  It is very difficult for parents in that situation who would have a legitimate expectation of having a place for the duration of a school term.  I accept that it says somewhere in the small print that a place is not always guaranteed but it strikes me as a legitimate expectation that a place would be provided on a bus, or at least if a space was provided initially that it would be available until the end of term.  The rules of the scheme need to be looked at in terms of how it operates and how parents can then plan for their own arrangements.</p><p>Parents take decisions about the school their children go to, where they go to work and how they organise their commute.  They have to consider whether they need one car or two cars.  Many people have had to leave their workplace or change their working arrangements to accommodate school transport.  The issue is having a serious and detrimental impact not just on the individual child but on the wider family because of the lack of consistency in the scheme and the lack of information and advance planning.  One does not know from one year to the next whether one's child will secure a place.</p><p>I wish to briefly raise two local issues.  As the Chairman said, perhaps the response could be provided in writing or in some other way.  I should not have to come before the committee to do this but unfortunately other avenues have not been fruitful.  Therefore, we are where we are.  I represent Kildare North.  There has been a major issue in the north-west Kildare area, in particular Johnstownbridge and Broadford, which are two busy and growing villages with significant numbers among the school-going population going to school in Edenderry.  It has been a tradition for generations that children from the area have gone to school in St. Mary's in Edenderry.  That was always done.  They played sport in that area also.  The school bus went from a 60-seater to a 48-seater prior to last September and 12 families lost their places.  People just about managed to make do.  All kinds of arrangements were worked out.  In one case a child was travelling in a car waving to her friends on the bus who were going along the same road beside her, and she was looking at empty bus seats.  The child in question was told she could not get a place.  There were many such difficulties.</p><p>I would like to establish what is the position on that route because what has happened now is that those who can afford to are clubbing together in order to get a private bus and those who cannot afford it are left in the lurch.  It is a case of unequal access to education.  It is a fundamental issue that must be examined.  I would appreciate it if the Johnstownbridge and Broadford to Edenderry route could be looked at in terms of what capacity will be provided coming into the new school year, and as early as possible because it is already near the end of July and parents must begin to make some plans for next year.</p><p>Another local issue relates to Sallins, which has a large rural catchment area and children travel into school in Naas and have done for many years.  One particular route covers Sallins, Sherlockstown, Kileenmore, Ardclough and Alasty.  It is a rural loop.  Without getting into the minutiae of it, the bus goes clockwise in the morning and counter-clockwise in the evening.  One would expect that the children who are collected first in the morning would be dropped home first in the evening.  They leave the house a little earlier than their schoolmates, up to an hour earlier in some cases, but one would expect that would balance out in the evening and that they would get home an hour earlier.  I raised the issue about a month ago and I got an explanation by email yesterday to the effect that this is the way it has been done for the past 25 years since the route was opened.  I do not think that is a good enough reason because times change, demographics change and populations and routes change.</p><p>The fact that it was always done that way does not mean it is the right way.  On the outward journey the bus goes one way and on the return journey it goes the reverse way.  It is not right that the children who get picked up first in the morning get dropped off last thing at night, which means they lose out at both ends of the day.  The poor children are exhausted going home and the parents are bedraggled trying to keep up with it all.  I do not expect an immediate response although it would be great if there was one but I would welcome a response to the issues in due course and in a timely fashion so that we can intercede if we need to for the coming year.</p><p>If the witnesses were to take one thing from the meeting it is that Bus &Eacute;ireann should improve the interface at least so that public representatives and parents can have a decent engagement and be able to get the information in a timely fashion when they need it.  That would be a great help.</p></speech>

I wish to raise a number of issues.  The meeting is running late and I would appreciate if the witnesses could respond to me in writing because I must attend another meeting at 6 p.m.</p> <p>  Is there a national policy for the way concessionary tickets are allocated?  Is it done by lottery or is it based on the first people to pay?  How does the system work?  It seems to be different in different areas.</p> <p>  I also made a submission to the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, but unfortunately some of the issues we raised with him have not been addressed.  I wish to raise two schools with the witnesses and I will be as brief as I can.  One is in Blacklion in County Cavan where the children travel to St. Clare&rsquo;s comprehensive school in Manorhamilton.  The journey is about 14 km from their home to the school.</p><p>It is approximately 14 km from the home to the school.  There was a review done in 2013 and the children were eligible at the time to go to the school.  I am sure we all have children doing exams or in exam years and the children in this case will be moved 29.5 km, from the school they are in to another school.  That is because of the new way the Department is measuring the distance from home to school.  Some of these measurements are across boggy and mountain roads that cannot really be traversed by a big school bus.  There is not a hope that could happen.  Nevertheless, these people are being deprived of the bus that the family has availed of for years to bring the children to St. Clare's Comprehensive School.  It is desperately wrong to move children who are in exam years out of a school.  They are being moved 29.5 km to another school where they know absolutely nobody and they have no connection with it in terms of sports, football etc.  It is very wrong and the matter should be considered.  It should be recognised that the school transport scheme has done a fantastic job as 116,000 children were transported to school last year.  It has operated over 50 years and given people an opportunity they would never have had to improve their lives and position.  It has helped their families as well, which should be recognised.</p><p> There is a school in Bunninadden in County Sligo that happens to be at the end of one catchment area and the beginning of another.  It is probably just outside the catchment of St. Attracta's college in Tubbercurry but it is in the catchment of Col&aacute;iste Muire in Ballymote.  There is a bus that collects children who want to go to the school.  As it happens, in the national school this year there are five pupils going one way and five going the other way.  The second bus, which goes to St. Attracta's college, comes into the village of Bunninadden so people can be collected safely.  We are talking about country and rural roads, some of which are very busy.  That bus is under threat but it should not be.  The pupils are being collected from the catchment area but the bus comes to the village, where it is safe to collect children and for parents to park etc.  That example should be examined.  I do not see why the second bus should be under threat as it is now.</p><p> I will finish with that as it has been a long meeting.  I would appreciate a response on the queries I have raised as soon as possible.  I thank the witnesses.  I am sorry I must go to another meeting that started at 6 p.m.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-11a.223" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1395" speakername="Jennifer Murnane O'Connor" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017071100002#N00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for addressing us today.  I am not here on a regular basis but I am just here because I have massive concerns about the bus system.  My main concern is about national policies, and it has been mentioned that they were changed in 2011 and 2012.  There is no appeal system.  I have told people not to appeal decisions.  Within my area of Carlow and Borris-Myshall, the people skills of the staff should be looked at.  I was speaking with the Minister recently about another case.  I can understand there is no medical card waiver for concessionary school transport, and it is something that needs to be addressed, but it really concerns me where the number of applications for transport on a concessionary basis exceeds the number of seats available, Bus &Eacute;ireann will determine the allocation of the tickets.  I know a case where there will not be enough seats on the bus to meet demand so Bus &Eacute;ireann will decide the allocation.  How does it decide that?  I have families who do not know if the children will be on the bus this year.  It is a concern.  As previous speakers indicated, it is about late consultation with the families that is causing massive concerns.</p> <p>  These issues must be addressed.  As the previous speaker noted, 116,000 children are being brought to school, which is marvellous.  My biggest gripe is with catchment areas.  There is no common sense applied when a person approaches the Department and it just will not budge.  One might as well be speaking to oneself as it just will not work.  Unless there is a will to change the system, policies and the catchment areas, the good work will be defeated.  For the sake of children and families worried about what will happen in September, we must get more information and clarification.  There should be a bit of common sense with families who know areas and circumstances.</p> <p>  Religion is another issue that is not being addressed and the Department will definitely have to look at it.  I thank the witnesses.  I came here because I have concerns.  Carlow, Borris and Myshall are my areas and as I am a new Senator, I am learning.  I was not happy last year with the feedback I got on the appeal system.  It was not fit for purpose.</p></speech>

I will certainly not delay proceedings.  When one is last to speak at a committee, the one advantage is that most speakers have said everything else.  I concur with Deputy Scanlon.  Before we get into changing policies, negatives and problems, it is always good to acknowledge the positives.  I definitely want to acknowledge the success of the school transport scheme where it is working.  It is frustrating for the public, representatives and everyone in that we can see where it works exceptionally well in most areas.  We want to acknowledge that and the benefits brought for so many students and families in so many locations.  When it works and runs smoothly, it is seamless.  It is important to acknowledge that.  The service provider - Bus &Eacute;ireann is represented here today - does a very positive job.  I get feedback from constituents describing the good work being done and how co-operative it is in assisting people while working within very tight guidelines and the restrictive policy that exists.  The provider does its best and gives a good service, and it is important we acknowledge that before we start.</p> <p>  I will focus on the policy area as it pertains to three topics.  Colleagues have spoken about bus tickets and some tickets are automatically awarded to students based on particular conditions and eligibility for medical cards.  That is fine.  My information is that people applying for discretionary bus tickets or some people who pay for a ticket are not being awarded a ticket because the bus is operating at full capacity.  In a number of audits done by me and constituents, it seems some people awarded a free ticket are not using the seat and it is not being taken up.  I can notify the witnesses of the exact circumstances outside the committee.  There are bus routes where seats are vacant.  On that basis, is it possible that a review could be carried out to ensure the people who are automatically getting tickets are using them?  If they are not, could the seat revert to somebody who badly needs it and who has endured much difficulty because of not being able to access it in order to get to school?  In some cases that I can speak about later, students have had to change school and it may have been very difficult for parents to leave children to school.  A seat on a bus would make a massive difference in such cases.  It is a problem.</p> <p>  There is also a problem where students got transport to school last year but they will not get it this year, as colleagues have mentioned.  It can be very disruptive.  Brothers or sisters may be on the bus but these students cannot travel on them.  The logistics are a massive problem for families.  If 80 students need a bus to get to school, can the capacity not be organised to meet demand?  Why is there a lottery, with parents or children fighting for places on buses when we know the numbers who need transport?  Why is transport not being provided in an adequate way?  It amazes me because we always seem to put the service in place or put it to tender on the basis that the demand is not met and capacity is less than the demand.  It is a problem.</p> <p>  There is also the question of choosing a school closest to the home.  That does not always work.  The Johnstownbridge and Broadford areas of Kildare spoken about are on the border with Meath.</p><p>My colleague has spoken about that general area.  It is bordering Meath.  When students complete primary school and want to go on to post-primary education, first and foremost, they like to follow their peers and stay with their friends.  Most importantly of all, they want to stay within their county so they can play sports and represent their county.  That might not mean a lot to all students but it means a lot to most students.  In the case of Johnstownbridge, which has been alluded to by my colleague, approximately 40 students are being driven by car from Johnstownbridge to Enfield to get the bus to Kilcock.  That distance is 3 km.  I have met with the Department and we have had meetings on the ground.  We have highlighted the issues surrounding where the students are picked up and dropped off and the Department is saying they are outside the line and that it cannot do it.  The irony is that if those 40 children came from the post-primary school in Kilcock and went to the one in their catchment area, as identified by the Department, there is no capacity for those 40 students in that school and a bus would be needed to bring those students to that school anyhow because the current bus would not have the capacity to do so.  We need a bit of lateral thinking to accommodate people because if those students move to the school identified by the Department, a bus will need to be provided for the students.  Why is flexibility not built in to bring them the 3 km to where they get the bus to go to their school of choice given all the reasons we have outlined?<br/><br/>If the Department is drawing up boundaries and trying to bring it into a system, I can see how these problems can occur but surely when these problems are brought to the Department's attention and discussed on the ground for the reasons my colleagues and I, and many more people, have raised with the Department, some flexibility should be built into the policy and guidelines to deal with those situations so they do not exist because, believe it or not, they cause a lot of hardship, pain, hassle, unnecessary worry and stress for families and students.  I know of one family where a student is entering the leaving certificate year and who might not be able to get a bus to go to the school they have attended for the past six years, which is a real worry for the family.  That is a problem.  As I said at the outset, the school transport scheme works well when it works.  It is well organised in areas and Bus &Eacute;ireann and other bus providers provide an excellent service.  However, we are talking about a percentage.  It is not <i>carte blanche</i>.  Flexibility needs to be applied in these areas so that we can have a positive outcome for all concerned.  This is what needs to happen and I ask the Department to consider it in the area of policy because it matters.</p></speech>

I will make a few general comments.  Ensuring there is an efficient service that is good value for the taxpayer and that provides safe transport for those who need it is a huge quality-of-life issue for the children, their families and their communities.  There are low-income families who receive back to school allowances but because they may live a bit nearer the school than 3.2 km for primary schools or 4.8 km for secondary schools, they may have to pay up to &euro;650, which is a very large amount of money for those who cannot afford it.</p> <p>  We have been talking about the health and safety of the students on the school bus, which is of paramount importance, but we must also think about the health and safety of those children who do not qualify for a school bus because of where they live.  There seems to have been a policy whereby school buses have been smaller to dissuade the provision of concessionary spaces to those children who need to access them because there might not be a car at home or parents might not be there because of work.  Having to wave good-bye to their child when the child must walk 3 km to school because they could not avail of a space on a bus when 3.2 km is the cut-off point is a very difficult situation for any parent.  These are areas we must look at.</p> <p>  It seems that since the Department did away with the catchment areas in 2012, this has caused some of the problems.  We have had some good recommendations relating to transport for children with special needs and it would be interesting to hear the views of the Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann on that.</p> <p>  Witnesses can see by the breadth of questions and concerns from Deputies and Senators that there is a communication problem in terms of trying to get answers.  I have certainly experienced that.  As late as last week, I was told there is one person working in that area.  One cannot even get somebody at the end of the line.  Many other services provide a dedicated Oireachtas liaison person.  This might be worthwhile so that if Members have particular issues, at least they know they can get through to somebody who could come back even with a rationale for why a decision has been made.  I acknowledge the complex job of the Department.  When one looks into the number of students and the number of miles travelled every week, one can see that it is a huge job and this must be acknowledged.  As Deputy O'Rourke said, we must commend the service for the good work that is being done.  Unfortunately, it is at times like this we hear the negativity.  Much of that is because Deputies and Senators are not getting an opportunity to voice their concerns or look for reasons specific decisions are made.</p> <p>  I will revert to the witnesses and look for responses.  If any of the members feel the need to come back in, that is fine.  We will take a second round of questions but I ask everybody to be very brief and to provide an opportunity for the witnesses to come back to me regarding some of the questions they cannot address today.  I will ensure that members get the responses.</p></speech>

There is no other real issue for me.  Deputies Moynihan and Martin spoke about nurses.  As far as we are aware, there are no nurses available for transport.  It is very rare that this happens and the Department does not supply it.  As I said at the last meeting of this committee I attended, we are lucky to get nurses in schools.  A nurse is not supplied unless the HSE supplies one to the family and the family then uses that time for the bus.  We have had many queries about the issues of nurses.  As I already said, we had a pilot training programme in Galway.  We picked Galway because there was a plethora of schools.  A Gaeltacht school, the only special school as Gaeilge in the country, a primary school and post-primary school were also involved.  That was 2013, so it is a good while ago.  Money was an issue for the Department and for everyone.  I can send the evaluation to anyone who wants it.  It involves the role of the bus escort, policy and legislation and understanding students with special educational needs, so it is more than autism, medical issues, critical incidents, report writing and record keeping, manual handling and positive behaviour strategies.  That is the outline of the programme.  The only way that would be paid for would be out of the extra amount that the schools get for administration of the scheme or in capitation.</p><p>The information is available.  If anyone wants it I can send it on. </p><p> Today, everyone has alluded to the length of the bus route from the point of view of children without special educational needs.  I know that Deputy Rabbitte is from Galway.  If children with special educational needs had to travel from either end of Galway to Galway city to attend a special school the journey would take two hours each way, which is not on.  I was involved in the rural transport programme in Laois a long time ago.  An American transport consultant who happened to live in the area recommended a travel journey of an hour maximum each way because people have different needs, particularly people with disabilities and the elderly.  One could push the journey time to a little more than an hour but it would result in behavioural difficulties.</p></speech>

Apologies if we do not cover them all but we will endeavour to do so.<br/><br/>My next comment is not a hospital pass in certain respects.  We apply the policy dictated by the Department.  Many of the issues that have been raised here are policy-related.  We engage with and are involved with the Department on a daily basis to provide practical solutions for any policy issues that arise.  I am conscious that the next two months in particular are when stress and anxiety levels are at their highest for all of the stakeholders involved.  I mean the parents, kids, the Department and, indeed, ourselves or our colleagues.<br/><br/>There are certain things, outside of the policy area, that we have put in place for this year and it is very much around communication.  Many of the issues that have been raised here are around communications or the lack thereof or its timeliness.  We have taken on board a lot of those concerns.  I will not say they are going to be perfect.  We have tried to put in place an escalation process.  All of the representatives here today, as individual Deputies and Senators, should have been communicated with directly about an escalation process that we have put in place this year.  Contact numbers have been communicated to each of their constituency offices to provide assistance if a Deputy or Senator requires information but cannot get a response.  The members have also received the mobile phone numbers that belong to our five regional managers in order to escalate issues if a Deputy or Senator has not received a response.  Those letters were sent a number of weeks ago.<br/><br/><b>Chairman:</b>I do not have the contact details.  Can they be resent, please?</p></speech>

Instead of having individual regions trying to deal with queries we have installed a more centralised telephony service that can then transfer calls to people who are available to answer calls.  From time to time one area might be more busy than another.  The new telephony system will allow us to utilise resources across the whole country more effectively, hopefully.  Testing of the system will be completed this week.</p> <p>  I shall highlight the practicalities of some of the issues.  All families have received an email notification to apply for tickets.  The deadline for payments is 28 July.  At this point we know that only 60% of those email communications have been opened.  It has been our experience that the deadline will have passed yet a significant proportion of the families will not have replied.  We could put in a very hard deadline of 28 July but we would have absolute mayhem after that date.  As has already started this week, the first reminder email has gone out to all of those people who have not opened their emails to please do so and to please pay if they have not done so.  A reminder email is issued each week between now and the end of the month.  Beyond that date we allow a grace period.</p> <p>  That is when we get into a very tight timeline of issuing tickets and trying to ensure that we have availability on buses.  As the operator of the scheme, we focus on the people who are eligible first and foremost.  We do not specifically focus on the concessionary tickets.  We ensure that all eligible pupils have a bus seat or access to transport to reach school, assuming they are eligible.  Many of the challenges emanate from constituents because the eligible number will increase or decrease each year which, in turn, influences the number of concessionary places that are available.  I shall explain the issues that this situation causes.  One might have a space one year but not the next year.  Our policy is to very much focus on the availability of places for eligible people rather than availability for the total number of people who have expressed an interest in a bus service. </p> <p>  Many points have been raised about local matters.  We will contact the members directly about them.  We will liaise with the clerk of the committee to ensure that we cover all of the issues.  </p> <p>  A question was asked about eco vehicles by the lady who is no longer here.  We acquired new buses two years ago and all of them comply with the highest eco standards applied by the European Commission.  The last number of tranches of new vehicles all comply with those standards.  However, there is not an overall policy in place that requires vehicles being used to provide a service, be it directly by ourselves or subcontract, to meet the most recent standards.  I can say, on behalf of Bus &Eacute;ireann, that buses that have been acquired by ourselves to provide a direct service meet those standards.  </p></speech>

I apologise if I have missed some issues but I was writing them down and trying to keep up as best as I could.  My shorthand is possibly not the best.  I shall do my best to answer the queries.</p> <p>  In terms of SEN services, there was an issue about contract change.  Ms Corr raised the issue of contract changes and short notice.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-11a.235" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Breda Corr" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017071100002#P00800"><p>Yes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-11a.236" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry Gannon" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017071100002#P00900"><p>Bus &Eacute;ireann is very mindful that change, particularly change for special educational needs children, can be very distressing for the children and their families.  We endeavour to keep things as stable as possible and keep changes to an absolute minimum.  Nonetheless, there are operational reasons that changes might have to be made at short notice.  Safety is one of the issues.  Let us remember that all SEN services are provided by contractors.  If a contractor's vehicle is not roadworthy, if it does not have a PSV certificate or the insurance was not renewed then it would be a breach of contract situation.  As a result we would have to take immediate action and there would not be time to notify people in advance.</p> <p>  Generally speaking, 20% is the average amount of existing services that are retendered every year.  The contractors are made aware that their services are open for tender.  Our local offices make contact when they become aware of the identify of the new operators.  The procurement campaign, which my colleague here is intimately acquainted with, is a very detailed process that begins in January each year and ends with the contracts being awarded towards the end of July.  That is how long it takes to get through all of the various stages.  Therefore, it is not possible for us to contact special schools when the contracts are awarded.  We could contact them but most schools are on holidays when the contracts are awarded.</p><p>There can be issues arising from the time that the contracts are awarded, which is unavoidable because of the structure of the procurement process and the amount of time that people have to be allowed to respond.  I will not go into the details but I can if the committee requires it.  There are valid reasons we cannot give the notification that we would otherwise like to give.  </p><p> On the issue of contact with the office, the point was raised that there was nobody to contact.  There is a Bus &Eacute;ireann mobile school transport inspector in each area.  The local offices can contact that inspector if there are contact difficulties.  The school authorities in each area should have his phone number.</p><p> In terms of suitable replacement buses, contractors are contractually obligated to have spare vehicles of the type that they are providing first-line.  They should have suitable replacement buses themselves.  </p><p> The issue of the lengths of journeys is valid.  I have looked at studies down through the years.  I saw a 1998 review of the school transport committee.  It looked at this area and concluded that because special needs centres were more diverse in comparison to primary and post-primary schools that there would naturally be a greater travel time involved in bringing children who are more diversely located at home to these schools.  The solution reached at that time did not necessarily involve more transport provision but possibly more facilities.  I mention that as an observation.  I do not believe that the Department has been found wanting in terms of investment in school transport provision.  </p><p> On the issue of bullying in primary school we have extensive child protection procedures in place in Bus &Eacute;ireann now.  If there are complaints about bullying on school buses we have the wherewithal to take action. </p><p> In terms of daily travel time it was mentioned that pupils are in some cases spending up to three hours on post-primary services.  There is a daily travel and waiting time criteria under the school transport scheme.  At primary level the guideline is one and a half hours, and at post-primary it is two and a half hours.  We endeavour to keep our services within that criteria. </p><p> Deputy Martin mentioned the issue of training for escorts and drivers operating special educational needs services.  Bus &Eacute;ireann would defer to the specialists in the area, in this case the school authorities who are best acquainted with the children and their individual needs and the methods of calming these children when they are in distress.  They are certainly the best qualified people to provide training.  There was disciplinary awareness training given for contractor drivers as well as Bus &Eacute;ireann driver in 2007 when funding was available.  If funding was available again we could certainly look at that.</p><p> Senator Byrne raised questions about 12 children who were two and a half miles off a route.  I would be interested to know more about this, and I will write to the Senator after this meeting.  I would like to know if the children are eligible or concessionary, because there is a difference under the rules of the school transport scheme.  Again, the reasonable distance service criteria kicks in.  For eligible children it is up to 3.2 km from a service.  That is considered to be a reasonable distance to service, and is something that we take into account when we are planning our routes.  </p><p> The issue that the Senator raised concerning Mungret is something that I am not aware of, but I will investigate and revert.  </p><p> Deputy Nolan spoke about concessionaries, and if it is likely that many concessionary children would lose seats.  The answer is that we simply do not know at the moment, because the closing date for the payments is, as Mr. Hernan has mentioned, 28 July.  We do not know how many eligibles are actually going to come forward on a route by route basis until the payments are received.  One of the complicating factors is that there is an Irish tradition - which we are encouraging people to break - of late payments.  Irrespective of the closing date for payments we continue to receive payments up to and into the start of the new school year.  On a route by route basis that can complicate matters.  We endeavour to accommodate as many eligible children as possible, and in so doing we have seats available for concessionary children.  There is a possibility that we might have to reorganise a service to accommodate the eligible children offering at a late stage.  Some concessionary transport may also become available as a result, so we withhold moneys until we know that we do not have the seats.  It is only when we are absolutely sure that we have tried everything to accommodate people that we refund the moneys.  That is why there can be a delay with the refunds.  I know that it can be frustrating, but I believe that it is preferable to refunding all of the monies on 29 July.  It is better to try to accommodate as many people as we possibly can.</p><p> Senator Gallagher asked how often the route is reviewed.  The answer to that is that routes are reviewed on an ongoing basis.  If there is a particular problem with a route, for example if the route is still operating along a road where nobody is living any more, that should certainly have been brought to the attention of the local school transport office.  If there is no one on the route we can certainly review that.  </p><p> The question of whether buses are adequately adapted was also raised by Senator Gallagher.  He mentioned that that was through the coach, tourism and transport council, CTTC, submission.  The answer to that question is yes.  When we are procuring the buses or taxis we ensure that we get a suitable vehicle for the needs of the children for that service.  The answer to that is yes, they are adequately adapted, whether with ramps, wheelchair lift access or a taxi in the case of a preschool autistic child.  Whatever the case may be they are adequately adapted.   </p><p> I apologise for the length of this response but there were many questions.</p><p> Deputy Moynihan asked a number of questions.  He asked about the average distance, the distance being different depending on which way one travels on the road system.  That would require a change in policy.  The current policy is the shortest traversable distance.</p></speech>

For instance, the bus does not have to be able to traverse the route for the route to be the shortest traversable distance.  If it is traversable on foot it is suitable for measuring purposes.  That is the current policy.</p> <p>  I have answered the question on escorts, and I believe Mr. Hernan has answered Senator Lawless's question about getting information and updates.</p> <p>  There were local issues concerning services from Johnstownbridge to Edenderry and in Sallins.  I will inquire with the local office and report back to the House.  I undertake to do that.  A local issue was also raised by Deputy Scanlon about Blacklion and a school in the area, Col&aacute;iste Muire in Ballymote.  Again I would have to refer to the local office.  We have more than 6,500 routes.  I am acquainted with some of them but obviously not all.</p> <p>  Senator Murnane O'Connor asked questions about how concessionary tickets are issued.  Broadly speaking concessionary tickets are issued after the eligibles have been accommodated.  In order to try to reduce levels of anxiety this year we have already started to issue eligible and concessionary tickets, beginning yesterday.  We will be issuing more than 5,000 tickets which we have ordered from the printers this week.  Some concessionary families will know earlier this year than last year that they will have transport.  We only started issuing tickets in August last year.  That applies where we know that there is not a loading issue, and where people have paid on time, and indeed paid well ahead of the closing date on 28 July.</p><p>I will answer the question about how concessionary tickets are issued in a little more depth.  The concessionary tickets are issued after the eligible children have been accommodated.  If the route is over-subscribed there is a random selection process applied.  The order of priority is that existing concessionary children and their siblings who have paid by the closing date of 28 July are given first priority.  The second priority is all new applicants who applied and paid on time.  The third priority is other families that do not fall into either of those categories, in other words who did not pay on time or apply on time.  They would be the third priority if a service is over-subscribed.  There has been a huge increase in the number of concessionaries as we all know. </p><p> Deputy O'Rourke mentioned people not taking up seats and holding onto a ticket.  It is an old chestnut.  It was a perennial issue pre-2011 when tickets were free under the school transport scheme for eligible children.  It was a very frustrating issue.  The answer to it is not simple.  Families will purchase a ticket in some cases.  The Deputy mentioned free tickets so I presume he means people who have a medical card and are getting the waiver.  Some families will use the ticket when it suits.  It might suit one day a week.  It might suit every morning and not every evening.  A parent might be working and might be able to bring a child into school and the child can get the bus home.  If one was to consider this, one would have to consider where to draw the line.  Must they use the bus every day?  What happens if children get sick?  How long could they be sick for before we withdraw the ticket?  There are a lot of issues around that.  I am only making observations because they are policy issues.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has to issue only the number of tickets for seats on the bus.  We will not issue more tickets than there are seats on the bus because we cannot risk an overload situation.  We could not notionally allow 5% for absenteeism and go 5% over the threshold.  We could not do that; we could not take the risk.</p><p> The problem with families not getting tickets for all children was another issue that was raised.  Some siblings get tickets and others do not.  That can be because of the changes to the rules in the scheme.  The eligible children who retain their eligibility would likely get their tickets and other children who are concessionary would be subject to the rules governing concessionaries.  It is possible that some siblings might get a ticket and another sibling might not.  That is the application of policy under the scheme.</p><p> Can the capacity of a bus be increased to meet demand was another question the Deputy raised.  I think he was talking about Johnstown Bridge to Kilcock.  The answer to that is it can be done in line with the criteria of the school transport scheme.  If there are more eligible children we have to consider increasing the size of the vehicle serving the school.  If the children are concessionary we cannot incur additional State cost to accommodate concessionary children because they are not eligible under the scheme in the first place.  It is set out under the rules of the school transport scheme.  We have to apply the policy as it is laid down.  </p><p> The Chairman raised the issue about the dedicated Oireachtas liaison person.  Mr. Ray Hernan answered that question.  </p><p> That is all I have.  I hope I have not missed people.</p></speech>

The first stage is the pre-qualification stage at which we take into account the experience the drivers have in the provision of transport services.  When it comes to the invitation to tender stage, we ask for more comprehensive detail about special needs.

Ms Breda Corr has mentioned some of the training issues.  I will give an explanation of some of the policy issues.  As has been said before, school transport is a national scheme.  It brings 116,000 kids to school and home every day.  It is one of the largest transport networks in the country and it costs &euro;182 million each year.  I apologise if I miss anything.  The current policy was introduced in 2012 and it does not take into account the parish or county boundaries.  We recognise it is difficult to have a scheme that fits all specific locations in a national scheme on set criteria and it is challenging to have it fit every local area.  The current school transport policy is based on a distance criterion of the closest school; it is 3.2 km at primary and 4.8 km at post-primary.  Parents choose whichever school they want for their children but if there is a requirement for school transport there are criteria to be met.  These criteria are set down in the schemes.<br/><br/>One of the issues mentioned was the flexibility on the number of ten eligible students.  Last summer one of the results of the Oireachtas cross-party group's review of concessionary transport was the Minister of State's announcement of some flexibility on the figure of ten if a school can show it will build back up to it in subsequent years.  <br/><br/>The shortest traversable route has been mentioned.  It should be noted that under the school transport policy, the shortest traversable route is used to establish eligibility.  As Mr. Gerry Gannon and Mr. Ray Hernan have pointed out, it does not necessarily equate to the route the bus will take.  <br/><br/>The training issue has been mentioned.  I am not sure who mentioned the issue of over-subscribed schools. <font color="#FF00FF"> </font>Currently the section 29 appeal is considered the benchmarking of a full school but there is other information available and we can certainly look at that issue.  <br/><br/>Concessionary transport is not guaranteed under current policy from year to year.  In recent years there has not been a downsizing of buses which is part of the reason why numbers on concessionary transport have grown.  Under current school transport policy, bus size will not be increased to cater for concessionary pupils.  <br/><br/>On the ethos issue, there is a slight difference between policy at primary and post-primary.  For instance, at primary, we have children bypassing a local Catholic school to go to a multi-denominational school.  At post-primary the ethos issue occurs in the context of minority religions.  It largely involves eligibility for Church of Ireland schools on the post-primary scheme.  The appeals system was mentioned by a number of people.  The current appeals system is a process appeal but under the programme for Government there was a commitment to review the appeals system and that review is due to be published shortly.  <br/><br/>The communications issue was widely mentioned but it has been dealt with very well by my Bus &Eacute;ireann colleagues.  Unless there are further questions, I think it has been dealt with.  <br/><br/>They were the notes I have on the policy issues.  I apologise if I have missed anything.  </p></speech>

While I do not want to labour the point, we all raised the communications issue, which it is fair to say has improved, but it is still not where we would like it to be.  It is better than last year, but that is not saying much.</p> <p>  I wish to finish on a positive note.  I did not want to bring it up initially because I wanted to focus on the issues with the service, which are extremely important to our constituents.  I attended the Young Scientist exhibition in the RDS earlier this year.  In one of the projects, students from Maynooth community college in my constituency had researched school transport.  I asked them to send me on the numbers and they stack up.  The school transport scheme is normally viewed as an exceptional scheme to get students from rural out-of-the-way places to school as they may find it difficult otherwise.</p> <p>  They turned that on its head and asked if the school transport scheme could become the default for transport to school.  Would students living two streets away from school still get the bus as much as they would if they lived two or five miles outside the town?  They surveyed a number of obvious benefits to congestion and climate change that accrue from having fewer vehicles on the road.  The same argument for adults to use public transport to get to work rather than individuals driving their cars can be made for schoolchildren.  This is not just in the far-flung places but also in the towns.</p> <p>  It was an interesting observation and an interesting project.  The statistics those second level students produced were very impressive and stood up to scrutiny.  I do not expect the witnesses to come back with a comprehensive reply on that today.  However, it should be put on the agenda in order that it could be considered as policy at some stage.</p></speech>

I did not get an answer to one of my earlier questions.  I seek a "Yes" or "No" answer from the witnesses from Bus &Eacute;ireann and the Department.  Have they all read what the report of the Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon, states about bus transport?  Does the Bus &Eacute;ireann carry out a risk assessment for those children who have to walk along dangerous roads to access a bus stop in rural areas?</p> <p>  A departmental official said that the Minister looked at the tolerance level and it is in place, in effect.  That is very grey for me.  I do not know how it is in place and how long it has been there.  How is it being enacted and judged?  Is it only for access to Government Deputies or Ministers or is it available throughout the country?  I do not understand the tolerance.  I was talking about having a tolerance of seven to ten or eight to ten children in order that there would be flexibility where numbers would drop back, for example, to eight, but greater numbers would be coming through in future.  I need to know that because it would be a clear message for schools in rural areas.</p> <p>  Mr. Gannon said that someone did not need to be able to drive it to be able to access it or to be able to measure it.  I think that is absolutely shameful.</p></speech>

In one particular case a school is oversubscribed and has no capacity for students to attend.  The reason cited not to provide public transport to bring them to an alternative school is that there will be capacity in that school in the future.  I know Ms McElduff is shaking her head and saying it is not right.  However, the parents got it in writing from the Department to say that there are plans to extend the school in 18 months or two years and in the interim it would not consider providing transport to the alternative school.</p> <p>  It all hinges on the area we discussed earlier, which affects Johnstownbridge and Broadford.  The crux of the problem is the lack of flexibility in the Department.  I note the officials have said there will be no change on the discretionary side etc.  The reality is that there is a cohort of students who come under three different headings.  They need to get to school, whether it is primary or post-primary.  That issue needs to be looked at because a student living in the next estate or a mile down the road from student who has the ticket still has to get to school and may have no way of getting there.  Walking there can be an issue because, as Deputy Rabbitte has pointed out, in most cases there is no infrastructure.  There is no other public transport.  Most households no longer have two cars because circumstances have changed in recent years, as we know.  That is the reality and that is why I am appealing to the Department to discuss the practicality of how this affects families, communities and schools.</p> <p>  It is ironic that post-primary schools are approaching parents with children in primary schools that would be identified by the Department as being in a different catchment area, promoting their school and advocating for students to come there.  Parents and students are saying, "Yes.  I like that.  I think I'll do that."  Then they do it and find they have no way of getting there because they are outside the boundary or because of a guideline.  We need to focus on that area because it is a problem.  Irrespective of how much we refer back to guidelines and legislation, that is a practical problem on the ground and it is not appropriate for Ms McElduff to say it does not exist.  It does exist because parents have told me it is a problem.</p></speech>

Deputy Alan Kelly and the Labour Party brought forward a Bill to regulate rogue agencies.  On the back of that, the Department of Health said that a public consultation would begin and all sorts of hoopla would happen.  The information at the time, and in light of the excellent work done by Ellen Coyne and other journalists, all underlined a need for us to take swift and immediate action in this regard.  The purpose of my amendment is to ensure that action is taken as part of this legislation.  Perhaps the Minister can give us some comfort and assure us that we do not need to worry.  Unless that is received I will press my amendment.</p></speech>

I, too, acknowledge Deputy Kelly and his party leader's work in this area.  This is something that all parties, groupings and Independents want to see addressed.  We have all been sickened and appalled by this, not even false information, but misleading nonsense and offensive - and we are not allowed use the "L" word - but all of that stuff has been told to women, and people in vulnerable situations as well.  I am determined to address the matter by regulation.  Let me first explain why I am not in a position to accept this amendment and then I shall outline what we will do.</p> <p>  The amendment proposes a new section 2 to amend the Act to designate the professions of counsellor and psychotherapist by primary legislation.  It also proposes to define the scopes of practice of these professions and to include crisis pregnancy counselling in said scopes.</p> <p>  The Act provides that the Minister for Health may, following a consultation process and with the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas, make regulations designating a health or social care profession not already regulated under other legislation if the Minister considers it to be in the public interest to do so and if certain specified criteria have been met.  I absolutely do consider it to be of public interest.</p> <p>  In the case of counsellors and psychotherapists we are already far advanced with this process.  I am not exactly sure what the Deputy meant by hoopla.  We have already reached public consultation and, indeed, concluded the process.  My Department is preparing regulations that I intend to bring to the Oireachtas in the autumn, for the approval of the Oireachtas.  </p> <p>  The 2005 Act does not define scope of practice but we discuss it in general.  Instead, regulation is primarily by way of registration and the protection of professional titles.  It is an offence for non-registrants to use a protected title.  Recognising that scopes of practice evolve over time, and in order to ensure public protection, each profession's code of professional conduct and ethics obliges registrants to act within the limits of their knowledge, skill, competence and experience.  Any breach of that code can be defined as professional misconduct and is liable to investigation and sanctions, up to and including the cancellation of registration under the fitness to practise provisions.  </p> <p>  In terms of the issues of crisis pregnancy counsellors or agencies, and allegations that some of them have provided misleading information, my Department, in addition to the regulation process, is reviewing the regulation of Information (Services Outside of the State For Termination of Pregnancies) Act 1995 to establish if its provisions need to be strengthened.  One possibility would be to amend the 1995 Information Act, when counsellors are regulated under the 2005 Act, to prevent professionals who are not regulated by the State from providing crisis pregnancy counselling services.</p> <p>  I shall outline the two parts.  The first is to lay the regulations both Houses of the Oireachtas for their approval, to regulate counsellors and psychotherapists in the autumn.  Second, we shall see if we can amend the information Act to see if it needs to be further strengthened.  There are a number of other things going on in that area at present.</p> <p>  I assure the Deputy that we are genuinely taking action.  I know when this committee considered Deputy Howlin's Bill, it was its view as it is Deputy Howlin's, that regulation is the way to go.  We are proceeding with haste.  I will lay the regulations before the House in the autumn.    </p></speech>

I say that in an effort to be constructive and helpful.  This is extraordinarily important legislation that is grounded in protecting the public, in public safety and in empowering members of the public as they go about their business obtaining services from professionals in this State. </p> <p>  I have every confidence in CORU, as the State regulator, and in the Physiotherapists Registration Board in discharging its duties as the regulator.  I want us to get this legislation right.  We have discussed the issues in recent days and weeks and I  think it boils down to a small number of issues.  I accept that there are legitimate concerns.  The Houses of the Oireachtas is due to go into recess at the end of this week.  I suggest that we use the period between now and resuming in September, and before Report Stage of this legislation, to see if we can iron out any issues.  There are particular issues about the scope of practice.  I mean the fact that we do not define scope of practice in primary legislation.  Let us consider whether we can provide further clarity on the matter.  There is also the issue of the assessment of professional competence test, what is involved, what is the criteria, where is it set at and can we provide further clarification.  All of that is subject to the legal advices that are available to me and through the office of the parliamentary draftspeople.  I just wanted to say that at the outset because I think it will come up as I address each amendment.</p> <p>  Deputies Kelly and Howlin tabled amendment No. 2 and Deputies Brassil, Kelleher and Louise O'Reilly tabled amendment No. 3.  I hope that the Deputies will accept my good faith that my Department will engage further.  I am not in a position to accept these amendments because they would have some unintended consequences.  As I understand it, these amendments seek to ensure that the application period for recent Institute of Physical Therapy, IPTAS, graduates is time limited and a date of 30 September 2018 is proposed in one of the amendments.  However, section 6(b) of the Bill already provides a stop date of 31 December 2019 for IPTAS graduates.  This is to allow current students on the final IPTAS physical therapy programme to graduate by the end of 2019.  More importantly, these amendments would result in the unintended consequence of sunsetting the provisions of section 5 in so far as they relate to applicants for registration who have never practised their professions.  Perhaps we can further engage on this issue between now and Report Stage.</p><p>I thank the Minister for his clarification and also for his openness in regard to the issues.  I agree with him that we need a period of time to address these issues and we need to use the summer wisely.  I hope the Department of Health and in particular the officials who are accompanying him today will use the summer wisely in trying to deal with these intricate issues.  They affect people's professions and we need to be very careful that there are no unintended consequences across the board.  We have been down the road on issues similar to this before and there were problems.</p><p> On that basis, I will not be pressing the amendment.  I do not fully agree with the Minister's response in respect of this specific issue but having said that, I accept his bona fides.  It is unfortunate that these issues were not teased out to the level they should have been, which probably goes back to the Minister's predecessor, may I say.</p></speech>

The policy remains the same.  One has to take a policy and translate it into legislation.  One takes legal advice to flesh out a policy.  I am happy to tease out the details.</p> <p>  Deputy Kelly is correct to raise the important issue of people's livelihood.  As we are making decisions in the Oireachtas that must protect public safety, which is what CORU, the State regulator is about, we do need to be conscious of the fact that there are people whose livelihood depends on us getting the legislation right.  The whole purpose of the Bill and the regulations across the range of professions is to make sure that people are practising to the level of their qualification and experience and no further.  That is where we need to end up.</p></speech>

I would like that repeated for the benefit of the organisations in the Visitors Gallery to put their mind at ease on that issue.</p> <p>  Other amendments have been tabled and I presume we will get an opportunity to speak on them individually.</p></speech>

I suggest we could further discuss these matters between now and Report Stage.  The purpose of these amendments, and the reason I am not in a position to support them today, is to bring forward the end of the application period for recent IPTAS graduates from December 2019 to September 2018 in the case of recent such graduates and to September 2019 in the case of current students who will graduate in 2019 from the final IPTAS programme.  The amendments presumably intend that those who have graduated since 2013 will have a one-year application period which will commence in September of this year.  As it is likely the Bill will not be enacted until autumn at the earliest, that September 2018 deadline is now out of synch with the intention of the Bill.  The Bill sets the application period for recent IPTAS graduates, in other words those who have graduated since 2013, and for current students graduating in 2019 at 31 December 2019.  This will require current students to qualify and apply in the same year and it is a reasonable end date in the circumstances.  I also think that introducing different application periods for different post-2013 graduates could complicate matters further.  The Bill already provides for a separate one-year application period for graduates who qualified before 2013 and who demonstrate practice under the title of physical therapist for a period of two years in the previous five years.  On the competence test the Deputy raised and which I referred to in my opening remarks, it is something I hear as a legitimate issue that people want to see further teased out and I am happy to do so in the process of our engagement before Report Stage.</p></speech>

I would like to quote from a letter sent by the previous Minister for Health to the ISCP:</p><blockquote>To ensure public protection, the board's code of professional conduct and ethics will oblige those registered under these provisions to act within the limits of their knowledge, skill, competence and experience.  In other words, the new registrants will be required to confine their practice to musculoskeletal therapy.</blockquote> <p>That was the commitment given and the ISCP is looking for that to be included in the legislation.  We have had meetings and it has been explained that &quot;scope of practice&quot; is never defined in primary legislation.  However, it is important that people who seek any form of therapy are clear in their minds as to the exact level of competence of the person treating them.  When professionals have a plate on their walls advertising a service, it is important that the public know exactly what that person can and cannot achieve for them.  From that point of view, the legislation is not clear enough.  The ISCP and IAPT need reassurance that this legislation will clearly define what &quot;scope of practice&quot; they can operate under and clarification about who will carry out a competency level assessment, who will have an input into it., and that the people who ultimately register are able to provide a safe service to the public.  The reason for the amendment is a clear commitment was given in this regard but the legislation is not clear that what was promised has been followed through and there is a need to do substantial work to resolve this issue and to satisfy both parties with an interest in the legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-11a.335" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2017071100002#G00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for his informed contribution on this.  I do not mind robust opinion and I do not in any way refer to the Deputy in this regard but I do not intend to allow myself to be in any way misrepresented.  The policy as set out by then Minister, Deputy Varadkar, is the policy I am putting into law, which is that people will only be able to practise up to the level of their qualification and if they lack a qualification beyond musculoskeletal therapy, they will not be entitled to practise.  If they practise beyond that, the sanctions that will apply will be the same that apply to all other professions that have been dealt with through our State regulatory body, CORU, up to and including being struck off the register and losing their ability to have a livelihood.  The sanctions, therefore, are serious.</p> <p>  However, the Deputy made a fair point about the need to provide further clarity and I am happy to undertake to do that for both the ISCP and IAPT.  I am satisfied there should be further engagement between my Department and both bodies regarding the threshold at which the competency level is set.  That issue has been raised by everybody over the past number of weeks and it should be re-examined.  As the Deputy correctly said, this is about public safety.  Both bodies and every Oireachtas Member supports that.</p> <p>  As I have said and the Deputy has acknowledged, we do not include "scope of practice " in primary legislation for good reason.  Professions evolve and if we have a scenario whereby we have to return to primary legislation, all of us knowing how arduous and time consuming that can be, that would not be in the interests of the public.  While recognising that scopes of practice evolve as well as the need to provide public protection, each profession's code of professional conduct and ethics obliges registrants to act within the limits of their knowledge, skill, competence and experience and any breach of the code is defined in the principal Act as professional misconduct and is liable to investigation and to sanctions up to and including cancellation of registration under the Act's fitness to practise provision.</p><p>The primary legislation envisages what to do if someone exceeds his or her scope of practice but scope of practice is defined in the profession's code of professional conduct and also ethics.  The Physiotherapist Registration Board has such a code and it will apply to those registered under those temporary provisions as well as to other registrants.  I want to be very clear that such practitioners or, indeed, any physiotherapist without the up-to-date skills in cardio or respiratory and neurological therapists will be obliged to confine their practice to musculoskeletal therapy or face investigation and sanctions.  That is included in both the combination of the legislation and the code of conduct.  I want to be constructive and ensure that any misgivings, concerns, or lack of clarity is ironed out between now and Report Stage.  If members of this committee are minded, and subject to our legal advice and our drafting, we could look at amendments on Report Stage.  I would be happy to come forward with an amendment to provide that a code of professional conduct and ethics adopted by a registration board shall require registrants to act with in the limits of their knowledge, skill, competence and experience.  This would copperfasten that code in primary legislation and legally require all registration boards to include this provision in their codes, while stopping short of defining the detail.  If one accepts that I cannot define the scope of practice in primary legislation, as I think we do, and if I can underpin the code of professional conduct and ethics adopted by the registration board and the requirement of all registrants to adhere to that in the primary legislation, it will go some way to providing further clarity.  I am happy to have this conversation between Committee and Report Stages.</p></speech>

Many of these issues are interrelated.  Based on what the Minister has said and the spirit in which he has said it, we may put them tabled them on Report Stage.  Based on what Deputy Brassil said, I understand that there will be a consultation process with both sides.  The draft conclusions which emerge from that will form the basis of discussion from which the amendments will be put forward.  We will either agree on those, or if not, we can put forward our own amendments.  Is that understood?</p></speech>

With the understanding, as I outlined in my answer, that CORU, a State regulator, is in place for a range of professions, and there must be consistency across the board so that any changes we would look to make in a code of professional conduct, for instance, we would apply to all of the professions.</p></speech>

I share their concern that public safety is the priority and that should be our primary aim as legislators.  We must make sure we have the highest possible standards in the professions and ensure that the regulatory process is fit for purpose.  I understand what the Minister said and look forward to the draft proposals.  I am always conscious of retrospective sanctions when it comes to somebody's health.  If somebody has an adverse reaction to an event, the person responsible for that must be dealt with through a sanctions process.  These things can be worked around through the code of practice and code of ethics and hopefully that will help us all.  Our goal here is to ensure there are no unintended consequences for the public or for people practising in the various jobs they are doing.  I concur with everyone but I wanted to put that on record.</p></speech>

To be fair to the people who are practising, regardless of which profession, we need to be in a position to give them the maximum amount of clarity.  On the basis of the suggestions made today, can we take it that these discussions will take place while we are in recess, subject to everybody's calendar commitments, and that every effort will be made to have these issues resolved before we resume in the autumn?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-11a.346" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2017071100002#J00200"><p>Yes, absolutely.  The Deputy is right and we are all <i>ad idem</i>on that.  It is not that we are in any way trying to suggest that someone's livelihood outranks public safety, it certainly does not.  Public safety is what this legislation and the CORU process are about.  Acknowledging that this is priority number one and picking up on Deputy O'Reilly's point, we must acknowledge also there are people who are validly qualified to carry out musculoskeletal therapy.  They are known as physical therapists in this country.  This is the anomaly that has arisen.  They are not validly qualified to carry out other procedures that physiotherapists carry out.  There needs to be a very clear understanding of the distinct difference in that respect.</p><p>Regarding the issue of sanction, without being in any way flippant about an important issue, it is not possible to sanction somebody unless they have done something wrong.  That is the way we regulate every profession in this country, but the risk of sanction is extraordinarily high.  The idea that somebody would purposefully risk his or her livelihood, business, profession and reputation is a pretty substantial one.  I am bringing forward a proposal today, in an effort to be helpful, to go further in this area than we have gone before in terms of the regulating of professions by looking to see if we can underpin a professional code of conduct in primary legislation.  My officials will work on drafting some proposals.  We will engage with the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists, ISCP, the Irish Association of Physical Therapists, IAPT, and with members of this committee before Report Stage. </p></speech>

The first relates to people who have qualified but not practiced.  A very stringent registration process and competency assessment must be done with respect to those individuals who, although they have been qualified for a number of years, have not practised and who are seeking to register now under this legislation.  That must be tied down and kept very tight.  The second issue relates to people, outside of the IAPT qualification and ISPC qualification process, who are practising and will seek to seek to register under this legislation.  There can be no issue around people's livelihoods, this is a matter of public safety.  For those people, the competency assessment must be to the highest standard and to the satisfaction of both organisations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-11a.349" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2017071100002#J00500"><p>I fully agree with the Deputy on that.  For the record, the issue of those who are qualified but have not practised is a standard provision across all the professions regulated by CORU.  Since there has been considerable focus understandably on the issue of physiotherapists, the view could be that it is particular to that profession.  It is not; it is the same provision that applies to speech and language therapists and all other professions where somebody has qualified but not practised.  The Deputy is entirely correct in that it needs to be extraordinarily stringent, and it will be.</p> <p>  On his second point, again, the Deputy was correct.  The level at which the threshold is set for the competency test is a concern shared by both organisations, myself and members of all political parties and groupings here.  I would make the point that there are people practising today in this country without having had to go through such a test.  This legislation will mean that will no longer be the case.  I am happy to talk to the Deputy about the threshold for that competency test.</p></speech>
