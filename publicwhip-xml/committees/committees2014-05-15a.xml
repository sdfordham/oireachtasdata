Are they agreed to?  Agreed.</p><p>  No. 3A is correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers.  No. 3A.1 is correspondence, dated 7 May 2014, from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, as a follow-on from our meeting of 3 April.  The correspondence is to be noted and published.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-15a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1008" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014051500003#B00300"><p>The response is welcome.  However, members should note that No. 2 in the response refers to the amount of debt to be transferred to Irish Water to meet wastewater service commitments when responsibility is transferred from the local authorities.  This is a reference to PPP projects.  Members will recall that we raised these matters with the Department some months ago and it became clear that these were very expensive projects.  There was a bias within the system towards PPPs rather than the traditional delivery model.  More to the point, as far as I can ascertain, there has been no scrutiny or analysis of the projects to ascertain if there was value for money.  This is a serious concern.  I note that the response we have received states the amount of debt that will be transferred from the local authorities to Irish Water is a complex matter and that a reply to our question is being prepared.  I would have thought it would be able to give us a direct response on the liabilities in terms of wastewater service commitments at this stage of proceedings.   I am anxious to ensure we will write back and insist on receiving a full response as soon as possible.</p></speech>

We will do so following the meeting.  We may also send a copy of what the Deputy has said in that regard.</p><p>  No. 3A.2 is correspondence, dated 12 May 2014, from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, regarding the sociology department at UCC.  It concerns the outcome of an investigation of certain matters relating to that department which were first raised in anonymous correspondence to the committee.  The correspondence is to be noted and published.</p><p>  No. 3A.3 is correspondence, dated 12 May 2014, again from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, regarding the issue at GMIT.  It is an update on the examination of the allegations which has not yet been completed.  The correspondence will be forwarded to Deputy Keaveney.  When will the examination of the allegations be completed?</p></speech>

Ineffective expenditure, totalling &euro;420,500, has been incurred on premises that could not be sublet.  We can raise the matter today if any member is interested in it.  Otherwise, we will note and publish the correspondence.</p><p>  No. 3A.5 is correspondence received from various section 39 bodies regarding staff remuneration over or equal to a figure of &euro;65,000.  It arises from a review by the committee of the salaries paid in section 39 bodies that received over &euro;5 million from the HSE.  The highest salary is paid to the CEO of Enable Ireland, at &euro;145,679.  We can deal with this matter when representatives of the HSE and the Department appear before the committee on 12 June.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  The correspondence is to be noted and published.</p><p>  No. 3B is correspondence from individuals.  No. 3B.1 is correspondence from Mr. Mark Darley, former staff member of the Abbey Theatre, regarding the discontinuation of the Abbey Theatre pension scheme.  The correspondence is to be noted and a copy forwarded to the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to receive a note on the matter.  </p><p>  No. 3B.2 is correspondence, dated 6 May 2014, from Mr. Barry Peak, Chambers Ireland, regarding public procurement policy.  We are arranging a meeting to deal with public procurement issues and must invite those who were in the Visitors Gallery the last day and representatives of Chambers Ireland.  The proposal is that we invite both parties at the same time as procurement officials and representatives of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We will arrange the meeting as soon as possible.  The correspondence is to be noted. </p><p>  No. 3B.3 is correspondence, received on 7 May 2014, from Mr. Hugh Rance regarding further correspondence about County Cork VEC.  The correspondence is to be noted.  We will examine County Cork VEC when the Comptroller and Auditor General's report has been published.  I understand he is producing a special report on County Cork VEC which will be placed before us shortly.  The correspondence relating to complaints on this issue can be compiled and then considered in the context of the report.</p></speech>

The correspondence is to be noted and published.  The committee has informed Ms Kerins of the next stage in its examination of Rehab.  The request from one D&aacute;il committee to another for application of compellability is a parliamentary procedure and there is no provision whereby those who may be the subject of compellability can have an input into the process.  That is our response to the letter received.  The application has been submitted, as has the application in respect of the SIPTU fund.  We are awaiting a response from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</p></speech>

As we heard the last day, the committee is likely to seek outside legal advice on the application relevant to the examination of section 39 companies.  We must await the result of that advice and the committee's meeting before we can continue.  Unfortunately, therefore, there is no timeframe.</p></speech>

All of that has been agreed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and that committee is now ready to receive applications and deal with them.  I expect the legal advice should not take long and that we should know, perhaps, before the summer recess.</p></speech>

This is to be noted and forwarded to the HSE for investigation and a note on the matters raised.  We have already agreed that St. Michael's House will be one of the section 38 bodies that we will call in for examination.  We must set dates for all of them.

We are noting it but the group has raised serious concerns about taxpayers' money.  It is an urgent matter and we should seek a comprehensive response to it as soon as possible from the Department.</p><p>  Next is correspondence relevant to today's meeting.  We have correspondence received on 8 May 2014 from the Department of Education and Skills re briefing materials.  This is to be noted and published.  No. 3C.2 is correspondence re 13 May 2014 from the Department of Education and Skills containing opening statements.  This is to be noted and published.</p><p>  No. 4 is reports and statements received.  These include statements from F&Aacute;S, the Credit Institutions Resolution Fund and Waterways Ireland.

The appropriation account indicates gross expenditure of &euro;8.6 billion in 2012.  Salaries and pensions accounted for more than three quarters of current expenditure, with approximately 93,500 whole-time equivalent staff in the sector.  Capital services expenditure amounted to just over &euro;450 million.  </p><p>  The school transport service is also funded from Vote 26.  Payments for the service amounted to almost &euro;169 million in 2012.  This includes a sum of &euro;150 million paid to Bus &Eacute;ireann which, under a long-standing arrangement with the Department, manages the provision of most school transport, using a combination of services contracted in from private bus operators and vehicles in its own fleet.  The remaining &euro;19 million was spent on direct school transport grants and school bus escort payments.</p><p>  The national training fund was established in 2000 as a ring-fenced fund designed primarily to support the training of those in employment and those who wished to take up employment.  When the fund was established, there was a shortage of skilled labour in certain key economic sectors.  The fund is resourced mainly by a levy on employers of 0.7% of reckonable earnings of certain categories of employee.  The income of the fund from the levy in 2012 was &euro;299 million, down slightly on the figure for 2011.  The other main recurrent source of funding is European Social Fund, ESF, receipts which tend to vary significantly from year to year.  In 2011 some &euro;80 million was received, including &euro;24 million in final refunds relating to ESF programme activity from 2000 to 2006.  No ESF funding was received in 2012, but &euro;32 million was received early in 2013.  Approximately three quarters of the expenditure in 2012 was on training programmes for those seeking employment.  Most of the remaining expenditure was on providing training for and the upskilling of those already in employment. </p><p>  The main beneficiary of the national training fund in 2012 was F&Aacute;S which received a total of &euro;297 million.  In addition, the Department paid F&Aacute;S almost &euro;12 million from the Vote for its training and integration support activity.  Payments to F&Aacute;S from the Vote amounting to &euro;23 million were provided for in the Estimate in subhead G2, but when the Department identified potential budget difficulties for the Vote, it stopped the Vote payments to F&Aacute;S.  To compensate, it increased the provision from the fund by just over &euro;9 million.  Subsequently, when it became clear that there would be a substantial surplus in the Vote, the fund was reimbursed by that amount, paid also from subhead G2.  I drew attention to this in the chapter on Vote accounting because the circumstances were not consistent with the principle that Vote holders should manage expenditure within the spending limits set by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for the Vote, while meeting all legitimate liabilities that arise in the year.</p><p>  In the comprehensive review of expenditure the expenditure ceiling set for the Department for 2012 comprehended both the Voted spending allocation and the national training fund expenditure allocation.  This, in effect, makes the Vote and the fund a single account for budget management purposes.  Because the Vote and the fund are accounted for separately, significant intra-account transactions should be clearly disclosed in both accounts.  The Accounting Officer has undertaken to do this in the future. </p><p>  Better transparency of the cost of public services could also be achieved if all payments for specific services issued from a single funding source.  Rather than making parallel payments to payees from multiple sources, Exchequer support for the target activities of a departmental fund, if required, could be achieved by voting a grant payment to the relevant fund.  For example, this is what happens with the Social Insurance Fund subsidy paid from the Vote for the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>  Chapter 12 deals with the control of expenditure on the education sector public private partnership projects, PPPs, that were at an operational stage in 2012.  It considers the adequacy of controls in place in respect of the key contract elements of price indexation, service performance and benchmarking.  At the end of 2012 cumulative expenditure on the five operational PPPs in the education sector was just over &euro;300 million, with outstanding commitments estimated at over &euro;1 billion, and annual expenditure running at almost &euro;50 million.  The projects relate to three bundles of primary and post-primary schools, the National Maritime College and the Cork School of Music, both of which are colleges of the Cork Institute of Technology.  The Department of Education and Skills is the contracting authority for all of the PPP projects and costs are borne in the Vote.  Towards the end of 2012 the National Development Finance Agency took on some of the contract management functions for the school bundles previously undertaken by the Department.  The college contracts are jointly managed by the Department and the institute.  At the request of the Department, the agency carried out a review of the indexation calculations submitted by the respective PPP companies during 2012 for each of the five contracts.  Errors were noted in the invoicing for both colleges, amounting to a potential overcharging of &euro;43,000.  The chapter recommended that all future payment indexation calculations on all projects should be reviewed by the agency and that the Department should satisfy itself that calculations for prior years were correct and that no overpayments had been made. </p><p>  Schools PPP companies are required to submit monthly performance reports to the agency, outlining activities in the previous month.  These reviews are circulated to each school principal for confirmation that all service failures that may have occurred are included and that the dates regarding the handling of service requests are correct.  When service failures occur, the agency ensures the appropriate deduction, if any, is made for the next monthly unitary charge payment.  Up to the end of 2012, deductions totalling just over &euro;1 million had been made from payments to the schools PPP companies.  Our examination found several instances in 2012 where individual schools had not responded to the request from the agency for confirmation that the monthly performance monitoring report was complete and accurate.  As payments to the PPP companies were not delayed in these cases, non-response from the schools is, effectively, being treated as confirmation that the performance report is correct.  The chapter recommended that the Department remind schools of the importance of providing formal feedback on the monthly performance monitoring reports in order to ensure contracted services are being delivered and that deductions, where appropriate, are applied.</p><p>  Benchmarking and market testing are used in PPP contracts as a means of ensuring the contracting authority continues to receive value for money over the life of the contract.  I reported in chapter 3 how an exercise of this kind had been undertaken by the Courts Service in relation to the Criminal Courts of Justice PPP and that significant financial savings had been achieved as a result.  For the PPP projects in the education sector, the options of benchmarking and market testing were available in the fifth year of operation and will be available every five years thereafter, but the examination found that the Department had decided not to invoke these provisions.  We found no documentary evidence of any detailed analysis supporting the decisions to forgo the benchmarking opportunities.  The chapter recommended that in the future the Department formally consider whether savings could potentially be delivered by way of benchmarking and market testing.  Reasons for proceeding, or not proceeding, with benchmarking should also be documented.</p></speech>

I will, therefore, keep these remarks brief. </p><p>  As a result of a Government decision, this Department restructured its Vote from 1 January 2013, to reflect the new performance budgeting approach to expenditure Estimates.  Expenditure under the restructured Vote from 2013 is now categorised across four programme areas, reflecting the four high-level goals of the Department.  The new format replaces the seven main expenditure headings used in the Vote accounts up to 2012. </p><p>  As a result of these significant changes to the structure of the Vote between 2012 and 2013, it is difficult to correlate exactly subhead expenditure for the 2012 voted subheads with the new performance budgeting presentation of the Estimates.  However, the briefing material supplied to the committee seeks to match these expenditures as far as possible. </p><p>  In relation to voted expenditure the Department&rsquo;s gross outturn for 2012 was &euro;8.6 billion, of which &euro;410 million, or approximately 5%, related to capital expenditure.  The provisional outturn for 2013 was &euro;8.5 billion, of which approximately 5%, &euro;440 million, was capital expenditure.  The bulk of voted current expenditure, 79%, is on pay and pensions.  In addition, expenditure under the non-voted National Training Fund amounted to &euro;341 million in 2012, while the provisional outturn for 2013 was &euro;349 million. </p><p>  The Comptroller&rsquo;s report contains two chapters relating to public-private partnerships.  Chapter 3 examines overall financial commitments under PPPs, while chapter 12 considers specific issues relating to contract management in Department of Education and Skills PPP projects.  The Department welcomes the recommendations identified in chapter 12 of the report.  The recommendations are consistent with the policy direction being taken by the Department in relation to overall arrangements for the management of PPP contracts.  A significant recent development in this regard has been the move in the course of 2012 to vest responsibility for the management of PPP contracts with the National Development Finance Agency.  This takes advantage of the core specialist expertise and skills that have been developed within the NDFA as the State agency responsible for supporting the Government&rsquo;s overall PPP programme. </p><p>  Arrangements have been put in place to avail of the expertise of the NDFA through outsourcing contract management for existing and future PPP school projects and to avail of its support in managing issues relating to indexation, benchmarking and monitoring service performance.  Ensuring that PPP companies provide quality infrastructure and services on a value-for-money basis is a paramount objective of PPP policy.  Ongoing feedback from each of the PPP schools and from Cork Institute of Technology has been largely very positive in relation to the overall quality of infrastructure and services.  The Department, with the assistance and support of the NDFA, will continue to work closely with all relevant stakeholders in ensuring that the objectives of the PPP programme in this regard continue to be delivered.</p><p>  Good progress is being made on the planned PPP bundles referred to in the report.  Construction has recently completed on all of the schools in the latest PPP bundle which is schools bundle 3.  Schools bundles 4 and 5 are in development, with tenders now received for bundle 4 and the process of assessment of tenders under way.  An invitation to negotiate has recently been issued to shortlisted tenders for the Grangegorman PPP development. </p><p>  In the interest of enhancing transparency around the value for money process, the Department has recently published the public sector benchmarks for schools bundles 1 and 2.  It is understood that these are the first public service benchmarks to be published under the Government&rsquo;s PPP programme. </p><p>  Chapter 4 of the Comptroller&rsquo;s report deals with Vote accounting issues across a number of Departments.  The chapter includes a section on funding for F&Aacute;S training and integration supports and arises from the fact that F&Aacute;S, now SOLAS, receives funding from both the Department&rsquo;s Vote and from the National Training Fund.  During 2012, expenditure pressures on the Vote led to the decision to place a hold on funding of F&Aacute;S from the Vote and to replace this with funding from the NTF.  The report recommended that transactions between the Vote and the fund be more clearly shown in the annual accounts.  Second, it considered that greater transparency could be achieved if payments in respect of specific services or programmes were issued from a single source.  </p><p>  The Department welcomed the report&rsquo;s recommendations and has sought in the draft 2013 NTF accounts to show more clearly transactions between the Vote and the NTF.  The Department is also examining the second recommendation in the report, in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and in the context of the National Training Fund Act, which provides the legislative basis for the NTF.  Both recommendations will also of course be discussed by the Department with staff from the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p><p>  My colleagues and I will be happy to deal with any issues arising from the Comptroller&rsquo;s report. </p></speech>

As someone who has been paid for many years by the Department I acknowledge that in general, the Department has been a good paymaster and pay for teachers has always arrived on time.  I wish to record that fact and thank the Department.</p><p>  I have a few questions about general spending.  The Secretary General has outlined the amount expended in the different levels of education.  To what extent is third-level education funded from the Department and to what extent does it depend on private funding?  What changes have been implemented in recent years and what will be the plan for the future?</p></speech>

Many of the institutions, particularly the universities, are expanding as a result of funding from private sources, to the extent they can do so.  The biggest changes over the past five to six years have been the increase in the student charge which is now at &euro;2,500 and it is planned to increase it by &euro;250 in each of the next two years, at which time it will be &euro;3,000.  A total of 47% of all undergraduate students receive either full or partial support towards that charge from the student grant system, leaving 53% of all undergraduates who pay the student charge fully themselves.  Of all students eligible for free fees, over 50% have some support under student grants.</p><p>  We have also been reducing the State expenditure on higher education and reducing the numbers of staff employed in higher education.  We reduced the grant by 2% three years ago, by 2% two years ago and by 1% this year, with plans for 1% next year.  Similarly the numbers of staff are being reduced so there is a decrease in expenditure.  There has been a gradual decrease in State expenditure and an increase in the student charge along with increases in the various private funding available to higher education institutions.</p><p>  The Department has a major higher education strategy under way, one element of which is an overall performance framework for higher education.  Each of the institutions made submissions to the Higher Education Authority which met and discussed plans over a number of years with each of the institutions.  A report on the outcome of the policy decisions arising is in the process of being submitted to the Minister and hopefully will be published in the near future.</p><p>  The Department has other work under way.  We are looking at the issues related to the future financing of higher education.  We are working in co-operation with the Higher Education Authority on a process with a number of elements, such as ensuring efficient use of resources in higher education.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-15a.70" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014051500007#F00200"><p>The State primarily engages with the institutions in two ways.  On the one hand, the engagement is by way of the performance dialogue between the Higher Education Authority and the institutions, which would facilitate discussion of these types of issue.  On the other hand, Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, undertakes reviews of the effectiveness of quality assurance processes within the institutions.  In addition, the institutions are implementing their own quality assurance programmes.  We also have a programme in place to increase shared services and enhance procurement in order to ensure efficiencies are advanced to the greatest extent possible.</p><p>  We recognise that there is a challenge within the funding of higher education.  In recent years we have seen a decrease in the number of school leavers year on year.  We are now at a stage, however, where this has bottomed out.  The number of school leavers is increasing and will probably continue to increase for the next 15 years or so.  Some 63% of all school leavers enter higher education on an undergraduate programme within five years of their leaving school.  If we are seeking to maintain that 63% progression rate as a goal, we will have to look for greater efficiencies within the system and examine other policy options.</p><p>  The Minister published earlier this week a further education and training strategy earlier which had been undertaken by SOLAS and endorsed by the Government.  There is interaction in the issues between the policy on the numbers in further education and training and the numbers in higher education.  That is something we will have to examine in the future.  We are looking at the development of a national skills strategy which might involve something of a rethink regarding the balance of numbers between further education and training and higher education and training.  One example of what we are doing in this regard is our recently completed review of apprenticeships.  We have many good ideas about the future of apprenticeship programmes which involve a crossover between further and higher education.  We are working on an implementation plan which we hope to complete by the end of June.  There is a great deal of demand across further education and training and higher education.  We have been working through a time of reducing funding and are looking at options for the future.</p></speech>

When a school gets the go-ahead to construct a new building or classroom, for example, am I right in saying primary control at that point rests with the board of management, rather than the Department?  Is it essentially the case that the Department passes over a tranche of money to the board which uses it to have the new accommodation constructed?</p></speech>

We have had to prioritise additional schools to cater for additional numbers.  However, we did receive some additional moneys which enabled us to go back to some projects which, for instance, involved refurbishments.  This year we have also been able to give some money towards summer works and so on.  If we are working on a project which a board of management has responsibility for managing, a process is put in place which would involve the appointment of a design team.  The design team will build a tender, based on a specification we provide and with an indication of the typical and expected cost from our perspective.  There is that type of engagement with the Department on the issue of cost even before the tender is issued.  After the design team has issued the tender, it might have to come back to us to discuss issues such as cost overruns.</p></speech>

I cannot go into the details of the individual school because I do not have sufficient evidence, but an allegation was made to me regarding the construction of a new school building which had been given the go-ahead from the Department to the effect that the builder was not employing people according to the regulations.  Specifically, the claim was that workers were coming down from the North and getting money in their back pockets.  Having conducted some investigations, the problem seems to be that there was no capacity on the part of the Department to investigate the issue because the responsibility was with the school.  The point I am making is that this is a very difficult responsibility to put on the shoulders of a board of management, the main concern of which, once it has secured the necessary funding, will surely be to get the building up and running as soon as possible.</p><p>  I am raising the issue because I do not like to see anybody employed improperly, which can lead to the exclusion of people who are legitimate.  Will Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; indicate whether the Department might be in a position to take a more proactive role in these situations?  Any individual school will not be in a good position to make the checks that might be necessary.  Its concern, understandably, will be to proceed with the building work.</p></speech>

For instance, we have introduced a range of measures to diversify delivery arrangements for school building programmes.  This has involved working with the education and training boards, the Office of Public Works and the National Development Finance Agency, not just on PPPs but also on traditional builds.  We have even worked on a couple of occasions with local authorities.  It is all about increased diversification in terms of the bodies that can take responsibility for these projects and thereby remove the onus from the schools to ensure delivery.</p><p>  Taking the Deputy's example as a case in a point-----</p></speech>

Further to this, we operate a series of random audits and can also initiate an audit at the request of a school if it is concerned that something is going on.  We outsource this work to a company called Contractors Administration Services, CAS, which has completed 13 random audits on school and college construction sites, which two more ongoing.  As a result of these audits, information on five projects has been referred to Revenue, one project has been referred to the Department of Social Protection and one to NERA.  We have different ways to assist schools where such practices are happening.  I suggest the Deputy bring the details of the particular case to which he referred to our attention and we will follow up on it.</p></speech>

I appreciate that the education and training board would have the mechanism to check out such things, but in the case of the traditional school under Catholic or Protestant patronage, or even an Educate Together school, there would not be that type of easy facility.</p></speech>

For example, a large number of new Educate Together schools have been built in recent years under the rapid delivery programme, in which cases the board of management is not as involved as it would be in the case of a traditional build.  We are very conscious of the types of issue to which the Deputy is referring, which is why the Department, with the strong support of the Minister, put in place the system of random audits.  It ensures we have a mechanism outside of the formal mechanisms involving the likes of Revenue and NERA to address these concerns.  If a school has concerns, there are channels through which it can communicate them.</p></speech>

We have direct dialogue with all of the unions.  There are a number of ways by which we can learn about things and decide on where we might ask the organisation undertaking the random audit to look.  To learn more from the process, we have even asked the company to provide a monitoring service for the full construction of a school from start to finish in order to establish the value added.  One of the things about the labour market and the construction sector - the Government announced another stimulus package yesterday - is that the sector keeps changing all the time and new issues emerge.  Bonds were an issue last year and it is quite possible that increasing costs are going to emerge as an issue this year on foot of increased demand.  Our basic build costs have risen slightly in the past year and we have raised the standard amount for basic build costs.  The sector continues to change and we must be as flexible as possible.</p></speech>

One of the Department's core aims is to ensure there is a well skilled body of teachers working in schools.

I presume there will be a need for a fair amount of investment in this area, particularly in rolling out the alternative to the junior certificate, etc.</p></speech>

The main initiative is the professional development service for teachers, PDST.  We also have a national scheme in place which supports in-career development for teachers.  In addition, education centres throughout the country organise courses for teachers and enable them to engage in further career development and learning.  Across a number of areas we have in place a range of continuous professional development programmes.  We fully accept that we have been obliged to reduce funding in this area in recent years.  We reduced overall funding for continuous professional development from approximately &euro;23.7 million to just over &euro;19 million from 2008 to early 2013.  We made special arrangements and put a dedicated team in place in respect of project maths to facilitate the roll-out of that subject.</p></speech>

This is a good example of an area in which we would like to be in a position to allocate additional funding.  It is certainly one of the areas being raised in dialogue with partners on the increasing demand for investment.  We place huge value on investment in the teaching profession and greatly emphasise the need to upgrade it.  This is being achieved by means of developments such as the establishment of the Teaching Council, the extension of the original teacher education courses and the amalgamation of the teacher education colleges.  The amalgamation process has resulted in there now being only six centres as opposed to 19 separate institutions.  In the context of pay, we are seeking to make teaching as attractive a career as possible.  Under the Haddington Road agreement, we are in discussions with the unions about making arrangements to try to minimise the casualisation of teaching, particularly at second level.  This is a major issue.  We have a range of initiatives to support the teaching profession, of which continuous professional development is one.</p></speech>

This phenomenon seems to have grown to a great degree at both primary and secondary level.  I presume the position is the same at tertiary level.

Under the terms of the Haddington Road agreement, arrangements are in place for a working group to examine new mechanisms to ensure teachers can have more certainty with regard to permanency.</p></speech>

When I was training to be a teacher, there was a good balance between the number of people being trained and the number of jobs available.  That does not appear to be the case now.</p></speech>

We were very fortunate that the likes of Hibernia College were available to assist in training unqualified teachers, particularly those in the primary education sector.  We would not have been able to implement section 30 of the Teaching Council Act, under which all teachers are required to be fully qualified, if such institutions had not been in operation during the past ten years.  We are now facing a different set of issues, including what should be the level of supply into the future.  Technically, there is an oversupply of teachers.  There are more teachers being trained than there are jobs available.  We do not have control over the numbers trained in the private sector and fund the training of those who attend public sector institutions.  We have asked the Teaching Council for advice in this matter.  Hibernia College has indicated that it is happy to engage with us and it is not the case that it is operating to its own agenda. It has indicated that it will be happy to engage with the Department once it has obtained the advice of the Teaching Council.</p><p>  It must also be borne in mind that there is an international market for people who have qualified as teachers and that certain individuals may wish to move abroad.  It is not, therefore, a case of there being a national benchmark in the context of the precise level of supply and demand.  This is a complex issue on which we have engaged in quite a bit of consideration.  We are very pleased that we have a qualified teaching workforce.  We want to provide increased in-career development opportunities for those within teaching.  We also want to improve initial teacher education and carry out further work on a range of other issues.  </p><p>  I will ask Mr. Burke to comment on casualisation, a matter on which he has been doing quite an amount of work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-15a.101" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Burke" time="11:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014051500008#G02000"><p>The first step in many of these issues is recognising that there is actually an issue.  Collectively, we were probably slow to do this in the case of second-level teaching.  Many young teachers in that sector spend quite a few years on fixed-term contracts which do not provide stability or security and which have ramifications in terms of their ability to buy houses, etc.  There is also the fact that they may not be on full hours because their services are not required for all of the school day.  Steps and measures - one of which involves the ability to redeploy resources - could be taken to improve the position in both the medium and longer term.  One of the difficulties in the system - we have made some strides towards improvements in this regard - concerns the stand-alone employer at the level of the school.</p> <p>If a school ends up in a situation where there is a mismatch between the teachers it has and the curriculum it wishes to offer, that can create a problem for it.  In a way we need to create more flexibility in movement in the system to be able to move on the agenda of giving people greater permanency.  This is an area, as the Secretary General said, that has been one of the commitments in the Haddington Road agreement and we are working on it with the unions and management at present.</p></speech>

There was the initial agreement and then there was the call for additional contributions.  Under the initial agreement, the outstanding issue is principally the properties issue whereby there are some 20 properties remaining to have their transfers finalised.  The Government decided last summer that properties which did not fully meet the standard of good and marketable title required in the agreement would be accepted where the qualification is technical and does not materially affect the valuation of the property.  We are working through a number of properties on that basis.  Property transfers are complex issues but significant progress has been made given that this is the case and there is continuous engagement with the Chief State Solicitor's office.</p><p>  With regard to the additional contributions, we have been seeking the additional contributions and the Minister would have met with the congregations to seek the additional contributions and there are a number of offers received.  We are working through some of the property issues in relation to those offers and there are some cash offers received and some transfers have been made.  At the same time, the view of the Minister and of the Government is that we would wish to have further transfers made and further offers made, but that has not come to fruition.</p></speech>

One is on indexation and one is in regard to reviewing services provided.  In a number of cases there would have been challenges to the PPP companies and we would have got some money back as part of that because they did not provide services.  There are relatively small issues where the services were not provided for a range of reasons.  It is not a major issue.  We do not have major delivery problems with the PPP companies.  Usually there are particular reasons around why a PPP company has not been able to deliver something, but if it is in the contract, then it is in the contact and we follow through with it.</p><p>  There is also the issue of when we wish to review a contract for the cost of a particular service and, arising from the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General, we have put in place a more formal process to decide whether we might review the provision by a PPP company of a service and the cost of it.  It is a case of swings and roundabouts because, on the one hand, it will cost some money to put in place a review to ensure everything is taken account of and we may have to pay more money as a result of a review.  Both sides have to agree to a review.  We have put in place a formal process now to come to a decision about whether we have a review in any instance.  We have a calendar of dates set out so that we know when the reviews will hit and when we will have the opportunity to do those.  In some cases a PPP company may come to us saying that it wants a review but we have to decide whether we want a review at the same time.</p><p>  One of the issues the Comptroller and Auditor General had raised is that while we made a decision in this regard in one case, there was not documented evidence that we had undertaken that.  We are ensuring the work is undertaken and that it is documented.</p></speech>

Effectively, we will have a range of different initiatives funded by SOLAS, the majority of which is funded now via the education and training boards with effect from 1 July when all the training centres transfer over.  They will be funding what was previously further education and training, which took place in the training centres but also the training that was outsourced by the training centres.  A good proportion of the F&Aacute;S budget is on outsourced training such as the money in the community training workshops.  A range of initiatives across further education and training will be funded by SOLAS.  The big advantage of having such an organisation is that we will have a coherent approach for funding, policy and regulation of the further education and training sector to parallel the arrangements in place with the Higher Education Authority in the higher education sector.  SOLAS will not be like F&Aacute;S in terms of organising the national delivery of programmes.  To a large extent it will work through the ETBs which are organising that.  That does not mean that SOLAS will not be able to organise some programmes centrally itself.</p></speech>

As part of its strategy, SOLAS has announced that it is looking at a performance framework for deciding on funding.  I talked about what it is doing in the Higher Education Authority with the report to us on its approach to performance funding.  In future, that will lead to higher education funding linking to outputs and outcomes.  We are moving into the same area in further education and training.  Over time, a precise approach will be developed in further education and training which focuses on that.  We started with MOMENTUM but we will roll it out further.  No decision has been made on the nature of the processes but the overall policy approach has been decided and we will look at it further.</p></speech>

We had an independent expert report which was submitted to the Minister at the end of last year and the Department is leading the drafting of an implementation plan in consultation with both SOLAS and the Higher Education Authority.  The plan is to broaden the range of areas where apprenticeships will be provided.  It will require the formal engagement of industry with education and training providers.  That is part of our plan.  It will have potential for involvement with different sectors of delivery.  Those sectors will have an opportunity to come forward.</p></speech>

Apprenticeships are not the only way in which we can combine on-the-job and off-the-job learning.  Across the board in further education and training, especially for people who are primarily moving into the labour market, a mix of on-the-job training and off-the-job training must be a key part of it.  We will have to build an evaluation framework into our implementation plan for apprenticeships.</p></speech>

Most of our teaching is based on rote learning for exam purposes, which is a problem.  How will we address the issue?</p></speech>

He was also on the radio yesterday morning.  He referred to the PISA study, which is a study of 15 year olds.  The last set of general outcomes from that was in December of last year.  It showed that our performance in mathematics generally was consistent with our performance in previous studies, other than in 2009 when there was a dip.  Effectively, we have been standing still on mathematics, but within dimensions of mathematics there was a more detailed study, and problem solving is a particular area where we have difficulty.  It is consistent with the changes we are putting in place with project maths in post-primary schools which is seeking to address the type of issues that have been identified as being relatively deficient in the Irish school-going population.  We have put a huge effort in project maths and the upskilling of teachers who teach maths in post-primary schools.  The same is true of the new curriculum and the new junior certificate and leaving certificate subjects.  It is also consistent with the overall approach we are taking on junior cycle reform where problem solving is an issue across the curriculum, not just in maths.  We are very conscious of the messages we are getting from the OECD.  That said, there are areas where we are doing relatively well.</p> <p>For example, the improvement in science, which has shown up in the programme for international student assessment is very positive.  It reflects the changes we put in place in the junior cycle curriculum ten and 15 years ago, and we have gone up a good deal relatively in science.  There are different messages but there is a particular issue within mathematics that identifies the serious issue regarding problem solving we were-----</p></speech>

It is about being able to solve problems across a range of sectors, not only in ICT but in the way we will move forward with various public partnership projects.  It is across a wide range of sectors, and not just in mathematics.  I would be concerned about that because we do not want to be behind the curve as the market requires that skill, which has happened in the past.  In recent years we have seen that we have a major issue with ICT programmers and so on.</p></speech>

We have the highest proportion of graduates under 35.  We have been relatively good at turning our higher education system towards skill needs, but the extent of demand for ICT is huge, and we have to become better at that.

I am very concerned with regard to tourism also, which I see as a growth area.  As one travels around the country one can see that we are far behind where we need to be in terms of the level of service agreement.  There does not appear to be any level of training going into that market.  If we are viewing it as a growth area, and it created 22,000 jobs in the past year, I am not sure that many of those were skilled jobs from the Irish sector, so to speak.  That is a major issue for the future and we should examine it before it comes looking at us, as it were.</p></speech>

I want to touch on a few issues.  Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; provided the committee with an item of correspondence about County Wexford Vocational Education Committee, which effectively is about something that has resulted in the waste of taxpayers' money to the tune of &euro;420,500.  It relates to a situation whereby the VEC moved to a new building in Ardcavan Business Park, in Wexford, on 1 July 2006 and left an existing building which was costing it &euro;67,465 per annum in rent.  That lease was first taken out in October 1984 but it still had eight years to run to 21 October 2014.  It initially let the building it vacated where it had its headquarters for a two year period from July 2006 to June 2008 for an annual figure of &euro;51,000, which effectively was &euro;102,000.  It could not secure a tenant post that event.  It continued to try to sub-let the building and sub-let a portion of it from 2012 to October 2014, which is a two year period, at a rate of &euro;7,000.  That brings the total between 2006 and 2014 to &euro;119,500, yet the rent it paid to a landlord on the premises was &euro;540,000.  The net cost, therefore, in terms of waste of taxpayers' money was &euro;420,500.</p><p>  How did that situation arise and how was it allowed to continue?  Do similar situations arise with regard to other VEC buildings, now education and training boards, ETBs, in various areas under the control of Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;'s Department?  This issue is hot off the press, so to speak, in that it is a letter of 13 May this year and it indicates what this committee is about, namely, appraising the use of taxpayers' money.  How did it happen?</p></speech>

This matter was drawn to our attention as a result of the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit.  We checked with the VEC and the VEC assures us that it did seek our approval but as I said in our correspondence, we cannot find that approval.  A check is going on but I did not want to leave the correspondence unresponded to in terms of getting back to the Deputy.  I said in the correspondence to the committee that, without prejudice to the outcome of the process in terms of finding out what went on, at the time the VEC made the decision to move, it was making the decision to move with a view to renting out the property it had.  Obviously, that did not continue after the first couple of years.  It is very unfortunate that it did not continue after the first couple of years.  I do not think it could have foreseen that would be the case given that the economics changed at the time.</p></speech>

Even apart from that, the annual rent it was paying on the premises was &euro;67,465.  The rent from the sub-let was only &euro;51,000.  That is a shortfall of &euro;16,500, and it was looking at an eight year exposure.  Even with that there was &euro;131,000 of taxpayers' money going down the drain.  It is an old-fashioned principle that public servants should deem it to be their own money, but in the situation that arose in this case - I am not personalising it but merely making the point - from a business model it was flawed from day one because it would cost the taxpayer &euro;132,000.  There would be a shortfall of &euro;16,500 per annum anyway.  Was it required to seek approval from the Department?</p></speech>

If the VEC could only get &euro;51,000 in rent in July 2006, which was at the peak of the Celtic tiger when rental values effectively were out of control, why was the VEC paying &euro;67,465 for the rental of a premises?

As part of the Department's due diligence, I ask the Secretary General to examine how a rate of &euro;67,465 was negotiated on the rental of the premises.  Why could the VEC only get &euro;51,000 for it?  How did the VEC justify moving to a new premises when the rental it was receiving on the old premises did not even cover the rental sum it was paying?  Was there a break clause in the contract?  On the whole, this appears to me to lack due diligence.  Effectively, the locks were on but no one had a key to open the lock to get out the front door.  Instead, the VEC climbed out the back window and effectively continued to pay the rent for the premises.  Can I take it that the Department will look into this and report back?</p></speech>

We have reduced the number of retired teachers being employed and issued information notes requesting schools to prioritise unemployed teachers over those in receipt of a pension.  We set out a set of measures that schools need to follow for the appointment of temporary teachers.  This requires schools to prioritise them.  We have also reduced the pay of retired teachers returning to teaching to ensure the reward was not there for people.  Consequently, a number of different steps have been taken and there is a significant financial disincentive for teachers to retire.  We also monitor the number of days being worked by retired teachers and it has declined.  These are the arrangements that are in place.  There are much reduced instances of retired teachers being employed by schools for longer than ten days.  That number has fallen as a result of-----</p></speech>

I refer to the issue of public private partnerships, PPPs, and the Department having in place a work programme.  Obviously, as members can see on the ground, there has been a population explosion, particularly among the younger age groups now coming into primary school and, by definition, into the secondary schools thereafter.  It has recently been reported that the Department's sister Department in the United Kingdom has concerns regarding the level of profit being taken out of PPPs by the private element.  I have two questions in this regard without wishing to question in any way the professionalism of various contractors.  Is the Department satisfied with the robustness of the PPP model in respect of the taxpayer getting proper value for money?  Second, is the Department satisfied with regard to school bundles?  As the numbers of building companies of scale in Ireland have reduced, will the Department have proper competition with regard to tenders coming in for PPPs in its next round of bundles?  These are two linked questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-15a.212" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014051500012#L01400"><p>They are good questions we must keep on asking ourselves.  I am aware that the value for money question about PPPs is an issue that concerns this committee greatly and we have taken and are taking a number of steps to ensure this is the case.  The publication by the Department, at the committee's request, of the public service benchmark, PSB, for school bundles 1 and 2 is an example of the Department attempting to increase transparency and understanding regarding what we are doing.  We also are reviewing some of our bundles to ensure the value for money and a review of that is under way that we hope to conclude by the end of the year.  In addition, Cork Institute of Technology also is undertaking a review.  It is something we must keep under constant review.  We work out the public sector benchmark in all its different ways.  Again, when I say "we", it is with the support of the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA.  We then must ensure that when the tendering takes place, it comes in under that, in order that we know there is a value-for-money aspect to it.  Were a number of tenders to come in as a result and were the outcome tender to be above the PSB because of an under-supply of builders willing to get involved, we would have concerns.  It is not a concern we have at present.</p><p>  There are several aspects to the market, including the availability of funding and so on.  Obviously, things are slightly better now on that front than was the case two or three years ago.  As the Deputy is aware and as we discussed here previously, we unfortunately were obliged to cancel our three third-level bundles.  However, we now are well advanced on planning with our fifth schools bundle and the Grangegorman project also is advancing very well.  We are pleased about the value for money so far but we must keep it under review.  We think it is useful to have some of our building programme delivered through PPPs.  We must be careful and do not wish to be completely involving PPPs.  Given the increasing school population, we do not want every PPP to be for a new school that needs to open for demographic reasons.  There are several different reasons for this, one being that a PPP does not suit new schools if such a new school is going to open gradually because it will not be used fully in the first year.  Another reason is that there can be particular deadlines whereby one must have the school opened by a particular day.  Consequently, were there some slippage over financing, this could mean it would be necessary for some other solution to be put in place.  We like a balance of new schools and perhaps amalgamated schools.  We are taking that balanced approach in respect of bundles 4 and 5 and certainly will be considering the possibility of further bundles, obviously in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for the future, as we are going into a capital review.</p><p>  The Deputy also referred to the equity returns and obviously we are conscious of the issues in the United Kingdom.  Again, we discussed them here last year as well.  We must be careful because if one procures something, one does not get behind what is the profit for the person from whom one procured it.  However, one must be careful, if there are not enough people in the market, that the profit-taking may be too high.</p> <p>I suppose that is something that we have to keep talking to the NDFA about.  It is in that balance.  Some of the issues in the UK involve the state taking some sort of an interest in it, but that seems to make the whole thing very complicated and involve an up-front investment from the state, which is one of the issues that this approach avoids.  It is a balanced approach.</p></speech>

That level of drain of funding every year over that eight-year period in total defies logic to the ordinary persons up and down the country looking in who fund-raise for their schools, parents councils and boards of management.  Suddenly, they see this drain of funding.  It cannot be allowed to continue.</p><p>  The Department needs to conduct due diligence of that area.  Obviously, there is great work being done by VECs as well.  Side by side with that, this is a management issue which is a wastage of taxpayers' money about which I would feel strongly.  It should never have happened in the first place.  I am sure the Secretary General would agree that there is a need for controls.  Given that he cannot find the documentation on it, I would ask him to review the internal controls that operate within that sector and the linkages to the Department to ensure that it never happens again.  Can I take it that he would have concerns about the type of controls that were in place at the time this contract was entered into?</p></speech>

They have to make all of those returns and they are the ones who have the primary responsibility.  We cannot police them but we have to assist them.  The main assistance that we would have is by the putting in place of the shared service in terms of the internal audit system and we have improved that as a result of the findings that we have had in place, and we have improved it further in the legislation.</p><p>  In parallel with that then, we would have an overview of the accounts as they come in.  That is not a detailed analysis.  It is the responsibility of the ETBs themselves.  They have to report to us as issues come up in their internal audits.

However, other issues arose &mdash; in regard to Wexford VEC, for example &mdash; related to legal fees and other matters associated with issues raised at VEC meetings.  I have looked at a number of the figures involved and must say I was shocked by the amount of money being paid out in legal fees and in dealing with these internal issues.  I would have believed that the audit committee or internal audit process would have identified this and that the issues and figures would have been reported to whoever is responsible for the sector in the Department.</p></speech>

We cannot be on top of them with all their decision-making processes but, when we are informed about an issue, we can consider a collective approach, as was done regarding legal fees within the ETB sector.  We cannot be on the shoulder of the ETBs while they are making a decision on what point on a scale a member of staff should be on.

We would have listened to what they had to say and have required that there be an external chair of an internal audit committee, for example.  Thus, responsibility is being taken.</p><p>  The key issue is to ensure the ETBs have best-practice procedures in place so they can take ownership and make decisions themselves.  Thus, there can be no way in which they can avoid considering the issues, and they can inform us as they proceed.</p><p>  There is an opportunity for the Comptroller and Auditor General to raise issues and for us to take action in that regard.

The committee should not believe we are not working extremely hard with the ETB to resolve these issues.  We had discussions with the CEO of the ETB on these issues on quite a few occasions over the past few years.  We have had a large number of internal meetings to seek to obtain updates about each of the areas that was being identified.  It is not that we are just waiting for somebody to write to us and tell us something has gone wrong.  We are working very closely with the ETB in ensuring the issues are resolved and addressed and to learn from systems issues that arise as a result.</p></speech>

The HEA is now the primary body that works with the institutes of technology.  It examines the accounts and raises issues.  Even as late as this week, the HSE has written to the institutes of technology about whistleblowing, for example, and it has asked them to ensure that they put arrangements in place to deal with any issues that may arise prior to the completion of the legislation currently going through the Houses.</p> <p>The HEA is the primary body in working with the institutes of technology and we work with it.</p></speech>

We received a letter in December 2013 from the Committee of Public Accounts on allegations relating to the awarding of contracts.  This is a matter which also arose in the submission and affidavits around the other legal case.  First, it is usual and appropriate for an allegation against an employee to be investigated by the employer in question.  This relates to an allegation concerning an employee.  The Chairman's committee requested a copy of the report when completed and it was provided.  The committee sought our views in that regard and we made it clear that it was usual and appropriate that an allegation be looked at.  We noted that a three-person investigation team had been established to investigate the allegations.  On that basis, no evidence could be found to refer to the Garda.</p><p>  There were further media reports and Deputies Leo Varadkar and Alan Kelly, the Minister and Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, respectively, and the Minister of State, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon, asked for a report from Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The report was received by us and I understand sent to the committee.  Arising from this, it appears to us that the process undertaken by Bus &Eacute;ireann was robust.  I understand the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications has referred all of the material to the Garda.  If other issues arise, it would not be appropriate for us to take further action.  If money was paid inappropriately, it would be a matter for the Garda.  We do not see additional value in us becoming involved.</p></speech>

Obviously, this is an issue that the committee asked us to reflect on when we were here last year talking about this.  We are confident in the robustness of the system of the systems we have in place but we have been seeking to enhance them and we are open to further enhancements.  There are a number of different elements.</p><p>  One could probably break down school transport into three elements for the sake of discussion and an overview.   We have the contracted out services that are between &euro;100 million and &euro;110 million.  We have the delivery by Bus &Eacute;ireann of services, which is &euro;30 million to &euro;35 million.  We have the administration charge, which I think is &euro;15 million or so.  We have different elements to assure us about each of the different parts.  The overall approach is that we have an arrangement in place with Bus &Eacute;ireann that we feel provides good value for money.  We had a serious value for money review in place into which Bus &Eacute;ireann fed information but was not part of and we had a wide range of recommendations arising from that in respect of the rules of the scheme and to bring about efficiency.  Arising from those arrangements, while demand has gone up, particularly for special education needs services and particular routes, the costs have come down.  State expenditure peaked at &euro;186 million in 2008 and is now down around &euro;171 million.  The savings have been bigger than that although we have increased charges.  The savings are bigger because there are additional services and there is a high number of services in place for children with special educational needs.  </p><p>  In reflecting on enhancing the assurances available in respect of each of the three areas, we must go back to what we concluded in the value for money review that the vast majority of the provision should be outsourced but that there should be a certain proportion retained by Bus &Eacute;ireann partly for a reserve partly to ensure that the competition would maintain and partly because it brought down the costs as a whole for Bus &Eacute;ireann as a transport organiser if it was providing some of the services.  We requested Bus &Eacute;ireann to maximise the amount that is outsourced in the scheme and that has been gradually increasing.  We have asked Bus &Eacute;ireann to put in place review procedures to ensure that all of the procurement arrangements are in line with appropriate national and EU requirements.  It updated its tendering arrangements in 2011.  We can provide the committee with details about this.  This was discussed in detail by Bus &Eacute;ireann with Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications.  It updated its procurement arrangements in 2011.  In addition to that, we are looking at increased assurances via its internal audit that it is taking the appropriate approaches.  </p><p>  This committee had a concern about the Comptroller and Auditor General's access to expenditure under our Vote.  We reflected on that and discussed it with our partner Departments.  We understand that there were ongoing parallel discussions at the Committee of Public Accounts.  We concluded that we could see no reason the Comptroller and Auditor General would not be fully free to follow the school transport money into Bus &Eacute;ireann if he so wished.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has agreed to that so there is no difficulty with Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Clearly, there has never been an issue about Bus &Eacute;ireann coming or not coming to this committee because as far as I am aware, it was not asked but it would certainly be more than willing to engage in that regard.  There has been an opening up of the arrangements.  We have written to the Comptroller and Auditor General about this and discussed the arrangements with him in advance of concluding on them.   </p><p>  In respect of the administrative charge, the committee will clearly be aware that we undertook a particular review of this and got external consultants to undertake it for us.  It raised issues.  The decision we made arising from that was to focus on the rebate element of that.  We are focusing on having annual discussions with Bus &Eacute;ireann and getting a rebate in respect of the charge.  We have had a rebate of over &euro;10 million over a number of years.  That is among the savings about which I have spoken.  We have a three-yearly independent review of the nature of the administrative charge.  We will put in place arrangements for the first of those reviews in the near future.  There was much discussion about profit and we had a discussion about that at the last meeting.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has assured us that it does not make a profit.  It does keep a reserve, the expenditure of which it discusses with us.  It has provided more details on that reserve and how it is being spent to the Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications.  We would be happy to talk that through but there is no money returning to central Bus &Eacute;ireann for expenditure on other areas.  The money within the school transport scheme is sealed and its annual accounts demonstrate that.  Those are different elements to ensure that overall, a value for money approach is undertaken.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-15a.311" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Burke" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014051500016#P00400"><p>The first thing is that the State has no legal obligation.  This has been definitively decided by the High Court.  That issue is subject to appeal to the Supreme Court but as of now and obviously on the assumption that the High Court prevails, the State has no legal obligation to put the matter out to tender.  One then has an option.  The State can obviously make a policy call to tender.  Frankly, there are arguments that can made for and against that.  The current arrangement has probably the significant strength that everything that is generated within the school transport scheme must remain within it.  If there was any element of surplus in any given year, it is ring fenced entirely for expenditure on school transport.</p><p>  The current arrangement also has the second significant advantage that the Department essentially has a demonstrated capacity to take money from it via the rebate.  That was something that in the final analysis was within the capacity of the Department to impose.  Those two characteristics are enormously valuable.  There is then a call to be made as to whether the State would forego those characteristics and tender the scheme.  If one was to ask my view, I would not be convinced of the value of that.  </p><p>  When we look at the scheme in its totality, there are essentially three core elements to it.  The first is the &euro;110 million, which is about two-thirds of the money.  That is flowing through Bus &Eacute;ireann to private contractors.  There is no evidence available to me that a better deal would be achieved with anyone else running the scheme because there are very robust tendering processes underpinning it and the market essentially decides the rate there.  That is the first element of the scheme which I am essentially saying would be pretty much neutral in any tendering context.  </p><p>  The second element is the Bus &Eacute;ireann direct provision - ball park &euro;30 million to &euro;33 million.  There are good strategic reasons for Bus &Eacute;ireann direct provision.  It is an advantage for Bus &Eacute;ireann to have a fleet available that can step in in any set of circumstances if the market is not available to provide the service, if there is evidence of any type of cartel behaviour in the market and so on.  The fact is that this element of provision has been declining in any event but there is a very strong argument that it would be extremely injudicious of the State to have this scheme entirely reliant on a range of contractors around the system without some capacity to underpin it in the final analysis in the event of failure of provision.  What I am saying is that in respect the second element, albeit the fact that it is the smaller of the two I have mentioned, there is no overwhelming strategic reason tendering would be of any great benefit.  I am offering it as my judgment.  </p><p>  The final element is the transport management charge.  That is travelling at about &euro;15 million at the moment.  The Department has a demonstrated capacity.  If it feels at any point that this transport management charge contains any form of surplus that is unwarranted, it has a demonstrated capacity to intervene and extract from that transport management charge, via rebate, an amount which it might determine.</p> <p>While it is a policy matter for the State to decide whether it would tender the scheme, that judgment call would have to be made in a very considered way and in the round.  If it were to tender, I suggest it might not tender that which exists.  It might choose to tender for a strategic fleet of last resort and separately for an overall management of the scheme.  It is a very major issue which would require deep analysis.</p></speech>

While it is a complex area in terms of the transport that is provided, it is not so complex that the Department could not put together some sort of tender arrangement whereby it would at least ask the market.  Everyone, whether in business or Departments, is being encouraged to ask for a number of tenders.  Given that of all the issues are being discussed in the media and elsewhere, it might be much more transparent if the Department could say it had tendered, explain the service it is receiving, outline the issues, explain how they are being dealt with and reveal the cost.  Bus &Eacute;ireann might win the tender again or might be the only company to submit a tender.  I would have thought the Department would consider it to determine what such a system costs.  Is Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; suggesting that the Comptroller and Auditor General can examine the cost of school transport?</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General is a backup method because the main responsibility is on the Department and on me as Accounting Officer.  We see no reason that the Comptroller and Auditor General could not do that and Bus &Eacute;ireann agrees.  As a semi-State body, Bus &Eacute;ireann has the power not to accept it but because it agrees, there is no difficulty.  If, for example, the Comptroller and Auditor General wishes to examine the effectiveness of procurement by Bus &Eacute;ireann there would be no difficulty with that.</p></speech>

We had a commission on school accommodation which undertook various work, and a couple of years ago we stood it down.

Citing the Competition Act, the Competition Authority has stated that, when negotiating with Departments, the organisations cannot represent the interests of their members, particularly in respect of pay and conditions.  That those who seek to represent the rights of members entering into contracts with the State would be prohibited under competition law from doing so seems to be an unintentional anomaly.  I suggest that this amendment might be around that anomaly.  I am conscious that court proceedings relating to this matter are under way.</p></speech>

Under EU and Irish competition legislation, self-employed persons, including professionals who are not employees, are regarded as undertakings.  There is ample evidence of EU case law in the European Court of Justice, which has determined that professionals are regarded as undertakings from an EU competition law angle.</p><p>  Section 4 of the Competition Act 2002 prohibits and makes void all agreements between undertakings, decisions by bodies representing undertakings and concerted practices that have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition in trade in any good or service in the State or any part thereof.  This reflects the provisions of Article 101 of the treaty on the EU, previously EC treaty Article 81, which contains a similar prohibition on agreements, decisions and concerted practices that may affect trade between member states.  Currently, representative bodies cannot decide on the fees paid for services provided by their members.  Nor can their members agree a price between themselves for their services, as this is regarded as price fixing contrary to the 2002 Act.  However, the State is not prohibited from unilaterally setting a fee that it is willing to pay for such services.  Neither is it prohibited from consulting a representative body and its members as long as the State retains the power to set the price.  Thus, any exemption in respect of professionals providing services to the State would have an impact on Exchequer finances.  More generally, any subjugation of competition law is more than likely to result in higher prices for businesses and, ultimately, consumers, a loss of competitiveness for business and, as regards the State and taxpayers, higher costs.</p><p>  As the Deputy acknowledged, a High Court case between the Competition Authority and the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, is pending and I would not like to prejudice the court proceedings.</p><p>  Regarding an exemption for certain categories of workers from competition law, the EU-IMF programme for financial support for Ireland committed the Government to ensuring that no further exemptions to the competition law framework would be granted unless they were entirely consistent with the goals of the programme and the needs of the economy and were agreed in advance by the troika.  No such exemptions were agreed in that context.  There are no plans to introduce such exemptions, especially in light of the post-programme surveillance process that is in place.  For various reasons, I am not in a position to accept the proposed amendment at this time.</p></speech>

The HSE or another organisation could be seeking people to provide a service on its behalf in a normal business practice.  Technically, the people might be self-employed, but they are actually being employed by the State to deliver on contracts.  In any business, people have a right to negotiate their contracts, the terms and conditions of same and how the contracts are delivered.  Competition law is being used to prevent proper negotiation.</p><p>  The Minister might update the committee on the court case's timing.  It was due to be heard in April.  When the might of the State can enforce competition law so as to make negotiations on behalf of service providers difficult, the situation needs to be resolved.  We cannot use competition law to defend that practice.</p></speech>

Different sections of buyers and suppliers need to be able to engage commercially in a fair manner with their counterparts.  I have in mind small convenience stores and so on that engage with an oligopoly in the provision of newspapers.  It is difficult for them to engage on the prices and conditions under their contracts.  If they were able to communicate, negotiate or even discuss the matter as a representative group, though, they would probably create a more equal commercial relationship.  Competition between buyers and an oligopoly of suppliers creates an unequal and unfair negotiations base.</p><p>  In Australia, provision is made for representative groups to negotiate on behalf of their organisations.  As long as such groups in Ireland do not abuse their buyer power, which is something that can be controlled, I do not know why the Minister will not allow them some space.</p></speech>

If one is a self-employed, independent operator, however, one can negotiate on all issues other than fees, in which regard one is only permitted to consult.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n asked whether this was a fair balance.  The State is not regarded as a monopoly in that sense.  It represents the public and is not comparable to a monopoly.  One cannot have groups of independent undertakings, be they self-employed or incorporated, acting in concert to set fees.  That is prohibited by the section in the Act in the interests of consumers and the marketplace.  This provision is designed to protect a market that operates in a fair way.  Obviously, if one is an employee, one can negotiate.  If one is self-employed, one can negotiate on non-fee items and consult in respect of fees.</p><p>  To address Deputy Calleary's point, I understand that the case will be heard on 21 May.</p></speech>

How can a consumer be protected when a powerful agency of the State that seeks to provide a service uses competition law to restrict the ability of those providing the service to negotiate their terms and conditions?  That is what is happening, and not just in that particular case.  I gather that it also applies to actors.  A range of people who provide services join together in representative organisations.  If they are workers, those organisations are called unions and can negotiate the terms and conditions of their employment.  The other people in question are self-employed, but that is due to the professional make-up.  They are providing an essential service to part of the State, yet the State is using its might and competition law to prohibit a level playing pitch.  This is most definitely not in the interests of the consumer.</p></speech>

All non-fee terms and conditions can be negotiated.  The dividing line is between employees, who can negotiate on wages, and incorporated or self-employed people, who cannot.  Anyone operating as an independent, large undertaking would probably be regarded as a cartel if it decided to fix a price in negotiations with the State.  The dividing line is between employees, who are free to negotiate on wages, terms and conditions, and undertakings, including independent and self-employed sole traders, which can negotiate on everything except fees.  This is meant to prevent price fixing.  It is at the core of EU competition law, from which our competition law is derived.  We are not-----</p></speech>

If the Minister is worried that some price fixing or a cartel could emerge, he could within the legislation propose that if the groups came together they could only represent a portion of the sector.  Alternatively, there could be a turnover limit, which has already been discussed with this Bill, and that would ensure there would be no worry about cartels.</p></speech>

There is a very clear line derived from the treaties at the foundation of the European Union.  The relevant elements were the old articles 81 and 82.  At the heart of that is the distinction between an employee and an undertaking, and undertakings cannot in effect seek to set fees, regardless of who is involved.  That is whether it is the public as a broad and undifferentiated mass of consumers or the State as a representative because it funds the service.  That is the heart of this distinction and it is designed to protect the idea of fairness.  It relates to groups of independent undertakings seeking to work together and set a fee.  It has an effect on negotiations such as this and, for example, in the medical area there are discussions which could involve negotiations about everything except the fee element.  In that case there can be consultation but not negotiation.  In that case the Minister sets the price because there cannot be a group combining to set a price.</p></speech>

We are trying to stop groups colluding.  Newspapers are delivered by two wholesalers and because of their market dominance, they have a very powerful influence over the terms, conditions and price in the engagement with the plethora of newsagents around the country.  As a result of the imbalance in power between the supplier and buyer, that type of collusion is more likely to happen under current circumstances.  By levelling the relationship in allowing newsagents to come together in a representative organisation in order to negotiate with the two wholesalers, it would be more likely that we would not have the kind of experience we now have.  The Minister's argument is the same as ours.</p></speech>

If a dominant group of purchasers is dealing with a dispersed group on the other side of a deal, it would be caught under the provisions of abuse of dominance, which limits what it can do.  The group cannot collude either.  There would be two restrictions on the more dominant "oligopoly", as the Deputy described it, as it cannot collude because of the first section and it cannot abuse its dominance.  On the more dispersed side of the market, the provision is that the parties cannot collude.  That means they cannot form a combination to try to set fees, although they can negotiate on other matters.  It would be strange to authorise to the Minister to decide which is the stronger or weaker party, with the Minister being set up to allow one party to collude in controlling the market.  That would not equate to competition law, the point of which is to be independently enforced against a clear set of rules.</p></speech>

It does not really have the function to deal with business-to-business type practices.  I have been using the example of newsagents, which were forced to bring a High Court injunction into their interactions with one of their suppliers at a cost of &euro;29,000, which is an onerous expense for any small group of organisations.  That money had to be spent as the Competition Authority did not have the capacity to focus on that element at all.  The Minister's point about enforcement is moot on this occasion as the capacity was not there to enforce.  If the market is allowed the ability to even up the power balance, the Competition Authority would not have to do that work.</p></speech>

That is true in the case outlined by the Deputy, involving two or three suppliers, or when it involves 40, 50 or 1,000 suppliers.  The rule is they cannot collude to set fees.  The Competition Authority has extra resources for enforcement and it can take cases either where it believes there is collusion and parties are combining to control fees on either side of the market or where they are abusing dominance and acting in a predatory way, for example.  The Competition Authority stands ready to enforce the rules but the rules are clear-cut in this respect.  Where there is an undertaking parties cannot combine to try to set fees.  They can negotiate on other conditions, such as with professional groups.</p><p>  The issue is how this has operated in practice in respect of where the State is on one side of the market, and although there has been consultation, the State ultimately decides the fee.  As we saw during the crisis, the State decided to reduce all those fees across the board, which it did without negotiation, with the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts.  The State is not a monopolist in the way a private trading organisation would be regarded as such, and that is correct.  For example, in the health area the State represents the collective body of patients.  That distinction must be drawn and it is upheld by European law, which is reflected in our law.  It is there for good reason.</p></speech>

My party proposes that there be a 12 month time period put on temporary inability.</p></speech>

This replicates the system that currently exists for the Competition Authority.</p><p>  The mechanics of advertising, interviewing and then taking into account the need for successful applicants to give some months' notice to their current employers, possibly up to three months, means that the entire recruitment and selection process could take a number of months to conclude during which period the commission would not be allowed to function without the requisite membership if a number of vacancies had arisen.  Thus the Bill repeats, at section 10(5) the provisions of the Competition (Amendment) Act 2010 which allows the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to appoint whole-time members for a short period to provide cover up to the point when whole-time members are appointed following the holding of a PAS competition.  In that context, as laid out in sections 10(10) and 10(11) of this Bill, such members may only be appointed for an initial maximum period of six months, with a further period or periods allowed provided the total period for that temporary member does not exceed 12 months.  This provision was utilised in 2010 and appointments made for less than the 12 month period.</p><p>  Finally, at section 10(3)(b), the Bill also repeats the provisions of the Competition Act 2002 in regard to the appointment of temporary whole-time members to address a situation where a member is temporarily unable to discharge his or her duties.  Such provisions are intended to cover illness of a member or unavailability to attend a meeting of the commission if that member is out of the country and cannot take his or her part in that meeting with a knock-on impact on the statutory quorum for that meeting.  Thus, they are of short duration and specific to a given unforeseen situation.  They have, in the case of the Competition Authority's experience to date, consisted of members of staff being appointed for limited periods to ensure authority meetings could take place with the required quorum, often at short notice.  In summary, if a longer-term vacancy arises, the provisions under sections 10(5), 10(10) and 10(11) will operate.  If there is a shorter-term vacancy, then section 10(3)(b) will operate.</p><p>  In light of the above, I do not believe that the proposed amendment from Deputy Calleary is necessary and I am not in a position to accept it.</p></speech>

I do not think the Deputy's amendment adds anything.  Clearly, the process of advertising, filling the position and working out notice with an existing employer could run beyond three months.  Providing for this is unnecessarily restrictive, and it does not have a place in primary legislation.</p><p>  The general rules of the Competition Authority require that a quorum be present.  There is always a move to fill a vacancy, either, as I said, on a temporary basis or using a longer-term appointment.  The commission does not operate like a normal State board where there are appointees.  These are professional people whose posts are filled using the Public Appointments Service.</p></speech>

Removal of the written element is the more problematic of the two elements contained in the proposal.  As proposed, it would weaken the provision by allowing for verbal or oral directions which may be open to interpretation and legal uncertainty both for me as Minister and for the commission.  Having the direction in writing allows for certainty for both parties.  It would also mean that the transparency safeguard provided for under section 18(2), namely "The Minister shall lay a copy of the direction ... before each House of the Oireachtas" would be inoperable.  This would not be a desirable situation for all parties.  I do not see merit in what has been proposed in the amendment for all of those reasons.</p></speech>

There is a feeling at the moment that the Government is secretly uneasy with it and the role that it is undertaking.

This is not an attempt to circumscribe anything.  Clearly, an accounting officer is accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts for matters within the purview of the PAC.

The proposed amendment from Deputy Calleary appears to weaken the powers of the Minister in respect of the preparation of the commission's work programme.  However, its drafting appears to be consistent with the proposed amendment from Deputy Calleary in respect of section 18, in that it removes any power of the Minister to issue directions.  In that context, consistency with the approach on the latter proposal would see a rejection of this proposal for section 28.</p><p>  The provision is about the commission drawing up its work programme.  The Minister is entitled to set things such as key performance indicators, ask for advocacy reports to be drawn up or consumer issues to be addressed that are of public concern.  The Minister does not have power in respect of its statutory duties to investigate and so on because it operates entirely independently.  It is reasonable for the Minister to have powers that require compliance of a more broad brush.  It does not seek in any way to trample on the commission's independence in its core work.</p></speech>

It is not normal for such reports to contain recommendations.  However, the Bill also provides in section 8, as part of the functions of the new commission, for it to undertake studies or analysis, including at the request of the Minister under subsection (4).  This is based on existing legislation - the Competition Act 2002 and the Consumer Protection Act 2007.  In this context, the commission will be able to make recommendations to the Government and Ministers, etc.</p><p>  On the Competition Act 2002, the Competition Authority may report on how competition is working in different sectors and has done so on many occasions.  It has made recommendations to improve how competition works in these sectors.  Such recommendations are addressed to the relevant Minister, public body or representative body, as appropriate.  While the new commission may be expert in the area of competition and consumer protection, it will not have the wider public policy role of Departments.  Ministers and Departments must consider issues from more than one policy perspective and weigh competing and conflicting policies against each other.  A single focus of an expert body does not typically allow such wider considerations to enter its deliberations.  In practice, the Government has agreed that the relevant Minister responsible for the area under the Competition Authority must report to the Government within nine months on his or her reaction and the Government notes the issue or takes a decision on it.  It is expected that the same will apply to reports of the new commission.  I am, therefore, not in a position to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

With regard to interim injunctions, the amendment provides that, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the first amendment relating to interlocutory injunctions shall oblige the courts to seek an undertaking from the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission when the commission seeks an interim injunction.  The amendments are intended to ensure public enforcement of competition law offences is not hindered by demands for undertakings from the State on damages at the time of injunctions being sought by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  This allows enforcement to occur without the court, as a normal process, requiring an undertaking by the commission to meet damages.  It should only be in exceptional circumstances that the court should do so.  The justification is to allow public enforcement to proceed without major financial undertakings being made to the court by the commission.  The amendment is drafted so as to respect the independence of the courts.</p></speech>

The first amendment at (a), covering subsection 18(1) and subsection (1A), has two parts.  The first part provides for a new section 18(1) on the setting of appropriate thresholds for merger notifications.  The setting of such thresholds is crucial to ensure that mergers that raise substantial lessening of competition concerns are captured by the compulsory notification system.  At the same time, it is necessary to be mindful that these thresholds must strike a balance between the need for the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission to review transactions having a nexus to the State while not placing unnecessary burdens on business with respect to lodging notifications.<br />A study of the current threshold regime in Irish law was undertaken to determine whether it is in line with practice elsewhere and has recommended a number of changes to the thresholds as follows: first, the dropping of the worldwide turnover threshold, which means that the new Competition and Consumer Protection Commission will only review mergers which have a real nexus to the State; second, the introduction of a combined turnover level for the State of &euro;50 million in place of &euro;40 million turnover for one of the parties; and third, an increase of the sales to &euro;3 million from &euro;2 million for each of two or more undertakings involved in the State to ensure that the notified merger involves two firms each with a non-insignificant role in the State's economy.  <br />The overall aim of these changes is not to seek an increase or a decrease in the number of notifications received by the new Competition and Consumer Commission but to ensure that the notifications received have a real nexus to the State.  While it is not possible to gauge the extent to which merger notifications will decrease or increase as a result of these proposals, the proposed revisions to the thresholds set out above will provide legal certainty and clarity for all stakeholders involved in merger analysis and will also allow the new Competition and Consumer Protection Commission to focus on notifications with material issues and with a real nexus to the State and thus identify if there is any overlap between the activities of the parties that may well result in a greater potential impact on competition within the State and bring the thresholds applied in the State further in line with international best practice for setting thresholds.  <br />The second part of the first amendment sees the provision of a new subsection 18(1)(a) to bring Irish legislation into line with the EC merger regulation, Council Regulation 139 of 2004, to provide that undertakings can notify to the new Competition and Consumer Protection Commission mergers or acquisitions on the basis of a good faith intention to conclude an agreement or the announcement of a public bid.  This provision will reduce the inclination of firms to jump the gun as they will be in a position to make a notification earlier in the transaction process.  <br />The third substantive amendment at (c), covering subsection 18(3), is also in the main a drafting amendment consequent on the first amendment being proposed while also removing the one month deadline for the voluntary notification of any merger that is not required to be notified by law.  This allows for notification at a later stage, if necessary, without imposing an unnecessary burden on the parties who wish to make the voluntary notification.  Such voluntary notifications are sometimes considered desirable by merging bodies to ensure that the merger itself is competition law-proofed and thereby ascribed legal certainty into the future.<br />The other elements of the proposed amendment are drafting amendments consequent on the first amendment being proposed, as are amendments Nos. 25, 26 and 30.</p></speech>

Although the authority's standard request for the information calls for an officer of the undertaking to certify compliance with such a request, some parties refuse to comply and argue that the authority lacks the power to require such certification.  These requests are an important step which contribute significantly to full and accurate responses.  This delays examination of the merger, leads to unnecessary disputes, can reward the recalcitrant and prevents the authority from having timely access to needed information.  <br />The proposed amendments to section 22 of the Competition Act 2002 provide that an officer of the undertaking concerned shall certify in writing to the new Competition and Consumer Protection Commission that he or she has complied with the request for information.  This will add a very small extra administrative burden on the undertaking concerned but the overall gains are fewer delays in the examination process and quicker decisions on merger applications.<br />The remaining part of the amendment contains some drafting changes from the text that appeared in the Bill as initiated.</p></speech>

There seems to be no yardstick or threshold contained in the legislation as to what is the maximum cross-media ownership limit.  It seems to me it is an arbitrary decision by the Minister when a media mogul has got into a situation of dominance and where that becomes dangerous.  I am not saying a specific formula can be included in primary legislation whereby the Minister would have to act but it is a concern of mine and, I imagine, of many individuals that we are dealing with a media market in Ireland that is very concentrated and is overly located in the hands of a few large powerful business interests.  <br />Given that the media is often the oxygen on which democracy functions, it is really important that this legislation is extremely strong in ensuring a diverse media market.  Perhaps the Minister will indicate what his understanding of what the threshold or the limit to cross-media ownership should be.</p> <p>If it is not put into primary legislation, how exactly will the current D&aacute;il have influence over future Ministers?  This specific amendment seeks to substitute the word "prevalent" with "present" because certain cultural issues and identities may not be prevalent within Irish society but they could be present.  Minorities should be reflected within media discourse and delivery and my worry would be that the legislation as it is currently worded would mean that some minority cultures or experiences today would be excluded from that reflection.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-15a.507" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2014051500010#J00200"><p>I will start with the amendment itself.  In considering plurality and diversity of content, our definition is taken in its entirety from the advisory group on media mergers report.  The term "present" is more absolute than "prevalent" and would make the proper measure of diversity extremely complex.  In the context of diversity, if everything that exists in the universe had to be considered, it would be an impossibly difficult test.  The word "prevalent" was chosen by the advisory group as it offers a balanced approach.  Otherwise, it would be too difficult to interpret.</p><p>  The wider issue that Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n raises was considered at length by the advisory group.  The group felt that specifying metrics in the legislation would be fraught with risk.  In the first instance, the question of normal market mechanics arose.  If the numbers of active market participants in a given media market were to reduce over time to the extent that the concentration metric was breached without a merger having taken place, then the next merger would have to be ruled out regardless of its merits.  This would be particularly relevant for a country like Ireland that has a relatively small media market and where the application of reasonable limits on concentration could be undermined following the closure of a single media outlet.  </p><p>  Second, the question of which index to use also arises, something of emerging concern given the rise of online media.  Already the question of how to measure cross-media impact arises.  How does one accurately measure the relative weight of newspaper circulation, radio and television audiences and online page views or downloads?  This is an issue of judgment that has to be applied and that is why we have a process of consultation, with expert groups assessing and advising.  </p><p>  The Deputy also raised a concern about whether this allows the whole thing to run away without the Oireachtas.  What is now required is that the relevant Oireachtas committee is advised and notified of the merger.  The Oireachtas committee is one of the bodies whose view is taken into account.  The legislation requires that the Minister notifies the relevant Oireachtas committee and invites a submission from it and any such submission then has explicit recognition as one of those documents to which the Minister must give regard in coming to a decision.  Of course, if a Minister comes to a decision, he or she must provide an order in the House too.  The Oireachtas has influence throughout the process.  As I said on Second Stage, seeking to pin down and define in very narrow metrics, even in the narrow competition area, never mind getting into the complexity of multiple media dimensions, is impossible.  It is a matter of judgment at the end of the day.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-15a.508" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1080" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2014051500010#J00300"><p>The problem I have is that we are dealing with legislation that deals with competition but this section hangs on the fact that there must be competition within the media market but we put no real yardstick or threshold on that.  That is a mistake because any Minister or Oireachtas committee can be put under pressure from those same media interests.  We have seen media groups exert extreme control over previous Governments.  The Bill makes it very difficult for a future Minister to make a strong decision in the public interest on this issue.  As far as how to analyse or create an index for media consumption, we have JNLR for print media, Nielsen for broadcast media and so forth so while it may be hard, it is not impossible.  Just because it is hard does not mean we should not try to do it.  There needs to be some threshold.</p><p>  I understand the Minister's point about the market being very concentrated anyway because it is small.  However, the threshold can reflect that market structure.  Regarding the amendment in hand, I believe that there is a problem with the word "prevalent" because it will exclude minorities.  The need for minorities to be reflected, with their diversity of cultural interests, in the media is very important.  In the context of the section as currently drafted, there is no doubt that minorities who are accepted and respected today would not, a generation ago, have been described as "prevalent".  There are likely to be minority groups in Ireland in 20 or 30 years time who are not considered acceptable today who will be present in the future but not prevalent.  That is the problem with the wording as it stands.  I wish to press my amendment.</p></speech>

Why is the Minister limiting this to groceries?  Let us consider what happens in the newsagent, the grocery shop or the convenience store.  There are quite a number of other products such as phone credit, stamps and newspapers, as well as services such as bill payment, which are part of normal commerce.  The abuse of supplier power and buyer power is an issue.  I know there is an amendment to broaden it a little.  Will the Minister discuss why the legislation should not be broadened to encapsulate those areas also?</p></speech>

There was a commitment in the programme for Government in relation to grocery goods.  There was public consultation on grocery goods.  The approach that needs to be taken in respect of this is that one allows bodies to submit their views and that these views get a proper airing.  That has happened in respect of the grocery goods sector.  This committee has conducted a number of investigations, as has the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This ground has been well trodden.  There has been a general consensus across the political parties that something needed to be done in this area.  Clearly, if the committee identifies or if there is a general view that there are other areas of difficulty in the supply chain, we will look at that and take advice from the competition and consumer protection commission and from players.  This has a long history in the Oireachtas and as a consequence was included in the programme for Government.  I undertook consultation with the grocery goods sector.  I am not saying that public concern cannot arise in another area.  There was a very clear reason for this.</p><p>  Let me add, while I am in possession, that I am considering some further refinement, definitions and amendments to some provisions of the Consumer Protection Act 2007, and I may revert on Report Stage to Part 5.</p></speech>

They are left open to abuse.</p><p>  This highlights that the list of products is not exhaustive and that consideration should be given to empowering the Minister through statutory instrument, following consultation, to add to this list.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n mentioned products that probably were not thought about when the Competition and Consumer Protection Bill was first drafted.  There needs to be some flexibility either on the part of the Minister or that of the competition and consumer protection commission around goods as they arise.</p></speech>

I am considering some further refinements to the definitions and provisions of Part 6.  I will revert on Report Stage.</p><p>  I will consult on the possibility of making a statutory instrument giving the Minister flexibility.  There may be the view in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel that it would be straying beyond what should properly be in regulations and would constitute sufficient change in the operation of whatever sector is involved that it should not be done by secondary legislation.  In light of the point made, I will seek advice on it.</p><p>  I will now deal with the amendment.  I note that Deputies T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and Calleary are calling for the inclusion of garden plants within the scope of the definition of grocery goods under the terms of the Bill.  For the purpose of the Bill, the term "grocery goods" means any food or drink that is intended to be sold for human consumption, which can include items such as any substance or thing sold or represented for use as food or drink for human consumption, or any substance or thing sold or represented for use as an additive ingredient or processing aid in the preparation or production of food or drink for human consumption.  It also includes intoxicating liquors, household cleaning products and toiletries.  Items such as garden plants go beyond the scope of the meaning and definition contained in the Bill for grocery goods.  The public consultation process undertaken on this issue in recent years did not elicit any such proposals, although it is clear that many relevant grocery goods undertakings may sell garden plants along with grocery goods as part of their overall offering to consumers.  It is worth recalling that the inclusion of such products under the regulations would mean that a new cohort of businesses such as large garden or DIY-type retailers, suppliers and wholesalers would now come within the definition of relevant grocery goods undertakings.  None of these businesses would have engaged in the public consultation process on this issue heretofore, as the discussion centred on the traditional and previous definitions of grocery goods, which did not include garden plants.  Thus, there would be an unforeseen extra administrative burden, in their view, imposed on them without any consultation.  My initial reaction is not to accept this proposal, but given the importance of this element of the horticultural sector's output, I will reflect on it further in before Report Stage.</p></speech>

The Opposition will always clip the ear of a government that does engage in proper consultation.  As there is no doubt of that, we cannot give out to the Minister for not seeking consultation.</p><p>  The key point is that the term "a grocery store" does not meet the current market realities.  In the current market, grocery stores, and shops in general, have broadened out considerably and are morphing all the time.  If we hang this legislation on the right to make sure nobody abuses player or buyer power, then the logic would be that suppliers of garden plants should be protected in this way.  I think we would lose a significant opportunity if the current Oireachtas does not seek to protect those suppliers.</p></speech>

We can move into dispute very quickly - more quickly than we may have thought.  Will the process of consultation happen before the Bill goes to the Seanad so that we will not have to return in two years' time to deal with the fallout when small producers of garden plants are being hammered by their major buyers without the protection we could bestow on them under the Bill?</p></speech>

The origin of this is the unfair practices that were seen to be arising.  The sorts of things that are deemed to have gone on are set out in the regulations.  Suppliers were over a barrel and had to agree to unreasonable terms.  We are seeking to deal with those practices in the grocery sector, where they were seen as a problem.  As the Deputy said and as I accepted in my reply, it creates a bit of a difficulty for me that this issue did not arise during the long period of consultation in the Oireachtas or under the John Travers process.  I will reflect on what has been said and see what can be done.  I do not want to make undertakings until I get a chance to assess what would be involved and what its impact would be on the sector and the players in the sector.  I would like to get an impression of the extent to which the practices about which the Oireachtas is concerned might be occurring in the horticultural sector in respect of plants as opposed to grocery products.  This needs to be the subject of a little consideration.  I do not want to make undertakings I cannot honour at a later stage.  However, I will undertake to reflect on this and ask officials who have an understanding of the sector to assess it.  At that stage, I will be in a position to form a judgment.</p></speech>

We are all paid to do our job of bringing these issues to the fore.  I know how long it takes for the legislative wheels to turn at Government level.  It takes longer from the Opposition's perspective because we just do not have the resources to draft legislation.  If the measure we are recommending is not included in this Bill, it is likely that it will not appear until the next D&aacute;il has been elected.  We have a responsibility to try to make sure it happens now.  Two or three years is a long time in any business, especially a small supplier that is suffering from unfair market practices.</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, some contentious matters have had to be dealt with to get to where we are.  I do not want to hold up legislation that has been flagged by the Oireachtas as being necessary.  Certain broader elements of this legislation relating, for example, to media mergers and the establishment of the bodies should be implemented as a matter of urgency.  I need to reflect on the different pressures that exist in this area before I make a judgment call on the merit of this proposal.  There has been a great deal of desire to see this legislation move forward.  I will seek to come to a quick judgment on this matter.  I am undertaking to examine it seriously.

The current threshold has been carefully chosen for several good reasons.  I will allude to the main considerations in this regard.</p><p>  First, I am anxious to ensure these provisions are not disproportionate.  I am trying to ensure they cover a broad swathe of processors, suppliers and retailers that are not regarded as major players in the national grocery goods sector.  Second, the European Commission uses a threshold figure of &euro;50 million in respect of turnover when it is distinguishing between small and medium-sized enterprises and large firms.  Third, I am anxious to ensure the regulatory and red tape obligations imposed by regulatory authorities on small and medium-sized enterprises are kept to a minimum.  The reductions in the threshold levels proposed by the Deputy would lead to a much higher incidence of administrative burden among SMEs in the grocery sector.  Fourth, the UK threshold for qualifying designated retailers for the purposes of the that country's Groceries (Supply Chain Practices) Market Investigation Order 2009 is "any Retailer with a turnover exceeding &pound;1 billion with respect to the retail supply of Groceries in the United Kingdom".  The threshold of &euro;50 million being provided for in this legislation is based on an extrapolation of the qualifying turnovers under the UK legislation.  Fifth, the figure of &euro;50 million emerged as a suggested figure from the public consultation process undertaken on this issue.</p><p>  A proposed figure of &euro;50 million has been set in this Bill for all of these reasons.  I am seeking not to be disproportionate about the ambit of this provision to grocery goods undertakings in the Irish market.  In that light, I consider that any reduction in the qualifying threshold of &euro;50 million would impose an unfair burden on many firms in this sector.  Therefore, I am not in a position to accept this amendment.</p></speech>

How many would be captured - in real terms or in proportional terms - by the Bill if it were amended in the way we seek?  I expect the Department would have proportional figures in mind when drafting such measurements.</p></speech>

Generally speaking, throughout all sectors there are approximately 180,000 small and medium sized enterprises and approximately 4,000 large companies.  I suspect that a move to include much smaller companies as well as the large ones would dramatically widen the purview of the legislation.  It would widen the chain dramatically.  The purpose of this legislation is to deal with abusive practices that are essentially related to market power.  If we reduce the threshold to encompass smaller companies in the way that has been proposed, we will move away from the purpose of these regulations, which is to grapple with the fact that strong players are in a position to dictate or change terms at will.  I think that is the balance here.  I am sure we can seek some information for the Deputy.  For example, we can get the data published by the Central Statistics Office.</p></speech>

I suggest they will be able to use this provision to do that.  We know who the strong players are.  As we speak, they are employing people who are being paid much more money than any of us are getting to go through this Bill and find ways around it.  I predict that the strong players will use the distribution chain for these purposes.</p> <p>They will use their dealings with the intermediary to abuse the supplier - in other words, the person who makes the effort to grow and supply the food they purchase.</p><p> While I agree with the Minister on the need to avoid imposing an administrative burden, providing for this level of protection to the primary producer would not impose a significant burden on companies with a turnover of more than &euro;10 million.  The current level of protection for primary producers is not sufficient.  To use the Minister's phrase, the dominant providers are using these types of measure to ensure primary producers are not afforded the protection they require.</p></speech>

A consultation approach was taken and this emerged as a reasonable provision.  There are good grounds for the provision we have made in this regard, which is the reason it has been included.  I will, however, examine the possibility of abusive moves being made to frustrate the intention of the legislation, as noted by the Deputy.</p></speech>

The use of separate companies enables them to circumvent employment law and constructively dismiss members of staff.  I have no doubt this practice will take place in this context if it results in a competitive advantage for the company in question.  As such, it will be logical for some of the businesses in question to act in this fashion.  If it is our intention to ensure fair trading conditions between companies, surely the proposed amendment would not be an imposition on firms with an annual turnover or &euro;12 million, &euro;15 million or &euro;30 million.</p></speech>

Compliance obligations are in place because we would not be able to carry out enforcement without them.  They are necessary with regard to the keeping of records.  The small firm for which the Deputy is advocating will also have to be compliant in its practices.  There are two sides to this argument and we are trying to strike a balance between introducing new compliance obligations for a public purpose, of which we are all aware, and ensuring these obligations are not disproportionate to the risk involved.  One chooses a threshold for this reason.  As I stated, the threshold was selected for a variety of reasons.  If it were lowered, we would add to the administrative compliance costs for businesses, including smaller companies.  Moreover, we would do so without having a <i>prima facie</i>ground for suggesting it would have any significant benefit, as these companies are not the players who are typically abusing a position of power in the marketplace.  We are trying to strike a balance.  As such, the &euro;50 million threshold has a good underpinning.</p></speech>

At the outset, let it be clear that the Government is strongly of the view that it is important to ensure there is a balance in the relationship between the various players in the grocery goods sector and that Ireland continues to have robust agrifood and retail sectors, particularly given the importance of these sectors to the national economy.</p><p>  Regulation of certain practices in the grocery goods sector is intended to achieve such a balance, taking into account the interests of all stakeholders in the grocery goods sector, including the interests of the consumer and the need to ensure there is no impediment to the passing on of lower prices to consumers.  This balance is an important issue.  In this context, I recall that section 63B(1)(f) of the Bill gives recognition to the importance of the development and maintenance of a strong, efficient and competitive production and supply base in the grocery goods sector.  It is important to note that the introduction of any regulation does not and cannot guarantee anything in regard to the prices received by any given link in the supply chain.  Negotiations on price will remain an issue for hard negotiation between contracting parties, as happens in any commercial relationship.  </p><p>  What the new regulations intend to achieve is to regulate certain practices rather than set prices.  While I believe the issue raised by the two Deputies is already covered by the text of the Bill, I will reflect on this in the context of Report Stage.</p></speech>

A whole range of multiples do not provide details of their sales and profits in this State.  This is a huge disadvantage for policy development and taxation and is a disadvantage also in regard to the ability to create progressive rates and understanding the market power structure.<br />The fact that Tesco, Aldi and others do not indicate the turnover or profit they make here is wrong.  In discussions I have had with many businesses recently, I have been made aware of the need for a progressive business rate.  However, how can we apply a rate that takes profit into consideration if some of the key players in the market are unwilling to disclose their profits?  I have probably mentioned this to the Minister a million times, but we cannot manage if we cannot measure.  The fact we cannot measure exactly the turnover and profitability of these multiples is a major weakness in our ability to hold them to account, to manage them and to develop policy.  If we are to have a transparent market in which firms and suppliers understand their true market power, it is important we get to the bottom of this issue.  Why has this not happened before this?</p></speech>

In regard to amendment No. 51, at a previous committee meeting the Minister attended at which we conducted an investigation into the grocery market, we were treated to two days of fiction that would make Enid Blyton proud on the so-called difficulties of some of the operators in the Irish market.  When they were pushed on profit levels and margins, they all went to ground and refused to provide that information.  Given their dominance in terms of business and their importance in terms of being a service and a purchaser of Irish goods, their ability to evade any kind of scrutiny of their financial model, the margins they charge, their choice of some products over others and the way they treat suppliers is wrong.</p> <p>As long as that culture of evasion exists and as long as it is facilitated by a lack of legislation, suppliers, customers and, in many cases, society at large are losing out and society is being harmed.  I am referring specifically to policies with regard to the selling of alcoholic goods, which can be hidden, and many large multiples can get around any associated legislation because of the lack of scrutiny or detail on what they should provide in respect of their financial model.  It is time now that we stood up to them as a country and put it to them that they must level the playing field for suppliers and, most important, for society.</p></speech>

These proposed amendments are stand-alone provisions and are not related to the regulations that I, as Minister, may make to regulate certain practices in the grocery goods sector.  As I have stated in the House previously, companies operating in Ireland are free to establish and organise themselves in the most suitable form to promote and run their businesses, provided that they comply fully with relevant national and EU legislation, including relevant legislation on the content of financial statements.</p><p>  The requirements regarding the preparation of publication of the financial statements of limited companies and groups are determined by the first, fourth and seventh EU company law directives and by Regulation (EC) No. 1606/2002 and international financial reporting standards adopted by the EU under its provisions.  These requirements are largely reflected in the Companies Act 1963, the Companies (Amendment) Act 1986 and the European Communities (Company: Group Accounts) Regulations, 1992, as amended.  The equivalent requirements apply throughout the European Union.  The fourth and seventh directives have been replaced by a new accounting directive, Directive No. 2013/34/EU, which is required to be transposed by July 2015.  The requirements concerning the accounts of unlimited companies are governed by domestic legislation.</p><p>  The extent to which profits are or are not disclosed is of general application and is not determined on the basis of the sector in which a company or group operates.  The requirements under company law are essentially the same for companies or groups that operate supermarkets as for companies or groups active in any other sector of the economy.  I consider that a disclosure regime targeting a specific sector could be viewed as disproportionate and discriminatory and could have negative consequences in terms of business costs and in attracting foreign direct investment.  Thus, I am not in a position to accept the amendments on this issue.</p></speech>

I also believe that to achieve that, information is necessary.  I cannot think of any other manager anywhere who would wilfully not request key information that is relevant to his ability to manage his job and tasks.  The profitability and turnover of these companies has consequences throughout the economy, not least in terms of employment rights and negotiations and engagements.</p><p>  In this scenario we are discussing market power.  The legislation is hung on the key issue that there is fair interaction of different market forces, including buyer and suppliers.  A key part of that is information.  The Minister cannot fully adjudicate on the engagement between Tesco or Aldi with suppliers if he cannot reasonably understand their levels of profit and turnover.  To wilfully manage the whole sector in the blind - that is the reality at present - results in an inability to manage it properly.  I still do not understand why exactly this has not happened as of yet and I urge the Minister to increase his ability to manage the sector and stand up for the interests of the public on this issue.</p></speech>

In his heart of hearts the Minister knows that.  If it is a European stipulation that is stopping us, then Europe must be challenged.  We cannot stand by any more and allow these organisations to use this leniency and the lacuna in the law relating to their financial model to do the damage that many of them are doing in our society as a whole.</p></speech>

This is not to police prices or profit margins.  This has arisen from a concern that people in a strong position can apply unfair rules in the way they deal with particular suppliers that are in a more vulnerable position.  We are seeking to deal with that.</p><p>  As I stated earlier, the Deputies are raising issues of what appropriate financial disclosures should apply.  We cannot have financial disclosure obligations for one sector and not another.  The financial disclosure obligations are set out in law and I have described them.  Enterprises are obliged to meet their obligations under company and tax law.  Those regulated under this provision will be obliged to meet their obligations in respect of unfair practices and fair contract terms.  That is the limit of what this legislation does.</p><p>  As I have stated already, if we start to introduce various alternative financial disclosure requirements from those that apply elsewhere in the European Union we would raise real issues in respect of how companies see themselves treated in different countries.  We are in a competitive environment and we should comply with the level playing field provided by EU provisions in this area.  They are fair and reasonable and they apply throughout the European Union.  This Bill is trying to deal with what are potential abuses in the way in which smaller suppliers could be treated in respect of their practices.</p><p>  Obviously there is a wider issue relating to people wishing to know how prices compare here and there, and that is a perfectly legitimate interest.  On Second Stage we discussed several surveys conducted by the National Consumer Agency and individual players who examine prices hither and yon.  It is perfectly valid to show people where value is and is not to be found.  That is a legitimate way to improve information in the marketplace.  However, requiring the publication of returns or profit margins in a particular sector is not what this Bill is about.</p></speech>

For as long as I can remember there have been periods of major costs increases in the State.  Ministers say from time to time that such and such a multiple is margin- or profit-harvesting.  There is considerable evidence to show that some of these multiples, including Tesco, achieve a far higher margin in this State then in other areas.  Again, it weakens the power of the consumer when that information is not to hand because the more multiples can hide with regard to their operations, the more power they have.  Surely transparency is an important issue for the consumer, never mind the suppliers to those companies.  Surely the Minister should be standing up for the consumer on these issues.</p></speech>

The ultimate abuse is that we know who is responsible and they are able to do that because of the kind of money they are making in the market.  We all know they are making big money but we do not know how much.  That is what funds the abuse and their ability to abuse market share.</p> <p>It strikes me as very odd that they must declare these figures in other European countries but not here.</p></speech>

We have seen those terms and are taking steps to regulate so that they cannot apply.  The legislation does not seek to introduce new financial disclosures because one cannot establish financial disclosures for one sector and not another.  That would be disproportionate.  It is not a question of whether some grocery chain would pull out of the country but of saying that we will set up a system of financial disclosure that will not apply elsewhere.  I do not believe Ireland should do that.  Ireland should have a level playing pitch in respect of financial disclosure requirements.  We should set laws that enterprises should comply with in terms of governance and taxation obligations.  All of these obligations should be fair and apply equitably and equally across all sectors.  We cannot start to introduce different rules for different sectors.  We are seeking to protect those who might be vulnerable and make sure that practices that would render them vulnerable are not so.</p><p>  There is plenty of work being done to protect consumers.  My Department, through the National Consumer Agency and others, provides price comparisons, allows people to see what is going on in different areas and there are substantial differences in the charges for all sorts of products, including financial products.  They are regulated.  We do not seek to go beneath them to look for declarations of a company&rsquo;s profitability in sectors where one insurer is offering terms on a different level to another insurer.

That does not have anything to do with good management of fair market practice.  We set up obligations under company law, competition law, tax law, planning law and expect companies to comply with them.  I take my hat off to people who are profitable and successful.  I do not expect them to have to publicise their profitability.  We know exactly where that would lead.  It would not encourage the creation or promotion of enterprise.  It would be an unhealthy direction to take.  One sets obligations and apply the rules fairly.  That is what we seek to do, to address a very specific problem.</p></speech>

The Minister has emphasised that this Bill aims to protect against abuse of the supplier relationship.  There is no doubt that below-cost selling is under way and that below the net invoice price selling is under way.<br />The Minister knows well that a turnip cannot be produced for five cent.  Below-cost selling of alcohol is rampant, I suggest.  Alcohol products are being used as magnets to draw in customers to large supermarkets.  The manner in which alcohol is being used, its availability and the lack of regulation in the way in which it is being sold is causing so many other social consequences.  <br />The Minister of State, Deputy Alex White is supposed to be working on a strategy around alcohol and alcohol abuse but one of the key problems is this sector.  We have a chance here to do something about alcohol as well as looking at the supplier relationship and the abuse of that relationship.  The Minister comes from an agricultural background and he knows it is not possible to produce a turnip for five cent, bring it to market, brand it and sell it.  This is being allowed to happen and there is no follow-up, no interest.  Everybody talks about it and then they move on to the next issue.  It is also the case with the sale of pallets of beer.  This amendment is to give protection to the primary producer and also societal protection from products that are being used by the large multiples to get people into their stores by using products that have far more consequences beyond the walls of that store.</p></speech>

A recent IPSOS-MRBI poll showed that nine out of ten respondents believe that legislation should be introduced to ensure that farmers receive a fair price.  We are here as representatives of the people and that is what we should be seeking to do.  Just three out of ten people were of the view that below-cost selling of vegetables was in the long-term interest of consumers.  There is no doubt that a loss leader is made up by extra margins elsewhere in a store.  In the round, the consumer does not benefit.</p><p>  In my view an honest day's work deserves an honest wage and an honest product deserves an honest price.  The two are interlinked because if the honest product does not get the honest price then the honest day's work does not get the honest wage.  We should allow for proper, robust, healthy competition between firms but this should not mean the exploitation of suppliers.  No matter which way this process is cut and diced, below-cost selling leads to the exploitation of sellers.  I have been at a number of committee meetings where the cross-party general view was that with regard to alcohol and other products below-cost selling was leading to negative outputs for society in general and for suppliers.  Here we have an opportunity to resolve that and I urge the Minister to resolve it once and for all.</p></speech>

The restrictive practice grocery order 1987, SI 142/87, prohibited below invoice price selling of certain goods rather than banning below-cost selling of those goods.  In effect, the order allowed wholesalers and suppliers to determine minimum retail prices being charged to consumers, thereby seriously constraining competition in the grocery trade.</p> <p>Since the repeal of that order in 2006, there is no statutory basis for me, as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, to make a minimum pricing order in any sector.  The use of aggressive pricing strategies in any business is a legitimate marketing tool and the normal outcome of the competitive process.  Low-cost and below-cost selling by a retailer is not in itself an offence, unless it involves an abuse of a dominant position.  A determination on whether a retailer is abusing a dominant marketplace position would necessitate a comprehensive investigation by the Competition Authority, the independent statutory body responsible for enforcing competition law in the State.  Complaints of an alleged anti-competitive practice should be referred to the authority.</p><p> I do not accept that there are grounds for the reintroduction of such a restrictive measure; therefore, I am not in a position to accept the proposed amendments.  Deputy Dara Calleary gave alcohol as an example.  However, as he indicated, the Department of Health is developing proposals in that area and it is doing so not as a matter of market operation but as a matter of public health policy.  The nature of markets is such that one cannot ensure every business will thrive and receive a reasonable return for its effort.  Businesses rise and fall and processes change and it is not the role of the State to set prices.  Our role is to set fair rules within which competition can operate, which is what we are seeking to do.  We are not seeking to fix a price for a particular product but to ensure that where an aggressive price strategy is pursued by a retailer, as is its entitlement, it is not done by abusing the supplier's contract terms.  The Bill provides the correct balance between the various interests in the marketplace.  For these reasons, I cannot accept the amendments brought forward by the Deputies.</p></speech>

It is not appropriate for the Minister to pass the ball to the Department of Health on this issue.  If that Department comes back and states below-cost selling of alcohol must be outlawed, which it might do, it will fall back on the Minister to implement it.  He has a chance to send a statement from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation that we are doing something about this.  The multiples are hardly quaking in their boots at the prospect of being investigated by the new authority, as poorly resourced as it is.  They have a raft of lawyers and many ways of getting around the legislation.  We, therefore, need to make sure the Bill is resource-proof in that context.</p><p>  We have seen instances of where suppliers are being abused.  There may be no written evidence, but we know it is happening in terms of the pressure being put on people, small suppliers in particular.  The dominant sellers are putting suppliers in a situation where a dependency arises and becomes part of their business model.  The supplier is obliged to provide product at certain prices, pay for shelf space and do all of the other stuff we know is going on.  Dealing with below-cost selling in this legislation would send a signal that such practices would not be tolerated.</p></speech>

He is suggesting wholesalers would write an invoice price and that it would become the price.  If that were happening in another situation, he would, rightly, be describing it as a cartel where the retailer had no obligation but to accept the price dictated by the supplier.</p></speech>

He removed that provision because it was operating as what used to be called resale price maintenance and was an anti-competitive practice.  In other words, it allowed suppliers to set a price below which nobody else could sell, thereby allowing them, in effect, to write their own profit margins.</p></speech>

The situation I have outlined was and is not desirable.  We must have a situation where more efficient businesses can compete on price and adopt aggressive price strategies if they so choose.  All of the issues to which the Deputy referred such as suppliers being obliged to pay for shelf space and so on will have to be regulated, which is what we are doing in the Bill.  It seeks to protect suppliers within this process, but it is not seeking to revert to provisions which the Deputy's own leader in government removed because they were not delivering benefits for the consumer.  All these provisions served to do was to allow certain parts of the supply chain to set prices for themselves.  The judgment taken by the Government at the time was that this was not in the interests of consumers.  Therefore, the power then available under legislation to set minimum prices was removed.  We are seeking to ensure there are fair practices within the marketplace and have set out detailed provisions in that regard.  We are not trying to set prices or say what a price should be in the marketplace.  That is not the purpose of any Department.</p></speech>

What we have, however, is not ideal.  Instead, we have a number of large multiples using their size and market power which we cannot measure because we do not know what their profits are to abuse the price relationship between supplier and retailer.  There is no sense in a small business owner trying to negotiate prices with a grower when the large multiple next door has the might of its organisation to do the same.  Of course, it will get a better deal.  It is not a case of the multiple being more efficient but of the smaller operator not having the same resources.</p><p>  In regard to alcohol, I reiterate that there absolutely is a public health demand for a restriction on its use as a loss leader.  We have seen what has happened since it became possible to sell alcohol at any price and in an uncontrolled environment, which is what is happening in supermarkets throughout the country.  I will come back to this issue on Report Stage, even if I have to specify products.  It is time the Minister's Department took the lead on a public health issue instead of waiting to see what changes a health strategy might propose.  The Minister's ideal world in which everybody competes on price and the more efficient businesses secure the better price is not reflective of reality.  The multiples have evaded efforts to discover information on their operations in this country or have some light shone on their financial figures and they are using these figures to abuse their dominance.  They are running the show and calling the shots and this legislation will do nothing to change it.</p></speech>

If we are to introduce public health provisions in respect of the sale of alcohol - I agree that there is a legitimate demand for such because cheap prices do represent a threat to public health - it has to be articulated by the Department of Health, which is what is happening.  That Department is taking a view, for very sound public health reasons, on the proper price and distribution methods, issues to do with advertising and a range of other provisions in regard to the sale of alcohol.  It is doing so in the proper way, by setting out the public health basis for it and presenting its findings to those who understand public health and are qualified to make judgments on public health policy.  That is what is happening and it is the right way to proceed.  It is not for a Department like mine to form judgments about public health issues or others outside its remit.</p> <p>The Department of Health is very alert to the Deputy's specific concerns and I understand it will be introducing a comprehensive strategy to facilitate the putting in place of a range of measures designed to try to contain the level of alcohol abuse which, of course, is a serious problem.  The strategy to which I refer has been set out and the Department has signalled that the legislation necessary to underpin it will be introduced.  That is the way the Government is approaching the matter.</p><p> The Deputy's amendment seeks to use legislation relating to competition in the marketplace to pursue objectives which do not come within the remit of my Department.  While I may be sympathetic to his views, alcohol abuse should be dealt with by the competent authorities and that is what is happening.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, it seems to be practice that in many of these relationships the purchaser and supplier do not necessarily have a contract.  The relationship develops informally and then it gets bad.  If a supplier decides not to have a contract, that is a case of the supplier waiving its right, but it would be agreed and accepted that a contract would exist unless otherwise stated by the supplier.</p></speech>

It should be the case that where that protection is deemed necessary by a supplier, where there is undue pressure, such protection is afforded to them.</p></speech>

Both propose that where a grocery goods undertaking chooses to enter into a contract with a relevant grocery goods undertaking the latter must have a contract with the former for the supply or sale of goods.  I note that there is a difference in the legal framing between the amendments tabled by Deputies T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and Calleary.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's seeks to include the provision under the list of activities on which regulations foreseen by the Bill will be drawn up, while Deputy Calleary's proposal seeks to make it obligatory outside of the regulations as a stand-alone measure.</p><p>  The provisions of the Bill as currently drafted state in section 63B(2)(a) that regulations may specify the form of the contract entered into by the parties.  While I do not want to pre-empt what the final regulations will contain, this section is pivotal to ensuring that situations such as unilateral amendments to terms, retrospective change to terms, etc., are covered by the regulations.  Without a written contract in place it would appear to be impossible to enforce any regulations on issues such as unilateral amendments to terms or retrospective changes of terms.  It is worth noting that the issue of written contracts is a core part of the UK code of practice for this very reason.</p><p>  As regards the suggestion that grocery goods undertakings could decide not to have a contract, this would have a practical effect in that the grocery goods undertaking would have no protection under the regulations.  I am not sure if this is what was intended by the Deputies in their proposal.</p><p>  Finally, there is always the possibility that the effect of the proposal would be that grocery goods undertakings are coerced into opting out of contracts by relevant grocery goods undertakings.  This would leave grocery goods undertakings with no protection under the regulations.  For all of the above reasons, I am not convinced that this is a good idea, and thus my initial reaction is that I would not be in a position to accept the amendments proposed.  However, I am aware that certain sectors would see this as a major issue and, as such, I am prepared to reflect on this before Report Stage.</p></speech>

This amendment seeks to give them the protection of being paid within 30 days, which is a basic right for everybody who submits an invoice.</p></speech>

There is no doubt in my mind that a key pressure point for a supplier is the issue of terms.  We have had the banks and many of the agencies dealing with credit in here and we know that credit flow and the supply of funds and working capital in businesses are a major danger at present, more so now than was ever the case in the deeper times of the recession.  Functioning, profitable and healthy businesses are being pushed to the edge due to the fact that they cannot manage their credit.  I expect that the Government would favour such an amendment.</p></speech>

I believe that the issue of the timeframe for payment should be considered in the context of any regulations rather than in primary legislation, to allow for more flexibility, if required, in any statutory instrument.  Payments are also covered by prompt payment legislation, and this must be factored into any regulations.  Setting out a period of 30 days in primary legislation may be too rigid compared to making regulations and thus, as the text of any regulation is not finalised or agreed, I believe that these amendments are neither required nor appropriate in this Bill.</p></speech>

It is not wrong to expect that people would get paid in time for what they provide.  It is onerous that people would be asked to spend 60 or, in some cases, 90 days waiting for payment for their product.  It retards the development of businesses if they cannot get paid in time.  It has a dampening effect on the economy in general, especially the indigenous economy.  It stops the growth of businesses if they cannot get paid in time and puts many operators out of business.</p></speech>

The reason we are providing for regulations is to allow the flexibility to use this framework, and that is what I will do.  I have indicated that I will bring the draft regulations back to the committee but I do not think we should be seeking to put into primary legislation things that will only unnecessarily restrict the scope of regulations and try to put into an item of primary legislation what is properly for the regulation period.</p></speech>

There is a lacuna at the moment which weakens the position and the amendment seeks to strengthen it.</p></speech>

The courts have also upheld such clauses.  It is one thing for the law to uphold certain forms of retention of title clause freely agreed by contracting parties but quite another for it to insert a mandatory title retention clause into commercial contracts.</p><p>  To the best of my knowledge, no other jurisdiction has introduced a legislative provision of the kind.  The aim of the Bill&rsquo;s provisions on grocery goods is to achieve a proper balance in the commercial relations between supplier and retailer but that should not be done by introducing a potential imbalance into the relationship between the supplier, retailer and other parties.  The proposed amendment would affect the interests of third parties, including the Revenue Commissioners, employees and unpaid service providers who have no equivalent option to take back services that have been provided by reducing the pool of assets available for distribution to other creditors of an insolvent buyer and, effectively, permitting an unpaid seller to jump the queue of creditors.</p><p>  The potential for a retention of title clause to lead to inequity between creditors has in fact led a number of jurisdictions, including the United States, Australia and New Zealand to treat such clauses as a form of security interest against third parties that must be registered by the seller.  The Law Reform Commission proposed a similar system of registration and other conditions regulating retention of title clauses, although its recommendations were not implemented.</p><p>  In its comprehensive report from 2011 on the legislation governing the sale of goods, the sales law review group also concluded that because of their impact on third parties who had no say in the contract, any reform of retention of title clauses had to be considered in the context of a broader reform of the law relating to personal property security interests.  Although I have some sympathy with the aim behind the amendment I am not in a position to accept it.</p></speech>

We know that is not the case.  Ultimately, the person that produces the product should have more rights than the Revenue Commissioners because the Revenue Commissioners are probably chasing them as well for payment they did not get.  I will not press the amendment but I will return to it on Report Stage.  At some time, some country will say to the big multiples that the laws will be different and that it will give the small guy a chance.  Why should we not be that country?</p></speech>

Little by little nation-states are starting to withdraw from proper management of such organisations because the relationship between companies and states are becoming unbalanced.  It seems to me a basic concept that if I own a product and I sell it that I own it until I am paid for it, yet the Minister is shying away from the logic that the property is mine until someone pays for it and he refuses to put it in the legislation.  It would provide security and confidence to suppliers that they have some level of leverage in the process if such a measure were in place.  It seems that the Government is more confident, secure and comfortable siding with the power of large multiples.</p></speech>

The Revenue Commissioners act on behalf of the State.  Other interests that are looked after are employees and unpaid service providers.  They deserve to be protected in the case of a large company getting into financial difficulty and not being able to make payment.  This is a much more complex issue than the little guy versus the big guy.  This has an effect through a fairly complex web of relationships in a supply chain that has others involved.</p><p>  I do not see the compelling argument in the line taken by the Deputies.  Other countries have recognised the situation as well.  I do not see the big gain the amendment would achieve other than in the situation of a company getting into severe problems and then it would erase all the other knock-on effects that are not as straightforward as the Deputies suggest.  I do not think this is an area we should seek to stray into.  What we are trying to do is regulate the relationships between suppliers and the grocery undertakings in the normal course of business.  It is a much wider issue that the Deputies seek to raise and it is not appropriate to the legislation.</p></speech>

There is a number of grounds in the legislation on which the commission can decide not to investigate a complaint and one of them is that there were alternative means of redress available to the complainant.  That is far too vague.  It does not outline those alternatives and it is a very broad area which a commission can seek not to investigate.  My concern is not just that the commission would desire not to investigate a complaint but because of resources, the latitude in which the commission would function would shrink very quickly and, therefore, by default this might be used to explain that shrinkage.</p></speech>

This is just one of four grounds for a decision not to continue with a complaint, the others being on the grounds of frivolous or vexatious complaints, trivial subject matter or the complaint occurred at too remote a time to justify an investigation.</p><p>  While it is not possible to investigate the volume of complaints that might be made in the future, it is vital that the commission is not obliged to investigate every complaint.  Equally, to be effective it will undoubtedly have to prioritise its resources to enforce all of its statutory functions.  I believe that where there is or was an alternative and satisfactory means of redress regarding the conduct complained of, it would be reasonable for the commission to choose in the round not to pursue the investigation of an individual complaint.  The complainant would be advised of the reasons for such a course of action, thus, I am not in a position to accept this amendment.</p></speech>

Given that the attention of the Oireachtas has been gripped by very valuable work carried out by whistleblowers throughout society but most centrally in the justice sector, confidentiality is an important element of getting to the truth.  There is no doubt that a large number of suppliers believe that when they come to the table with real grievances they will be blacklisted and therefore will have fewer opportunities to engage in trade with organisations to protect these individuals.  That barrier to getting to the heart of improper use of power in the market is a logical step to allow for that.  We are not looking to allow for vexatious reporting to the commission.  The commission is well able to identify vexatious reporting but it is important that some level of protection for individuals is afforded.  If the individual wants to make themselves known in the process that should be allowed also but in that case they must be protected from discrimination, disadvantage and unfair treatment into the future.</p></speech>

The commission will have authority under section 63C(2) to initiate an investigation of a relevant goods undertaking on foot of receiving a complaint but it can also do it on its own initiative.  This alternative allows us to investigate independently of the complaint being made.  Equally, the provision to issue a contravention notice making breaches of these orders an offence is intended to allow the commission to enforce regulations without having to base its actions on complaints.  In other words, it can take on something without revealing the identity of the complainant.  I am sure the commission will seek to protect the identity of persons who supply it with information in the first instance in the course of commencing its investigation, and section 23 contains a provision on unauthorised disclosure of confidential information.  However, in terms of someone who gets to an enforcement stage, if the case does not stand on the investigative powers the right of the accused to details of his or her accuser is a core tenet of our Constitution and legal system.  While I understand the rationale for what the Deputy is proposing, we have provided the best protection possible to allow the commission investigate while protecting the anonymity of the complainant but if it stands and falls on the evidence of the complainant, it cannot pursue without that complaint.</p></speech>

I agree that if someone makes a case against one, by the time it gets to court one has a right to know the identity of that individual.  That is the reason the amendment states that when it reaches that stage, protections against discrimination and disadvantage can be dealt with.  The amendment might need to be reworded, and the Minister might come back to it on Report Stage.</p></speech>

The amendment is probably unnecessary in that what is being attempted here is the best that can be done while respecting the constitutional legal system.  The commission will seek to protect the identity of persons and to respect their views but I do not think members should be setting up a compulsion to so do within the legislation.</p></speech>
