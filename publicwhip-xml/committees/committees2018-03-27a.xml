    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-27a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1268" speakername="Pat Deering" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2018032700002#A00300"><p>The meeting has been convened to consider the Revised Estimate for Vote 30 - Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which was referred by the D&aacute;il to the committee with the instruction to report back to the D&aacute;il not later than 19 April 2018.  I welcome the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Michael Creed, and his officials and thank them for attending and for briefing the committee beforehand.  As they are aware, the agriculture, food and marine sectors are in very challenging times, with numerous issues arising from Brexit, climate change, trade and, as we discussed in some detail previously and will hopefully discuss at a later stage, the Common Agricultural Policy.</p><p>In responding to these challenges, the financing and resourcing of the responses in the year ahead is very important.  The committee will get to explore this today with an emphasis on a number of key issues.  The activities of the Department and its agencies include: supporting and protecting animal health; supporting the farming and forestry sectors; finding new markets for Irish products; mitigating the impact of Brexit; ensuring a robust and well resourced seafood sector.</p><p> We will deal with Vote 30 on a programme by programme basis.  The Minister will make an opening statement.  There are four programme areas so we will consider each programme separately with questions from members of the committee.  I remind members and everybody present to ensure their mobile telephones are turned off completely.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against either a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  An advance briefing from the Department on the various programmes has been circulated to members and the committee secretariat.</p><p> I invite the Minister to make his opening statement.  I remind the members that the Minister must leave for a Cabinet meeting at 4.45 p.m.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-27a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2018032700002#B00200"><p>I am pleased to meet with the committee for this valuable opportunity to review our progress and how we are navigating through the current challenges and opportunities presented across the various sectors in agriculture, food development, marine and forestry.</p> <p>  The recently launched National Development Plan 2018-2027 re-affirmed the Government&rsquo;s commitment to protecting and enhancing our rural economy.  Investment in the agrifood sector is required to improve competitiveness, to ensure the maintenance of Ireland&rsquo;s landscape, to improve biodiversity and water quality, to contribute to climate change goals and for the development of our fishery harbour centres.  This capital funding is very important, of course, but the majority of our funding comes through the current part of the Vote.  I am pleased to note that for 2018 our overall allocation increased by 4.5%.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to the agrifood and marine sectors is further demonstrated through budget 2018 recognising the challenges faced by rural communities and the ongoing challenge of Brexit.  In 2018, the Exchequer contribution to the Vote of my Department will amount to &euro;1.557 billion.  This is &euro;1.285 billion in current expenditure and &euro;271.8 million in capital expenditure when a &euro;23.8 million capital carryover is taken into account.  This represents an overall increase of almost &euro;67 million over last year and recognises the role the agrifood sector continues to play in our economic recovery.  In addition to the funding received through the Department's Vote, in 2018 Ireland will receive some &euro;1.2 billion in direct funding from the EU for the basic payment scheme.</p> <p>  The agrifood sector has performed strongly in recent years.  According to statistics from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, exports reached &euro;13.6 billion in 2017.  This represents a 74% increase in agrifood exports since 2009.  Similar to last year, my key focus for 2018 is on maintaining farm payments and protecting vulnerable farm incomes, supporting sustainable farming and jobs in rural and coastal communities and reinforcing the sector to meet the challenges of Brexit.</p> <p>  Turning to rural development, the &euro;4 billion rural development programme for 2014 to 2020 provides vitally important stimulus in the Irish rural economy.  In 2018, a total of &euro;626 million is to be invested in the rural economy, directly to farmers through rural development programme schemes.  I have provided for an increase of &euro;20 million for the capital investment scheme, the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, bringing the total funding available in 2018 to &euro;70 million.  I expect this to be fully spent as payment claims are being submitted on an ongoing basis.  The scheme is open for applications in rolling three month tranches.  There are currently 17,520 applicants following the first nine tranches.  Approvals are issuing on an ongoing basis after the closure of each tranche.  Approvals have now issued to over 13,144 applicants.</p> <p>  The green, low-carbon, agri-environment scheme, GLAS, which is Ireland&rsquo;s flagship agri-environment scheme, provides valuable support to farmers who deliver public goods and environmental benefits that enhance our sustainability credentials.  At the end of December 2017, there were approximately 50,000 active participants in GLAS, of which more than 97% of eligible participants have now received advance payments valued at over &euro;166 million.  Further payments are issuing weekly where all the required validation checks have been successfully passed.  My officials are in contact with farmers to forward outstanding information while also working through remaining more complex cases to facilitate speedy resolution and payment.  A sum of &euro;203 million is allocated for GLAS in 2018.</p> <p>  The sum of &euro;49.5 million will be available for the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, in 2018.  Two tranches of BDGP have been opened and the number of participating applicants is now approximately 24,500.  This scheme puts a focus on placing Ireland at the leading edge globally in the use of genomics in beef production and enhances our reputation as a world leader in sustainable food production.</p> <p>  I have delivered on the programme for a partnership Government commitment and increased the areas of natural constraint, ANC, allocation for 2018.  The &euro;25 million increase will bring the allocation to &euro;227 for a scheme that provides invaluable direct financial support to farmers with land in the many naturally constrained parts of the country.</p> <p>  Turning to forestry, in response to a lower than anticipated take-up of the Department&rsquo;s afforestation scheme in recent years and taking into consideration submissions received from stakeholders as part the mid-term review of the current forestry programme, I was pleased to introduce higher rates and premiums for new forestry planting, with grants increased by 2% to 7% depending on the species category and the premiums for certain categories increased by 5%.  The enhanced measures are designed to promote greater species and habitat diversity with higher grant and premium rates to encourage more broadleaf and diverse conifer planting, while improved grant and premium rates for agro-forestry and forestry for fibre may incentivise farmers to plant forestry on their farm alongside other farming activities.  Forestry may complement the other enterprises on the farm and provide a regular income stream to farmers in the form of the annual forestry premium.</p> <p>  Some &euro;23 million will be also available for payment to some 19,000 participants in knowledge transfer groups in the beef, dairy, equine, sheep, poultry and tillage sectors.  The implementation of the scheme builds on the knowledge and skills base of farmers in key areas and focuses on profitability and sustainability as well as important issues such as farm safety and farm succession planning.</p> <p>  In 2018, &euro;20 million is allocated to the sheep welfare scheme which is targeted at making a meaningful contribution to sheep welfare with particular regard to the production system and the environment in which Irish sheep production takes place.  The scheme was launched in December 2017 with almost 21,000 sheep farmers participating in the first year.  Advance payments for the first year amounting to &euro;16 million have issued to more than 20,600 farmers.  Balancing payments in respect of the first year are due to issue in the second quarter of 2018.  The second year of the scheme has now commenced, with more than 20,000 farmers, including new entrants, continuing to participate in it.</p> <p>  Despite comments to the contrary I am satisfied the full &euro;4 billion committed to the rural development programmes will be fully drawn down and spent.  I have also continued to provide support to forestry, horticulture, the various State agencies under my remit and the horse and greyhound racing fund.</p> <p>  In response to Brexit, the triggering of Article 50 in March 2017 and the ongoing negotiation on the withdrawal of the UK from the EU pose a massive challenge given the importance of the UK market to Ireland&rsquo;s agrifood sector.  The UK is by far our largest trading partner, to which we exported &euro;5.2 billion worth of agrifood products in 2017.  During 2017, with the assistance of additional funding it received, Bord Bia undertook a market prioritisation exercise at the Department&rsquo;s request.  The results of this will help us inform, identify and target suitable new international markets for Irish food and drink in a sector-specific fashion.  This is part of a wider strategy linking the Department&rsquo;s market access efforts to those of agencies such as Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland, and using Ireland&rsquo;s network of embassies as a hub, to develop the profile of Ireland&rsquo;s food sector and to improve access to a wider range of markets worldwide.</p> <p>  Since the Brexit decision, my Department has placed great emphasis on enhancing its own capacity and that of Bord Bia in the area of market diversification and new market access.  Following the extra &euro;10 million that I allocated to Bord Bia since the Brexit vote, I secured a further &euro;4.5 million in budget 2018 to assist the agency in its promotional and developmental work overseas.  This funding is to support food and drink companies facing Brexit challenges with market diversification measures, including providing companies with access to local expertise in international markets.  Through the market prioritisation exercise, recently published by Bord Bia and funded by my Department, we will together identify and target other suitable new international markets for Irish food and drink, in a sector-specific fashion, to which I will lead missions later in the year.  This extra funding will also allow Bord Bia to employ additional staff, some of whom will be based abroad, in line with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s global footprint initiative to double the Team Ireland footprint on the international stage by 2025.</p><p>Bord Bia has developed a four pillar strategy - managing volatility, obtaining consumer and marketing insight, deepening customer engagement and extending market reach - to provide companies with market research, advice and support.  An additional &euro;2 million allocated in 2017 - adding to the extra &euro;1.6 million allocated in 2016 - enabled Bord Bia to undertake new activities, including an export marketing strategy programme to help companies to maintain and grow positions in the UK and-or diversity market reach; research to identify priority market opportunities; participation in three new trade fairs in Asia; and increased presence at key shows such as Gulf Food where the space doubled and Anuga in Germany.  Bord Bia is also planning to almost double its draw down of EU promotion funds to &euro;1.9 million, mainly for activities focused on China.  </p><p> Following on from the market prioritisation exercise, I led a trade mission to Japan and the Republic of Korea in November 2017.  This followed trade missions in 2017 to China, Singapore, north Africa, the Gulf States, the US and Mexico.  In addition, the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, led a trade mission to Vietnam and the Republic of Korea earlier in the year.  For 2018, a programme of ministerial trade missions has commenced with a trade mission to the US and Canada in February 2018.  A further trade mission will take place in May to China and Hong Kong.  </p><p> In 2018, the &euro;241 million European maritime and fisheries fund operational programme is expected to be fully operational with a total of 19 schemes and a budget of approximately &euro;55 million made available across my Department and its agencies.  This investment will fund a range of programmes, including capital investment in seafood processing and our harbours, aquaculture and fishing sectors to foster growth in production, value and employment; enhance sustainability and competitiveness; and support training, skills development and stakeholder capacity development.  I have also made &euro;87 million in funding available for the food safety animal and plant health work performed by the Department.  It is important to remain vigilant and defend our health status and keep our food standards at the very leading edge.  </p><p> This is a brief overview of the range of measures that apply in the agrifood and marine sectors for 2018.  I look forward to the discussion and questions from committee members.  </p></speech>

We will try to stick to each programme if at all possible.  In posing questions, members should clearly state the subhead to which they are referring so that it is easier to deal with the matter and to limit their questions to one subhead at a time allowing us to get as much value as possible out of the time space we have.  The first programme is food safety, animal and plant health and animal welfare.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-27a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1339" speakername="Marcella Corcoran Kennedy" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2018032700002#C00300"><p>I thank the Minister for his presentation.  In respect of the context and impact indicators, it looks really positive in terms of the control we have over food safety and animal safety and welfare.  I noticed that we are very lucky we had zero major food safety incidences.  The figures are all going in the right direction.  Is the Minister satisfied that this will continue to be the case in terms of our investment in it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-27a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1350" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2018032700002#C00400"><p>I do not know if it is the correct heading under which to raise this question.  Today in the farming press, we saw a frightening headline about the number of farm animals that are entering knackeries.  I suppose it has been the worst spring I can remember in my time farming.  It has been the worst and longest winter and the worst spring.  We have had flooding, snow and high winds.  We should have been promoting a subsidy for concentrates instead of the subsidy for transport.  At this stage, fodder is virtually non-existent even if the weather improved tomorrow morning.  Unfortunately, the forecast for the next week to ten days is anything but pleasant.  Are there any plans to introduce a concentrate subsidy that would address some of the animal welfare issues on the ground?  It does not do our industry's image any good to see headlines like those we saw today in the paper.  There are serious problems out there.  Even on what we would call intensive farms, there is a serious shortage of feed at this stage.  As I was driving up today, I do not think I saw one herd of cows out in the fields this morning so there is a serious problem.  A subsidy for concentrate at this time could be a major help in alleviating the welfare problems.</p></speech>

Will the Minister comment on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-27a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2018032700002#C00800"><p>On the general issue of food safety and animal health in programme one, it is probably not widely recognised that this constitutes the key activity of the Department in terms of resources and personnel.  Because there is so much at stake in the context of our international reputation, we are constantly engaged in supervision and inspections to ensure that we continue to operate at the highest standards in terms of animal welfare and food safety.  I am satisfied that we have adequate resources available.  I commend all of the staff involved because the Department, the agrifood sector and farmers engaged in husbandry on a daily basis all have a vested interest in ensuring our international reputation is maintained at the highest possible level.  As a food island that exports more than 90% of what we produce, we need to be able to stand over that.  In respect of our commitment to excellence all along the food chain in terms of food safety and animal welfare, these are issues where the marketplace is increasingly demanding that we have a fully transparent system of the highest standards.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Cahill, there is an increase in the allocation for fallen animals in 2018.  I know the report in the newspapers to which the Deputy refers.  The detail of that coverage made reference to Storm Emma and animals, particularly sheep, still being identified as casualties of that.  I acknowledge there were issues around that which have given rise to increased numbers of fallen animals.  It has been a difficult winter.  There is no point in saying otherwise and it is certainly dragging on now.  The Department is acutely aware of grass growth and is tracking it almost on a daily basis and looking at forecasts.  As we head towards 1 April, I accept there are many farmers who are anxiously awaiting a growth spurt in grass.  However, there is an issue around the individual responsibility of farmers and the level of stocking density, particularly in the dairy sector where we have very rapid expansion.  Each farmer needs to take account of their own responsibilities in terms of making sure they have adequate fodder provision.  What I suspect is the case is that whatever shoulder or head room that was there over the past winter in terms of carryover of fodder from previous years will have been virtually exhausted in this late spring.  This puts a clear obligation on individual farmers to make sure in the coming months that they do not replenish just an adequate level of fodder.  We are looking at variations of how extensive a winter can be but on average, we have four to five months of winter.  We need to make sure there is adequate fodder and some head room to take account of exceptional weather events.  The headlong rush to increase numbers, particularly in the dairy sector, probably has been at the expense of some of that capacity to provide additional fodder on farms.  Individual farmers need to take stock of this.</p><p>It strikes me that while we all celebrate increased dairy output, we should not lose track of individual responsibility to ensure adequate fodder provision on farms.  We have been through the debate on fodder schemes, transport subsidies and so forth and Deputies have their views on a ration subsidy.  The ultimate responsibility rests with individual farmers.  In exceptional circumstances, the State will make some efforts in this area, as it has done this year.  Individual farmers need to be cognisant of the carrying capacity on their holding, taking account of the level of fodder they require.  I am sure Deputy Jackie Cahill, as an active farmer, will acknowledge that in some instances the rapid expansion in numbers has been at the expense of the capacity to provide adequate fodder for exceptional weather events such as those we have been experiencing recently. </p><p> On tuberculosis, I understand the number of cases has started to plateau but I will revert to the Deputy with detailed figures.  Subject to correction, it is my recollection that where there has been a decline in herd incidence as a result of the increasing average herd size.  While there may have been an increase in the number of animals affected, the number of herds affected has not increased.  I have just been provided with some information on the incidence of tuberculosis.  In 2017, a total of 2,180 herds were affected. </p></speech>

Does he continue to maintain that position?  I am interested in his assessment of the current position regarding fodder.  I understand approximately nine applications have been made for the fodder transport subsidy.  Does the Minister accept the scheme was a folly and the Department's approach was misplaced?  On the one hand, the introduction of the scheme was a recognition that we have a problem while, on the other, the scheme was counter-productive in terms of achieving its objective of addressing the problem of supply of grass based fodder.  Instead of stretching supply in the country, which was the overall objective of the scheme, the scheme would have increased demand for grass based fodder and resulted in fodder being transferred from one area to another.  The scheme has clearly not worked.</p> <p>  Spring is late this year and given the cold weather forecast for Easter, it is possible it will be much later than usual, which places us in a tricky position.  As I have repeatedly pointed out, agricultural advisers have been advising farmers to focus on concentrates, whereas the Department's approach has been to focus on grass based fodder.  We have reached a pinch point in that there is no grass based fodder available and even areas where it was available are coming under pressure.  As Deputies will have noted from reports from around the country, the price of concentrates is increasing owing to demand.  Does the Minister accept there is a crisis?  Does he also accept that the scheme he introduced had no head or tail?</p></speech>

My net message is that it is a matter for individual farmers to ensure they have an adequate supply of fodder.  There are two ways of interpreting the data in respect of the initiative the Department introduced.  However, it is too early to draw conclusions.  It may be the case that further applications will be submitted by farmers who are getting on with the business associated with spring time on their holdings.  It is also possible that the number of applications will not increase.  I acknowledge that this is an exceptionally difficult spring on holdings.  The difficulties are not geographically confined to the north west and are now an issue on the entire island.  We are monitoring the issue daily in terms of grass growth predictions, weather forecasts, etc., and we will take into account the advice from State agencies, including Teagasc, on what steps it may be appropriate to take.  At this stage, we do not plan any initiatives of the type suggested by the Deputy in the context of the difficult weather we are experiencing.</p></speech>

It was not involved in a prescriptive manner in the initiative the Department subsequently formulated.  As I stated, we continue to monitor the national position.</p></speech>

It is a roll of the dice now as to how long the spring may be.  The Minister must be much more proactive than simply monitoring the position daily.  One step he could take would be to review the transport subsidy scheme as it is counter-productive.  If it becomes necessary to help subsidise the transport of grass based fodder, it will be to subsidise the importation of additional fodder, rather than the transport of an already scarce resource around the country.  As Deputy Cahill argued, a concentrates based scheme for those who are under significant pressure is the type of support required from the Department.  That is the advice farmers should be following and many are certainly doing so at the farm gate.  It is not the approach taken by the Department, however.  Has the Department provided for a contingency fund in the Revised Estimate to support a fodder scheme if the position does not quickly improve?</p></speech>

I return to my original point that this is, in the first instance, a matter for farmers to resolve.  We have introduced a transport subsidy which is available in certain circumstances.  That was the appropriate response at the time and we continue to monitor the position closely.  The shortage of fodder is much more acute across the country now than it was when this issue arose.  However, as we head into the late spring, growth rates should, in the normal course of events, deliver the solution that is required.  We continue to monitor the position.  While we have not identified any funding in the 2018 Estimate to fund an initiative, if circumstances require them, resources will not be an issue.</p></speech>

There was not one blade of grass on either side of the road.  The fact is cattle have been housed since last September.  We need to be aware that is why the knackeries are full.  The lorries are on the road now day and night to take dead animals from farmers.  It has been said it is being monitored.  The time for monitoring is gone because there is not a blade of grass growing anywhere.  The Minister has to realise that.  I saw a small bit of grass to the west of the town of Macroom, but nowhere else.  There is none in Kerry or in Kildare and farmers backs are to the wall.  Cattle will not know what the open air is like because they have been inside for so long now.</p><p> Dairymen are hit in particular because they cannot raise the protein content in the milk without grass.  They will be down five or six cent per litre.  That is a fact.  Where I come from, suckler farmers provide the beef for the country.  I refer to Kerry and all along the west coast.  They will not survive if they do not get some subsidy, as the Deputies here said, or some form of assistance.  Their backs are to the wall.  They have nothing.  They are broke, and mentally and physically worn out because it has been the longest time ever that the cattle have been inside.  I never remember a winter as long.  Look at the ground today.  It would take two or three weeks for it to grow, if it started growing today.  However, we have more snow forecast for next weekend.  I am appealing to the Minister to listen to us because farmers were never in a worse place.</p></speech>

We continue to monitor the situation.  We are approaching 1 April and, normally, we would expect that grass growth would be ahead of where it is now and that would deliver a solution.  I accept that the forecast for the weekend is for cold weather and that is worrying.  However, we continue to monitor the situation on an ongoing basis with a view, if required, to taking appropriate action.  However, at this stage, we do not have a plan for any initiative.</p></speech>

The green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, is the one we have been talking about for the past 12 months.  Quite a number of farmers are still waiting to get their payments.  I am also looking at the sheep welfare scheme which was successful to an extent.  Are there any plans to broaden that out and make any increase?  The sheep sector has a lot of potential but it needs support.  I am conscious that one of the only ways that it can get that at the moment, at least until some work is done on markets to try to increase prices, is to put some more money into that scheme.  I know that may include additional actions on behalf of the farmer and that is something that has been talked about for some time.  Are there any plans to increase that scheme and make something more of it?</p> <p>  There has also been a lot of talk for some time in respect of the whole issue around suckler cows, where that is going and the beef data genomics scheme and trying to broaden that out to include some kind of suckler welfare scheme into it.  Everyone talks about the &euro;200 cow target.  I would like some assurance that there is at least some consideration in respect of that.  While the beef data genomics scheme has been successful to some extent, many farmers still find it very complex and difficult to manage.  While it has had some successes, there are still issues.  The big one that farmers are looking for is some kind of support around husbandry in respect of the suckler cow and getting something in place which would increase those payments.</p></speech>

There is an ambitious programme to increase the number of farmers operating the organics farming scheme.  Is the Minister happy that we are on target to get to the figures we are hoping for or is there potential to increase that?  Linked to that, in respect of protein plants, I note the European Parliament recently adopted a protein and leguminous plant strategy.  I wonder is there potential in this country for us to increase the number of protein plants our farmers are growing?  It strikes me that they would be useful for human and animal consumption.</p> <p>  I also have a question in respect of the areas of natural constraint, ANCs.  When the review will be complete and will there be an increase in the budget there?  It seems that there is not.  The Minister might update me on that.  Forestry is crucial for us in respect of mitigating our carbon levels.  Are we satisfied with the amount of plantings that we have or is there potential to improve on that?  I refer in particular to broad leaves in particular. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-27a.38" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1350" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2018032700002#E00700"><p>I wish to raise three different sectors.  One is the beef sector.  We had a Private Members' Bill a couple of weeks ago on the suckler cow and the need for a payment.  However, as has been said a few times, we are approaching 1 April and the beef price now is probably fractionally below where it was in November and December.  How are beef finishers going to survive and stay in business with the price return that they are getting?  Our whole beef sector, which is a huge contributor to the overall economy, is under serious pressure from the man with the suckler cow to the man finishing the cattle.  Some serious money is needed.  On top of that, we have the challenge of Brexit and Mercosur is again raising its head.  The concessions being made on the Mercosur deal are going to make a bad situation even worse.  However, traditionally beef prices always went on a steady graph from Christmas to 1 June.  If anything now, the graph is going downwards at the moment.  How is this sector going to survive?  I appreciate there is some funding being given to Bord Bia in the context of Brexit but all the challenges facing that sector are absolutely immense.</p> <p>  On designated land, and in particular I refer to the hen harrier areas, a launch of a scheme was announced in late 2017.  However, the view among farmers with designated land is that this scheme is wholly inadequate to restore the value of their land.  At the stroke of a pen, Brussels took away the value of the land of these farmers.  If a scheme is to be meaningful in these areas of natural constraint, it has to be able to restore that land to its rightful value.  The scheme announced in 2017 is seriously underachieving in that respect and we have representations here from various groups.  There definitely needs to be more resources put into that scheme.  A properly funded scheme has to be put in place for these farmers who have been severely discriminated against with their land being designated.  It does not seem to be in the 2018 Estimates.</p> <p>  The hill ewes have been referred to again as a sector that faces land abandonment in certain areas.  However, the Estimates for 2017, in the animal welfare scheme for sheep, has an increase of &euro;3 million for 2018.  I would like an explanation of where that extra &euro;3 million is going to be spent.  My understanding is that the scheme is not open to new entrants at the moment.  I refer to the discrepancy in the figures between one year and another.</p><p>Especially with hill ewes, we have to try to get extra funding for them in order to avoid land abandonment.  I could go into other sectors.  The challenges facing the beef sector, which are immense, designated land and hill ewes are the three sectors on which I would like to focus.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-27a.40" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1244" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2018032700002#F00200"><p>To follow on from Deputy Cahill's final point where he raised the issue of why there is &euro;20 million assigned for the sheep welfare scheme this year and &euro;17 million next year, I note that the number of herd owners participating in the animal welfare scheme for sheep was 33,000 last year but only 23,000 this year.  Deputy Cahill asked why it did not add up.  There is a &euro;3 million increase in the budget for a scheme that is not paying a different rate this year compared to last year.  The metrics show that 10,000 fewer are expected to participate in it this year, which is baffling.  There is a drop in the sheep number as well, from 2.5 million to 2 million.</p> <p>  With regard to the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, when that was announced by the Minister's predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, he committed to &euro;1.45 billion going towards GLAS over its duration.  It was very specifically for GLAS.  He also indicated that it would be within the current rural development programme period.  The figure of those within GLAS and the average spend would indicate that the spend will be &euro;1 billion.  Where is the Minister with the &euro;1.45 billion that was committed with GLAS?  How close does the Minister expect to get to it?  I cannot see the Minister getting anymore than &euro;1 billion.  The maths do not add up.  I would like the Minister to address that in detail.  If he is not spending that &euro;450 million extra on GLAS, he might indicate what else he has spent it on in the meantime.  I certainly do not see it.</p> <p>  I endorse the point made by Deputy Cahill on the plight of the suckler sector and the need for additional contributions to try to make sure that there is a margin for beef and suckler farmers.  It is simply not there and it is not sustainable.  With regard to the current beef data and genomics programme, we have to find a way to provide additional funds towards that to try to keep an increased payment within this current Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, programme.  We now have the wider task to which the D&aacute;il has agreed, namely, to seek to achieve something along the lines of &euro;200 in the next CAP.  I have one final point on the beef data and genomics programme.  Would the Minister consider reopening that?  Initially, it was indicated that up to 35,000 farmers could apply for it.  We currently have 25,000, 10,000 fewer than was indicated could be accommodated.  Will the Minister address that, please?</p></speech>

These farmers are now described as "hobby farmers".  I know what they have to go through because we do it ourselves.  Between calving cows in the middle of the night, losing calves and all that goes with it, breeding them and trying to have the right bulls, these suckler cow farmers are not even breaking even now.  That is the gospel truth.  They come to marts in Macroom, Kenmare, Cahirciveen, Milltown and Castleisland.  They do such a good job.  They rear the cattle and feed them to the highest standards.  They go home with their tails between their legs because when they do up their figures, they are not balancing the books.  I appeal to the Minister to do something to ensure that these fellows can keep their operations because if they get out of them, they will not go back to them.  The Minister should remember that.  If they get out of cows and reduce their numbers, they will not go back.  They are sending the beef, as we know, up the country, where they are fattened and moved into the factories.  The supply comes from all along the west coast, although maybe some people up here might not understand or realise it.  The fact is the suckler cow can be found all along to the west coast but the sector is under immense pressure.  We are not telling lies; it is the truth.  It was written the other day that these are "hobby farmers" and that will not continue.</p> <p>  We have spoken about the hen harrier before.  If the Minister cannot pay for a proper compensation scheme and cannot compensate these farmers, just forget about it and disband it.  As I said before, it is like wanting to rob people's houses or beat up old people.  It is very bad.  It is daylight robbery to reduce the value of a person's farm, whether a man or a woman.  I appeal to the Minister to forget about it if he cannot pay them.  He should pay as he goes and if he does not pay, do not go.</p> <p>  There is another section of farmers which I think the Minister knows about.  They are farmers who are being deprived of their payments this year because commonages were burned.  I know the people who are involved in, and who own, the commonages.  They fought hard to stop the fires and called the fire brigade but lo and behold, all their payments are held up and that is not fair.  In one case, the fire did not start on their land and they do not know how it started.  In other cases, they had nothing to do with it.  I appeal to the Minister to look at this issue because two things will happen.  Farmers will become very annoyed if they have people walking through their land and they are not sure whether a fire will start.  What will they do?  They will make sure by locking the gate and keeping them out.  Kerry is a tourist county.  It will have very serious repercussions for the tourism industry if farmers, such as these, are denied their payments.  I ask the Minister to look at this issue.  What has happened is wrong but it can be put right.  It is like arresting a fellow for robbing the pub in the village but the fellow was not in the village at all that night.  It imposes 100% penalties on these people and takes their payments.  Some of these people had nothing for Christmas.  They were expecting a few bob for Christmas but they got nothing.  That is God's gospel truth.</p> <p>  There is another anomaly that has affected a good few people with the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, payments, where one is entitled to get a certain amount.  I will give an example of a person who purchased a vacuum slurry tank.  Since he borrowed the money from a finance company, a hire purchase and leasing company, he will not get his grant.  Some &euro;26,000 or &euro;27,000 out of the &euro;40,000 has gone on this.  He will get no grant.  He was entitled to &euro;10,500.  He did not understand it and the leasing company should have told him.  It is very wrong when this happens to a family like this.  These are bad times on many farms.  They were depending on this money to keep them going.  They borrowed from a leasing company rather than a bank and the tanker is in the leasing company's name.  They did not understand that and were not made aware of it by the leasing company.  There are several such cases.</p><p>They are paying for the tanker every month, but they will not get their grant because of this simple but unfortunate anomaly.  I ask the Minister to do something to ensure that this does not happen again and that awareness is raised among the farming fraternity that they are not to do that.  However, some leeway or assistance should be given to the people who find themselves in this unfortunate position.</p></speech>

There is no undue delay.  As in Deputy Danny Healy-Rae's case, if the Chairman knows of any individual case we will certainly investigate it.</p> <p>  I will answer questions in no particular order.  On the issue of the sheep scheme, which Deputy McConalogue and others raised, in the context of the difference between the 2017 and 2018 provisions, as I understand it, we paid the advance in 2017.  That balancing payment for the 2017 scheme will be paid in 2018, as well as providing for whatever level of liability we will have in 2018 on the current applications.  The provision is ramping up over 2017 because we did not pay a full scheme in 2017; we paid an advance of the scheme.</p> <p>  Deputy Martin Kenny raised the prospect of doing more in that regard.  These schemes are designed and approved by the European Commission on the basis of costs incurred or income forgone so if we were minded, and we must bear in mind that in the rural development programme, RDP, there is not any head room in terms of additional expenditure, to so do in terms of making additional funding available under the sheep welfare scheme, it would have to be for actions carried out by the individual farmer.</p> <p>  I accept the point Deputy makes.  This is a sector that stood in line for quite a while.  This scheme has been welcomed in respect of its simplicity for farmers to be compliant with and, generally speaking, it is money that is overdue.  We will be paying the balancing payment of that 2017 advance in the second quarter of this year and, as he is aware, we opened the scheme for this year to new entrants also, and I believe we are budgeting for in the region of 20,000 applicants for 2018.  We originally provided &euro;25 million.  That was on the basis of 2.5 million ewes at &euro;10 a ewe.  We did not get all the applicants, even when we reopened the scheme in 2018.</p></speech>

That opportunity has passed.  In truth, our problem with the RDP, and I can deal with this in greater detail, is that our Estimate is that we will overspend on it by approximately &euro;106 million over the lifetime of the programme.  If we take areas of natural constraint, ANC, liabilities into account, it could be more.  Cumulatively, it could amount to an overspend of up to &euro;300 million.</p> <p>  What is not widely recognised, and I did not want to get into this response now, is that when the 2014 to 2020 RDP was being launched, we had a liability of almost &euro;600 million carried forward from the previous RDP.  Given that there is much debate now on how the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, will be funded, and the level of funding that will be available to member states post-2020, it would be imprudent to load additional liabilities onto the next CAP when we do not know the level of funding that will be available for that.  Currently, our projections are for an overspend of substantial amounts, so we do not have the head room to consider additional expenditure.</p> <p>  I want to deal with the other points raised-----</p></speech>

Not all of them applied, so the liability ended up at approximately &euro;20 million.  In 2017, we paid an advance on that.  The balancing liability will be paid in the second quarter of 2018.</p> <p>  On Deputy Corcoran Kennedy's point about organics, we have approximately 1,740 farmers in the organic scheme.  That is a higher level of beneficiaries than we ever had previously and it was as a result of an open call for people to apply, and we took in everybody who applied at that stage.  Originally, in the rural development programme going back to 2015, we under-provisioned on the liability but we took in everybody who applied, and we have had to increase the provision for it.  We envisaged a budget in the region of &euro;56 million for the organic scheme and I believe we are now providing in the region of &euro;66 million because we took in everybody who applied.</p> <p>  It is one of those sectors where there is an insatiable demand at a consumer level for organic products, both domestically and internationally.

There is almost an insatiable demand for organic products on the dairy side and on the tillage side as well, but that is our commitment in terms of organics.</p> <p>  The Deputy also raised a point about protein crops.  Under the Common Agricultural Policy, we currently provide approximately &euro;3 million for protein crops.  I believe we grow approximately 14,000 ha mostly beans.  The Deputy might have seen Commissioner Hogan make some comments recently about Europe's dependency on imported protein crops.  A substantial volume of that is genetically modified, GM, protein crops.  Of the protein crops we import, and off the top of my head I believe we import about 2 million tonnes of protein for animal feed, most of it is GM.  There is a substantial opportunity for import substitution, both here and in the European Union.  The Commission is looking at publishing a paper on plant proteins by the end of 2018 and I hope that will lead to a new initiative from the Commission, perhaps via the CAP, and reduce our exposure to both imported and GM proteins, which would be a significant step in the right direction.</p> <p>  On the issue of GLAS payments, there are marginally less than 50,000 applicants, and 97% or 98% of those have been paid.  There are 2,900 cases remaining and, of those, 1,600 are a matter for the participant to resolve.  They relate to issues ranging from rare breed forms, low emissions slurry spreading forms, basic payment scheme, BPS, errors needing clarification, nutrient management plans and a range of other issues that are within the scope of the applicant to resolve before the Department can process them.  The others are issues the Department is working through.</p><p>We are dealing with the final core of the scheme.  One should bear in mind that 97% to 98% of applicants have already been paid.  The last ones involve difficult circumstances such as dual claims and other such issues.  The majority of the outstanding cases are ones which the applicant must resolve.  It is highly likely as well that we will see a number of applications where the applicant is no longer actively involved in the scheme and has walked away from it without notifying the Department.  We are dealing with that core now and trying to bring it to a conclusion.  We are paying applicants as they are cleared.  There is no undue delay.</p></speech>

Each individual case throws up a range of different issues.  One might be mapping issues.  Another might be actions on individual plots that the applicant is seeking to opt out of.  All those cases require individual attention.  They are not routine in their presentation and they require either the applicant to provide further information or the Department to work through all the issues with them as a consequence of the applicant feeding back information to the Department.  There is no undue delay on the Department's side in paying people.</p> <p>  Other issues that were raised include areas of natural constraint, ANC.  As Deputy Corcoran Kennedy is aware, we benefitted from a decision at EU level to extend the time period for a review of the disadvantaged areas scheme on a range of criteria set down by the Commission on bio-physical criteria.  The new deadline is that we must have that completed by the time farmers make their applications for the basic payment scheme in 2019.  That breathing space has given us more time and the work is under way.  We have given a commitment that in due course there will be an engagement with stakeholders and landowners involved in the process.</p> <p>  In terms of afforestation levels, we have just completed a mid-term review of the forestry programme and that has seen an upwards revision of the afforestation payments and premiums.  We would like to see a higher level of afforestation, in particular a higher level of hardwood afforestation.  The changes are with a view to trying to drive it further.  That is critical from the point of view of our climate change obligations.  In total, we are spending in the region of &euro;103 million or &euro;104 million on the forestry programme for 2018, which is a very substantial commitment from the Exchequer.  It is not an EU-funded scheme but we are very anxious to increase our afforestation levels.</p> <p>  The first thing to be said on the hen harrier scheme is that there is significant farmer interest in the revised scheme.  Already, more than 1,000 applicants have submitted applications.  One should bear in mind that those with designated hen harrier lands are entitled to GLAS and GLAS Plus.  I always say to those who make the point Deputy Cahill made - I did so even when I was on the opposite side of the table - that the solution to the range of issues those landowners have, and I have considerable sympathy for them, is not a single silver bullet in terms of a hen harrier scheme.  It was always meant to be a combination of GLAS, GLAS Plus, the hen harrier scheme and the third piece of the jigsaw was the threat response plan on the current blanket restriction on afforestation.  I hope that third part will go the extra bit to restore income opportunities for those landowners.  That is something that is on the way.  There is a &euro;25 million commitment in the rural development programme for the hen harrier scheme and a combination of those schemes will deliver a solution.</p> <p>  In terms of the suckler cow scheme, I appreciate the point made in the recent D&aacute;il debate.  However, what was not clearly articulated in the motion is whether people are talking about a &euro;200 payment per suckler cow on every suckler cow and how it would be funded at a time when all our policy initiatives have been on increasing the genetic merit of the herd.  Are we not in danger of standing accused of a lack of joined-up thinking if on the other hand we have a campaign that is merely about driving numbers in the herd at a time when we face challenges around methane emissions in terms of climate change obligations?  I take my responsibility seriously in terms of trying to deliver the maximum possible income opportunities to the beef sector.  One of the most innovative things to happen in that endeavour, which may have been at a time when a colleague of Deputy McConalogue's was Minister, was that we decoupled and said we would make the payment without the obligation to have the numbers.  We said we would make the payment on the basis of a farmer having the minimum stocking density for ANC payments.  That would allow farmers to make economic decisions.  If we chose the option of making a coupled payment we would be then reverting back to obliging farmers to keep any old stripper or suckler cow for the purposes of the payment, regardless of the quality.  I do not think anybody could argue such a move would be to go in the right direction, regardless of the resources we can secure.  We are clearly challenged in the context of the rural development programme but in the context of whatever additional resources we can secure in the next CAP I think it should be delivered to farmers with the aim of continuing the journey of improving the genetic merit of the herd and liberating farmers from the obligation to stack numbers and delivering the best opportunity to them in that context.  That is something to which I am committed.</p> <p>  Deputy McConalogue raised the issue of GLAS and the reference to &euro;1.4 billion at the time of the announcement of the GLAS scheme.  I alluded to some of the rationale behind this earlier when I was talking about the incurred liability of &euro;600 million the current rural development programme inherited from the previous rural development programme.  Part of that was around the issue of liabilities under AEOS and the REP scheme, both of which had substantial numbers of farmers working through their contract at that time.  It would have been nice if they had all jumped ship on day one and said they would go to the new GLAS scheme but they did not and they had an entitlement to work out their existing contract and then to switch over to GLAS.  We inherited a liability.  What was envisaged was that of the &euro;1.4 billion, GLAS would incur a liability of &euro;990 million and REPS-AEOS transitional payments from the previous rural development programme would be in excess of &euro;300 million.  Cumulatively, it came to approximately &euro;1.38 billion, almost &euro;1.4 billion.  That has been clarified for the Deputy in response to numerous parliamentary questions in terms of GLAS, AEOS and REPS.  They are all agri-environmental schemes.  There is no pot of gold there, regrettably, in terms of underspend that can be redeployed elsewhere.  There was a liability.  I am sure the Deputy is not suggesting that we should have cut the farmers adrift and said we would not pay them.  There was a liability for AEOS and REPS.  There was a liability on GLAS and the target was 50,000 applicants and we got the 50,000 applicants.  I think the commitment is around &euro;250 million a year at the moment in that space.  I appreciate the point Deputy McConalogue made.  He hankers back understandably to that press statement on &euro;1.4 billion.  It is &euro;1.4 billion but that is a combination of GLAS and inherited liabilities from the previous rural development programme.</p></speech>

It is crystal clear and it is in black and white in the Government's own commitments.  When the GLAS scheme was announced it was clearly committed by the then Minister, Deputy Coveney, on behalf of the Government that it would be &euro;1.45 billion on GLAS over the course of the rural development programme.  That was crystal clear.  That is what he promised in his press conference, but following on from that, all the farming media put up in big headlines that it was what the Government would deliver, understandably so, because that is what the Government promised.  The Minister cannot come in here four or five years later and say the Government did not really mean that, and that the money was earmarked for historical commitments rather than the GLAS scheme.  That is unacceptable.  That is just having people on.  That is taking money out of people's hands - out of farmers' hands.  That is what the Minister has done here.</p><p> I would like the Minister to address that.  That is what was promised at the time, and that is &euro;450 million short of the Government's progress today. </p></speech>

There was a GLAS element to it and there was an inherited liability which could have switched to GLAS.  They could have switched to GLAS but those concerned decided to exercise their entitlement to work out their existing contracts.  Either way we would have been obliged to pay.  Our commitment under GLAS is nearly &euro;1 billion, and the balance is accounted for by those individuals working out their entitlements under their previous AEOS or  REPS contracts.  If they had exercised the opportunity to switch over to GLAS, we would not be arguing this.  This is an exercise in optics.  We have met the target of 50,000 participants, and we have honoured all of our obligations under GLAS, AEOS and REPS.</p></speech>

Spending of &euro;1.45 billion was promised, absolutely crystal clearly.  The Government made no bones about it.  It was promised very clearly by the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney.  It was not qualified in any way.  In fact, there was no room for qualification in what he said.  When he met the farming organisations and talked to the press, he doubled down and was very clear in that.</p></speech>

People did not join GLAS just in the first year.  They have joined GLAS 2 and GLAS 3.  I am the current incumbent.  Deputy McConalogue may well be the person who is facing these questions in due course.  I note that Deputy Jackie Cahill also has ambitions to that position.  Deputy McConalogue is surely not saying that he or Deputy Cahill would not honour the GLAS 3 applicants, who had a legitimate expectation of a five-year contract when they joined the scheme?  When people joined AEOS or REPS, they had a legitimate expectation that their full contracts would be honoured.  We did honour them, to the tune of more than &euro;600 million across the entire rural development programme, RDP.  That was the right thing to do.  It was a liability that we inherited from the rural development programme that Deputy McConalogue's party negotiated.  It is right that those GLAS applicants who joined most recently have their contracts honoured.  At the core of what Deputy McConalogue is suggesting is the idea that we should not have honoured them.  The parties to those schemes could have switched to GLAS on day one and become GLAS participants, but they chose not to.  That was their entitlement.  The commitment was &euro;1.4 billion, and in fact we will marginally exceed that.  We will spend &euro;1.44 billion under agri-environmental schemes.  Call them GLAS, REPS, AEOS or whatever one will.  They are contracts the Department is bound to honour.</p></speech>

The Government should be honest with farmers at all times.  I am also saying that it was absolutely dishonest in this instance.  On the GLAS scheme, the Minister refers to commitments running up to 2022, the point when everyone who is currently in GLAS will be out of it.  By the time everybody is out of GLAS in 2022, just under &euro;1 billion will have been spent on the scheme.  If Deputy Cahill or I were to launch a scheme afterwards, anyone would expect us to be up-front with farmers.  They would expect us to indicate what is the remaining commitment from previous schemes, and what will be the commitment for new schemes.  Deputy Coveney indicated with great fanfare what the Government's commitment for a new scheme was going to be -  &euro;1.45 billion.  Deputy Creed expects to sally in here three or four years later and say the Government did not really mean that.  We can just wash away the &euro;450 million shortfall, because even though the then Minister told everybody that, he did not mean it.  He was thinking something else.</p></speech>

The authority's personnel are not able to board those vessels.  It is a serious issue as the smaller vessels seem to get all the attention while the bigger ships, which can do multiples of the level of damage to our seafood stocks, are almost ignored.  It is difficult as I am not sure if we have the ability to board, search and properly monitor those ships.  Is there anything we can do to try to make a better effort, at least?</p></speech>

There is quite a significant combined effort between the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, and the Naval Service in monitoring all compliance with fishing legislation by both Irish and other EU member state boats in our territorial waters.  The figures for boarding and checking of compliance would surprise people, not just with respect to Irish boats but international boats as well.  We have a different profile of our industry here and we have more medium boats.  As many other countries have privatised the quotas asset, there are fewer and bigger factory ships.  These attract adverse comment but we board them regardless of that to ensure compliance.  The SFPA is very active in this regard and I can get the Deputy figures for boarding.</p></speech>

It is of interest to those in peripheral and coastal communities, where there is a tradition of fishing.  The stated intention arising from the report is that we would clear the backlog in licence applications within two years.  There are approximately 600 licences so it is quite a challenge but it can be done.  I do not know if people from that division were in but there is an implementation process on the report under way.  The ambition is to clear the backlog within two years.</p></speech>

There are other harbours outside of those which are really starved of any investment funding.  Small allocations are given on an annual basis to local authorities to contribute to them but there is no significant funding being directed to them.  I can give one example in my locality.  The Minister will not be surprised to hear me mention Greencastle and he is well aware of it.  Previously, the Department had provided capital funding for the location but it is not one of the fishery harbour centres.  It is the next busiest port outside of those.

It needs additional funding for completion.  There is no capital line for this in any Department budget.  The appropriate place for it is in this Department as this was the previous parent Department.  This has been pushed from pillar to post and I have no doubt it is the same for other harbours.  There is money in local authorities for small jobs, which is useful, but there must also be a capital line for much larger infrastructure projects, similar to the capital line that was previously in Departments.  I am interested in the Minister's comments and whether we can get a commitment that the Department will be the lead the Department.  Will it set up that budget line?

Payment of the 2017 co-funding will be made in August 2018.  I can give the Deputy more detail but I will have to interpret that myself.</p><p>However, I take the Deputy's point about the reduction in levies on the calf exports, in particular, and the volumes that are moving now, which are quite welcome.

The headings with the highest percentage increases tend to be under administration.  For example, there was a 9% increase in salaries, wages and allowances in 2018 from 2017.  In No. VI, for offices, premises and expenses, the increase is 12% between 2017 and 2018.  In No. VII, for consultancy services and value-for-money and policy reviews, there is an increase of 11% from 2017 to 2018.  Can the Minister comment on that?  Some of it is probably due to pay agreements and so forth, but the increase stands out as high given the percentage increases in some of the other areas.  We are seeing the highest percentage increases on the administration side.</p></speech>

It started at &euro;174 million and became &euro;162 million.  This is the Revised Estimates.  On the consultancy allocation increasing by 10%, it goes from a base of &euro;176,000 to &euro;208,000 which is not an excessive amount.  We have had a staffing issue.  We are running flat out to almost stand still.  Our efforts to recruit have not been as fast as we would like and what we are losing at the other side means that the numbers are not increasing by a significant amount.  We hope to increase the numbers in 2018 because we are at a stage where new employees in critical areas are necessary and important.</p></speech>

Many members of the committee will be very familiar with these new arrangements which were introduced by the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016.</p> <p>  In brief, the Act provided for new streamlined arrangements, which came into operation on 3 July 2017, to enable planning applications for large scale housing developments, SHDs, of 100 housing units or more, or student accommodation developments of 200 bed spaces or more, to be made directly to the board for determination.  These arrangements are intended to provide greater certainty for developers in terms of the timelines for planning decision-making, while also facilitating the earlier provision of much needed housing supply and helping to address the current housing supply shortage situation.</p> <p>  Under the SHD arrangements, a developer is required to firstly engage in pre-application consultations in relation to a proposed SHD development with the board and with the local planning authority, with such pre-application consultation phase having to be completed within nine weeks.  Where a planning application is subsequently submitted to the board, the board is required to make a determination on an application within a period of 16 weeks from the submission of that application.  These new fast track arrangements have the potential to result in planning decisions for concerned large developments being made within 25 weeks of commencement of the pre-application consultation, as against the more normal two stage planning process which can, in certain circumstances, take up to 18 to 24 months from initial design stage to ultimate approval.  I appreciate it can be shorter than that, but in some cases that has happened in the past.</p> <p>  In order to ensure that An Bord Plean&aacute;la had the necessary structures and resources in place to undertake these additional functions, the legislation provided for the establishment of a new strategic housing division of the board to decide on these housing applications.  The division requires two additional ordinary board members on a temporary basis, while the new arrangements are in place.  Separately, and in addition, the filling of an additional dedicated ten professional and administrative posts was sanctioned by our Department to support this division and the relevant staff are in place since 2017.</p> <p>  Over the last number of years the board has operated with a membership of nine members, consisting of the chair and eight ordinary members.  However, section 104 of the Planning Act provides that the board can consist of a maximum of up to ten members, the chair and nine ordinary board members.  Therefore, in January of this year, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, appointed a ninth ordinary member to the board, thereby bringing the board to its full complement of ten, as provided for in the legislation and thereby filling the first of the two additional ordinary members positions required for the new SHD arrangements.</p> <p>  Section 104 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, also provides that the Minister may by order temporarily increase the number of ordinary members of the board, where this is necessary to enable it to fulfil its duties and objectives.  Such an order must be laid in draft before both Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before it can be made.</p> <p>  As indicated, and in light of the tight statutory timeframes associated with determining applications under the SHD provisions, it is necessary to utilise this provision now.  The order before members is required so that the Minister can make a further appointment to the board, ensuring that the second additional member required for the new SHD arrangements are in place.</p><p>Under the 2016 Act, the SHD arrangements which it introduced will operate initially until 31 December 2019.  Subject to review, they may be extended to 31 December 2021, the end date of the Rebuilding Ireland action plan.  Accordingly, the draft order proposes to increase the membership of the board by one member, initially for the period until 31 December 2019, with a view to extending the appointment in accordance with the legislation, if required, at a later date.  Board members are generally appointed by the Minister from candidates nominated by prescribed organisations.  Subject to the necessary Oireachtas approval, it is the Minister&rsquo;s intention to select a nominee for appointment as a board member at the earliest possible date.</p><p> I support the making of this necessary order.  As I outlined, the SHD provisions were introduced to speed up the planning decision-making process for large-scale housing developments, with a view to addressing urgently the housing supply shortage.  The additional board member is vital to ensure there will be sufficient capacity within the board to undertake its additional functions related to SHDs and in order that SHD planning determinations can be made within the fast-track timeline prescribed under the 2016 Act.  </p><p> I look forward to engaging with the committee and will endeavour to answer questions committee members may have.</p></speech>

At what stage are they applications?  When the legislation was going through, we raised the question of why consideration had not been given to imposing statutory timelines on An Bord Plean&aacute;la for all planning decisions.  They apply to all local authorities which arguably have a bigger job to do in having to go through full applications, as opposed to an appeal to the board.  Is there any impact on non-strategic housing development decisions taken by the board of a lengthening of the timelines by virtue of having to deal with larger applications under the new legislation?</p></speech>

A total of four of the 36 opinions indicated that the documents submitted gave a reasonable basis on which to submit planning applications, while 32 required further consideration.  Of the 36 opinions, 19 planning applications for strategic housing developments have been brought forward to the board which has issued a decision in seven of those cases.  It has granted permission for the construction of a total of 523 residential units, mainly apartments, and 3,408 student bed spaces.  It has refused permission for the construction of a total of 1,040 residential units, consisting of 478 houses and 562 apartments.  All of the decisions were made within the 16-week timeframe.  I have an overview of the seven cases decided if members want to have it.</p></speech>

We set out a specific student accommodation action plan with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Department of Education and Skills.  We wanted to drive that agenda and have purpose-built student accommodation on or close to campus which should also free housing for others.</p><p>There has been a push on there.  All our education players have been encouraged to become involved in that and to do more of their own alongside private developers.  There are 12 decisions to be made.  The remaining 12 strategic housing development applications consist of 3,420 residential units, which comprise 2,373 houses, 1,047 apartments and 691 student bed spaces.  Quite a number of residential units are coming through.  I have no problem providing a note on that in order to give members some information on that.</p></speech>

When we had a debate on this matter in the Seanad and in the D&aacute;il, that was considered.  Generally, 80% to 82% of An Bord Plean&aacute;la's cases are dealt with within the statutory timelines.  It has a service level agreement with our Department to reach that target.  In 2017, it was lower than that and only 65% to 66% of cases were dealt with within the statutory timelines, mainly because the board was down members and was awaiting appointees.  It was also seeking more staff, which we facilitated during 2017.  We will monitor that.  Sometimes the 20% of cases that are not dealt with within the specific timelines comprise high profile ones.  That is something we monitor and we discuss it in the context of the service level agreement.  We can review it and discuss it further, if we are of the view that we need to change the rules.  We need some certainty around timelines from the planning system.  The main reason for the changes we made in 2016 was to introduce some certainty and to encourage people who owned land - that is, unzoned - to bring forward applications.  We gave a commitment that we would give applicants a decision within a certain timeframe.  That assists with the costs involved and the business case in order to fast-track planning.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked if this had any impact on non-strategic housing developments.   We have not noticed anything different but we can do a check and do a trawl to be sure about that.  By increasing the overall complement of the board and meeting the staff requirements following the review in 2016, An Bord Plean&aacute;la should be in a better position to be able to reach its overall targets.</p></speech>

In an effort to fast-track the larger developments, we do not want small builders who build 20, 40 or 80 units to experience much longer delays.  If there was a way to track and monitor that, it would be useful.</p></speech>

I have made it clear that we have proposed this order on foot of a commitment given that if we changed the legislation to provide for fast-track developments An Bord Plean&aacute;la needed additional board members.  A specific team was set aside for that, therefore, it should not influence the board's day-to-day processes.  If both Houses of the Oireachtas accept this, it will strengthen the position of the board to make sure applications are dealt with within the timelines and that nobody else will suffer.</p></speech>

That nine-week phase is to make sure we get good quality applications and that nobody's time is wasted.

If they want to come back, they can still apply.  Only four got a straightforward response; they were told their applications were at the top level, but 19 applications have come in.  Some of those 32 combined applications and they would have made changes before they formally applied.  The nine-week period is to guide best practice and the submitting of the best applications.

The chair of the board has specifically said that she would like the candidates for these positions to have an architectural and engineering background.  The most recent appointee was Michelle Fagan, who I believe has an architectural background.  There are five panels.  The candidates are nominated.  The Minister chooses from those and it makes the appointments process correct; they are ministerial appointments.  It is hoped that if the Houses clear this on Thursday, the Minister should be able to work from the existing list of nominated people, so we will not have to waste any time.</p> <p>  Regarding Deputy &Oacute; Broin's point, housing developments in general are being prioritised by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  There is an agreement that priority is given to all housing developments, regardless of their size.</p></speech>

It would be helpful if we got a similar spreadsheet, even on a six-monthly basis, of the kind of information the Minister of State has shown but presented as a flow chart.  The smaller number of applications that got through the pre-application process quickly have been dealt with in a much more speedy fashion, but I would be interested to see, of all the developments, the actual improvement in the timeline.  The Minister of State might give a commitment that every six months we would get a spreadsheet update with the columns and the lengths of time for each stage of the process for all pre-applications and applications.  That would be useful to allow us track it.</p></speech>

In terms of the ones who go through that early process and are given advice to make changes, all that information is on record and can be seen, and the inspector will comment on that as well.  It is all clear-cut.  I understand the Deputy's point.  It is to be able to track the process to see if it is working with regard to timelines.</p></speech>

It is not sufficient to just put them on silent mode, as this will maintain interference with the broadcasting system.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Coppinger.</p>  <p>  No. 1 is consideration of the Revised Estimates for Vote 34 - Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government; Vote 16 - Valuation Office; and Vote 23 - Property Registration Authority.  I welcome the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, the Ministers of State, Deputies Damien English and John Paul Phelan, and their officials.  The D&aacute;il ordered on 14 December 2017 that the Revised Estimates be referred to the committee for consideration.  The purpose of the meeting is to consider the Revised Estimates and the provision of information regarding the outputs and impacts of programme expenditures.  As previously agreed, we will begin with Vote 34 and then move to Votes 16 and 23.  I will call the programmes and invite questions under each for Vote 34.  Members will be called in the order in which they indicated.</p>  <p>  I call the Minister to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-27a.212" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2018032700003#B00600"><p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss with the committee my Department&rsquo;s Revised Estimate for 2018, as well as the Votes for the Valuation Office and the Property Registration Authority, PRA, which, arising from a recent transfer of functions, are now also under the aegis of my Department.  We have provided a briefing on the Department&rsquo;s funding for 2018, as well as other key information to assist in the work today,.</p>  <p>  Turning first to Vote 34, the Revised Estimate sets out my Department&rsquo;s budget for 2018.  Gross expenditure of &euro;3.264 billion is budgeted for this year.  This represents an increase of almost &euro;1.2 billion or 55% on the provision in 2017.  The gross provision for 2018 comprises &euro;1.633 billion in current spending and &euro;1.631 billion on the capital side.  In addition, my Department&rsquo;s programmes will benefit in 2018 from resources of some &euro;621 million that will be available from the Local Government Fund.  While some Exchequer-neutral technical adjustments are being made between the Vote and the Local Government Fund in 2018, which I will return to later, even allowing for this, the Estimate represents a significant increase in resources for my Department.  It indicates beyond doubt the priority that the Government attaches to my Department&rsquo;s programmes and, in particular, to supporting the initiatives set out in Rebuilding Ireland.</p>  <p>  More than &euro;1.8 billion is being made available in the Vote for housing programmes in 2018 &ndash; an increase of more than &euro;500 million on the 2017 Estimate.  In addition, local authorities will fund a range of housing services to the value of &euro;92 million from surplus local property tax receipts, bringing the total housing provision to more than &euro;1.9 billion - &euro;778 million on the current side and &euro;1.14 billion in capital funding.  This investment will provide social housing supports for 25,500 households in 2018.  More than &euro;1 billion will support the delivery of almost 5,900 social homes through construction and acquisition.  The balance of the funding will add further tenancies &ndash; and maintain existing ones - through the housing assistance payment, HAP, rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and long-term leasing.  It will also fund other important housing supports and services relating to homelessness, regeneration, housing for Travellers, and programmes to upgrade existing housing, for example, energy efficiency improvements and adaptation grants.  An allocation of &euro;301 million - up &euro;149 million on 2017 is for the HAP, which will enable a further 17,000 households to be accommodated, as well as support the 32,000 existing active HAP tenancies.  Funding of &euro;134 million will support the operation of the RAS, including a further 600 new transfers from rent supplement.</p> <p> With regard to services for homelessness, an allocation of &euro;116 million, which is an increase of &euro;18 million on the 2017 Estimate, will address the increased demand for emergency homeless services and assist in supporting homeless households to transition to long-term and sustainable housing solutions.  In 2018, more than 3,000 exits from emergency accommodation are expected through the provision of social homes and tenancies under the housing assistance payment.  The additional funding provided for 2018 will support the provision of a programme of scheduled services, expenditure on emergency accommodation and also the implementation of solutions to transition homeless households from hotel arrangements to more appropriate family hub accommodation. </p> <p> The local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, will be supported by an allocation of &euro;60 million in 2018.  The fund will provide enabling infrastructure on key sites to open up lands for early development and has the potential to release the delivery of at least 20,000 new homes by 2021.  At least 10%, or 2,000, of these new homes will be social housing through Part V, with additional social housing to be provided on certain State-owned sites.  In addition, &euro;15 million is being allocated in 2018 to provide infrastructure and services, for example, roads and paths, water connections and street lighting on local authority-owned sites in Dublin to facilitate the delivery of affordable housing to help households facing the greatest challenge with affordability and to create mixed tenure communities. </p> <p> As the committee is aware, following the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services and the enactment of the Water Services Act 2017, the costs of normal domestic water services fall to be met by the Exchequer.  To improve the transparency of the new funding arrangements, the Government decided that from 2018 this funding is to be provided from the Vote of the Department rather than by a combination of current funding from the local government fund and capital contribution from the Minister for Finance.  This is now reflected in the amount of &euro;1.1 billion - &euro;600 million on the current side and &euro;500 million on the capital side - which is included this year in programme B of the Estimates for meeting Irish Water costs in respect of domestic water services and providing a capital contribution towards investment.  The capital funding in 2018 is part of the overall funding of &euro;8.5 billion earmarked in Project Ireland 2040, the national development plan, to continue to upgrade our national water infrastructure.  The group water sector continues to be an important element of the water industry in Ireland.  Reflecting this, a provision of &euro;20 million was made in 2018 for capital spend under the rural water programme through which funding is provided for group water schemes, an increase of over &euro;2 million on the 2017 Estimate. </p> <p> The new multi-annual approach to the programme which was introduced in 2016 provides enhanced funding certainty for priority investment needs in order to support the implementation of proper planning and sustainable development in rural areas, meet the requirements of the Drinking Water Directive for rural water supplies and support the delivery of measures identified in river basin management plans to meet the objectives of the directive. </p> <p> The local government fund, LGF, has in recent years been funded principally by motor taxation and local property tax, LPT, which is collected by the Revenue Commissioners.  A payment has also been made to the fund from the Department&rsquo;s Vote.  The main payments from the fund have been to local authorities, Irish Water, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, as well as the Exchequer.  In tandem with Irish Water funding moving from the LGF to the Vote in 2018, which I have already mentioned, we are now proceeding with other changes to the fund which aim to return it more fully to its original purpose of funding local authorities and to end circular flows of funds that had built up over the years.  In particular, from this year, motor tax receipts will go directly to the Exchequer; payments in respect of road and public transport infrastructure, previously met from the LGF, will now be met from the Vote of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport; and there will be no further requirement for a payment from the LGF to the Exchequer.  In 2018, after these changes, the position is that the income sources into the fund are estimated to be LPT of &euro;470 million and a payment from the Exchequer of &euro;124.8 million.  My Department will make payments estimated at &euro;620.7 million from the fund in 2018, including LPT payments to local authorities of &euro;504 million. </p> <p> LPT continues to provide a sustainable, stable, alternative source of funding for the local government sector.  The 2018 LPT allocations to local authorities are broadly based on the same mechanism and principles as were agreed by Government in previous years, with 80% local retention to fund the delivery of public services and the remaining 20% being redistributed to provide top-up funding to local authorities that have lower property tax bases due to variances in property values and density across the State. </p> <p> With regard to other programmes, in planning, &euro;10 million in capital funding is being provided as the start of a multi-annual urban renewal fund amounting to &euro;60 million in total.  The fund will be directed to local authority-led projects to regenerate and revitalise urban areas.  From 2019, Project Ireland 2040, the national development plan, will see greatly intensified action to transform our cities and towns through the new &euro;2 billion urban regeneration and development fund aimed at achieving sustainable growth in these areas.  Further areas of expenditure set out in the 2018 Estimate include meeting the costs of An Bord Plean&aacute;la at &euro;17.2 million and Met &Eacute;ireann at &euro;20.9 million.</p> <p> In 2017, the Government decided to assign to my Department responsibility for Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Valuation Office and the Property Registration Authority.  A provision of &euro;15.6 million is made in Vote 34 for Ordnance Survey Ireland, while the other two organisations have separate Votes amounting to &euro;11.6 million for the Valuation Office and &euro;29.3 million for the Property Registration Authority.  These bodies are to merge to form Tailte &Eacute;ireann and work is under way in my Department on this important project.</p> <p> I have kept my remarks as brief as possible and focused on some, but by no means all, spending areas in order to allow for full discussion on the programmes of funding of my Department and related organisations this hear.  I will be happy, along with the Ministers of State, to deal with matters members wish to raise.  </p></speech>

The second page of the housing Vote contains a long table showing key outputs and public service activities.  I seek clarity on it.  I am clear on the first three rows.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-27a.219" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="13:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2018032700005#D00600"><p>It is on the second page of the housing Vote.  It is the fourth table outlining key outputs and public service activities.  It is the long one.  I have no query about the first three rows.  Will the Minister explain the differences between the next three rows?</p>  <p>  There is a target of 560 voids in 2018.  That brings us back to the thorny subject of when a void is really a void and just an expensive standard re-let.  My understanding was that the long-term voids were finished.  Therefore, I am even more suspicious that the 560 voids are properties that have tenants and due to be re-let but the cost of turning them over is significantly higher than would normally be the case.  Therefore, they are not long-term voids but just expensive re-lets.  From where does the figure come?</p>  <p>  My next query is about public private partnerships and enhanced leasing.  Obviously, the Department has targets for current expenditure on social housing.  Its ability to meet these targets will depend on the cost of the units.  We know roughly the cost of the units delivered, for example, under the heading of standard leasing.  I have a concern about public private partnerships.  Do we know what the public service benchmarking exercise is?  Do we know what the cost of the units will be over the lifecycle?  Can the Minister give us any additional information at this point?</p>  <p>  On enhanced leasing, on the basis of the limited information contained in the Minister of State's press release in January, it seems to be incredibly expensive.  There is a really good deal, for example, on the percentage of market rent achieved.  One does not have to cover the cost of maintenance; that falls on the local authority or an approved housing body.  What is the difference in cost between an enhanced leasing unit, for example, and a standard leasing unit?  Does it have a potential impact on the ability to deliver the targets included in the report?</p>  <p>  I will come back to the issue of water services when we have dealt with housing, if that is okay.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-27a.220" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="13:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2018032700005#D00700"><p>The Deputy mentioned the target of 560 voids.  The number is diminishing every year.  The voids which are essentially council house vacancies are the low-hanging fruit which have been targeted by the Department for a number of years to bring them back into use as social housing stock.  We are not talking about casual vacancies when we talk about voids.  While previously properties had to be in the system for a length of time to be classified as long-term voids, that was removed to take away any potential to have an incentive to keep properties as voids to avail of funding.  We are talking about properties that potentially would be long-term voids if this funding was not spent to bring them back into use.  It is a significant amount of funding.  When we talk about a potential sum of &euro;30,000 being spent, it is not a small amount compared with the amount allowed for under the repair and lease scheme, for example.  These are properties that would be vacant if the money was not spent and so are part of the voids programme.  To ensure there was no doubt about what we were doing, I took the number of voids out of the build target when we started to publish data in order that people would be clear that we were not counting them as builds.  We should be clear that the number has been diminishing every year.  As we get to the end of the programme, we are, I think, talking about 130 voids, but it might not even be that figure, depending on how much progress we can make with the properties in the coming few years.</p>  <p>  Potentially enhanced leasing is very positive for the State.  We are talking about the ability to leverage private finance to provide social housing, taking all of the risk on the build side that the State would not have to take.</p> <p>Significantly, and as reflected in the market rent that is acquired, private finance also takes on all of the liability costs for the buildings over the course of the 25 years, which is a longer-term lease than we have had previously.  This takes into account maintenance fees, service charges and all of those things that a local authority might have had to pay under a different lease agreement.  The private body will have to expend a significant amount of money over the lifetime of the lease agreement, which represents a considerable saving to the State.  This is the reason for the 92% discount.</p> <p> It is important to recognise that potential rent increases will arise every three years under the scheme and be linked to the harmonised indices of consumer prices, HICP.  There is also a process under which any disagreement or difficulty that arises will be clarified.  The enhanced leasing arrangement, which is coming to a finalisation point with expressions of interest, will represent a gain to the State in terms of the potential new properties that we will be able to leverage.</p> <p> A question was asked about the fourth table and the second set of three rows.  The first figure of 5,869 comprises 4,409 builds, 560 voids and 900 acquisitions.  The second figure of 4,969 just underneath that comprises builds and voids and does not include acquisitions.  The 3,209 figure relates to local authority builds and includes regeneration, voids and Part V housing.  That is how the figures have been separated and explains the difference between the figures in the second set of three rows regarding the 2018 target.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-27a.222" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="13:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2018032700006#E00200"><p>In terms of voids, the problem with the way the figures are being presented - I was one of those who asked for that figure to be removed, so I welcome that the Minister did that - is that, when the voids programme was originally introduced, it was concerned with bringing units that were effectively not part of the housing stock back into it.  Regardless of whether they were included in the build figure, they were to be counted as additions to the stock, and so they should have been.  If a property is vacant for six, 12 or 18 months or two years and is then refurbished, it should be considered as an addition to the stock.  However, if a property that is only ten or 13 weeks between tenants costs &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000 to do up, it cannot be counted as new to the stock.  I made a freedom of information request to South Dublin County Council regarding its void programme last year.  According to the council, the average length of time for voids to be returned under the long-term voids programme, as I call it, was 10.29 weeks.</p>  <p>  I accept the Minister's comments about not wanting to disincentivise people or give them a perverse incentive to leave the properties vacant for longer in order to avail of funding, but we must separate the two types of property.  First is a property that is long-term void - it has not had a tenant within a reasonable period - and is effectively a new unit in the stock.  Second, an expensive relet cannot be counted as a new unit, especially if it had someone in it ten, 12 or 18 weeks ago.  These two types must be counted differently and the latter should be removed from the new unit figures, as they are just expensive relets.  Of the 560 voids being targeted this year, I imagine that the overwhelming majority are expensive relets.  They are above the &euro;30,000 level, but they probably had tenants at some stage this year or at the end of last year.  There is a genuine problem in how the Department is counting them.</p>  <p>  Regarding the enhanced leasing scheme, I want to be clear, as I may have misunderstood the Minister's press release.  My understanding is that the cost of the day-to-day maintenance of the property will rest with the approved housing body, AHB, or local authority and the cost of the structural maintenance of the property will rest elsewhere.  If I am wrong, the Minister might clarify the situation.  Is he saying that he has run numbers on this and that, over the 25 years, these units will be less expensive or more expensive to the State?  The major difference is that, with standard leasing from AHBs, the AHBs own the units at the end of the 25 years.  With this scheme, there is a 25-year lease but, if a social housing family is still in the property at the end of that time, the AHB sector will not own the unit.  If the family wants to remain, there would have to be a new lease.  Therefore, the cost to the taxpayer over the lifetime of the tenancy will be substantially more than under standard leasing from AHBs, which is essentially leasing to buy.  Has the Minister numbers on the cost comparison between the two types of leasing within and post the 25 years?</p> <p>The other point I want to make is not one for the Minister but for his colleague in finance.  There is a real concern that the requirement to bring 100% capital funding to this excludes the approved housing bodies.  They will not be able to buy into this.  Many of the alternative investment funds that are likely to invest in this will pay substantially lower levels of tax because of their tax status.  Other than the dividend withholding tax, they will pay very little tax at all on their rent roll.  This means there will be an additional loss to the State.  That is not a question for the Minister.  I am making a point about the tax status of the vehicles that will be investing in this.  Questions need to be asked about the additional benefits of this deal for those vehicles.  Is the taxpayer really getting a good deal at the end of it?</p></speech>

When we talk about 2:1s, we are talking about former bedsits being brought back as single-unit accommodation.  Essentially, there are three different streams under the voids programme.  We are not talking about what the Deputy has described as "expensive re-lets".  In some cases, there is a risk that a unit will be vacant for a considerable period of time if significant investment is not made by the council, which is something that can happen just once under this particular programme.</p></speech>

A property that has been tenanted by the same family for 40 years or more may have had very little work done on it over its lifecycle.  The cost of re-letting such a property is expensive because of the need for rewiring, reinsulation, new windows and new kitchens, etc.  It costs way more.  That work can be done within ten weeks under this programme, which has a high rate of finance.  This kind of property is essentially being counted in the Minister's figures as an addition to the stock even though it was tenanted ten or 14 weeks earlier.</p></speech>

I am not challenging what the Minister is doing, but I am saying I think this needs to be spelled out very clearly in the figures so that people are absolutely clear on whether something is an expensive re-let, rather than a 2:1 or a property that has been brought back into use after being derelict for a long time.  There are fundamental differences between the categories.  I would challenge the appropriateness of counting as a new unit something which had a tenant in it a couple of months previously and may or may not have fallen out of stock if this additional funding had not been made available.</p></speech>

I can certainly provide figures to the committee setting out how many 2:1s and derelict properties we are working on over the programme.  It is important to note that as we work through this programme, the number of voids that have the potential to be brought back into use will decrease every year.  The Department is moving towards more active management of stock through a programme that focuses on casual vacancies that require a bit of funding to ensure they can be retenanted as quickly as possible.  This programme, which is separate from the voids programme, involves making investments proactively to ensure these properties do not become long-term voids.  It recognises that many of the properties in question were long-term voids before they were brought back into the system.  That is how the money is being spent.</p>  <p>  The Deputy also asked about enhanced leasing and maintenance.  The 92% reduced rate of rent is higher than the traditional lease, which was approximately 80%.  The local authority was maintaining all the responsibility for day-to-day maintenance as well, but that is not the case under the new enhanced leasing arrangements.</p></speech>

It is important to note it has been decided that in order to keep them off the balance sheet, these properties will not come into public ownership at the end of the 25-year period.  Indeed, the State will not have the first option on them.  This is important because it will allow us to leverage even greater potential to secure more housing through this stream without having a negative impact on our ability to spend money in other areas of housing or the public good.  As we get towards the end of the 25-year lease agreement, we will have to manage tenancies actively to make sure no one is exposed in a way that means he or she has nowhere to live.</p> <p>However, it is also important to note that over the 25 year period people's housing needs will have changed.  The original needs of that tenancy will have changed in the 25 year period.  The exact needs of the tenant in 25 years time are not set in stone on day one.  Some work will be done of course in advance to ensure that the tenancy can be managed.  Perhaps the arrangement will be rolled over.  It is not for certain that the stock will necessarily be taken back into private ownership or sold off.  Even if it were sold off, it is not certain who the buyer might be; it could be an approved housing body or someone else.  That will depend and it will be managed closer to the end of the lease term.</p> <p> Reference was made to cost comparisons for the different lease agreements.  Considerable work was done between ourselves and the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform to ensure that we were bringing in to existence a new stream of delivery that would ensure value for money for the State.  It is important that this is done.  Sometimes, it is difficult to make direct cost comparisons.  Risk in this instance will be carried almost exclusively by the private side.  This includes risk for the build, maintenance, day-to-day management and potential vacancy if the units are empty or not re-let at a given time.  In those circumstances, the investors will not get their lease payments or the payments will cease.  The fact is that they are tied into what will not be a free hand in terms of rent rises.  That will be linked on a three year basis to the harmonised index of consumer prices.  All these factors make it difficult to carry out a direct cost comparison with the traditional lease agreement that we have had with local authorities playing the management role at an 80% discount.</p> <p> We have done considerable work with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Finance to ensure that we are getting value for money for the taxpayer.  This is an important new stream of housebuilding and homes for social housing.</p></speech>

What determines value for money in this scheme versus the other schemes?</p>  <p>  I will go back to the first question I asked about the public private partnerships.  I realise there is some difficulty with them.  My understanding is that a public service benchmarking exercise has been carried out.  I gather it is held under lock and key in order that no politician can look at it bar, I presume, the Minister and the Department.  It is used to make a comparison for the successful tenders.</p>  <p>  There is meant to be some mechanism to determine if the cost of the public private partnership consortium over the 25 years is around or less than the cost to the State of delivering the same service.  Can the Minister give us any information on that?  Is there a similar exercise?  How can the Minister refer to value for money for enhanced leasing?  What is the Minister measuring it against?</p></speech>

The tests set out to see whether the project could be delivered more cheaply through traditional means.  All these benchmarks and value for money measures will be made public after the contracts are awarded.</p>  <p>  A significant amount of work has been done with the enhanced lease agreement by the National Development Finance Agency.  When we go into the final lease agreement with the people who are successful with the expression of interests, we will then carry out another value for money exercise to ensure that it all stacks up and amounts to another delivery stream that brings value for money to the taxpayer in addition to the more traditional streams.  That work will be done when we go into the final agreement.  The NDFA has done the pre-proofing, as it were, of the fundamental principles behind the scheme and how it will operate.</p></speech>

In every county a case like that arises, where an elderly couple die who have lived in the same property for 40 years, and it will cost over &euro;30,000 to bring the property back into use.  That does not add to the stock of local property houses.

The Minister said after the budget last year that he realised that the State buying from the market was having an influence and that he did not see that as a sustainable move going forward.  However, the proposal to buy 900 houses this year is still in place.  Some 560 of those were voids.  That leaves us with a figure of 4,489.  Can the Minister provide a breakdown as to what that figure consists of?  I am talking about direct builds by local authorities and approved housing bodies.  Does this form part of the part five housing allocation?</p>  <p>  The Minister said that he would look at new ways of funding social housing delivery.  Does he have any update on that?  </p>  <p>  I want to acknowledge the work that is being done on homelessness.  The Minister has said that some 4,000 people have exited homelessness this year, and I acknowledge that.  However, they have been replaced by another 4,000.  The only month we have seen a reduction in homeless figures was December.  For the rest of the year there has been a continual increase in the number of homeless people.  We are still using hotels, despite the fact that the previous Minister had said that he hoped that practice would end by July.  However, 700 families are still living in them.  How are we going to get on top of this ongoing problem?  We are not getting on top of it.  What action can be taken?  It seems to escalate on an annual basis.   </p></speech>

An important policy change on acquisitions was announced at the first housing summit in September.  I did not believe that local authorities should compete in high-demand areas with young couples and people trying to buy homes because it was pushing up the prices of houses and was not contributing to our stock of social housing.  As a result we made a policy decision to move a significant amount of that funding towards direct build by local authorities and housing bodies.  That meant that there would be a 30% increase this year in the number of units directly built by local authorities, which amounts to a figure of around 800 new homes.  I did not cease the practice of acquisitions completely, because in certain parts of the country that are not high-demand local authorities can get considerable value for money by buying those properties from the market.  It is quicker and cheaper to do.  In places such as Donegal and Roscommon local authorities are continuing to acquire homes.  For this year we are looking at a total of 7,900 new social housing homes, through builds, acquisitions and leasing agreements.  Some 900 of those will be acquired, but a significant amount more than that will be directly built.  The policy changed, but it did not change for low-demand areas where acquisitions make sense.  That is a judgement call for the local authority.</p>  <p>  On the build breakdown for 2018, the figure that we have for local authorities and housing bodies is roughly around 3,800.  That breaks down into 2,300 from the local authorities side and 1,500 from the approved housing bodies in terms of direct builds.</p> <p>Approximately 600 come into the build figure under Part V.  In addition, we have the 900 acquisitions to which we referred and the leasing agreements add another 2,000.  That is the 7,900 figure broken down by the different build types and Part Vs.  I did not mention the voids, which number 560.</p> <p> The enhanced leasing agreement is a new delivery stream we have been signalling, which is now almost coming to completion thanks to the good work of the Minister of State, Deputy English, and his officials in getting it ready to go out to an expression of interest and finalising those agreements once we get into April.  We are also progressing, with the European Investment Bank, EIB, the potential for a new stream of delivery for affordable housing.  That is ongoing.  I was in Luxembourg last month and we are having detailed discussions on a weekly basis with officials from the EIB to see if we can start to have more affordable housing at a greater scale.  This is line with the announcements I made in January, particularly the cost-rental side of those announcements.</p> <p> With regard to homelessness, the Deputy is absolutely right to say the problem is escalating in certain ways when one looks at the numbers.  I know the Deputy recognises that a huge amount of work has been done.  We recently saw with Storm Emma the dedication of officials in my Department, local authorities, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive and the NGO sector to help people who were on the frontline of this, people who were sleeping rough, to get them into secure accommodation.  Our responsibility is now to get them into sustainable accommodation.  We still have a very high number of families in hotels.  We moved a significant number of families out of hotels last year but families continue to present.  Until we have more family hubs built - we have a rapid hub programme under development - families will have to be looked after in hotels, recognising that it is not an adequate first response.  We are moving quickly to a situation where there will be more than enough rapid hub spaces in place for families to be accommodated as a first response before we get them into more secure tenancies.  On the number of exits, we are doing work at the moment which I had hoped to publish before now but I will try to publish it later today or tomorrow.  It addresses the number of exits that were achieved last year as well as information on more recent homeless statistics.  We will put them into the public domain as quickly as we can.</p></speech>

I know we sometimes question the value of money put into HAP.  Equally, we saw landlords jumping on the bandwagon because HAP will give them a greater monthly rental than they currently achieve.  We all need a percentage of HAP but there is a huge over-reliance on HAP at the moment and it is just throwing good money after bad money.  When will we see the pendulum swing away from HAP and towards more long-term delivery?  It is a short-term measure where we need a long-term solution.  It is just a loss of good money after bad money.</p></speech>

Many people like the options that HAP gives them.  They prefer to remain in the private rental sector, are happy to have the State support to be able to do that and their housing needs are being met.  When one looks at the funding that is being provided this year, we have effectively doubled the budget for HAP for this year.  That approximately &euro;300 million will allow us to maintain approximately 32,000 people who are currently in HAP homes and bring approximately another 17,000 people into HAP.  That is just under 50,000 people, for &euro;300 million, who are being accommodated in perfectly good private rented accommodation.  Some &euro;300 million would not get that many homes built and we obviously would not get them tomorrow.  With regard to our reliance on HAP, with Rebuilding Ireland concluding in 2021, over the course of 2020 and 2021, we will accommodate more people entering our social housing stock than we will into housing assistance payment supports in the private rental sector.  Looking beyond Rebuilding Ireland to our ambition in Project Ireland 2040 to bring an additional 72,000 homes into our social housing stock through build and lease, that is how we will be able to continue to manage people moving from HAP to social housing stock that is managed by local authorities.</p> <p>Our ambition does not end with the Rebuilding Ireland strategy in 2021, nor is it our ambition to maintain the current balance between social housing stock and the housing assistance payment.  We intend to re-balance the position in favour of social housing stock over the course of Rebuilding Ireland and into Project Ireland 2040. </p></speech>

I agree that a percentage of them want to live in a private rented accommodation.  While HAP is a necessary scheme, it involves spending a large amount on a short-term solution to a long-term problem.  Perhaps the pendulum will start to swing back at some point after 2021 and the HAP will not be required to the same extent as it is now.</p></speech>

However, Rebuilding Ireland has a target of adding 50,000 houses to the social housing stock, with a further 88,000 people on the housing list to be accommodated through the housing assistance payment.  In the years leading up to 2021, people will present with a housing need the State must meet.  However, given the number of homes that will be built by 2020 and 2021 and our ambitions post-2021, I believe we will be able to re-balance the position.  As I stated, the social housing stock will be re-balanced away from the HAP by 2021.  My ambition is to continue that process in Project Ireland 2040.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-27a.268" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2018032700011#K00500"><p>I have three follow-up questions, two of which are related to the issues raised by Deputy Casey.  One of the interesting questions about the figures on the number of people who exit from homelessness is the number who end up back in emergency accommodation.  Professor Eoin O'Sullivan has produced some interesting research in which he tracks, on a monthly or quarterly basis, the number of people entering emergency accommodation who are first-time occupants of emergency accommodation as opposed to people who had presented previously.  It may be worthwhile for the Department to link into and publish this research and information on people exiting emergency accommodation, for example, on how long they exit for and the propensity of people to return to emergency accommodation.</p>  <p>  On the housing assistance payment, the Minister referred to many people liking the HAP option.  I am interested in finding out on what research he bases that view given that the majority of people entering HAP supported accommodation opt to be included on the HAP transfer list.  This suggests they are keen to secure more permanent accommodation.</p>  <p>  When discussing HAP, we also need to discuss the rental accommodation scheme, leasing and rent supplement, even if the numbers of people on rent supplement are meant to be declining and leasing, because all of these schemes subsidise private rental accommodation.  By the end of Rebuilding Ireland, more than 100,000 people will be living in the private rented sector and receiving social housing support subsidised by the State.  The figure will be the highest in the history of the State and will account for one third of the total social housing tenancies if one includes all the social housing that will be added to the existing stock.  Part of the problem is that the legislation is designed in such a way as to indicate that the social housing need of these households have been met, which suggests it is permanent, whereas the experience of those living in private rented accommodation and receiving social housing support is that it is temporary. </p>  <p>  As I state probably every time we discuss the HAP, I do not propose to get into an argument with the Minister about the scheme because we have fundamentally different views on it.  However, if he accepts that people can move into council housing from HAP supported accommodation, he should ensure they are given access to choice based letting and the principal means of allocating social housing.  This would clearly show whether people want to move out of HAP supported accommodation.</p>  <p>  At what point will the Minister be able to provide figures on the cost of the affordable housing units in Dublin that will benefit from the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF?  While I accept that contractual and confidentiality issues arise, I am sure the figures will be provided at some point.  Can the Minister provide them now or must we wait until a later stage?</p></speech>

It takes considerable time and effort to drill into the data, to present them again and check them before publication  I want to do more with the information available to us.  As I signalled on the previous occasion I released figures on the number of people in emergency accommodation and homeless, there is more information that we are not capturing properly or publishing.  I want to try to find a way to do this while maintaining the transparency we have with regard to all of the issues we face.  I may return to this when I get a chance to publish the figures for February.</p>  <p>  On the housing assistance payment, the comment I made is based on the success of the scheme to date and the number of people currently in it versus the number who have exited it, which is comparatively low.  When we view the scheme from that perspective, it is successful from the point of view of tenants.  When one considers that approximately 20,000 landlords are involved in the scheme, it is also successful from the point of view of landlords.</p> <p>As such, I see it as a scheme that is operating successfully.  I do not know if-----</p></speech>

The point he made was that a lot of people like the option.  He seemed to suggest that they had some other option, whereas for the vast majority of people taking housing assistance payment, HAP, it is their only option.</p></speech>

That is one of the benefits of HAP and the reason it is proving to be successful.  I do not think we have a different view on HAP.  I would not have designed the scheme like this way back when.  This was born out of necessity, based on what faced us when we did not have the stock in place to meet the needs of our people.  That said, there would still be a need for private rental support for people in the private rental market.  I think it is a good thing in that it gives people flexibility and achieves certain social goods, such as promoting mixed communities.  I think there should always be a State support available to help people to source their own accommodation on the private rental market.  It is something that will continue.  However, I am cognisant of the fact that our social housing stock is far too low. That is why Rebuilding Ireland makes the commitment to increase that stock by at least 50,000, and to build on that in Project Ireland 2040.</p>  <p>  In relation to the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, this would have been published by now but for Storm Emma and a few other things.  As soon as Deputy &Oacute; Broin lets me out of this committee I will endeavour to get it out this week. </p></speech>

That said, the last time I said that to him, I left the committee, looked at the numbers and published them, and I was criticised subsequently for my strategy in releasing them.

Are there any questions for the Minister here?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-27a.282" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2018032700012#L01300"><p>I have two questions.  We had a session last week on the draft revised EU drinking water directive, or the directive on the quality of water intended for human consumption, as the European Commission oddly likes to call it.  At that meeting, Irish Water's representatives told us that the company had done some initial calculations based on the current draft.  Obviously we know that the current draft is unlikely to be the final draft, but Irish Water has done some financial calculations on the cost of capital expenditure and current expenditure required if that draft was to come into force.  The representatives said that it would cost between &euro;200 million and &euro;300 million in capital expenditure.  That is one-off expenditure over a period of time.  There would also be a potential annual operational cost of &euro;100 million for all of the scheme's bits and pieces.</p>  <p>  When we asked them what that means to the current capital programme, they said that their difficulty would not necessarily arise in looking for extra money but that their capacity to deliver any additional capital expenditure operations was circumscribed by their existing programme.  If they had these additional requirements, it would not be a case of approaching the Minister and asking for extra money; Irish Water simply would not be able to spend that money even if he gave it to the company.  This means that other areas of activity would be delayed, for example, upgrading the wastewater treatment plants that are currently being accused of falling foul of the European Court of Justice's legal action, or the pipe upgrades. </p>  <p>  Obviously that would create a real dilemma if the directive came into force in its current form.  Rather than having an argument about whether Irish Water can have more money, we would have to decide which would be prioritised; upgrading the wastewater treatment plants, fixing the leaking pipes and trying to save water or meeting these new requirements.  Has the Minister had conversations with Irish Water about that dilemma arising from the directive?  If not, is that something he should be doing?  Obviously it is a significant set of concerns.  </p>  <p>  In that context, and in regard to the capital investment that is outlined in the schedule, can the Minister give us an update on the progress in tackling those 38-odd agglomerations that are in breach of the urban wastewater treatment directive?  Can he give us an update on any conversations he has had about the legal challenge that the Commission has put to the European Court of Justice? </p> <p>I understand the Minister is still waiting for an answer on that but any updates he can provide would be useful.  </p> <p> Can the Minister also tell us whether he is looking beyond those 38 agglomerations?  The Environmental Protection Agency has identified up to 100 wastewater treatment plants which are at some level of risk.  Can the Minister give us some update as to where that sits in the context of the existing capital plan?  </p> <p>The Minister mentioned the extra &euro;2 million for group water schemes.  I stand corrected if I am wrong but I understand that relates to the standing charge, the annual fee or subvention.  The Minister obviously gave a commitment to respond to the request to look at whether additional capital investment supports would be required, as per the recommendation of the Oireachtas committee.  Can he update us on that piece of work as well?  </p></speech>

We have approved the EU directive prior to this meeting, and it has gone back.  A motion has gone before the Houses and I believe it is to be heard tomorrow.</p></speech>

We face a number of challenges in the provision of water services at the moment.  We have planned a number of different capital projects to that end.  The main constraints we face relate to the construction sector and the supply chain.  This is something we normally face when it comes to the provision of water infrastructure.  We face it when we look at all of the infrastructure provisions that need to be made.  I have been speaking with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, about a number of different mechanisms that might be put in place to manage infrastructural development into the future, given the significant investment that is now going to go in on the capital side of most budgets to make sure there are no unforeseen bottlenecks or that a project is not started that cannot be continued because the skills or machinery are not there.  That is something we are doing on a national basis.</p>  <p>  I am due to meet Irish Water to talk about what our priorities are in terms of the future provision of water.  We need to find that balance between repairing leaks and pipes that are already there and providing new water supplies to make sure our cities, towns and villages can continue to grow, as is anticipated.  </p>  <p>  On the issue of group water schemes and subsidies, an important piece of work was done in tandem with the water Bill last year.  We were working on Irish Water, and I believe members knew that a huge piece of work was being done with the private group water schemes both to ensure they were being treated fairly in terms of the restoration of subsidies and that there would be sufficient capital supports in place for the future provision of group water schemes.  Perhaps the public was not aware of that work.  We are about to initiate a very short review of the wider investment needs of group water schemes to look at the kind of funding they will require over the coming years.  The review will consider the capital requirements, the supervision of water quality and governance arrangements.  It also will look at some schemes that have been orphaned for various reasons, as well as those schemes which may wish to come in to what might be called the public water sector.  We hope to have finished that work in the second half of this year and that will inform our preparations for the budget for 2019.  We will be getting into that wider process in the not-too-distant future.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy also asked about wastewater and the river basin management plan to 2021, as well as the strategic funding plan.  We are looking at the next river basin management plan at the moment.  We have been a little bit delayed on that, and it is the subject of some proceedings.  We continue to work to get this new replacement management plan finalised as quickly as possible, and we will see what happens in terms of the proceedings that are under way.  As for further details on the river basin management plan and the forthcoming &euro;1.7 billion investment in infrastructure, 276 wastewater treatment plants are being looked at, as well as the 162 at-risk water bodies where urban wastewater has been identified as a significant pressure.  As we address those through the river basin management plan and as the funding is allocated, there should be some impact in terms of infringement proceedings that are currently under way.  </p></speech>

I thank the Minister for that update in respect of group water schemes.  I met a number of group water schemes in Mayo a couple of months back.  These were older and smaller schemes.  The voluntary boards are dwindling in terms of age and numbers.  They expressed real concern, not on the annual subvention but about the current state of the capital infrastructure and whether they could continue.  They wanted to continue as a group water scheme.  Their preference was not to merge into the public system but they were genuinely fearful of the capacity of the scheme to continue.  That is an important piece of work in respect of giving those schemes a real option to remain group water schemes if that is what they want.  I am sure that is one of the things the Minister will be looking at in the review.</p></speech>

It is a general point.  To return to the potential impact of the drinking water directive.  The Minister has confirmed what I understood.  If there are additional capital requirements, the difficulty for Irish Water will be the capacity to deliver them in respect of planning permissions, tendering and all of that stuff.  Even if the directive's eventual shape does not cost &euro;300 million to Irish Water in capital funding, if it costs &euro;150 million or &euro;100 million, that is still a huge drain out of the current capital plan that Irish Water has.</p>  <p>  I am thinking in particular of the work to bring the urban wastewater treatment plants into line with that directive.  Is that something the Minister is going to be looking at specifically with Irish Water?  Will potential contingency plans be thought through in case that type of bill comes down the line?  I know it is not a bill that would come down the line within 12 or 24 months but even &euro;150 million or &euro;100 million from its capital programme would be a huge shift if that had to be used to meet the requirements of this directive.  When the Minister says a decision of the court is expected, has he done any risk assessments of the potential costs, depending on how that decision is made, or is he going to wait until the decision is announced and assess it at that point?</p></speech>

We are looking at a new strategic funding plan for Irish Water beyond 2021.  That will need to be done.  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, will have a role in that as well in respect of the role it plays in regulating the costs Irish Water might incur.  We will address each of those issues as we go through that process in respect of what needs to be done to ensure we have safe drinking water for our population.  It is important we can communicate positively to the public that is where the investment is going, so they can have safe drinking water.</p>  <p>  In respect of potential infringement proceedings, we are working with the Commission as best we can.

We were trying to understand why they are failing.  Is one of the reasons they are failing the lack of water supply?  If we put that into context, is there an adequate supply to reach the targets of Rebuilding Ireland in future?</p>  <p>  In respect of commercial water, local authorities are still managing the billing and collection processes.  However, we still have approximately 30 different commercial water rates.  When does the Minister see harmonisation to one commercial rate water charge happening?</p></speech>

We have had some negative decisions as well.</p> <p>It is almost a year since I signed the order so we wish to carry out a soft review of how it has worked to date and to see if changes might be necessary.  One would have expected that some of the reasons for the decisions that have emerged to date would have been clarified in the pre-consultation period, but they were not.  We need to take a look at exactly what is going on there.</p> <p> To my knowledge, water infrastructure has not been a delaying factor or a cause for rejection in any of those cases.  There was some media reporting last month about one significant property owner or house builder complaining to a different Department about a lack of water infrastructure and about that impeding his developments, but that turned out not to be the case in what was happening with some of his properties.  We need to make sure, and it is one of the benefits of water and housing being under the same Department, that we can progress our housing plans in tandem with other key infrastructure that has to be put in place.  That is what we do.  We must ensure that infrastructure such as roads, lighting or water is not standing in the way of us being able to build houses because that is something we have to do.</p> <p> With regard to the commercial rates, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, is working on a non-domestic review and this programme will take place over the next 18 to 24 months.  There will be a great deal of public consultation on this.  Public consultation is important to ensure that as we progress this move on rates there is full understanding of what needs to be achieved and full buy-in from the people who are paying the rates.  This is not something on which we are going to come to a conclusion in the near future.  I wish to make sure that there is significant public consultation in advance of any new changes coming down the line.  Of course, we will also be guided by what the CRU intends to do.</p></speech>

While public consultation is very important for everything, a two year window to try to reach a decision on this is a little long.  In fairness, we have known it has been coming for quite some time so what is the delay in harmonising commercial water rates?  We were able to harmonise commercial rates between towns and counties over a five year period and there were significant differences there.</p></speech>

Quite a complex piece of work has to be done.  However, it is not up to me, it is up to the CRU.  I have been emphasising that I do not want it rushed because potentially there might be an impact on small businesses in terms of their costs of doing business.  I want people to be fully aware of what might be coming down the line and what might be an additional cost for some businesses in the future.  I want them to be able to prepare for that and to have adequate time to do so.  Again, however, the timeline is not of my making.</p></speech>

In recent years the local government fund, LGF, was funded principally by motor taxation and local property tax, which is collected by the Revenue Commissioners.  A payment has also been made to the fund from the Department's Vote.  However, the main payments from the fund have been to local authorities, Irish Water, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport as well as the Exchequer.  In tandem with Irish Water funding moving from the local government fund to the Vote in 2018, we are also proceeding with other changes to the fund which aim to return it more fully to its original purpose of funding local authorities and to end circular flows of funds that had built up over the years.  That means that from this year motor tax receipts will go directly to the Exchequer, payments in respect of road and public transport infrastructure previously met from the LGF will now be met from the Vote of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and there will be no further requirement for a payment from the LGF to the Exchequer.</p> <p>This allows for a funding stream into Irish Water without any circular transactions.  It also means the local government fund is a more direct payment into local government.  </p></speech>

I would like to focus today on the local authorities' baseline in respect of which LPT plays a huge role.  The baseline was established approximately 20 years ago and it has not been reviewed in any significant way in the interim.  Many counties, particularly those around Dublin where there has been significant growth in populations, believe they are being disadvantaged because the baseline has not been reviewed.  Can the Minister give an indication of when the baseline might be reviewed?</p></speech>

As this is a tax, it is a matter for the Minister for Finance but because it is a local property tax the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government has a significant say in how it might be redesigned, if it is to be redesigned.  This piece of work has commenced.  In parallel to that, my Department is reviewing the baseline and the redistribution of local property tax to the different local authorities.  I recognise that some local authorities are having difficulties and that some of them think the manner in which the baseline is calculated is unfair.  It is more than likely that we will not move away from the principle of a redistribution of rates from particular local authorities to others to help those that have a lower density of housing, but we will look at new criteria for the calculation of a baseline taking into account the differences between local authorities, including the length of a coastline for which a local authority has responsibility, populations and so on.  The departmental review will look at how the baseline is calculated with a view to improving it while ensuring that no local authority is worse off as a result of a recalculation of how we achieve a baseline.</p></speech>

However, a number of counties have concerns in regard to the baseline and there needs to be clarity brought to this issue.  Wicklow County Council is complaining that it is being disadvantaged as against other local authorities.  There needs to be more transparency brought to the baseline figure and how it is calculated.</p></speech>

When the officials appeared before the joint committee earlier to discuss the review of rates legislation, they and we experienced some frustration because the Valuation Office has come under a different Department and legislative code.  It would be a good idea, once the Valuation Office has settled into its new home, as it were, if the relevant officials were to appear before the committee again for a more rounded discussion on rates valuation reviews, particularly in light of the point made by Deputy Casey.  When all the relevant officials are located in one office, it makes for a more fruitful conversation.  That is my suggestion.</p></speech>

The commercial rates Bill is a priority in this term.  In my wisdom, I have delegated responsibility for the legislation and the work on the Valuation Office to the Minister of State, Deputy John Paul Phelan.  I want to ensure there is consistency at a political and official level.  Once the three new sections have been bedded into the Department, it may be a good time to have a more detailed discussion of our work.</p></speech>

I will not ask the Minister about that.  My major worry, which I know is shared by the Minister, his officials and the local authorities involved, is that these 44 families may have to present as homeless at any stage in the incoming period.  We do not want that.  There are tenants in the property who are the responsibility, in some shape or form, of South Dublin County Council, Dublin City County Council, Fingal County Council and at least two other local authorities outside Dublin.  Some came via the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive, so there is a fair amount of complication.</p> <p> I have three points to put to the Minister.  His Department needs to be as proactive as possible in working with the different local authorities and the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive to ensure the families get all the support they need so that if the planning issues cannot be resolved, they are assisted to move into alternative private rental accommodation.  I spoke to officials in the Minister's Department last week and this week.  They have been very helpful, but I ask the Minister to give us some reassurance that he and his staff will do everything they can to work with the other local authorities to resolve what is an incredibly stressful situation for the residents.  I met with a very large group of them last night and they are hugely concerned.  Some of these people have come from hubs or emergency accommodation.  Those 44 families thought they were at the end of that experience and, through no fault of the local authorities or the Minister's Department but as a result, in my opinion, of the inappropriate and potentially illegal behaviour of a developer, they are now in an incredibly difficult position.  I raise that with the Minister to hear what assurance he can give me and, through the committee, the families in question, that he will do everything he can to assist them during this very difficult period.</p></speech>

I know he has been working with the residents to try to find an early solution for them.  This is a very frustrating situation to be in where we have what appears to be a perfectly good building with tenants in it but which potentially may be an illegal building and, as a result of that potential, tenants who thought they were at home may not be in the coming weeks and months.  I am aware of the work Deputy &Oacute; Broin has been doing and that he has been in touch with my officials.  They will meet the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive and officials from the local authority tomorrow to manage a proper pathway for those people affected in terms of how we will deal with this to make sure that, if we can, not one family will fall into emergency accommodation but can be accommodated directly into a new home.  We are taking a proactive stance on this issue and this is thanks to Deputy &Oacute; Broin bringing it to our attention in the first instance and the work of my officials in recognising the situation those tenants are facing.</p></speech>

A developer can manage to build 44 apartments for which there was no planning permission and which did not meet building standards.</p></speech>

A revised planning application was submitted in 2017 to amend that to 48 units.  That application was rejected and appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la but it appears that during the period of time the appeal has taken, which was approximately six months, the developer in question built and tenanted 44 of those units.  Building control amendment regulations, BCAR, compliance certification was not received by the local authority at any stage, neither commencements, disability, fire or completion certificates.  My understanding is that South Dublin County Council has inspected the premises and there are no fire safety concerns at this point, therefore, there is not an immediate evacuation concern.  On the face of it, it appears the developer built and tenanted the building and did not comply with any of the building or planning regulations.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la's ruling, while it is short, creates real issues in that there is a significant number of units which, according to its ruling, are not compliant with ceiling heights, numbers of units, size of rooms, etc., and the local authority now has to fulfil its statutory obligation in terms of the planning enforcement.</p></speech>

I am interested in this, having not yet heard how the additional units came to the attention of the planning authority.  Was it through the planning authority's own work?</p></speech>

We had all seen works happening but they related to a conversion.  It came to our attention in the first instance because housing applicants in South Dublin County Council's list wanted to take up regular tenancies and applied for the housing assistance payment, HAP.  When they applied for that, South Dublin County Council, in doing due diligence, checked the building and at that point realised there was no completion certificates.  At that point a planning concern was raised.  The Bord Plean&aacute;la decision was pending so people were taking a relatively sensible approach, waiting for that to come out, and it came out last week.  The difficulty is it does not look like any of the 44 units are built in compliance with the 2016 planning approval.  I have had conversations with planning officials and I am trying to find my way around them.  Some units may be in compliance with the approval.</p>  <p>  Under the enforcement regulations, South Dublin County Council has written to the developer and has given 28 days to reply.  We will have to wait and see whether the individual applies for retention or amended retention.  The difficulty is that as of last week, when the residents found out, they had assumed they would be on the street within hours and there was a degree of panic.  We have done much work to reassure them but there are complicating factors in the sense that people are from multiple local authorities, including some outside of Dublin.  Some people are not on housing lists but could be.  That is a process that must be looked at.  At least ten of the households have notices to quit because their HAP applications were refused.  I know that is one of the issues that will be discussed at the meeting tomorrow.</p>  <p>  There are people there from the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive homeless placefinder service and they need some reassurance that if they identify alternative private rental accommodation in the upcoming period, they can transfer the homeless HAP and deposit into the new properties.  That is technically not permissible under normal rules but they clearly do not apply.  We also have five or six private rent pairs who have paid considerable sums - in some cases, a deposit of three months and rent in advance - and they are now wondering if they will get those deposits back.  Threshold representatives were at the meeting last night to advise those residents.  It is very complicated.  If the local authorities that might have some tangential involvement is not at the meeting tomorrow, correspondence should be forwarded to it.  I spoke to Marguerite in the HAP section of the Department today about that.  If staff at the front line of local authorities are apprised of this as quickly as possible, individuals ringing in could be given advice relevant to this situation rather than the standard policy advice.  We do not want much confusion in an already difficult set of circumstances.</p></speech>

I am honoured by this opportunity and in the short period since receiving the nomination I have taken steps to engage with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and NSAI management in respect of the expectations not only on the chairperson but of the authority itself.  From my background in the medical devices and pharmaceutical industry at a national, European and global level, I have an awareness of the requirements and I have experienced the significant benefits accruing to organisations from the application of standards in a business environment.  In addition, my tenure on the board of IBEC and as president of the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland have provided me with an insight into the issues facing Irish businesses as they position themselves in the ever-evolving economic climate.</p>  <p>  My initial discussions have identified that NSAI has strong vision, mission, values and a good strategic plan to 2020, which was approved by the Minister.  I would like to take the opportunity to commend the work of the outgoing chairperson, Mrs. Julie O'Neill and the board members on the strength of the strategic plan, which will guide my chairmanship, if ratified.  In addition, the NSAI is a contributor to the 2018 Action Plan for Jobs programme, APJ, and Enterprise 2025 Renewed, with a role in the following actions.  The intention is to enhance supports for companies engaged in research, development and innovation, and the roll out of a workplace innovation toolkit.  The intention is to position Ireland to the forefront of sector-specific standards, including in medical technologies, chemicals, food and energy, to stimulate innovation, certainty and international reputation, as well as to manage potential consequences arising from Brexit.</p>  <p>  In the context of those initiatives, it is important to note that the NSAI is not a job creation agency but a key element in the trade infrastructure that underpins our economic activity.  I am advised that the NSAI has strong performance, operating and governance structures aligned to the delivery of its statutory and strategic objectives and the code of practice for the governance of State bodies 2016.</p>  <p>  I will now address the challenges.  The improving economic conditions and preparations in anticipation of a post-Brexit environment will provide challenges for the NSAI in the coming years.  I understand the Department is working closely with management to ensure alignment of the objectives of both the NSAI and the Department.  The intention is to target and refocus standards development activities to strategically support priority sectors identified as key to economic development, such as the medical devices sector.  We must ensure that the NSAI services contribute to Brexit solutions that minimise disruption to Irish business and enhance opportunities for entry to international markets.  We must also structure the organisation to deliver at maximum potential for Irish business.  We must further enhance Ireland's reputation as a country of choice with a robust trade infrastructure which supports the technical requirements of business.</p>  <p>  As a non-commercial body, the NSAI's income continues to be the predominant source of funding with 75% of operating costs met from certification and other fees charged by the authority.  With increasing costs and an ongoing programme of staff investment this model is under pressure.  I have noted that it will be 2020 before management is projecting a return to an operating surplus, which is a key objective for the board.  Brexit will undoubtedly present unique challenges for the NSAI, as well as in European and international institutions where we represent Ireland.  With support from the Department, the NSAI is assessing and positioning itself for the evolution of a final Brexit position.  I believe that the services provided by the NSAI will contribute to the Government's planning and business supports to ensure Irish business will emerge even stronger in a post-Brexit environment.</p>  <p>  My approach to the position of chairman is one of consultation and working with the board, the Minister, the Department and primary stakeholders, including Departments and agencies.  I look forward to working closely with Geraldine Larkin, the CEO, and the management team.  Together, we must ensure the NSAI delivers in line with the strategy, requirements of legislation and national objectives.  All of that will be done within a strong governance framework.  I also see a responsibility for championing the future role of the NSAI, thus ensuring its services are utilised and leveraged within the strategies of Departments.  In that context, I would welcome the opportunity to present to the committee, possibly on an annual basis, regarding the activities of the NSAI if it would consider that to be of benefit.  Within the technical and quality infrastructure that is Ireland's trading economy, the NSAI has an important role to play.  If my nomination is confirmed, I will be proud to contribute to that.  Should members have any questions I would be happy to take them.</p></speech>

This meeting has been convened to consider the Revised Estimate for Vote 37 - Employment Affairs and Social Protection, as referred by the D&aacute;il to the select committee with an instruction to report back to the D&aacute;il.  I welcome the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, and her officials to the meeting and thank them for the briefing material, which has been circulated to committee members.  I propose that the Minister will make an opening statement and members will then be afforded an opportunity to ask questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-27a.378" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2018032700002#D00400"><p>I thank members for the invitation to be meet the committee to discuss the Revised Estimates for my Department.  Department officials have provided detailed briefing material for the use of the committee at this meeting, which includes comprehensive financial and recipient data.  This briefing also provides updates on the Department&rsquo;s performance on its output targets for 2017.</p> <p>  Members know that, while the scale of the Department&rsquo;s expenditure is larger than any other Department, the services it provides are also hugely important.  It is important for the people who receive payments or services weekly or monthly, but it is also very important for society generally.  The Department&rsquo;s work impacts positively on people throughout their lives, from the payment of child benefit to provision of the State pension.  It also provides much-needed support when it is required at various stages in between.</p> <p>  Each week, more than 1.3 million people - pensioners, people with disabilities, people on maternity or sick leave, carers and jobseekers - receive a payment from my Department.  In addition, more than 625,000 families receive child benefit each month in respect of 1.2 million children.  An allocation of slightly more than &euro;20 billion was provided for the Department this year, which represents 36% of gross current Government expenditure and is &euro;155 million more than was provided in the further Revised Estimate for 2017.</p> <p>  This level of expenditure is obviously significant.  It represents not only the level of service that we aim to provide, as a country, to our citizens when they are in need.  In addition, our social protection system is one of the key cornerstones in our social fabric, whereby tax and social insurance income is redirected to people when they are in need at different periods during their lives.  Without these social transfers we would see a society where poverty and social exclusion become more extreme and acute.  Through policy and legislative change, through this Estimates process and through our annual budget cycle, we seek to improve the system, to alleviate poverty further and to support families, children and older people while seeking to ensure that our spending is efficient, which means getting it to the people who need it most.</p> <p>  As I said, &euro;20 billion represents 36% of gross current Government expenditure and it is useful for a moment to consider the areas in which this money is to be spent.  The biggest single block of expenditure in 2018 will be on pensions, which will amount to almost &euro;7.6 billion, or 38% of overall spend.  Expenditure on illness, disability and carer payments will amount to &euro;4.2 billion in 2018, representing 21% of expenditure.  It is interesting to note that these two programmes alone account for almost 60% of total expenditure between them.  Working age income support schemes account for 17% of expenditure, at &euro;3.4 billion this year.  This includes payments for jobseekers, one-parent families, maternity and paternity leave and supplementary welfare allowance.  In parallel, expenditure on employment services, including community employment, the back to education allowance, T&uacute;s, the rural social scheme and various employment and activation programmes, amounts to &euro;823 million this year, or 4.1% of the Department&rsquo;s overall expenditure.</p> <p>  Thankfully, we are seeing expenditure on working age income and employment supports decreasing, both in financial terms and as a proportion of overall expenditure, reflecting the ongoing improvements in the labour market in terms of reducing unemployment and rising employment levels.  We still have a lot to do in this space and we are aiming to reach those furthest from the labour market to ensure that we provide people with as much assistance as possible to get back into either work or education and upskilling.  Expenditure on children and families will account for more than 13% of expenditure at &euro;2.6 billion, of which more than &euro;2 billion is spent on child benefit and &euro;430 million on the working family payment.  Expenditure on supplementary payments like rent supplement, and on agencies like the Citizens Information Board and miscellaneous services, accounts for &euro;814 million, or slightly more than 4% of expenditure.</p><p> To a large extent, the Department anticipates and responds to emerging issues in the economy and society.  The schemes it provides are demand led and expenditure is largely driven by demographic trends and economic factors, including changes in the labour market.  I have mentioned that we have seen welcome and significant improvements in the labour market over recent years.  These improvements have occurred at a rapid pace.  Results from the latest labour force survey show that there are now more than 2.23 million people in employment, an increase of almost 67,000 in 2017.  Reflecting the survey results, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for February this year stands at 6.1%.  Significantly, long-term unemployment reduced from 3.7% to 2.5% during 2017.  These trends in unemployment are reflected in reducing the live register.  At the end of February, there were almost 40,000 fewer people on the live register than the same time last year and 84,000 fewer people than this time two years ago.  The live register peaked at 470,000 in mid-2011 and is now around 230,000, which is a reduction of more than 50%.  The CSO will have new figures on Friday.</p><p> JobPath is one of the initiatives introduced by the Department which seeks to improve the employment outcomes for the long-term unemployed.  Since it commenced in July 2015, 151,000 people have engaged with the service and we have had notification of 30,900 job starts.  This is good news for all involved but JobPath is about more than that.  It is about assisting those who get employment to remain in that employment.  That is why even when a jobseeker has gained employment, he or she is offered a further 52 weeks of in-work support designed to assist those who have been out of the work place longest to stay in it once they have returned.  The statistics are published regularly showing how many jobs are sustained and for how long.  It is a positive service because customer satisfaction is very high.  Overall satisfaction has improved from a mean score of 4.05 in 2016 to 4.26 in 2017 out of a total score of 5.0.  Scores across the key areas of offices, staff, service and processes are very strong and all scores have improved significantly.  Out of 151,000 people who have engaged with the service, there have been complaints in just one third of 1% of cases.  In my humble opinion, this is incredibly impressive.  This is remarkable and is the synopsis of the real story concerning JobPath, which is not perhaps what one would see in some fora.</p><p> The reduction in the live register is freeing up the resources we need to meet demands emerging from demographic changes.  In addition, it provided the basis on which I could take steps in budget 2018  to ensure that everyone could begin to see the benefits accruing from our sustained economic recovery.  In budget 2018, I sought to ensure that people dependent upon fixed incomes saw some improvements.  I ensured that people receiving weekly social welfare payments saw an increase in their rates.  We all acknowledge that they are coming into force this week.  I placed a particular focus on families and children, particularly children living in poverty.  These increases will benefit our pensioners, people with disabilities, carers and jobseekers and will take effect from this week.</p><p> Focusing on families and children, the payment for qualified children on social welfare payments was increased to &euro;31.80 per week, or an increase of &euro;104 per annum per child, the first increase in these payments since 2010.  I also increased the weekly income thresholds in the working family payment for families of up to three children, ensuring that these families get a better return from their earnings.  This change increases the after-tax income of families by &euro;312 per annum.  In addition, I also introduced changes to improve the financial benefit of work for lone parents who take up some employment.  The income disregards for the one-parent family payment and jobseeker's transition payment increased by &euro;20 from &euro;110 to &euro;130 per week.  This change improves the level of take-home earnings of lone parents by up to &euro;520 per annum. I also removed the sunset clause for the back to work family dividend payment.  These changes, excluding the changes in the underlying basic rates of payment, amount to expenditure of an additional &euro;66 million per annum for working families on low incomes.</p><p> I am also conscious of our most vulnerable citizens and increased the fuel season by one week from 26 weeks to 27 weeks.</p><p>In the light of Storm Emma and the recent severe cold snap - the beast from the east - I also ensured persons in receipt of the fuel allowance received an additional fuel payment this year to assist with the cost of higher domestic fuel bills.  Furthermore, budget 2018 provided for the introduction of a new telephone support allowance, which will be paid to social welfare customers in receipt of both the fuel allowance and the living alone increase - people who are living on their own and of limited means.  </p><p> I was also pleased to be able to increase the number of places on the rural social scheme by a further 250 this year.  This was announced last week.  </p><p> While the level of youth unemployment continues to fall, it still remains unacceptably high.  That is why I also announced in budget 2018 the introduction of a new youth employment support scheme later this year.</p><p> A Christmas bonus of 85% was paid to over 1.2 million long-term social welfare recipients such as pensioners, people with disabilities, carers, lone parents and long-term unemployed jobseekers, at a cost of almost &euro;220 million.</p><p> The Department has also provided a briefing on claims processing last year.  For many of my Department&rsquo;s schemes, claims are processed within, or close to, the Department&rsquo;s processing time standards.  However, for some schemes, the processing time standards were not achieved in 2017.  This was particularly the case for schemes such as the carer&rsquo;s allowance and domiciliary care allowance schemes.  While the targets have not been met under these schemes, there have been underlying improvements.  For example, under the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme, the average number of weeks taken to award a claim fell from 19 weeks in 2016 to 14 in 2017.  Under the domiciliary care allowance scheme, the number of claims in hand was 40% lower at the end of 2017 compared to at the start of the year.  My Department is committed to ensuring claims are processed as quickly as possible and that delays are kept to a minimum.  It is worth mentioning that anyone who is awaiting a decision on a claim for a social welfare payment can apply for a means-tested supplementary welfare allowance payment pending the outcome of his or her social welfare application.</p><p> I want to make some comments on the position for pensioners who qualified for the contributory State pension in reduced rate bands since 2012.  Committee members will be aware of the efforts we have made to provide a solution for these pensioners.  I have discussed the matter several times with the committee.  I would like pensioners to feel we have listened and worked on a solution.  In January I was delighted to announce very significant changes in the pension system.  These changes will benefit tens of thousands of pensioners, the majority of whom are women, who spent time out of the workforce caring for their families.  The early availability of a total contributions approach, with substantial home caring credits, will deliver more equitable pension outcomes.  The changes are an indication of the value that we, as a Government and society, place on the women and men, now of pension age, who have worked both outside and inside the home throughout their lives.  The new total contributions approach for pensioners assessed under the 2012 rate band changes will come into effect from the end of this week.  Following the passing of the necessary legislation, my Department will invite over 40,000 pensioners, currently assessed under the 2012 rate band changes, to have their pensions recalculated under the total contributions approach to determine if they qualify for a higher rate of payment.  The first payments will be made from the first quarter of 2019, with payments backdated to 30 March 2018.</p><p> In comparing the Department&rsquo;s expenditure in 2017 with the allocation for 2018 it is important to note that variances in expenditure on most social welfare schemes are typically explained by a combination of factors which include trends, including downwards, in recipient numbers; changes in average weekly payment values, and differences in the number of paydays in any given year.  In addition, comparisons between 2017 and 2018 expenditure figures are further impacted on by the measures introduced in budget 2018, including the increases in the weekly rates of payment, and the payment of an 85% Christmas bonus in 2017, at a cost of almost &euro;220 million.  Provision for such bonuses is made, subject to the financial position of the State in October each year as part of the budgetary process, and is not included in the Revised Estimates at this time.</p><p> We have come through a difficult time for the country, n economic crisis that lasted for too many years.  As the economy continues to recover, we can now begin to see the benefits of more jobs and lower unemployment and ensure everyone in society will gain from this progress.</p><p>Recent budgets have allowed us to look at the social protection system and provide for improvements in the lives of the most vulnerable people who do not see an immediate benefit from the economic recovery but who are seeing improvements in their income.</p><p> My statement has sought to provide the select committee with an overview of the scale and scope of the Department's expenditure and how the significant improvements in the budget are reflected in the Estimates for 2018.  I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies and responding to their questions.</p></speech>

The select committee has agreed that the format of the meeting will be that the Minister will respond to each individual member's questions and that we will not bank Deputies' questions.  I ask members to be specific and direct and the Minister to respond with direct answers.</p> <p>  I will make one comment on the presentation of the accounts, to which the Minister also alluded.  In many cases, the outcome for 2017 is being compared with the Estimate for 2018.  The Christmas bonus is included in one figure and not in the other.  This means that we are not comparing like with like when we see expenditure increases.  Will the Minister to reconsider this approach in the presentation of the figures?  I am aware that the issue is explained in the additional information, but it is not immediately clear when one examines the figures in tabular form.  Is the Minister really telling the committee that she must wait until October before being able to state a Christmas bonus will be paid?  Given that no one expects the Christmas bonus to disappear this year, it should be included in the Estimates process.  The Minister can review the matter in her own time.  The issue is simply that the figures across all headings do not allow for a like for like comparison.  </p> <p>  I call Deputy Willie O'Dea. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-27a.384" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1367" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2018032700002#G00400"><p>I thank the Deputy for allowing me to speak first as I cannot stay for long.  </p> <p>  This is the first time I have scrutinised the budget for social protection, on which I note that expenditure as a proportion of the overall budget stands at 36%, which appears to be high.  However, a comparison with figures for other European states shows that they are much higher, standing at 40% or 41%.  I do not know what the reason is for the difference, whether it relates to the amounts paid or whether the social welfare budgets of other countries cover more areas.  It should be noted, however, that the Irish figure is not high and is lower than the European average.</p> <p>  I welcome the development in pension provision.  I was very much part of the protests that developed on this issue.  Without wishing to detract from the wonderful work done by the Minister on the issue, we would not be congratulating ourselves on this achievement were it not for the men and women who protested, kicked up a fuss, lobbied and ensured their voices were heard.  I am pleased that they will receive their proper entitlements, rather than living under penalties.  However, the decision not to do this retrospectively should be reviewed, particularly as the economy is healthy and growing, as the Minister noted.  These are the men and women who built the country and the economy.  We should provide for retrospective payments far in excess of what is provided for in the document which indicates that the new provisions will kick in on 30 March.  I will probably campaign with the same men and women for the restoration of more back money because it is not fair that it will be provided from 30 March onwards. </p> <p>  The Minister has indicated that the youth unemployment rate is falling and that she intends to introduce a new programme of intervention and activation measures for young people.  Why are they still being penalised?  This is the only cohort of the population which suffered discrimination under austerity that has not had payments restored.  I do no understand the reason we continue to penalise young people who are unemployed.  No attempt is being made to reverse the cuts they suffered.  While there are different categories of young person, their age does not mean that they need less to eat, spend on bus fares or pay rent.  Will the Minister to explain the continued penalties imposed on young people?</p> <p>  My secretary who lived on the lone parent's allowance for a long time and is a founding member of the SPARK organisation which the Minister has met many times makes some interesting points about the restoration of the income disregard which is now back up to &euro;130 a week.</p><p>The point she makes is that it was &euro;127 in 2009, whereas a basket of goods that could have been purchased for &euro;127 in 2009 now costs &euro;147.  There is no genuine restoration of the income disregard which was taken from lone parents during the period of austerity.  There is still a big gap to be filled and it should be looked at.</p><p> My next point concerns climate change.  A stink was kicked up in the D&aacute;il about the need for an extra week's payment for people in fuel poverty and it was very welcome that it was made to them.  However, as we will see more of it, there should be a climate change section to deal with the issues that will arise as a result.  I argue that, given that the Minister is responsible for employment as well as unemployment issues, we need to look at measures to ensure that, if there is another Storm Emma or Storm Ophelia and workers are told by the Government to stay at home, their employers will pay them.  There are tens of thousands of workers who got nothing - zilch - for the two days they were told to stay at home.  They stayed at home for health and safety reasons, not because they did not want to be paid.  This issue needs to be looked at in employment legislation.  All Departments need to look at the impact of climate change but particularly the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p></speech>

If I had my way, the figure would be 41%, but it is 36%.  I will challenge every single year to try to get more in order to be able to do some of the stuff we want to do collectively.  Nonetheless, there is a difference between our budget and those of many other European countires.  As such, we are not necessarily comparing like with like.  The budgets of other European countries include a lot of health and education stuff that we do not deal with in the Department because it comes under other Departments.  However, that does not discount the fact that I would like it to be more and the Deputy can count on me asking for more next year.</p> <p>  I hear the Deputy loud and clear on back money for pensioners.  Women, in particular, have been coming into all of our offices since the announcement was made.  The difficulty I have is that I can only make a change when I bring forward new legislation.  I cannot backdate the legislation to 2012 when the law was changed by the Parliament.  The new law I am going to bring in will have an effective date of 30 March.  I can only bring in a new law and make the changes now.  It is not about having a conversation with somebody about where we are going to get the money, rather it is about those who were adjudicated on under the law of the land for the past five or six years.  It is only because I am bringing forward new legislation that there will be a change to how they are adjudicated on.  I have no means of changing what happened in the past and while that may be difficult to hear, unfortunately, it is the reality, but that is not to say the Deputy will not support people politically and do what she has to do.  If she can come up with a solution, that will be deadly, but what I am being told is that I can only bring forward new legislation to effect change, which is what I am doing.</p></speech>

Effectively, what we are doing is bringing forward a new law to recognise that people were outside the workforce for a variety of reasons.  In most cases, we know that it was women who were rearing their families.  We need to be cognisant of the fact that they were not in the system.  Either way, it is not unique to this legislation.  It is as if we introduced new legislation to outlaw the murdering of cats, although there is probably already a law-----</p></speech>

If we were to introduce a new law today, we would not be able to charge somebody under it for something they did last year.  Unfortunately, that is the way it is.</p> <p>  On the income disregards for lone parent families, the Deputy is right that the cost of living has gone up.  I would have increased it by more if we had more money.  I have every intention of continuing to do so for as long as I am lucky enough to be in this role and able to look after the most vulnerable in society.  We are all aware, not just from ESRI reports but also from the physical evidence of meeting people, that the most vulnerable financially in our society are those living with disabilities and lone parent families.  They are the ones who need to be supported in whatever way we can support them in the next budgetary process and thereafter until they have a good quality standard of living.  I can give the Deputy a guarantee that as long as I am in this seat, that will be one of my priorities.</p><p>In particular, I want to address the issue of the 120,000 children who are living in consistent poverty.  Thankfully, that figure is decreasing, but it is not decreasing half fast enough.</p><p> On youth unemployment, we will be introducing a new scheme later this year for the under 26s.  As it will be on a voluntary basis, no one will be made to join it.  There will, however, be a large uptake, given the type of scheme that it will be.  I am looking forward to launching it in the next year in the light of the response we are receiving.</p><p> I will disagree with Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith who I know will disagree with me on the issue of changing the payments.  We are not asking anyone under 25 years of age to live on a lower payment than others.  They have the option of returning to training, taking courses and upskilling, for example, to become carers.  There are a variety of means for them to increase their payments to what they could be were they jobseekers over 26 years of age, if that is what they want.  I make no apologies for not wanting people younger than 26 years to be on the dole.  I want them to be working, which is why we are aggressively working via JobPath with young people who have spent more than 12 months on the live register.  We are finding them jobs.</p></speech>

If money is a difficulty for them, they have options to increase their payments.</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy on the issue of fuel poverty.  We had this conversation a couple of months ago when I appeared before the joint committee as opposed to the select committee.  I am undertaking some work that will further inform any decision we might make in budget 2019.

On pensions which was the topic of Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's final question, I am taken aback by the Minister's announcement today that there will be no question of compensating people from 2012 onwards, apart from what she has already announced.  My understanding of the Constitution is that it only prohibits retrospective legislation in the case of criminal law or revenue matters, for example, where someone is penalised, and that there is no prohibition on retrospective legislation to compensates people.  We can debate that matter again.  My understanding is that, regardless of who will gain from the changes the Minister has announced in respect of 2012 pensioners, thoe changes will kick in from this week but that they will not be paid until next year.  When will they be paid?  I presume it will be when the pension increase comes through next year, whenever that might be.  How will they be paid?  Will they be paid in one lump sum or will they be paid the arrears over a period?</p> <p>  On pensions generally, the Minister had to find an extra &euro;208 million because an additional 16,610 people had reached the age of 66 years.  That gives an indication of the looming pension crisis and how badly it is accelerating.  Does the Minister accept that one way to deal with the issue is to abolish mandatory retirement?  I read the Government's roadmap on pensions, in which there seems to be an implicit acceptance that, were mandatory retirement to be abolished, it might have a considerable impact on the pension bill in the future.</p><p>The Minister will be aware that Deputy John Brady and I have proposed Bills.  If they are defective in some way, I am sure we could sit around the table to rectify them and make them pristine.  Has anybody calculated what the Minister would save by introducing legislation to prevent people from being mandatorily retired before pension age?  If there was a link between mandatory retirement and pension age, people would not have to retire before reaching pension age.  Does the Minister have statistics that specify how many pensioners rely solely on the State pension because they have no other income?  How many rely mainly on it?  Does the Minister have figures that indicate the number between the ages of 65 and 66 years who are claiming jobseekers' allowance?</p><p> I would like to ask a few questions that relate to working age and employment supports.  Can the Minister tell us how much it would cost if we were to pay the same rate of jobseekers' allowance and benefit to everybody from the age of 18 years?  I am sure she has such a figure.  How much extra would it cost?  I note that Intreo is compiling a report on the effectiveness of the local employment services and jobs clubs, etc.  Is the effectiveness of Intreo in upskilling people and finding placements for them being reviewed?  I understand the JobPath programme is being reviewed.  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong in that regard.</p><p> The number who claim disability allowance has jumped by 6,270, a considerable increase.  There was a greater increase of 8.2% in the number in receipt of carer's allowance.  I presume the ageing population is the reason for the latter increase.  Will the Minister explain the increase in the number claiming disability allowance?</p><p> The Minister referred to domiciliary care allowance and carer's allowance when she spoke about targeting.  It is made clear on page 53 of the Estimates that the target of 15 weeks, or four months, was achieved in just 2% of domiciliary care allowance cases in 2015 and 2016.  In 2017 the figure increased to 24%, which is still very poor.  The target was met in 44% of carer's allowance cases.  People are waiting a long time to be paid these benefits which are means tested.  I know that they receive arrears, etc.  In the case of carer's allowance, just 44% of applicants receive a decision within four months.  In the case of domiciliary care allowance, fewer than 25% receive a decision within four months.  This shows the urgent need for improvements in this area.</p><p> In the case of children, has there been a review of how the working family payment is working?  What jobs are being taken up as a result?  I note that half of the increase of &euro;4.4 million in the allocation for the Citizens Information Board relates to administration.  Will the Minister explain exactly what it relates to?</p><p> I will conclude by asking the Minister about her figures for control savings.  A projected figure of &euro;510 million has been cited.  I take it that it refers to the extra amount the State would have to pay if these anti-fraud measures were not in place.  Are there figures to show how much was saved last year as a result of people being pursued and prosecuted for making fraudulent claims?  Will the Minister give us an indication of the total overpayments?  Most overpayments occur innocently as a result of errors on the part of the Department or the individual.  What percentage of errors can be attributed to fraud?  Annual savings of &euro;510 million were projected for the past couple of years.  The same projection has been made for this year, which means that there has been no significant improvement as a result of the anti-fraud campaign.</p></speech>

I am surprised that the Deputy is surprised by what he considers to have been an announcement today.  It was not an announcement.</p><p>It was made clear in the D&aacute;il in January that I would introduce new legislation and what that new legislation would do.  That is what the couple of hundred people outside the gates were told.  In the correspondence I have received from most of them, there is an understanding there will be a new adjudication process for their cases using a different method, namely, the total contributions model.  The payment will come into place in the first quarter of 2019.  Whatever back payment is owed to someone from 30 March 2018 will be made in one lump sum on the first day after the adjudication.  Based on the adjudication, the pensioner will move to a new payment if he or she has decided to change payments.</p><p> The Deputy's second point was that he wanted me to abolish the mandatory retirement age, but my difficulty with that is there is no such thing as a mandatory retirement age.  I cannot abolish something that does not exist.  I have considered a number of ways of getting around what it is the Deputy is trying to fix.  I have met industry representatives.  The reason we cannot introduce a new law to the effect that, for example, Willie O'Dea cannot be made to retire at 65 years of age if he wants to work until he is 66, 67 or so on is the terms and conditions included in his contract are a matter for him and his employer.  Presumably, he would have signed that contract; therefore, if he wanted to change its terms, it would be a matter between him and his employer and it would not be for the State to intervene.  However, I have tried to ask employers to be cognisant of the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives and a valuable resource in an environment in which employers are telling us that they have recently been finding it more difficult to get workers.  Thankfully, that is a new problem for us.  They are proactively going to seek to extend contracts.  They have agreed with me that, where new contracts are concerned - for example, if someone's nephew was to start working in Dunnes Stores tomorrow - they should reflect whatever is the current age of retirement when workers retire.  As we all know, someone who is now in his or her 20s will not retire at 66 or 67 years of age.  The likelihood is that he or she will retire at 68 years after the legislation has been changed.  A contract of employment should reflect the reality as opposed to some long-standing practice of setting an age of 65 years, despite the change to 70.  I am trying to get industry to change its practice which I hope will seep in and result in people actually wanting to work for longer.  Possibly through the new pensions roadmap, I am proposing that we devise ideas on how to incentivise people, from a State pension perspective, to remain working for longer where they are in a position to do so.  Nothing has been finalised, but we are considering the matter.  It is not as simple as introducing a brand new law that no one can be made to retire at 65 years of age, as it is on a contract by contract basis.</p><p> If the Deputy does not mind, I will revert to him on the issue.  I do not have with me the figures for the numbers of people who rely solely or mostly on their pension.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-27a.414" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2018032700002#L00300"><p>I will send them to the Chairman in the next couple of days.</p> <p>  To reply to the question on working age and the possibility of giving everyone under 25 years of age an increase to the level of the full unemployment payment made to everyone aged over 25 years, I will revert to the Deputy on the issue in the next couple of days.  I beg the committee's pardon, I have the information.  The cost of restoring jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance to the full rate for all recipients under 26 years of age would be &euro;90 million in a single year.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about a review.  I read in the newspapers that a review of JobPath was under way, but I do not know from where that information came.  Through the Intreo and JobPath offices, we work with our two contractors, Seetec and Turas Nua, very closely on a daily basis.  As such, there is a constant review of the cases sent to and returned from JobPath.  We have daily and weekly figures for the numbers of people who are successfully employed and retained in employment thereafter.  There is also a constant review of our internal structures in the case of JobsPlus, jobs clubs, Intreo offices and controls.  We regularly monitor the services we provide so as to ensure they are right for those who are looking for jobs.</p><p> The disability allowance increase is due to demographics.  The large increase is not specific to Ireland.  We are very much in line with all of the trends across the European Union.  Thankfully, people are living longer.  In many cases, they are leading healthier lives.  Those who are not healthy are pressing for various supports, as reflected in some of our schemes.</p><p> The working family payment is under constant review.  I want to be able to tailor it to make it more effective.  We started that process last year.  My predecessor, the Taoiseach, started it before I took over from him in this portfolio in June last year.  I made some changes in the budget in October 2017 and I am planning to make more this year.  The working family payment is under continuous review.  I want to make sure it reaches the widest number of people on low and middle incomes.  This is necessary not only to make sure they have a decent quality and standard of living but also to allow them to upskill and perhaps find a better job and career, as we have discussed.  The report on the working family payment being prepared for the committee is due to be given to us in June.  I hope to be able to come here at that stage to discuss my plans in that regard and get a buy-in and suggestions from members of the committee.</p><p> The Deputy asked me to explain why the level of control savings was on a par with that in previous years.  Our ambition every year is to continue to go after people claiming payments to which they are not entitled under particular schemes.  We will make sure our money is directed towards those who are entitled to receive payments under the various schemes.  I do not need to explain again the control savings of &euro;510 million.  The Deputy is familiar with the multiplication factor used.  The actual or real value of the savings is significantly less than &euro;510 million.  The Deputy is right when he describes the figure as a representation of what the cost to the Department of making additional payments would have been if the control savings had not been made and the payments had continued.  Overpayments of &euro;111 million were made in 2017,  just &euro;1.8 million of which resulted from departmental error.  In certain cases, we paid people who should not have been paid.</p><p> The Deputy also asked about the Citizens Information Board.  He is correct when he says an extra &euro;4.357 million has been allocated this year.  We were very pleased to be able to give this money to the board to pay for various things.  For example, &euro;327,000 is being provided to deliver on commitments made in legislation passed in both Houses on sign language permission, as set out in the national disability inclusion strategy.  A further &euro;650,000 is being provided for the replacement of the current wide area network infrastructure.  The improvement in the telephone systems will facilitate the development of high speed broadband links between the Citizens Information Board and its 220 partner delivery services.  Some &euro;1.4 million is being provided to cover the estimated cost of external restructuring arising from the board's decision to restructure the governance arrangements and reduce the network of regional companies from 93 to 16.  A further &euro;1.98 million is being provided to meet critical staffing needs across the 42 citizens information companies, the citizens information telephone service and the 53 MABS companies.  All of this adds to the total budget of &euro;53.05 million for the Citizens Information Board.</p></speech>

I thank them for coming before the committee.  I want to touch on a few areas.  </p> <p>  Page 42 of the document presented to the committee refers to additional money for branch managers.  I have sent correspondence to the Minister on the ongoing difficulties facing 58 branch managers who have engaged with the Department, but I have yet to receive a response.  Agreement was reached during considerable discussions, but out of the blue the Department withdrew from them.  To say the least, it was bizarre that it cited competition law in doing so.  Has the additional &euro;2.7 million been provided to address the payment issues that have arisen from the increased workload faced by branch managers?</p><p>Is it a new payment for branch managers agreed in negotiations between the Minister and the association?</p><p> On pensions, Deputy O'Dea referred to the mandatory retirement age.  As the Minister will be aware, I introduced legislation on this matter which has completed Second Stage.  I am awaiting a money message from the Government to allow the Bill to advance to Committee Stage.  Late last year, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, announced changes which would allow public service workers to remain in the workforce beyond their retirement age.  Strict guidelines will apply to these new measures, including a condition that persons seeking to continue in employment must first retire and be rehired at the lowest payscale in the relevant employment.  I realise this matter does not come within the Minister's remit.  Despite major concerns being expressed about these changes, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has not introduced heads of a Bill or legislation to give effect to them.  Legislation to abolish the mandatory retirement age could be introduced and older citizens who want to remain in the workforce would thank us for doing so.  In that sense, I disagree with the Minister's response to Deputy O'Dea's question on this matter.  Legislation could be introduced if there was the political to do so.</p><p> On the changes introduced in 2012 and the Minister's welcome announcement regarding her efforts to address the matter, great credit must go to organisations such as Age Action Ireland, which made this the political issue of the day.  While the vast majority of the citizens impacted by the issue are women, a sizeable number of men are also affected.  I commend Age Action Ireland and all the older citizens who mobilised and made their voices heard on this matter.  Will the Minister confirm that to qualify for a full pension under the total contributions approach, a person will require a full 40 years of credits?  Is that the position because people are concerned?</p><p> An issue arises regarding total contributions and self-employed people who became sick and no longer qualified for credited payments.  This is a serious issue which must be examined.  Is the Minister considering this matter and what provision is being made for self-employed persons?</p><p> On employment support programmes such as the community employment scheme, T&uacute;s and the back-to-education scheme, the Minister stated that the drop in spending under the community employment and T&uacute;s schemes was due to a "decline in the number of participants arising from the improved labour market."  Why have referrals to the JobPath scheme soared, while community employment schemes are struggling to fill places?  Is the Minister aware of the difficulty T&uacute;s and community employment programmes are experiencing filling places?  As I indicated, referrals to JobPath are soaring, whereas the number of referrals to these schemes is plummeting. </p><p> Last week, representatives of the Irish Local Development Network, ILDN, appeared before the joint committee.  They stated that there was a direct correlation between JobPath commencing operations and the decline in the number of referrals to their schemes.  They cited the example of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown where in 2015, the year JobPath was established, the number of referrals to T&uacute;s declined from 722 to 261.</p><p>In another area - this applies throughout the State - the local employment service, which was contracted for 20,050 referrals, has only received 15,900 referrals, a drop of 20% in referrals.</p></speech>

I am unsure who has told Deputy Brady that the workload has increased, but it has actually drastically decreased in recent years because our jobseekers have drastically decreased.  The workload of our branch managers has thankfully decreased from a jobseekers perspective, as has the workload of all the actual offices that are Department offices rather than branch offices.  Since they get paid on a work basis the revenue going into those branches has dropped in recent years because the workload has dropped.  That is why we sought to have a conversation with those involved.  We wanted to talk about giving them an increase in what they are being paid currently on the current workload for potentially changing practices and using more online technology and genuinely having a renegotiation.</p> <p>  Those negotiations were taking place productively but not without some difficulty - I do not think any negotiations are ever as sweet and pie.  Anyway, we had a grand conversation last year.  We came to an agreement shortly after Christmas.  The reason we had to pull out at that stage was because we received legal advice that what we were doing was close to touching the procurement rules.  It was right up to the nose and stretching to being illegal in so far as we were renegotiating a contract without actually putting it out to full public tender.</p> <p>  Now, we have pulled back temporarily to check the legal advice.  We have now gone back into negotiations with the branch managers' association and the talks are being chaired by Kevin Duffy.  I figure we are close to closing an agreement.  I imagine it will happen if not in a matter of days then definitely within a matter of weeks.</p> <p>  The talks have been constructive.  Under the final deal, when we reach it, the figure will be significantly higher than the figure mentioned by Deputy Brady.  This is because of the negotiations that we have had, as chaired by Kevin Duffy in recent months.  We expect a successful outcome.</p> <p>  Anyway, it is certainly not because their workload has increased.  It is because their workload has decreased.  Indeed, it has decreased drastically in recent years because the live register has decreased drastically, thankfully.</p> <p>  With respect, Deputy Brady and I do not agree on a great deal.  I do not think that mandatory retirement is set out in law.  Deputy Brady seems to think it is.  I definitely know that in practice people are made to retire at 65 years of age, but that is because of what their contract says and that is what is being carried out.  What we need to try to do is to change their contracts.</p> <p>  Much as Deputy Brady might have great faith in me and might think that I am running the whole shop, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, is the person responsible for all public sector employees and he is the person responsible for bringing forward the legislation.  I believe he has brought forward heads of the Bill.  He will bring it to the relevant committee to tease through what the actual negotiations had been with unions and public sector representative bodies.  The role from his perspective is to recognise that people in the public sector are living longer healthier lives and want to contribute.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, wants to find a mechanism to say that if they want to stay working until they are 70 years of age, they can do so.  Again, I do not have that responsibility.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Brady completely with regard to the advocacy group and the work Age Action Ireland does.  I think it is an incredible company.  I think the people the company works with and for are among the most good-natured group of people we have as citizens in the country.  We all know that woe betides anyone who messes with them.  Such a person will feel a real clip on the ear.  That is why I like working with Age Action Ireland.  The company is incredibly proactive and exceptionally reasonable.  Those involved do a great deal of helping and assisting when things need to be changed.  They were most helpful and co-operative with me during the time I needed their help.  I am keen to put my thanks to them on record.</p> <p>  I get the feeling some Deputies believe that when we start the public consultation on the total contributions model we will already have an end game in mind, but we do not.  The reason we are going to do a comprehensive public consultation process is to arrive at the end game.  This is one of the most sizeable reforms that we have seen to a particularly large policy in many years and we want to get it right.</p><p>The only way we will get this right is by listening to all of the people who will be impacted by it.  That includes pensioners and advocacy organisations, and might include a person in their 20s or a person in their 50s or 60s.  We will carry out a very public consultation process whereby any of the impacts, whether on self-employed people or people who are retired already and who may be able to move to the total contributions category if there is a window, will be laid out.  That will help us achieve the desired outcome.  There will be straw men put out so that we can go up and down the options and have a look at what it would look like, based on various suggestions, but we certainly have no end game in sight yet.  That will be very much determined by everybody's input over the next couple of months.  I hope to be in a position by the end of this year where we can all collectively say what we want, and where we will all feel that we have had some sort of valuable input into what the retirement situation will be when we all retire in a few years.  </p><p> I am always baffled when people think that one scheme is in competition with another scheme.  The new figures have been signed off on by Cabinet today, and the live register is consistently going down.  The aim of the Department is to help the 230,000 people still on the live register to get back to work, in the most effective way we can.  In some instances that will mean sending people to jobs clubs.  It might mean that people are sent to JobsPlus, or that they are put on a T&uacute;s scheme, which is compulsory.  For some people it might mean community employment, CE, which is entirely voluntary.  Deputies are being told that CE schemes are reporting that people are not being referred to CE schemes.  The Department never referred people to CE schemes.  It is an entirely voluntary scheme.  The jobs are advertised and people on the live register apply for those jobs.  That has not changed.  We are sending people with huge ambition to JobPath in their tens of thousands because we want those people - particularly the people who are long-term unemployed - in the workforce, because that is what they want.  I make no apologies for wanting to help people who present themselves as looking for work to help them get the type of work and the type of training they need to get the kind of job they want to get.  However, no course or scheme is in competition with another.  There are a variety of places and a variety of schemes-----</p></speech>

What did it cost?  People on the household benefit package were impacted just as much as others.  I am aware that the fuel allowance is means tested and is specifically for people who need it.  However, under the household benefit package many people are having gas or electricity paid for.  Those people did not get paid that extra amount.  How many people are on that package and how much would it cost to pay them the fuel allowance?  They were still badly impacted, and were told to put on their heating so that they would not get cold or ill.</p> <p>  Social Justice Ireland brought out a report last week which stated that more than 100,000 working Irish people are at risk of poverty.  The research found that 780,000 people live in poverty in Ireland today, and that over one quarter of those are children.  The point was made that tax credits are not refundable.  That should change.  Has the Department looked at that idea?  I do not know whether the Minister has seen the report or not.  I can send it to her.  Social Justice Ireland said that the failure to make tax credits refundable is totally unacceptable.  </p></speech>

That people who are working are in poverty in this day and age is a serious issue.  The report is called Poverty Focus 2018, if the Minister wants to check it out.</p> <p>  I refer to the pension legislation brought in this year.  This Government and previous Governments have been very creative in creating situations where people who were hiding money in offshore accounts were protected by way of the amnesties and so on.  They did not have to pay the tax they owed.  Here we have a cohort of people, particularly women, who over the last six years have been discriminated against because of legislation that was introduced in 2012.  The Department should have the knowledge and experience to be able to come up with an amnesty for those people, or something that would declare this legislation was discriminatory.  There should be some sort of compensation scheme, or something like that, for that period of time.  Those who got their pensions in 2012 have lost out big time, financially, over a period of six years.  It was highlighted in 2012.  It was not as if it was under the carpet, or Members of the D&aacute;il did not raise with the then Minister how it would impact on people.  It was only when the good people of this country realised what was going on, in critical numbers, and went out on the streets that the Minister was forced to review the situation.  Something has to be put in place.  Pensioners will continue to campaign to get that money backdated to 2012, and I will certainly support them.</p> <p>  I refer to the youth employment scheme the Minister will introduce later this year.  Can we get a report on that?  How exactly will it be run?  Who is running it?  What is the whole protocol around it?</p> <p>  I refer to community employment schemes.  I was at a meeting of the canal communities local drugs task force where people were devising a strategy to link in with the national drugs and alcohol strategy.  They made the point that they have heard that community employment schemes are now being told that workers have to be job ready.  Community employment schemes will now be geared towards people being job ready.    That will raise the question of how the community will be supported through community employment schemes into the future.  That is a serious question if that is the way the Department is approaching community employment schemes, namely, being geared towards people being job ready rather than playing that important role in a community, which needs support for task forces and that sort of thing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-27a.436" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1273" speakername="Joe Carey" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2018032700002#Q00200"><p>I welcome the Minister and thank her for her positive and open engagement with the committee.  It is important to recognise the huge progress that has been made in terms of reducing the live register figures.  The Minister said in her opening statement that there was a 50% reduction from 2011 to now.  The numbers are still high enough and there remains much work to be done on them, but it is important to recognise the work that has been done.  That work has led to a position whereby increases in the weekly payments to pensioners, people with disabilities, carers and jobseekers can be made.  Those increases will come about this week.</p> <p>  I refer to community employment, which a number of members have raised.  The Minister has said she will perhaps tweak the scheme.  There are issues around people who are eligible.  Some people would like to stay on in a community employment scheme, but it is regarded as a training scheme as opposed to an employment scheme.  The Minister received a delegation from Clare County Council on this issue.  The delegation, which included supervisors on community employment schemes, left the Minister with some proposals to bring about changes in community employment that would have a positive impact.  I refer to little tweaks that would enable people to stay on schemes longer, or make people eligible.  The Minister might inform us if she has looked at that question.  When will she be in a position to make an announcement on that?</p> <p>  I welcome the additional placements for the rural social scheme, RSS.  That scheme has a massive impact on rural Ireland and on a county like County Clare, so I very much welcome that.</p><p> Something that concerns me are the processing times for the carer's allowance.  A period of 14 weeks is a long time for someone who is waiting for that payment and who is providing a service to a person.  Does the Department have a target to reduce that processing time for this year?  It is important that we would have one.  I recognise the Minister's work in addressing the anomaly that was there in the State pension.  The compromise position the Minister has reached is a sensible one and it has been recognised by Age Action Ireland and by people who have campaigned for it.  I recognise the Minister's work in Cabinet to bring about that solution.  It is a workable solution and I welcome it.</p></speech>

I refer to the community employment and T&uacute;s schemes.  The community employment scheme, in particular, has been around a long time.  It has tended to evolve to reflect the economy, whether there was high unemployment and so forth.  Apart from the benefit to the individuals who are participating in the schemes, they have a broader community benefit.  It is important that the terms and conditions of the schemes are kept under constant review, both from the point of view of the community good and the individual, but also in the context of where the economy is.</p> <p>  There is a vote in D&aacute;il, so we will conclude very quickly.  I refer to a point that Deputy O'Dea raised.  In regard to the Citizen's Information board, it was surprising that there were no savings as a result of the restructuring.  I refer to mortgage interest supplement, which I have discussed with the Minister before.  The Estimate for this year is zero, so how are those people being funded, or what has happened to them?</p></speech>
