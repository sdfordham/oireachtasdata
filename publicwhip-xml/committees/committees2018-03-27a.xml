It is not sufficient to put one's phone on silent mode as this will maintain a level of interference with the broadcasting system.  The next item is consideration of a motion regarding the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2017 (Increase in Number of Ordinary Members to An Bord Plean&aacute;la) Order 2018 with the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government with special responsibility for housing and urban development, Deputy Damien English, referred by the order of the Houses to the joint committee.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Minister of State, Deputy English, and his officials, Ms Niamh Dew and Mr. Terry Sheridan, to the meeting this morning.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of a long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or persons outside the House, or any official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I call on the Minister to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-27a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018032700002#D00300"><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for affording me, along with Mr. Sheridan and Ms Dew, the opportunity to present to the committee on this draft order which proposes to increase by one member, on a temporary basis, the number of ordinary members of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p> <p>  The background to the draft order stems from the new additional functions of An Bord Plean&aacute;la in dealing with applications for strategic housing developments, SHDs.  Many members of the committee will be very familiar with these new arrangements which were introduced by the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016.</p> <p>  In brief, the Act provided for new streamlined arrangements, which came into operation on 3 July 2017, to enable planning applications for large scale housing developments, SHDs, of 100 housing units or more, or student accommodation developments of 200 bed spaces or more, to be made directly to the board for determination.  These arrangements are intended to provide greater certainty for developers in terms of the timelines for planning decision-making, while also facilitating the earlier provision of much needed housing supply and helping to address the current housing supply shortage situation.</p> <p>  Under the SHD arrangements, a developer is required to firstly engage in pre-application consultations in relation to a proposed SHD development with the board and with the local planning authority, with such pre-application consultation phase having to be completed within nine weeks.  Where a planning application is subsequently submitted to the board, the board is required to make a determination on an application within a period of 16 weeks from the submission of that application.  These new fast track arrangements have the potential to result in planning decisions for concerned large developments being made within 25 weeks of commencement of the pre-application consultation, as against the more normal two stage planning process which can, in certain circumstances, take up to 18 to 24 months from initial design stage to ultimate approval.  I appreciate it can be shorter than that, but in some cases that has happened in the past.</p> <p>  In order to ensure that An Bord Plean&aacute;la had the necessary structures and resources in place to undertake these additional functions, the legislation provided for the establishment of a new strategic housing division of the board to decide on these housing applications.  The division requires two additional ordinary board members on a temporary basis, while the new arrangements are in place.  Separately, and in addition, the filling of an additional dedicated ten professional and administrative posts was sanctioned by our Department to support this division and the relevant staff are in place since 2017.</p> <p>  Over the last number of years the board has operated with a membership of nine members, consisting of the chair and eight ordinary members.  However, section 104 of the Planning Act provides that the board can consist of a maximum of up to ten members, the chair and nine ordinary board members.  Therefore, in January of this year, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, appointed a ninth ordinary member to the board, thereby bringing the board to its full complement of ten, as provided for in the legislation and thereby filling the first of the two additional ordinary members positions required for the new SHD arrangements.</p> <p>  Section 104 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, also provides that the Minister may by order temporarily increase the number of ordinary members of the board, where this is necessary to enable it to fulfil its duties and objectives.  Such an order must be laid in draft before both Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before it can be made.</p> <p>  As indicated, and in light of the tight statutory timeframes associated with determining applications under the SHD provisions, it is necessary to utilise this provision now.  The order before members is required so that the Minister can make a further appointment to the board, ensuring that the second additional member required for the new SHD arrangements are in place.</p><p>Under the 2016 Act, the SHD arrangements which it introduced will operate initially until 31 December 2019.  Subject to review, they may be extended to 31 December 2021, the end date of the Rebuilding Ireland action plan.  Accordingly, the draft order proposes to increase the membership of the board by one member, initially for the period until 31 December 2019, with a view to extending the appointment in accordance with the legislation, if required, at a later date.  Board members are generally appointed by the Minister from candidates nominated by prescribed organisations.  Subject to the necessary Oireachtas approval, it is the Minister&rsquo;s intention to select a nominee for appointment as a board member at the earliest possible date.</p><p> I support the making of this necessary order.  As I outlined, the SHD provisions were introduced to speed up the planning decision-making process for large-scale housing developments, with a view to addressing urgently the housing supply shortage.  The additional board member is vital to ensure there will be sufficient capacity within the board to undertake its additional functions related to SHDs and in order that SHD planning determinations can be made within the fast-track timeline prescribed under the 2016 Act.  </p><p> I look forward to engaging with the committee and will endeavour to answer questions committee members may have.</p></speech>

At what stage are they applications?  When the legislation was going through, we raised the question of why consideration had not been given to imposing statutory timelines on An Bord Plean&aacute;la for all planning decisions.  They apply to all local authorities which arguably have a bigger job to do in having to go through full applications, as opposed to an appeal to the board.  Is there any impact on non-strategic housing development decisions taken by the board of a lengthening of the timelines by virtue of having to deal with larger applications under the new legislation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-27a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018032700002#E00300"><p>From when the new arrangements were put in place in July up to 21 March, the board received 47 valid pre-application consultation requests, for the initial nine-week period, in respect of which 36 opinions have issued, with a further 11 due in the coming weeks.  A total of four of the 36 opinions indicated that the documents submitted gave a reasonable basis on which to submit planning applications, while 32 required further consideration.  Of the 36 opinions, 19 planning applications for strategic housing developments have been brought forward to the board which has issued a decision in seven of those cases.  It has granted permission for the construction of a total of 523 residential units, mainly apartments, and 3,408 student bed spaces.  It has refused permission for the construction of a total of 1,040 residential units, consisting of 478 houses and 562 apartments.  All of the decisions were made within the 16-week timeframe.  I have an overview of the seven cases decided if members want to have it.</p></speech>

Permission for the student accommodation at Belfield was granted with conditions.  Permission for the residential development on Ballyogan Road was refused.  Permission for the residential development at Barna in Galway was also refused.  Permission for the student accommodation on Cork Street was granted, while permission for the student accommodation in Cork was granted on 7 March.  Permission for the student accommodation and residential developments in Stillorgan, County Dublin, was granted with conditions on 15 March, incorporating 576 student bed spaces and 103 apartments.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-27a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018032700002#E00700"><p>There are 523 residential units and 3,408 student bed spaces.  We set out a specific student accommodation action plan with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Department of Education and Skills.  We wanted to drive that agenda and have purpose-built student accommodation on or close to campus which should also free housing for others.</p><p>There has been a push on there.  All our education players have been encouraged to become involved in that and to do more of their own alongside private developers.  There are 12 decisions to be made.  The remaining 12 strategic housing development applications consist of 3,420 residential units, which comprise 2,373 houses, 1,047 apartments and 691 student bed spaces.  Quite a number of residential units are coming through.  I have no problem providing a note on that in order to give members some information on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-27a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018032700002#F00200"><p>Perfect.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-27a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018032700002#F00300"><p>The Deputy's second question concerned the statutory timelines.  When we had a debate on this matter in the Seanad and in the D&aacute;il, that was considered.  Generally, 80% to 82% of An Bord Plean&aacute;la's cases are dealt with within the statutory timelines.  It has a service level agreement with our Department to reach that target.  In 2017, it was lower than that and only 65% to 66% of cases were dealt with within the statutory timelines, mainly because the board was down members and was awaiting appointees.  It was also seeking more staff, which we facilitated during 2017.  We will monitor that.  Sometimes the 20% of cases that are not dealt with within the specific timelines comprise high profile ones.  That is something we monitor and we discuss it in the context of the service level agreement.  We can review it and discuss it further, if we are of the view that we need to change the rules.  We need some certainty around timelines from the planning system.  The main reason for the changes we made in 2016 was to introduce some certainty and to encourage people who owned land - that is, unzoned - to bring forward applications.  We gave a commitment that we would give applicants a decision within a certain timeframe.  That assists with the costs involved and the business case in order to fast-track planning.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked if this had any impact on non-strategic housing developments.   We have not noticed anything different but we can do a check and do a trawl to be sure about that.  By increasing the overall complement of the board and meeting the staff requirements following the review in 2016, An Bord Plean&aacute;la should be in a better position to be able to reach its overall targets.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-27a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018032700002#F00400"><p>That last point is important.  In an effort to fast-track the larger developments, we do not want small builders who build 20, 40 or 80 units to experience much longer delays.  If there was a way to track and monitor that, it would be useful.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-27a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018032700002#F00500"><p>We will certainly track that and consult the board on it.  I have made it clear that we have proposed this order on foot of a commitment given that if we changed the legislation to provide for fast-track developments An Bord Plean&aacute;la needed additional board members.  A specific team was set aside for that, therefore, it should not influence the board's day-to-day processes.  If both Houses of the Oireachtas accept this, it will strengthen the position of the board to make sure applications are dealt with within the timelines and that nobody else will suffer.</p></speech>

Is there a common trend in that respect, or could information be provided in order to tweak the system to improve that position?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-27a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018032700002#F00700"><p>There is a number of reasons.  I do not have a  breakdown of the trends, but I could ask the board about that.  Naturally, the board will come back to us if there are specific changes it would recommend.  Generally, this process is to make sure we have a high standard of application in the first place.</p></speech>

That nine-week phase is to make sure we get good quality applications and that nobody's time is wasted.  The 32 applicants would have been given different reasons setting out how they could improve their applications; it was not that they were refused-----</p></speech>

If they want to come back, they can still apply.  Only four got a straightforward response; they were told their applications were at the top level, but 19 applications have come in.  Some of those 32 combined applications and they would have made changes before they formally applied.  The nine-week period is to guide best practice and the submitting of the best applications.  I will consult the board to see if there are any trends coming through.  If there is anything that we need to discuss, we can do that.</p></speech>

The chair of the board has specifically said that she would like the candidates for these positions to have an architectural and engineering background.  The most recent appointee was Michelle Fagan, who I believe has an architectural background.  There are five panels.  The candidates are nominated.  The Minister chooses from those and it makes the appointments process correct; they are ministerial appointments.  It is hoped that if the Houses clear this on Thursday, the Minister should be able to work from the existing list of nominated people, so we will not have to waste any time.</p> <p>  Regarding Deputy &Oacute; Broin's point, housing developments in general are being prioritised by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  There is an agreement that priority is given to all housing developments, regardless of their size.</p></speech>

It would be helpful if we got a similar spreadsheet, even on a six-monthly basis, of the kind of information the Minister of State has shown but presented as a flow chart.  The smaller number of applications that got through the pre-application process quickly have been dealt with in a much more speedy fashion, but I would be interested to see, of all the developments, the actual improvement in the timeline.  The Minister of State might give a commitment that every six months we would get a spreadsheet update with the columns and the lengths of time for each stage of the process for all pre-applications and applications.  That would be useful to allow us track it.</p></speech>

In terms of the ones who go through that early process and are given advice to make changes, all that information is on record and can be seen, and the inspector will comment on that as well.  It is all clear-cut.  I understand the Deputy's point.  It is to be able to track the process to see if it is working with regard to timelines.</p></speech>

We have provided a briefing on the Department&rsquo;s funding for 2018, as well as other key information to assist in the work today,.</p>  <p>  Turning first to Vote 34, the Revised Estimate sets out my Department&rsquo;s budget for 2018.  Gross expenditure of &euro;3.264 billion is budgeted for this year.  This represents an increase of almost &euro;1.2 billion or 55% on the provision in 2017.  The gross provision for 2018 comprises &euro;1.633 billion in current spending and &euro;1.631 billion on the capital side.  In addition, my Department&rsquo;s programmes will benefit in 2018 from resources of some &euro;621 million that will be available from the Local Government Fund.  While some Exchequer-neutral technical adjustments are being made between the Vote and the Local Government Fund in 2018, which I will return to later, even allowing for this, the Estimate represents a significant increase in resources for my Department.  It indicates beyond doubt the priority that the Government attaches to my Department&rsquo;s programmes and, in particular, to supporting the initiatives set out in Rebuilding Ireland.</p>  <p>  More than &euro;1.8 billion is being made available in the Vote for housing programmes in 2018 &ndash; an increase of more than &euro;500 million on the 2017 Estimate.  In addition, local authorities will fund a range of housing services to the value of &euro;92 million from surplus local property tax receipts, bringing the total housing provision to more than &euro;1.9 billion - &euro;778 million on the current side and &euro;1.14 billion in capital funding.  This investment will provide social housing supports for 25,500 households in 2018.  More than &euro;1 billion will support the delivery of almost 5,900 social homes through construction and acquisition.  The balance of the funding will add further tenancies &ndash; and maintain existing ones - through the housing assistance payment, HAP, rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and long-term leasing.  It will also fund other important housing supports and services relating to homelessness, regeneration, housing for Travellers, and programmes to upgrade existing housing, for example, energy efficiency improvements and adaptation grants.  An allocation of &euro;301 million - up &euro;149 million on 2017 is for the HAP, which will enable a further 17,000 households to be accommodated, as well as support the 32,000 existing active HAP tenancies.  Funding of &euro;134 million will support the operation of the RAS, including a further 600 new transfers from rent supplement.</p> <p> With regard to services for homelessness, an allocation of &euro;116 million, which is an increase of &euro;18 million on the 2017 Estimate, will address the increased demand for emergency homeless services and assist in supporting homeless households to transition to long-term and sustainable housing solutions.  In 2018, more than 3,000 exits from emergency accommodation are expected through the provision of social homes and tenancies under the housing assistance payment.  The additional funding provided for 2018 will support the provision of a programme of scheduled services, expenditure on emergency accommodation and also the implementation of solutions to transition homeless households from hotel arrangements to more appropriate family hub accommodation. </p> <p> The local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, will be supported by an allocation of &euro;60 million in 2018.  The fund will provide enabling infrastructure on key sites to open up lands for early development and has the potential to release the delivery of at least 20,000 new homes by 2021.  At least 10%, or 2,000, of these new homes will be social housing through Part V, with additional social housing to be provided on certain State-owned sites.  In addition, &euro;15 million is being allocated in 2018 to provide infrastructure and services, for example, roads and paths, water connections and street lighting on local authority-owned sites in Dublin to facilitate the delivery of affordable housing to help households facing the greatest challenge with affordability and to create mixed tenure communities. </p> <p> As the committee is aware, following the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services and the enactment of the Water Services Act 2017, the costs of normal domestic water services fall to be met by the Exchequer.  To improve the transparency of the new funding arrangements, the Government decided that from 2018 this funding is to be provided from the Vote of the Department rather than by a combination of current funding from the local government fund and capital contribution from the Minister for Finance.  This is now reflected in the amount of &euro;1.1 billion - &euro;600 million on the current side and &euro;500 million on the capital side - which is included this year in programme B of the Estimates for meeting Irish Water costs in respect of domestic water services and providing a capital contribution towards investment.  The capital funding in 2018 is part of the overall funding of &euro;8.5 billion earmarked in Project Ireland 2040, the national development plan, to continue to upgrade our national water infrastructure.  The group water sector continues to be an important element of the water industry in Ireland.  Reflecting this, a provision of &euro;20 million was made in 2018 for capital spend under the rural water programme through which funding is provided for group water schemes, an increase of over &euro;2 million on the 2017 Estimate. </p> <p> The new multi-annual approach to the programme which was introduced in 2016 provides enhanced funding certainty for priority investment needs in order to support the implementation of proper planning and sustainable development in rural areas, meet the requirements of the Drinking Water Directive for rural water supplies and support the delivery of measures identified in river basin management plans to meet the objectives of the directive. </p> <p> The local government fund, LGF, has in recent years been funded principally by motor taxation and local property tax, LPT, which is collected by the Revenue Commissioners.  A payment has also been made to the fund from the Department&rsquo;s Vote.  The main payments from the fund have been to local authorities, Irish Water, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, as well as the Exchequer.  In tandem with Irish Water funding moving from the LGF to the Vote in 2018, which I have already mentioned, we are now proceeding with other changes to the fund which aim to return it more fully to its original purpose of funding local authorities and to end circular flows of funds that had built up over the years.  In particular, from this year, motor tax receipts will go directly to the Exchequer; payments in respect of road and public transport infrastructure, previously met from the LGF, will now be met from the Vote of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport; and there will be no further requirement for a payment from the LGF to the Exchequer.  In 2018, after these changes, the position is that the income sources into the fund are estimated to be LPT of &euro;470 million and a payment from the Exchequer of &euro;124.8 million.  My Department will make payments estimated at &euro;620.7 million from the fund in 2018, including LPT payments to local authorities of &euro;504 million. </p> <p> LPT continues to provide a sustainable, stable, alternative source of funding for the local government sector.  The 2018 LPT allocations to local authorities are broadly based on the same mechanism and principles as were agreed by Government in previous years, with 80% local retention to fund the delivery of public services and the remaining 20% being redistributed to provide top-up funding to local authorities that have lower property tax bases due to variances in property values and density across the State. </p> <p> With regard to other programmes, in planning, &euro;10 million in capital funding is being provided as the start of a multi-annual urban renewal fund amounting to &euro;60 million in total.  The fund will be directed to local authority-led projects to regenerate and revitalise urban areas.  From 2019, Project Ireland 2040, the national development plan, will see greatly intensified action to transform our cities and towns through the new &euro;2 billion urban regeneration and development fund aimed at achieving sustainable growth in these areas.  Further areas of expenditure set out in the 2018 Estimate include meeting the costs of An Bord Plean&aacute;la at &euro;17.2 million and Met &Eacute;ireann at &euro;20.9 million.</p> <p> In 2017, the Government decided to assign to my Department responsibility for Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Valuation Office and the Property Registration Authority.  A provision of &euro;15.6 million is made in Vote 34 for Ordnance Survey Ireland, while the other two organisations have separate Votes amounting to &euro;11.6 million for the Valuation Office and &euro;29.3 million for the Property Registration Authority.  These bodies are to merge to form Tailte &Eacute;ireann and work is under way in my Department on this important project.</p> <p> I have kept my remarks as brief as possible and focused on some, but by no means all, spending areas in order to allow for full discussion on the programmes of funding of my Department and related organisations this hear.  I will be happy, along with the Ministers of State, to deal with matters members wish to raise.  </p></speech>

It is the fourth table outlining key outputs and public service activities.  It is the long one.  I have no query about the first three rows.  Will the Minister explain the differences between the next three rows?</p>  <p>  There is a target of 560 voids in 2018.  That brings us back to the thorny subject of when a void is really a void and just an expensive standard re-let.  My understanding was that the long-term voids were finished.  Therefore, I am even more suspicious that the 560 voids are properties that have tenants and due to be re-let but the cost of turning them over is significantly higher than would normally be the case.  Therefore, they are not long-term voids but just expensive re-lets.  From where does the figure come?</p>  <p>  My next query is about public private partnerships and enhanced leasing.  Obviously, the Department has targets for current expenditure on social housing.  Its ability to meet these targets will depend on the cost of the units.  We know roughly the cost of the units delivered, for example, under the heading of standard leasing.  I have a concern about public private partnerships.  Do we know what the public service benchmarking exercise is?  Do we know what the cost of the units will be over the lifecycle?  Can the Minister give us any additional information at this point?</p>  <p>  On enhanced leasing, on the basis of the limited information contained in the Minister of State's press release in January, it seems to be incredibly expensive.  There is a really good deal, for example, on the percentage of market rent achieved.  One does not have to cover the cost of maintenance; that falls on the local authority or an approved housing body.  What is the difference in cost between an enhanced leasing unit, for example, and a standard leasing unit?  Does it have a potential impact on the ability to deliver the targets included in the report?</p>  <p>  I will come back to the issue of water services when we have dealt with housing, if that is okay.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-27a.84" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="13:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2018032700005#D00700"><p>The Deputy mentioned the target of 560 voids.  The number is diminishing every year.  The voids which are essentially council house vacancies are the low-hanging fruit which have been targeted by the Department for a number of years to bring them back into use as social housing stock.  We are not talking about casual vacancies when we talk about voids.  While previously properties had to be in the system for a length of time to be classified as long-term voids, that was removed to take away any potential to have an incentive to keep properties as voids to avail of funding.  We are talking about properties that potentially would be long-term voids if this funding was not spent to bring them back into use.  It is a significant amount of funding.  When we talk about a potential sum of &euro;30,000 being spent, it is not a small amount compared with the amount allowed for under the repair and lease scheme, for example.  These are properties that would be vacant if the money was not spent and so are part of the voids programme.  To ensure there was no doubt about what we were doing, I took the number of voids out of the build target when we started to publish data in order that people would be clear that we were not counting them as builds.  We should be clear that the number has been diminishing every year.  As we get to the end of the programme, we are, I think, talking about 130 voids, but it might not even be that figure, depending on how much progress we can make with the properties in the coming few years.</p>  <p>  Potentially enhanced leasing is very positive for the State.  We are talking about the ability to leverage private finance to provide social housing, taking all of the risk on the build side that the State would not have to take.</p> <p>Significantly, and as reflected in the market rent that is acquired, private finance also takes on all of the liability costs for the buildings over the course of the 25 years, which is a longer-term lease than we have had previously.  This takes into account maintenance fees, service charges and all of those things that a local authority might have had to pay under a different lease agreement.  The private body will have to expend a significant amount of money over the lifetime of the lease agreement, which represents a considerable saving to the State.  This is the reason for the 92% discount.</p> <p> It is important to recognise that potential rent increases will arise every three years under the scheme and be linked to the harmonised indices of consumer prices, HICP.  There is also a process under which any disagreement or difficulty that arises will be clarified.  The enhanced leasing arrangement, which is coming to a finalisation point with expressions of interest, will represent a gain to the State in terms of the potential new properties that we will be able to leverage.</p> <p> A question was asked about the fourth table and the second set of three rows.  The first figure of 5,869 comprises 4,409 builds, 560 voids and 900 acquisitions.  The second figure of 4,969 just underneath that comprises builds and voids and does not include acquisitions.  The 3,209 figure relates to local authority builds and includes regeneration, voids and Part V housing.  That is how the figures have been separated and explains the difference between the figures in the second set of three rows regarding the 2018 target.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-27a.86" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="13:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2018032700006#E00200"><p>In terms of voids, the problem with the way the figures are being presented - I was one of those who asked for that figure to be removed, so I welcome that the Minister did that - is that, when the voids programme was originally introduced, it was concerned with bringing units that were effectively not part of the housing stock back into it.  Regardless of whether they were included in the build figure, they were to be counted as additions to the stock, and so they should have been.  If a property is vacant for six, 12 or 18 months or two years and is then refurbished, it should be considered as an addition to the stock.  However, if a property that is only ten or 13 weeks between tenants costs &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000 to do up, it cannot be counted as new to the stock.  I made a freedom of information request to South Dublin County Council regarding its void programme last year.  According to the council, the average length of time for voids to be returned under the long-term voids programme, as I call it, was 10.29 weeks.</p>  <p>  I accept the Minister's comments about not wanting to disincentivise people or give them a perverse incentive to leave the properties vacant for longer in order to avail of funding, but we must separate the two types of property.  First is a property that is long-term void - it has not had a tenant within a reasonable period - and is effectively a new unit in the stock.  Second, an expensive relet cannot be counted as a new unit, especially if it had someone in it ten, 12 or 18 weeks ago.  These two types must be counted differently and the latter should be removed from the new unit figures, as they are just expensive relets.  Of the 560 voids being targeted this year, I imagine that the overwhelming majority are expensive relets.  They are above the &euro;30,000 level, but they probably had tenants at some stage this year or at the end of last year.  There is a genuine problem in how the Department is counting them.</p>  <p>  Regarding the enhanced leasing scheme, I want to be clear, as I may have misunderstood the Minister's press release.  My understanding is that the cost of the day-to-day maintenance of the property will rest with the approved housing body, AHB, or local authority and the cost of the structural maintenance of the property will rest elsewhere.  If I am wrong, the Minister might clarify the situation.  Is he saying that he has run numbers on this and that, over the 25 years, these units will be less expensive or more expensive to the State?  The major difference is that, with standard leasing from AHBs, the AHBs own the units at the end of the 25 years.  With this scheme, there is a 25-year lease but, if a social housing family is still in the property at the end of that time, the AHB sector will not own the unit.  If the family wants to remain, there would have to be a new lease.  Therefore, the cost to the taxpayer over the lifetime of the tenancy will be substantially more than under standard leasing from AHBs, which is essentially leasing to buy.  Has the Minister numbers on the cost comparison between the two types of leasing within and post the 25 years?</p> <p>The other point I want to make is not one for the Minister but for his colleague in finance.  There is a real concern that the requirement to bring 100% capital funding to this excludes the approved housing bodies.  They will not be able to buy into this.  Many of the alternative investment funds that are likely to invest in this will pay substantially lower levels of tax because of their tax status.  Other than the dividend withholding tax, they will pay very little tax at all on their rent roll.  This means there will be an additional loss to the State.  That is not a question for the Minister.  I am making a point about the tax status of the vehicles that will be investing in this.  Questions need to be asked about the additional benefits of this deal for those vehicles.  Is the taxpayer really getting a good deal at the end of it?</p></speech>

When we talk about 2:1s, we are talking about former bedsits being brought back as single-unit accommodation.  Essentially, there are three different streams under the voids programme.  We are not talking about what the Deputy has described as "expensive re-lets".  In some cases, there is a risk that a unit will be vacant for a considerable period of time if significant investment is not made by the council, which is something that can happen just once under this particular programme.</p></speech>

A property that has been tenanted by the same family for 40 years or more may have had very little work done on it over its lifecycle.  The cost of re-letting such a property is expensive because of the need for rewiring, reinsulation, new windows and new kitchens, etc.  It costs way more.  That work can be done within ten weeks under this programme, which has a high rate of finance.  This kind of property is essentially being counted in the Minister's figures as an addition to the stock even though it was tenanted ten or 14 weeks earlier.</p></speech>

I am not challenging what the Minister is doing, but I am saying I think this needs to be spelled out very clearly in the figures so that people are absolutely clear on whether something is an expensive re-let, rather than a 2:1 or a property that has been brought back into use after being derelict for a long time.  There are fundamental differences between the categories.  I would challenge the appropriateness of counting as a new unit something which had a tenant in it a couple of months previously and may or may not have fallen out of stock if this additional funding had not been made available.</p></speech>

I can certainly provide figures to the committee setting out how many 2:1s and derelict properties we are working on over the programme.  It is important to note that as we work through this programme, the number of voids that have the potential to be brought back into use will decrease every year.  The Department is moving towards more active management of stock through a programme that focuses on casual vacancies that require a bit of funding to ensure they can be retenanted as quickly as possible.  This programme, which is separate from the voids programme, involves making investments proactively to ensure these properties do not become long-term voids.  It recognises that many of the properties in question were long-term voids before they were brought back into the system.  That is how the money is being spent.</p>  <p>  The Deputy also asked about enhanced leasing and maintenance.  The 92% reduced rate of rent is higher than the traditional lease, which was approximately 80%.  The local authority was maintaining all the responsibility for day-to-day maintenance as well, but that is not the case under the new enhanced leasing arrangements.</p></speech>

It is important to note it has been decided that in order to keep them off the balance sheet, these properties will not come into public ownership at the end of the 25-year period.  Indeed, the State will not have the first option on them.  This is important because it will allow us to leverage even greater potential to secure more housing through this stream without having a negative impact on our ability to spend money in other areas of housing or the public good.  As we get towards the end of the 25-year lease agreement, we will have to manage tenancies actively to make sure no one is exposed in a way that means he or she has nowhere to live.</p> <p>However, it is also important to note that over the 25 year period people's housing needs will have changed.  The original needs of that tenancy will have changed in the 25 year period.  The exact needs of the tenant in 25 years time are not set in stone on day one.  Some work will be done of course in advance to ensure that the tenancy can be managed.  Perhaps the arrangement will be rolled over.  It is not for certain that the stock will necessarily be taken back into private ownership or sold off.  Even if it were sold off, it is not certain who the buyer might be; it could be an approved housing body or someone else.  That will depend and it will be managed closer to the end of the lease term.</p> <p> Reference was made to cost comparisons for the different lease agreements.  Considerable work was done between ourselves and the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform to ensure that we were bringing in to existence a new stream of delivery that would ensure value for money for the State.  It is important that this is done.  Sometimes, it is difficult to make direct cost comparisons.  Risk in this instance will be carried almost exclusively by the private side.  This includes risk for the build, maintenance, day-to-day management and potential vacancy if the units are empty or not re-let at a given time.  In those circumstances, the investors will not get their lease payments or the payments will cease.  The fact is that they are tied into what will not be a free hand in terms of rent rises.  That will be linked on a three year basis to the harmonised index of consumer prices.  All these factors make it difficult to carry out a direct cost comparison with the traditional lease agreement that we have had with local authorities playing the management role at an 80% discount.</p> <p> We have done considerable work with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Finance to ensure that we are getting value for money for the taxpayer.  This is an important new stream of housebuilding and homes for social housing.</p></speech>

What determines value for money in this scheme versus the other schemes?</p>  <p>  I will go back to the first question I asked about the public private partnerships.  I realise there is some difficulty with them.  My understanding is that a public service benchmarking exercise has been carried out.  I gather it is held under lock and key in order that no politician can look at it bar, I presume, the Minister and the Department.  It is used to make a comparison for the successful tenders.</p>  <p>  There is meant to be some mechanism to determine if the cost of the public private partnership consortium over the 25 years is around or less than the cost to the State of delivering the same service.  Can the Minister give us any information on that?  Is there a similar exercise?  How can the Minister refer to value for money for enhanced leasing?  What is the Minister measuring it against?</p></speech>

The tests set out to see whether the project could be delivered more cheaply through traditional means.  All these benchmarks and value for money measures will be made public after the contracts are awarded.</p>  <p>  A significant amount of work has been done with the enhanced lease agreement by the National Development Finance Agency.  When we go into the final lease agreement with the people who are successful with the expression of interests, we will then carry out another value for money exercise to ensure that it all stacks up and amounts to another delivery stream that brings value for money to the taxpayer in addition to the more traditional streams.  That work will be done when we go into the final agreement.  The NDFA has done the pre-proofing, as it were, of the fundamental principles behind the scheme and how it will operate.</p></speech>

I fully agree with the remarks on the description of re-letting of a property.</p> <p>There will be a percentage of those every year.  In every county a case like that arises, where an elderly couple die who have lived in the same property for 40 years, and it will cost over &euro;30,000 to bring the property back into use.  That does not add to the stock of local property houses.

The Minister said after the budget last year that he realised that the State buying from the market was having an influence and that he did not see that as a sustainable move going forward.  However, the proposal to buy 900 houses this year is still in place.  Some 560 of those were voids.  That leaves us with a figure of 4,489.  Can the Minister provide a breakdown as to what that figure consists of?  I am talking about direct builds by local authorities and approved housing bodies.  Does this form part of the part five housing allocation?</p>  <p>  The Minister said that he would look at new ways of funding social housing delivery.  Does he have any update on that?  </p>  <p>  I want to acknowledge the work that is being done on homelessness.  The Minister has said that some 4,000 people have exited homelessness this year, and I acknowledge that.  However, they have been replaced by another 4,000.  The only month we have seen a reduction in homeless figures was December.  For the rest of the year there has been a continual increase in the number of homeless people.  We are still using hotels, despite the fact that the previous Minister had said that he hoped that practice would end by July.  However, 700 families are still living in them.  How are we going to get on top of this ongoing problem?  We are not getting on top of it.  What action can be taken?  It seems to escalate on an annual basis.   </p></speech>

An important policy change on acquisitions was announced at the first housing summit in September.  I did not believe that local authorities should compete in high-demand areas with young couples and people trying to buy homes because it was pushing up the prices of houses and was not contributing to our stock of social housing.  As a result we made a policy decision to move a significant amount of that funding towards direct build by local authorities and housing bodies.  That meant that there would be a 30% increase this year in the number of units directly built by local authorities, which amounts to a figure of around 800 new homes.  I did not cease the practice of acquisitions completely, because in certain parts of the country that are not high-demand local authorities can get considerable value for money by buying those properties from the market.  It is quicker and cheaper to do.  In places such as Donegal and Roscommon local authorities are continuing to acquire homes.  For this year we are looking at a total of 7,900 new social housing homes, through builds, acquisitions and leasing agreements.  Some 900 of those will be acquired, but a significant amount more than that will be directly built.  The policy changed, but it did not change for low-demand areas where acquisitions make sense.  That is a judgement call for the local authority.</p>  <p>  On the build breakdown for 2018, the figure that we have for local authorities and housing bodies is roughly around 3,800.  That breaks down into 2,300 from the local authorities side and 1,500 from the approved housing bodies in terms of direct builds.</p> <p>Approximately 600 come into the build figure under Part V.  In addition, we have the 900 acquisitions to which we referred and the leasing agreements add another 2,000.  That is the 7,900 figure broken down by the different build types and Part Vs.  I did not mention the voids, which number 560.</p> <p> The enhanced leasing agreement is a new delivery stream we have been signalling, which is now almost coming to completion thanks to the good work of the Minister of State, Deputy English, and his officials in getting it ready to go out to an expression of interest and finalising those agreements once we get into April.  We are also progressing, with the European Investment Bank, EIB, the potential for a new stream of delivery for affordable housing.  That is ongoing.  I was in Luxembourg last month and we are having detailed discussions on a weekly basis with officials from the EIB to see if we can start to have more affordable housing at a greater scale.  This is line with the announcements I made in January, particularly the cost-rental side of those announcements.</p> <p> With regard to homelessness, the Deputy is absolutely right to say the problem is escalating in certain ways when one looks at the numbers.  I know the Deputy recognises that a huge amount of work has been done.  We recently saw with Storm Emma the dedication of officials in my Department, local authorities, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive and the NGO sector to help people who were on the frontline of this, people who were sleeping rough, to get them into secure accommodation.  Our responsibility is now to get them into sustainable accommodation.  We still have a very high number of families in hotels.  We moved a significant number of families out of hotels last year but families continue to present.  Until we have more family hubs built - we have a rapid hub programme under development - families will have to be looked after in hotels, recognising that it is not an adequate first response.  We are moving quickly to a situation where there will be more than enough rapid hub spaces in place for families to be accommodated as a first response before we get them into more secure tenancies.  On the number of exits, we are doing work at the moment which I had hoped to publish before now but I will try to publish it later today or tomorrow.  It addresses the number of exits that were achieved last year as well as information on more recent homeless statistics.  We will put them into the public domain as quickly as we can.</p></speech>

I know we sometimes question the value of money put into HAP.  Equally, we saw landlords jumping on the bandwagon because HAP will give them a greater monthly rental than they currently achieve.  We all need a percentage of HAP but there is a huge over-reliance on HAP at the moment and it is just throwing good money after bad money.  When will we see the pendulum swing away from HAP and towards more long-term delivery?  It is a short-term measure where we need a long-term solution.  It is just a loss of good money after bad money.</p></speech>

Many people like the options that HAP gives them.  They prefer to remain in the private rental sector, are happy to have the State support to be able to do that and their housing needs are being met.  When one looks at the funding that is being provided this year, we have effectively doubled the budget for HAP for this year.  That approximately &euro;300 million will allow us to maintain approximately 32,000 people who are currently in HAP homes and bring approximately another 17,000 people into HAP.  That is just under 50,000 people, for &euro;300 million, who are being accommodated in perfectly good private rented accommodation.  Some &euro;300 million would not get that many homes built and we obviously would not get them tomorrow.  With regard to our reliance on HAP, with Rebuilding Ireland concluding in 2021, over the course of 2020 and 2021, we will accommodate more people entering our social housing stock than we will into housing assistance payment supports in the private rental sector.  Looking beyond Rebuilding Ireland to our ambition in Project Ireland 2040 to bring an additional 72,000 homes into our social housing stock through build and lease, that is how we will be able to continue to manage people moving from HAP to social housing stock that is managed by local authorities.</p> <p>Our ambition does not end with the Rebuilding Ireland strategy in 2021, nor is it our ambition to maintain the current balance between social housing stock and the housing assistance payment.  We intend to re-balance the position in favour of social housing stock over the course of Rebuilding Ireland and into Project Ireland 2040. </p></speech>

I agree that a percentage of them want to live in a private rented accommodation.  While HAP is a necessary scheme, it involves spending a large amount on a short-term solution to a long-term problem.  Perhaps the pendulum will start to swing back at some point after 2021 and the HAP will not be required to the same extent as it is now.</p></speech>

However, Rebuilding Ireland has a target of adding 50,000 houses to the social housing stock, with a further 88,000 people on the housing list to be accommodated through the housing assistance payment.  In the years leading up to 2021, people will present with a housing need the State must meet.  However, given the number of homes that will be built by 2020 and 2021 and our ambitions post-2021, I believe we will be able to re-balance the position.  As I stated, the social housing stock will be re-balanced away from the HAP by 2021.  My ambition is to continue that process in Project Ireland 2040.</p></speech>

One of the interesting questions about the figures on the number of people who exit from homelessness is the number who end up back in emergency accommodation.  Professor Eoin O'Sullivan has produced some interesting research in which he tracks, on a monthly or quarterly basis, the number of people entering emergency accommodation who are first-time occupants of emergency accommodation as opposed to people who had presented previously.  It may be worthwhile for the Department to link into and publish this research and information on people exiting emergency accommodation, for example, on how long they exit for and the propensity of people to return to emergency accommodation.</p>  <p>  On the housing assistance payment, the Minister referred to many people liking the HAP option.  I am interested in finding out on what research he bases that view given that the majority of people entering HAP supported accommodation opt to be included on the HAP transfer list.  This suggests they are keen to secure more permanent accommodation.</p>  <p>  When discussing HAP, we also need to discuss the rental accommodation scheme, leasing and rent supplement, even if the numbers of people on rent supplement are meant to be declining and leasing, because all of these schemes subsidise private rental accommodation.  By the end of Rebuilding Ireland, more than 100,000 people will be living in the private rented sector and receiving social housing support subsidised by the State.  The figure will be the highest in the history of the State and will account for one third of the total social housing tenancies if one includes all the social housing that will be added to the existing stock.  Part of the problem is that the legislation is designed in such a way as to indicate that the social housing need of these households have been met, which suggests it is permanent, whereas the experience of those living in private rented accommodation and receiving social housing support is that it is temporary. </p>  <p>  As I state probably every time we discuss the HAP, I do not propose to get into an argument with the Minister about the scheme because we have fundamentally different views on it.  However, if he accepts that people can move into council housing from HAP supported accommodation, he should ensure they are given access to choice based letting and the principal means of allocating social housing.  This would clearly show whether people want to move out of HAP supported accommodation.</p>  <p>  At what point will the Minister be able to provide figures on the cost of the affordable housing units in Dublin that will benefit from the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF?  While I accept that contractual and confidentiality issues arise, I am sure the figures will be provided at some point.  Can the Minister provide them now or must we wait until a later stage?</p></speech>

It takes considerable time and effort to drill into the data, to present them again and check them before publication  I want to do more with the information available to us.  As I signalled on the previous occasion I released figures on the number of people in emergency accommodation and homeless, there is more information that we are not capturing properly or publishing.  I want to try to find a way to do this while maintaining the transparency we have with regard to all of the issues we face.  I may return to this when I get a chance to publish the figures for February.</p>  <p>  On the housing assistance payment, the comment I made is based on the success of the scheme to date and the number of people currently in it versus the number who have exited it, which is comparatively low.  When we view the scheme from that perspective, it is successful from the point of view of tenants.  When one considers that approximately 20,000 landlords are involved in the scheme, it is also successful from the point of view of landlords.</p> <p>As such, I see it as a scheme that is operating successfully.

The point he made was that a lot of people like the option.  He seemed to suggest that they had some other option, whereas for the vast majority of people taking housing assistance payment, HAP, it is their only option.</p></speech>

That is one of the benefits of HAP and the reason it is proving to be successful.  I do not think we have a different view on HAP.  I would not have designed the scheme like this way back when.  This was born out of necessity, based on what faced us when we did not have the stock in place to meet the needs of our people.  That said, there would still be a need for private rental support for people in the private rental market.  I think it is a good thing in that it gives people flexibility and achieves certain social goods, such as promoting mixed communities.  I think there should always be a State support available to help people to source their own accommodation on the private rental market.  It is something that will continue.  However, I am cognisant of the fact that our social housing stock is far too low. That is why Rebuilding Ireland makes the commitment to increase that stock by at least 50,000, and to build on that in Project Ireland 2040.</p>  <p>  In relation to the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, this would have been published by now but for Storm Emma and a few other things.

Are there any questions for the Minister here?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-27a.146" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2018032700012#L01300"><p>I have two questions.  We had a session last week on the draft revised EU drinking water directive, or the directive on the quality of water intended for human consumption, as the European Commission oddly likes to call it.  At that meeting, Irish Water's representatives told us that the company had done some initial calculations based on the current draft.  Obviously we know that the current draft is unlikely to be the final draft, but Irish Water has done some financial calculations on the cost of capital expenditure and current expenditure required if that draft was to come into force.  The representatives said that it would cost between &euro;200 million and &euro;300 million in capital expenditure.  That is one-off expenditure over a period of time.  There would also be a potential annual operational cost of &euro;100 million for all of the scheme's bits and pieces.</p>  <p>  When we asked them what that means to the current capital programme, they said that their difficulty would not necessarily arise in looking for extra money but that their capacity to deliver any additional capital expenditure operations was circumscribed by their existing programme.  If they had these additional requirements, it would not be a case of approaching the Minister and asking for extra money; Irish Water simply would not be able to spend that money even if he gave it to the company.  This means that other areas of activity would be delayed, for example, upgrading the wastewater treatment plants that are currently being accused of falling foul of the European Court of Justice's legal action, or the pipe upgrades. </p>  <p>  Obviously that would create a real dilemma if the directive came into force in its current form.  Rather than having an argument about whether Irish Water can have more money, we would have to decide which would be prioritised; upgrading the wastewater treatment plants, fixing the leaking pipes and trying to save water or meeting these new requirements.  Has the Minister had conversations with Irish Water about that dilemma arising from the directive?  If not, is that something he should be doing?  Obviously it is a significant set of concerns.  </p>  <p>  In that context, and in regard to the capital investment that is outlined in the schedule, can the Minister give us an update on the progress in tackling those 38-odd agglomerations that are in breach of the urban wastewater treatment directive?  Can he give us an update on any conversations he has had about the legal challenge that the Commission has put to the European Court of Justice? </p> <p>I understand the Minister is still waiting for an answer on that but any updates he can provide would be useful.  </p> <p> Can the Minister also tell us whether he is looking beyond those 38 agglomerations?  The Environmental Protection Agency has identified up to 100 wastewater treatment plants which are at some level of risk.  Can the Minister give us some update as to where that sits in the context of the existing capital plan?  </p> <p>The Minister mentioned the extra &euro;2 million for group water schemes.  I stand corrected if I am wrong but I understand that relates to the standing charge, the annual fee or subvention.  The Minister obviously gave a commitment to respond to the request to look at whether additional capital investment supports would be required, as per the recommendation of the Oireachtas committee.  Can he update us on that piece of work as well?  </p></speech>

We have approved the EU directive prior to this meeting, and it has gone back.  A motion has gone before the Houses and I believe it is to be heard tomorrow.</p></speech>

We face a number of challenges in the provision of water services at the moment.  We have planned a number of different capital projects to that end.  The main constraints we face relate to the construction sector and the supply chain.  This is something we normally face when it comes to the provision of water infrastructure.  We face it when we look at all of the infrastructure provisions that need to be made.  I have been speaking with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, about a number of different mechanisms that might be put in place to manage infrastructural development into the future, given the significant investment that is now going to go in on the capital side of most budgets to make sure there are no unforeseen bottlenecks or that a project is not started that cannot be continued because the skills or machinery are not there.  That is something we are doing on a national basis.</p>  <p>  I am due to meet Irish Water to talk about what our priorities are in terms of the future provision of water.  We need to find that balance between repairing leaks and pipes that are already there and providing new water supplies to make sure our cities, towns and villages can continue to grow, as is anticipated.  </p>  <p>  On the issue of group water schemes and subsidies, an important piece of work was done in tandem with the water Bill last year.  We were working on Irish Water, and I believe members knew that a huge piece of work was being done with the private group water schemes both to ensure they were being treated fairly in terms of the restoration of subsidies and that there would be sufficient capital supports in place for the future provision of group water schemes.  Perhaps the public was not aware of that work.  We are about to initiate a very short review of the wider investment needs of group water schemes to look at the kind of funding they will require over the coming years.  The review will consider the capital requirements, the supervision of water quality and governance arrangements.  It also will look at some schemes that have been orphaned for various reasons, as well as those schemes which may wish to come in to what might be called the public water sector.  We hope to have finished that work in the second half of this year and that will inform our preparations for the budget for 2019.  We will be getting into that wider process in the not-too-distant future.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy also asked about wastewater and the river basin management plan to 2021, as well as the strategic funding plan.  We are looking at the next river basin management plan at the moment.  We have been a little bit delayed on that, and it is the subject of some proceedings.  We continue to work to get this new replacement management plan finalised as quickly as possible, and we will see what happens in terms of the proceedings that are under way.  As for further details on the river basin management plan and the forthcoming &euro;1.7 billion investment in infrastructure, 276 wastewater treatment plants are being looked at, as well as the 162 at-risk water bodies where urban wastewater has been identified as a significant pressure.  As we address those through the river basin management plan and as the funding is allocated, there should be some impact in terms of infringement proceedings that are currently under way.  </p></speech>

I thank the Minister for that update in respect of group water schemes.  I met a number of group water schemes in Mayo a couple of months back.  These were older and smaller schemes.  The voluntary boards are dwindling in terms of age and numbers.  They expressed real concern, not on the annual subvention but about the current state of the capital infrastructure and whether they could continue.  They wanted to continue as a group water scheme.  Their preference was not to merge into the public system but they were genuinely fearful of the capacity of the scheme to continue.  That is an important piece of work in respect of giving those schemes a real option to remain group water schemes if that is what they want.  I am sure that is one of the things the Minister will be looking at in the review.</p></speech>

It is a general point.  To return to the potential impact of the drinking water directive.  The Minister has confirmed what I understood.  If there are additional capital requirements, the difficulty for Irish Water will be the capacity to deliver them in respect of planning permissions, tendering and all of that stuff.  Even if the directive's eventual shape does not cost &euro;300 million to Irish Water in capital funding, if it costs &euro;150 million or &euro;100 million, that is still a huge drain out of the current capital plan that Irish Water has.</p>  <p>  I am thinking in particular of the work to bring the urban wastewater treatment plants into line with that directive.  Is that something the Minister is going to be looking at specifically with Irish Water?  Will potential contingency plans be thought through in case that type of bill comes down the line?  I know it is not a bill that would come down the line within 12 or 24 months but even &euro;150 million or &euro;100 million from its capital programme would be a huge shift if that had to be used to meet the requirements of this directive.  When the Minister says a decision of the court is expected, has he done any risk assessments of the potential costs, depending on how that decision is made, or is he going to wait until the decision is announced and assess it at that point?</p></speech>

We are looking at a new strategic funding plan for Irish Water beyond 2021.  That will need to be done.  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, will have a role in that as well in respect of the role it plays in regulating the costs Irish Water might incur.  We will address each of those issues as we go through that process in respect of what needs to be done to ensure we have safe drinking water for our population.  It is important we can communicate positively to the public that is where the investment is going, so they can have safe drinking water.</p>  <p>  In respect of potential infringement proceedings, we are working with the Commission as best we can.  We recognise there are certain areas where more work needs to be done on our side.  However, we believe we are making good progress and that should be reflected in due course.</p></speech>

We were discussing the strategic housing development, SHD, process.  It was identified that a number of applications were failing the pre-planning process.  We were trying to understand why they are failing.  Is one of the reasons they are failing the lack of water supply?  If we put that into context, is there an adequate supply to reach the targets of Rebuilding Ireland in future?</p>  <p>  In respect of commercial water, local authorities are still managing the billing and collection processes.  However, we still have approximately 30 different commercial water rates.  When does the Minister see harmonisation to one commercial rate water charge happening?</p></speech>

We have had some negative decisions as well.</p> <p>It is almost a year since I signed the order so we wish to carry out a soft review of how it has worked to date and to see if changes might be necessary.  One would have expected that some of the reasons for the decisions that have emerged to date would have been clarified in the pre-consultation period, but they were not.  We need to take a look at exactly what is going on there.</p> <p> To my knowledge, water infrastructure has not been a delaying factor or a cause for rejection in any of those cases.  There was some media reporting last month about one significant property owner or house builder complaining to a different Department about a lack of water infrastructure and about that impeding his developments, but that turned out not to be the case in what was happening with some of his properties.  We need to make sure, and it is one of the benefits of water and housing being under the same Department, that we can progress our housing plans in tandem with other key infrastructure that has to be put in place.  That is what we do.  We must ensure that infrastructure such as roads, lighting or water is not standing in the way of us being able to build houses because that is something we have to do.</p> <p> With regard to the commercial rates, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, is working on a non-domestic review and this programme will take place over the next 18 to 24 months.  There will be a great deal of public consultation on this.  Public consultation is important to ensure that as we progress this move on rates there is full understanding of what needs to be achieved and full buy-in from the people who are paying the rates.  This is not something on which we are going to come to a conclusion in the near future.  I wish to make sure that there is significant public consultation in advance of any new changes coming down the line.  Of course, we will also be guided by what the CRU intends to do.</p></speech>

While public consultation is very important for everything, a two year window to try to reach a decision on this is a little long.  In fairness, we have known it has been coming for quite some time so what is the delay in harmonising commercial water rates?  We were able to harmonise commercial rates between towns and counties over a five year period and there were significant differences there.</p></speech>

Quite a complex piece of work has to be done.  However, it is not up to me, it is up to the CRU.  I have been emphasising that I do not want it rushed because potentially there might be an impact on small businesses in terms of their costs of doing business.  I want people to be fully aware of what might be coming down the line and what might be an additional cost for some businesses in the future.  I want them to be able to prepare for that and to have adequate time to do so.  Again, however, the timeline is not of my making.</p></speech>

Under the local government fund, on the first table, the total last year was &euro;365.3 million and this year it is &euro;124.8 million.  That is a difference of &euro;240 million.  The Minister gave an explanation for that accounting, but perhaps he would repeat it a little more slowly so my slow brain can catch it.</p></speech>

In recent years the local government fund, LGF, was funded principally by motor taxation and local property tax, which is collected by the Revenue Commissioners.  A payment has also been made to the fund from the Department's Vote.  However, the main payments from the fund have been to local authorities, Irish Water, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport as well as the Exchequer.  In tandem with Irish Water funding moving from the local government fund to the Vote in 2018, we are also proceeding with other changes to the fund which aim to return it more fully to its original purpose of funding local authorities and to end circular flows of funds that had built up over the years.  That means that from this year motor tax receipts will go directly to the Exchequer, payments in respect of road and public transport infrastructure previously met from the LGF will now be met from the Vote of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and there will be no further requirement for a payment from the LGF to the Exchequer.</p> <p>This allows for a funding stream into Irish Water without any circular transactions.  It also means the local government fund is a more direct payment into local government.  </p></speech>

I would like to focus today on the local authorities' baseline in respect of which LPT plays a huge role.  The baseline was established approximately 20 years ago and it has not been reviewed in any significant way in the interim.  Many counties, particularly those around Dublin where there has been significant growth in populations, believe they are being disadvantaged because the baseline has not been reviewed.  Can the Minister give an indication of when the baseline might be reviewed?</p></speech>

As this is a tax, it is a matter for the Minister for Finance but because it is a local property tax the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government has a significant say in how it might be redesigned, if it is to be redesigned.  This piece of work has commenced.  In parallel to that, my Department is reviewing the baseline and the redistribution of local property tax to the different local authorities.  I recognise that some local authorities are having difficulties and that some of them think the manner in which the baseline is calculated is unfair.  It is more than likely that we will not move away from the principle of a redistribution of rates from particular local authorities to others to help those that have a lower density of housing, but we will look at new criteria for the calculation of a baseline taking into account the differences between local authorities, including the length of a coastline for which a local authority has responsibility, populations and so on.  The departmental review will look at how the baseline is calculated with a view to improving it while ensuring that no local authority is worse off as a result of a recalculation of how we achieve a baseline.</p></speech>

However, a number of counties have concerns in regard to the baseline and there needs to be clarity brought to this issue.  Wicklow County Council is complaining that it is being disadvantaged as against other local authorities.  There needs to be more transparency brought to the baseline figure and how it is calculated.</p></speech>

When the officials appeared before the joint committee earlier to discuss the review of rates legislation, they and we experienced some frustration because the Valuation Office has come under a different Department and legislative code.  It would be a good idea, once the Valuation Office has settled into its new home, as it were, if the relevant officials were to appear before the committee again for a more rounded discussion on rates valuation reviews, particularly in light of the point made by Deputy Casey.  When all the relevant officials are located in one office, it makes for a more fruitful conversation.  That is my suggestion.</p></speech>

The commercial rates Bill is a priority in this term.  In my wisdom, I have delegated responsibility for the legislation and the work on the Valuation Office to the Minister of State, Deputy John Paul Phelan.  I want to ensure there is consistency at a political and official level.  Once the three new sections have been bedded into the Department, it may be a good time to have a more detailed discussion of our work.</p></speech>

I will not ask the Minister about that.  My major worry, which I know is shared by the Minister, his officials and the local authorities involved, is that these 44 families may have to present as homeless at any stage in the incoming period.  We do not want that.  There are tenants in the property who are the responsibility, in some shape or form, of South Dublin County Council, Dublin City County Council, Fingal County Council and at least two other local authorities outside Dublin.  Some came via the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive, so there is a fair amount of complication.</p> <p> I have three points to put to the Minister.  His Department needs to be as proactive as possible in working with the different local authorities and the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive to ensure the families get all the support they need so that if the planning issues cannot be resolved, they are assisted to move into alternative private rental accommodation.  I spoke to officials in the Minister's Department last week and this week.  They have been very helpful, but I ask the Minister to give us some reassurance that he and his staff will do everything they can to work with the other local authorities to resolve what is an incredibly stressful situation for the residents.  I met with a very large group of them last night and they are hugely concerned.  Some of these people have come from hubs or emergency accommodation.  Those 44 families thought they were at the end of that experience and, through no fault of the local authorities or the Minister's Department but as a result, in my opinion, of the inappropriate and potentially illegal behaviour of a developer, they are now in an incredibly difficult position.  I raise that with the Minister to hear what assurance he can give me and, through the committee, the families in question, that he will do everything he can to assist them during this very difficult period.</p></speech>

I know he has been working with the residents to try to find an early solution for them.  This is a very frustrating situation to be in where we have what appears to be a perfectly good building with tenants in it but which potentially may be an illegal building and, as a result of that potential, tenants who thought they were at home may not be in the coming weeks and months.  I am aware of the work Deputy &Oacute; Broin has been doing and that he has been in touch with my officials.  They will meet the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive and officials from the local authority tomorrow to manage a proper pathway for those people affected in terms of how we will deal with this to make sure that, if we can, not one family will fall into emergency accommodation but can be accommodated directly into a new home.  We are taking a proactive stance on this issue and this is thanks to Deputy &Oacute; Broin bringing it to our attention in the first instance and the work of my officials in recognising the situation those tenants are facing.</p></speech>

A revised planning application was submitted in 2017 to amend that to 48 units.  That application was rejected and appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la but it appears that during the period of time the appeal has taken, which was approximately six months, the developer in question built and tenanted 44 of those units.  Building control amendment regulations, BCAR, compliance certification was not received by the local authority at any stage, neither commencements, disability, fire or completion certificates.  My understanding is that South Dublin County Council has inspected the premises and there are no fire safety concerns at this point, therefore, there is not an immediate evacuation concern.  On the face of it, it appears the developer built and tenanted the building and did not comply with any of the building or planning regulations.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la's ruling, while it is short, creates real issues in that there is a significant number of units which, according to its ruling, are not compliant with ceiling heights, numbers of units, size of rooms, etc., and the local authority now has to fulfil its statutory obligation in terms of the planning enforcement.</p></speech>

We had all seen works happening but they related to a conversion.  It came to our attention in the first instance because housing applicants in South Dublin County Council's list wanted to take up regular tenancies and applied for the housing assistance payment, HAP.  When they applied for that, South Dublin County Council, in doing due diligence, checked the building and at that point realised there was no completion certificates.  At that point a planning concern was raised.  The Bord Plean&aacute;la decision was pending so people were taking a relatively sensible approach, waiting for that to come out, and it came out last week.  The difficulty is it does not look like any of the 44 units are built in compliance with the 2016 planning approval.  I have had conversations with planning officials and I am trying to find my way around them.  Some units may be in compliance with the approval.</p>  <p>  Under the enforcement regulations, South Dublin County Council has written to the developer and has given 28 days to reply.  We will have to wait and see whether the individual applies for retention or amended retention.  The difficulty is that as of last week, when the residents found out, they had assumed they would be on the street within hours and there was a degree of panic.  We have done much work to reassure them but there are complicating factors in the sense that people are from multiple local authorities, including some outside of Dublin.  Some people are not on housing lists but could be.  That is a process that must be looked at.  At least ten of the households have notices to quit because their HAP applications were refused.  I know that is one of the issues that will be discussed at the meeting tomorrow.</p>  <p>  There are people there from the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive homeless placefinder service and they need some reassurance that if they identify alternative private rental accommodation in the upcoming period, they can transfer the homeless HAP and deposit into the new properties.  That is technically not permissible under normal rules but they clearly do not apply.  We also have five or six private rent pairs who have paid considerable sums - in some cases, a deposit of three months and rent in advance - and they are now wondering if they will get those deposits back.  Threshold representatives were at the meeting last night to advise those residents.  It is very complicated.  If the local authorities that might have some tangential involvement is not at the meeting tomorrow, correspondence should be forwarded to it.  I spoke to Marguerite in the HAP section of the Department today about that.  If staff at the front line of local authorities are apprised of this as quickly as possible, individuals ringing in could be given advice relevant to this situation rather than the standard policy advice.  We do not want much confusion in an already difficult set of circumstances.</p></speech>

I am honoured by this opportunity and in the short period since receiving the nomination I have taken steps to engage with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and NSAI management in respect of the expectations not only on the chairperson but of the authority itself.  From my background in the medical devices and pharmaceutical industry at a national, European and global level, I have an awareness of the requirements and I have experienced the significant benefits accruing to organisations from the application of standards in a business environment.  In addition, my tenure on the board of IBEC and as president of the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland have provided me with an insight into the issues facing Irish businesses as they position themselves in the ever-evolving economic climate.</p>  <p>  My initial discussions have identified that NSAI has strong vision, mission, values and a good strategic plan to 2020, which was approved by the Minister.  I would like to take the opportunity to commend the work of the outgoing chairperson, Mrs. Julie O'Neill and the board members on the strength of the strategic plan, which will guide my chairmanship, if ratified.  In addition, the NSAI is a contributor to the 2018 Action Plan for Jobs programme, APJ, and Enterprise 2025 Renewed, with a role in the following actions.  The intention is to enhance supports for companies engaged in research, development and innovation, and the roll out of a workplace innovation toolkit.  The intention is to position Ireland to the forefront of sector-specific standards, including in medical technologies, chemicals, food and energy, to stimulate innovation, certainty and international reputation, as well as to manage potential consequences arising from Brexit.</p>  <p>  In the context of those initiatives, it is important to note that the NSAI is not a job creation agency but a key element in the trade infrastructure that underpins our economic activity.  I am advised that the NSAI has strong performance, operating and governance structures aligned to the delivery of its statutory and strategic objectives and the code of practice for the governance of State bodies 2016.</p>  <p>  I will now address the challenges.  The improving economic conditions and preparations in anticipation of a post-Brexit environment will provide challenges for the NSAI in the coming years.  I understand the Department is working closely with management to ensure alignment of the objectives of both the NSAI and the Department.  The intention is to target and refocus standards development activities to strategically support priority sectors identified as key to economic development, such as the medical devices sector.  We must ensure that the NSAI services contribute to Brexit solutions that minimise disruption to Irish business and enhance opportunities for entry to international markets.  We must also structure the organisation to deliver at maximum potential for Irish business.  We must further enhance Ireland's reputation as a country of choice with a robust trade infrastructure which supports the technical requirements of business.</p>  <p>  As a non-commercial body, the NSAI's income continues to be the predominant source of funding with 75% of operating costs met from certification and other fees charged by the authority.  With increasing costs and an ongoing programme of staff investment this model is under pressure.  I have noted that it will be 2020 before management is projecting a return to an operating surplus, which is a key objective for the board.  Brexit will undoubtedly present unique challenges for the NSAI, as well as in European and international institutions where we represent Ireland.  With support from the Department, the NSAI is assessing and positioning itself for the evolution of a final Brexit position.  I believe that the services provided by the NSAI will contribute to the Government's planning and business supports to ensure Irish business will emerge even stronger in a post-Brexit environment.</p>  <p>  My approach to the position of chairman is one of consultation and working with the board, the Minister, the Department and primary stakeholders, including Departments and agencies.  I look forward to working closely with Geraldine Larkin, the CEO, and the management team.  Together, we must ensure the NSAI delivers in line with the strategy, requirements of legislation and national objectives.  All of that will be done within a strong governance framework.  I also see a responsibility for championing the future role of the NSAI, thus ensuring its services are utilised and leveraged within the strategies of Departments.  In that context, I would welcome the opportunity to present to the committee, possibly on an annual basis, regarding the activities of the NSAI if it would consider that to be of benefit.  Within the technical and quality infrastructure that is Ireland's trading economy, the NSAI has an important role to play.  If my nomination is confirmed, I will be proud to contribute to that.  Should members have any questions I would be happy to take them.</p></speech>

Department officials have provided detailed briefing material for the use of the committee at this meeting, which includes comprehensive financial and recipient data.  This briefing also provides updates on the Department&rsquo;s performance on its output targets for 2017.</p> <p>  Members know that, while the scale of the Department&rsquo;s expenditure is larger than any other Department, the services it provides are also hugely important.  It is important for the people who receive payments or services weekly or monthly, but it is also very important for society generally.  The Department&rsquo;s work impacts positively on people throughout their lives, from the payment of child benefit to provision of the State pension.  It also provides much-needed support when it is required at various stages in between.</p> <p>  Each week, more than 1.3 million people - pensioners, people with disabilities, people on maternity or sick leave, carers and jobseekers - receive a payment from my Department.  In addition, more than 625,000 families receive child benefit each month in respect of 1.2 million children.  An allocation of slightly more than &euro;20 billion was provided for the Department this year, which represents 36% of gross current Government expenditure and is &euro;155 million more than was provided in the further Revised Estimate for 2017.</p> <p>  This level of expenditure is obviously significant.  It represents not only the level of service that we aim to provide, as a country, to our citizens when they are in need.  In addition, our social protection system is one of the key cornerstones in our social fabric, whereby tax and social insurance income is redirected to people when they are in need at different periods during their lives.  Without these social transfers we would see a society where poverty and social exclusion become more extreme and acute.  Through policy and legislative change, through this Estimates process and through our annual budget cycle, we seek to improve the system, to alleviate poverty further and to support families, children and older people while seeking to ensure that our spending is efficient, which means getting it to the people who need it most.</p> <p>  As I said, &euro;20 billion represents 36% of gross current Government expenditure and it is useful for a moment to consider the areas in which this money is to be spent.  The biggest single block of expenditure in 2018 will be on pensions, which will amount to almost &euro;7.6 billion, or 38% of overall spend.  Expenditure on illness, disability and carer payments will amount to &euro;4.2 billion in 2018, representing 21% of expenditure.  It is interesting to note that these two programmes alone account for almost 60% of total expenditure between them.  Working age income support schemes account for 17% of expenditure, at &euro;3.4 billion this year.  This includes payments for jobseekers, one-parent families, maternity and paternity leave and supplementary welfare allowance.  In parallel, expenditure on employment services, including community employment, the back to education allowance, T&uacute;s, the rural social scheme and various employment and activation programmes, amounts to &euro;823 million this year, or 4.1% of the Department&rsquo;s overall expenditure.</p> <p>  Thankfully, we are seeing expenditure on working age income and employment supports decreasing, both in financial terms and as a proportion of overall expenditure, reflecting the ongoing improvements in the labour market in terms of reducing unemployment and rising employment levels.  We still have a lot to do in this space and we are aiming to reach those furthest from the labour market to ensure that we provide people with as much assistance as possible to get back into either work or education and upskilling.  Expenditure on children and families will account for more than 13% of expenditure at &euro;2.6 billion, of which more than &euro;2 billion is spent on child benefit and &euro;430 million on the working family payment.  Expenditure on supplementary payments like rent supplement, and on agencies like the Citizens Information Board and miscellaneous services, accounts for &euro;814 million, or slightly more than 4% of expenditure.</p><p> To a large extent, the Department anticipates and responds to emerging issues in the economy and society.  The schemes it provides are demand led and expenditure is largely driven by demographic trends and economic factors, including changes in the labour market.  I have mentioned that we have seen welcome and significant improvements in the labour market over recent years.  These improvements have occurred at a rapid pace.  Results from the latest labour force survey show that there are now more than 2.23 million people in employment, an increase of almost 67,000 in 2017.  Reflecting the survey results, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for February this year stands at 6.1%.  Significantly, long-term unemployment reduced from 3.7% to 2.5% during 2017.  These trends in unemployment are reflected in reducing the live register.  At the end of February, there were almost 40,000 fewer people on the live register than the same time last year and 84,000 fewer people than this time two years ago.  The live register peaked at 470,000 in mid-2011 and is now around 230,000, which is a reduction of more than 50%.  The CSO will have new figures on Friday.</p><p> JobPath is one of the initiatives introduced by the Department which seeks to improve the employment outcomes for the long-term unemployed.  Since it commenced in July 2015, 151,000 people have engaged with the service and we have had notification of 30,900 job starts.  This is good news for all involved but JobPath is about more than that.  It is about assisting those who get employment to remain in that employment.  That is why even when a jobseeker has gained employment, he or she is offered a further 52 weeks of in-work support designed to assist those who have been out of the work place longest to stay in it once they have returned.  The statistics are published regularly showing how many jobs are sustained and for how long.  It is a positive service because customer satisfaction is very high.  Overall satisfaction has improved from a mean score of 4.05 in 2016 to 4.26 in 2017 out of a total score of 5.0.  Scores across the key areas of offices, staff, service and processes are very strong and all scores have improved significantly.  Out of 151,000 people who have engaged with the service, there have been complaints in just one third of 1% of cases.  In my humble opinion, this is incredibly impressive.  This is remarkable and is the synopsis of the real story concerning JobPath, which is not perhaps what one would see in some fora.</p><p> The reduction in the live register is freeing up the resources we need to meet demands emerging from demographic changes.  In addition, it provided the basis on which I could take steps in budget 2018  to ensure that everyone could begin to see the benefits accruing from our sustained economic recovery.  In budget 2018, I sought to ensure that people dependent upon fixed incomes saw some improvements.  I ensured that people receiving weekly social welfare payments saw an increase in their rates.  We all acknowledge that they are coming into force this week.  I placed a particular focus on families and children, particularly children living in poverty.  These increases will benefit our pensioners, people with disabilities, carers and jobseekers and will take effect from this week.</p><p> Focusing on families and children, the payment for qualified children on social welfare payments was increased to &euro;31.80 per week, or an increase of &euro;104 per annum per child, the first increase in these payments since 2010.  I also increased the weekly income thresholds in the working family payment for families of up to three children, ensuring that these families get a better return from their earnings.  This change increases the after-tax income of families by &euro;312 per annum.  In addition, I also introduced changes to improve the financial benefit of work for lone parents who take up some employment.  The income disregards for the one-parent family payment and jobseeker's transition payment increased by &euro;20 from &euro;110 to &euro;130 per week.  This change improves the level of take-home earnings of lone parents by up to &euro;520 per annum. I also removed the sunset clause for the back to work family dividend payment.  These changes, excluding the changes in the underlying basic rates of payment, amount to expenditure of an additional &euro;66 million per annum for working families on low incomes.</p><p> I am also conscious of our most vulnerable citizens and increased the fuel season by one week from 26 weeks to 27 weeks.</p><p>In the light of Storm Emma and the recent severe cold snap - the beast from the east - I also ensured persons in receipt of the fuel allowance received an additional fuel payment this year to assist with the cost of higher domestic fuel bills.  Furthermore, budget 2018 provided for the introduction of a new telephone support allowance, which will be paid to social welfare customers in receipt of both the fuel allowance and the living alone increase - people who are living on their own and of limited means.  </p><p> I was also pleased to be able to increase the number of places on the rural social scheme by a further 250 this year.  This was announced last week.  </p><p> While the level of youth unemployment continues to fall, it still remains unacceptably high.  That is why I also announced in budget 2018 the introduction of a new youth employment support scheme later this year.</p><p> A Christmas bonus of 85% was paid to over 1.2 million long-term social welfare recipients such as pensioners, people with disabilities, carers, lone parents and long-term unemployed jobseekers, at a cost of almost &euro;220 million.</p><p> The Department has also provided a briefing on claims processing last year.  For many of my Department&rsquo;s schemes, claims are processed within, or close to, the Department&rsquo;s processing time standards.  However, for some schemes, the processing time standards were not achieved in 2017.  This was particularly the case for schemes such as the carer&rsquo;s allowance and domiciliary care allowance schemes.  While the targets have not been met under these schemes, there have been underlying improvements.  For example, under the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme, the average number of weeks taken to award a claim fell from 19 weeks in 2016 to 14 in 2017.  Under the domiciliary care allowance scheme, the number of claims in hand was 40% lower at the end of 2017 compared to at the start of the year.  My Department is committed to ensuring claims are processed as quickly as possible and that delays are kept to a minimum.  It is worth mentioning that anyone who is awaiting a decision on a claim for a social welfare payment can apply for a means-tested supplementary welfare allowance payment pending the outcome of his or her social welfare application.</p><p> I want to make some comments on the position for pensioners who qualified for the contributory State pension in reduced rate bands since 2012.  Committee members will be aware of the efforts we have made to provide a solution for these pensioners.  I have discussed the matter several times with the committee.  I would like pensioners to feel we have listened and worked on a solution.  In January I was delighted to announce very significant changes in the pension system.  These changes will benefit tens of thousands of pensioners, the majority of whom are women, who spent time out of the workforce caring for their families.  The early availability of a total contributions approach, with substantial home caring credits, will deliver more equitable pension outcomes.  The changes are an indication of the value that we, as a Government and society, place on the women and men, now of pension age, who have worked both outside and inside the home throughout their lives.  The new total contributions approach for pensioners assessed under the 2012 rate band changes will come into effect from the end of this week.  Following the passing of the necessary legislation, my Department will invite over 40,000 pensioners, currently assessed under the 2012 rate band changes, to have their pensions recalculated under the total contributions approach to determine if they qualify for a higher rate of payment.  The first payments will be made from the first quarter of 2019, with payments backdated to 30 March 2018.</p><p> In comparing the Department&rsquo;s expenditure in 2017 with the allocation for 2018 it is important to note that variances in expenditure on most social welfare schemes are typically explained by a combination of factors which include trends, including downwards, in recipient numbers; changes in average weekly payment values, and differences in the number of paydays in any given year.  In addition, comparisons between 2017 and 2018 expenditure figures are further impacted on by the measures introduced in budget 2018, including the increases in the weekly rates of payment, and the payment of an 85% Christmas bonus in 2017, at a cost of almost &euro;220 million.  Provision for such bonuses is made, subject to the financial position of the State in October each year as part of the budgetary process, and is not included in the Revised Estimates at this time.</p><p> We have come through a difficult time for the country, n economic crisis that lasted for too many years.  As the economy continues to recover, we can now begin to see the benefits of more jobs and lower unemployment and ensure everyone in society will gain from this progress.</p><p>Recent budgets have allowed us to look at the social protection system and provide for improvements in the lives of the most vulnerable people who do not see an immediate benefit from the economic recovery but who are seeing improvements in their income.</p><p> My statement has sought to provide the select committee with an overview of the scale and scope of the Department's expenditure and how the significant improvements in the budget are reflected in the Estimates for 2018.  I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies and responding to their questions.</p></speech>

The select committee has agreed that the format of the meeting will be that the Minister will respond to each individual member's questions and that we will not bank Deputies' questions.  I ask members to be specific and direct and the Minister to respond with direct answers.</p> <p>  I will make one comment on the presentation of the accounts, to which the Minister also alluded.  In many cases, the outcome for 2017 is being compared with the Estimate for 2018.  The Christmas bonus is included in one figure and not in the other.  This means that we are not comparing like with like when we see expenditure increases.  Will the Minister to reconsider this approach in the presentation of the figures?  I am aware that the issue is explained in the additional information, but it is not immediately clear when one examines the figures in tabular form.  Is the Minister really telling the committee that she must wait until October before being able to state a Christmas bonus will be paid?  Given that no one expects the Christmas bonus to disappear this year, it should be included in the Estimates process.  The Minister can review the matter in her own time.  The issue is simply that the figures across all headings do not allow for a like for like comparison.  </p> <p>  I call Deputy Willie O'Dea. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-27a.248" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1367" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2018032700002#G00400"><p>I thank the Deputy for allowing me to speak first as I cannot stay for long.  </p> <p>  This is the first time I have scrutinised the budget for social protection, on which I note that expenditure as a proportion of the overall budget stands at 36%, which appears to be high.  However, a comparison with figures for other European states shows that they are much higher, standing at 40% or 41%.  I do not know what the reason is for the difference, whether it relates to the amounts paid or whether the social welfare budgets of other countries cover more areas.  It should be noted, however, that the Irish figure is not high and is lower than the European average.</p> <p>  I welcome the development in pension provision.  I was very much part of the protests that developed on this issue.  Without wishing to detract from the wonderful work done by the Minister on the issue, we would not be congratulating ourselves on this achievement were it not for the men and women who protested, kicked up a fuss, lobbied and ensured their voices were heard.  I am pleased that they will receive their proper entitlements, rather than living under penalties.  However, the decision not to do this retrospectively should be reviewed, particularly as the economy is healthy and growing, as the Minister noted.  These are the men and women who built the country and the economy.  We should provide for retrospective payments far in excess of what is provided for in the document which indicates that the new provisions will kick in on 30 March.  I will probably campaign with the same men and women for the restoration of more back money because it is not fair that it will be provided from 30 March onwards. </p> <p>  The Minister has indicated that the youth unemployment rate is falling and that she intends to introduce a new programme of intervention and activation measures for young people.  Why are they still being penalised?  This is the only cohort of the population which suffered discrimination under austerity that has not had payments restored.  I do no understand the reason we continue to penalise young people who are unemployed.  No attempt is being made to reverse the cuts they suffered.  While there are different categories of young person, their age does not mean that they need less to eat, spend on bus fares or pay rent.  Will the Minister to explain the continued penalties imposed on young people?</p> <p>  My secretary who lived on the lone parent's allowance for a long time and is a founding member of the SPARK organisation which the Minister has met many times makes some interesting points about the restoration of the income disregard which is now back up to &euro;130 a week.</p><p>The point she makes is that it was &euro;127 in 2009, whereas a basket of goods that could have been purchased for &euro;127 in 2009 now costs &euro;147.  There is no genuine restoration of the income disregard which was taken from lone parents during the period of austerity.  There is still a big gap to be filled and it should be looked at.</p><p> My next point concerns climate change.  A stink was kicked up in the D&aacute;il about the need for an extra week's payment for people in fuel poverty and it was very welcome that it was made to them.  However, as we will see more of it, there should be a climate change section to deal with the issues that will arise as a result.  I argue that, given that the Minister is responsible for employment as well as unemployment issues, we need to look at measures to ensure that, if there is another Storm Emma or Storm Ophelia and workers are told by the Government to stay at home, their employers will pay them.  There are tens of thousands of workers who got nothing - zilch - for the two days they were told to stay at home.  They stayed at home for health and safety reasons, not because they did not want to be paid.  This issue needs to be looked at in employment legislation.  All Departments need to look at the impact of climate change but particularly the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p></speech>

If I had my way, the figure would be 41%, but it is 36%.  I will challenge every single year to try to get more in order to be able to do some of the stuff we want to do collectively.  Nonetheless, there is a difference between our budget and those of many other European countires.  As such, we are not necessarily comparing like with like.  The budgets of other European countries include a lot of health and education stuff that we do not deal with in the Department because it comes under other Departments.  However, that does not discount the fact that I would like it to be more and the Deputy can count on me asking for more next year.</p> <p>  I hear the Deputy loud and clear on back money for pensioners.  Women, in particular, have been coming into all of our offices since the announcement was made.  The difficulty I have is that I can only make a change when I bring forward new legislation.  I cannot backdate the legislation to 2012 when the law was changed by the Parliament.  The new law I am going to bring in will have an effective date of 30 March.  I can only bring in a new law and make the changes now.  It is not about having a conversation with somebody about where we are going to get the money, rather it is about those who were adjudicated on under the law of the land for the past five or six years.  It is only because I am bringing forward new legislation that there will be a change to how they are adjudicated on.  I have no means of changing what happened in the past and while that may be difficult to hear, unfortunately, it is the reality, but that is not to say the Deputy will not support people politically and do what she has to do.  If she can come up with a solution, that will be deadly, but what I am being told is that I can only bring forward new legislation to effect change, which is what I am doing.</p></speech>

Effectively, what we are doing is bringing forward a new law to recognise that people were outside the workforce for a variety of reasons.  In most cases, we know that it was women who were rearing their families.  We need to be cognisant of the fact that they were not in the system.  Either way, it is not unique to this legislation.  It is as if we introduced new legislation to outlaw the murdering of cats, although there is probably already a law-----</p></speech>

If we were to introduce a new law today, we would not be able to charge somebody under it for something they did last year.  Unfortunately, that is the way it is.</p> <p>  On the income disregards for lone parent families, the Deputy is right that the cost of living has gone up.  I would have increased it by more if we had more money.  I have every intention of continuing to do so for as long as I am lucky enough to be in this role and able to look after the most vulnerable in society.  We are all aware, not just from ESRI reports but also from the physical evidence of meeting people, that the most vulnerable financially in our society are those living with disabilities and lone parent families.  They are the ones who need to be supported in whatever way we can support them in the next budgetary process and thereafter until they have a good quality standard of living.  I can give the Deputy a guarantee that as long as I am in this seat, that will be one of my priorities.</p><p>In particular, I want to address the issue of the 120,000 children who are living in consistent poverty.  Thankfully, that figure is decreasing, but it is not decreasing half fast enough.</p><p> On youth unemployment, we will be introducing a new scheme later this year for the under 26s.  As it will be on a voluntary basis, no one will be made to join it.  There will, however, be a large uptake, given the type of scheme that it will be.  I am looking forward to launching it in the next year in the light of the response we are receiving.</p><p> I will disagree with Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith who I know will disagree with me on the issue of changing the payments.  We are not asking anyone under 25 years of age to live on a lower payment than others.  They have the option of returning to training, taking courses and upskilling, for example, to become carers.  There are a variety of means for them to increase their payments to what they could be were they jobseekers over 26 years of age, if that is what they want.  I make no apologies for not wanting people younger than 26 years to be on the dole.  I want them to be working, which is why we are aggressively working via JobPath with young people who have spent more than 12 months on the live register.  We are finding them jobs.</p></speech>

We have an ambition to get young people off jobseeker's payments and not welfare dependent.  We want them to upskill, train and participate in the workforce.  That is what they also want.  If money is a difficulty for them, they have options to increase their payments.</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy on the issue of fuel poverty.  We had this conversation a couple of months ago when I appeared before the joint committee as opposed to the select committee.  I am undertaking some work that will further inform any decision we might make in budget 2019.  As I told the Chairman before the meeting, I hope to revert to the committee on the outcome of that work when I am ready to do so in order that we might have a conversation about it in advance of entering the budgetary process.</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy that there is ambiguity surrounding employment rights in terms of how climate change impacts on us.  We need to consider this matter.  Clear guidelines have been given, but they are probably not clear enough and we might need to re-examine them.</p> <p>  Did the Deputy ask about anything else?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-27a.273" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1227" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2018032700002#J01900"><p>I have a few questions for the Minister.  On pensions which was the topic of Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's final question, I am taken aback by the Minister's announcement today that there will be no question of compensating people from 2012 onwards, apart from what she has already announced.  My understanding of the Constitution is that it only prohibits retrospective legislation in the case of criminal law or revenue matters, for example, where someone is penalised, and that there is no prohibition on retrospective legislation to compensates people.  We can debate that matter again.  My understanding is that, regardless of who will gain from the changes the Minister has announced in respect of 2012 pensioners, thoe changes will kick in from this week but that they will not be paid until next year.  When will they be paid?  I presume it will be when the pension increase comes through next year, whenever that might be.  How will they be paid?  Will they be paid in one lump sum or will they be paid the arrears over a period?</p> <p>  On pensions generally, the Minister had to find an extra &euro;208 million because an additional 16,610 people had reached the age of 66 years.  That gives an indication of the looming pension crisis and how badly it is accelerating.  Does the Minister accept that one way to deal with the issue is to abolish mandatory retirement?  I read the Government's roadmap on pensions, in which there seems to be an implicit acceptance that, were mandatory retirement to be abolished, it might have a considerable impact on the pension bill in the future.</p><p>The Minister will be aware that Deputy John Brady and I have proposed Bills.  If they are defective in some way, I am sure we could sit around the table to rectify them and make them pristine.  Has anybody calculated what the Minister would save by introducing legislation to prevent people from being mandatorily retired before pension age?  If there was a link between mandatory retirement and pension age, people would not have to retire before reaching pension age.  Does the Minister have statistics that specify how many pensioners rely solely on the State pension because they have no other income?  How many rely mainly on it?  Does the Minister have figures that indicate the number between the ages of 65 and 66 years who are claiming jobseekers' allowance?</p><p> I would like to ask a few questions that relate to working age and employment supports.  Can the Minister tell us how much it would cost if we were to pay the same rate of jobseekers' allowance and benefit to everybody from the age of 18 years?  I am sure she has such a figure.  How much extra would it cost?  I note that Intreo is compiling a report on the effectiveness of the local employment services and jobs clubs, etc.  Is the effectiveness of Intreo in upskilling people and finding placements for them being reviewed?  I understand the JobPath programme is being reviewed.  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong in that regard.</p><p> The number who claim disability allowance has jumped by 6,270, a considerable increase.  There was a greater increase of 8.2% in the number in receipt of carer's allowance.  I presume the ageing population is the reason for the latter increase.  Will the Minister explain the increase in the number claiming disability allowance?</p><p> The Minister referred to domiciliary care allowance and carer's allowance when she spoke about targeting.  It is made clear on page 53 of the Estimates that the target of 15 weeks, or four months, was achieved in just 2% of domiciliary care allowance cases in 2015 and 2016.  In 2017 the figure increased to 24%, which is still very poor.  The target was met in 44% of carer's allowance cases.  People are waiting a long time to be paid these benefits which are means tested.  I know that they receive arrears, etc.  In the case of carer's allowance, just 44% of applicants receive a decision within four months.  In the case of domiciliary care allowance, fewer than 25% receive a decision within four months.  This shows the urgent need for improvements in this area.</p><p> In the case of children, has there been a review of how the working family payment is working?  What jobs are being taken up as a result?  I note that half of the increase of &euro;4.4 million in the allocation for the Citizens Information Board relates to administration.  Will the Minister explain exactly what it relates to?</p><p> I will conclude by asking the Minister about her figures for control savings.  A projected figure of &euro;510 million has been cited.  I take it that it refers to the extra amount the State would have to pay if these anti-fraud measures were not in place.  Are there figures to show how much was saved last year as a result of people being pursued and prosecuted for making fraudulent claims?  Will the Minister give us an indication of the total overpayments?  Most overpayments occur innocently as a result of errors on the part of the Department or the individual.  What percentage of errors can be attributed to fraud?  Annual savings of &euro;510 million were projected for the past couple of years.  The same projection has been made for this year, which means that there has been no significant improvement as a result of the anti-fraud campaign.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-27a.275" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2018032700002#K00200"><p>Where do I start?  I am surprised that the Deputy is surprised by what he considers to have been an announcement today.  It was not an announcement.</p><p>It was made clear in the D&aacute;il in January that I would introduce new legislation and what that new legislation would do.  That is what the couple of hundred people outside the gates were told.  In the correspondence I have received from most of them, there is an understanding there will be a new adjudication process for their cases using a different method, namely, the total contributions model.  The payment will come into place in the first quarter of 2019.  Whatever back payment is owed to someone from 30 March 2018 will be made in one lump sum on the first day after the adjudication.  Based on the adjudication, the pensioner will move to a new payment if he or she has decided to change payments.</p><p> The Deputy's second point was that he wanted me to abolish the mandatory retirement age, but my difficulty with that is there is no such thing as a mandatory retirement age.  I cannot abolish something that does not exist.  I have considered a number of ways of getting around what it is the Deputy is trying to fix.  I have met industry representatives.  The reason we cannot introduce a new law to the effect that, for example, Willie O'Dea cannot be made to retire at 65 years of age if he wants to work until he is 66, 67 or so on is the terms and conditions included in his contract are a matter for him and his employer.  Presumably, he would have signed that contract; therefore, if he wanted to change its terms, it would be a matter between him and his employer and it would not be for the State to intervene.  However, I have tried to ask employers to be cognisant of the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives and a valuable resource in an environment in which employers are telling us that they have recently been finding it more difficult to get workers.  Thankfully, that is a new problem for us.  They are proactively going to seek to extend contracts.  They have agreed with me that, where new contracts are concerned - for example, if someone's nephew was to start working in Dunnes Stores tomorrow - they should reflect whatever is the current age of retirement when workers retire.  As we all know, someone who is now in his or her 20s will not retire at 66 or 67 years of age.  The likelihood is that he or she will retire at 68 years after the legislation has been changed.  A contract of employment should reflect the reality as opposed to some long-standing practice of setting an age of 65 years, despite the change to 70.  I am trying to get industry to change its practice which I hope will seep in and result in people actually wanting to work for longer.  Possibly through the new pensions roadmap, I am proposing that we devise ideas on how to incentivise people, from a State pension perspective, to remain working for longer where they are in a position to do so.  Nothing has been finalised, but we are considering the matter.  It is not as simple as introducing a brand new law that no one can be made to retire at 65 years of age, as it is on a contract by contract basis.</p><p> If the Deputy does not mind, I will revert to him on the issue.  I do not have with me the figures for the numbers of people who rely solely or mostly on their pension.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-27a.277" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1227" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2018032700002#L00200"><p>The Minister can forward them to us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-27a.278" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2018032700002#L00300"><p>I will send them to the Chairman in the next couple of days.</p> <p>  To reply to the question on working age and the possibility of giving everyone under 25 years of age an increase to the level of the full unemployment payment made to everyone aged over 25 years, I will revert to the Deputy on the issue in the next couple of days.  I beg the committee's pardon, I have the information.  The cost of restoring jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance to the full rate for all recipients under 26 years of age would be &euro;90 million in a single year.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about a review.  I read in the newspapers that a review of JobPath was under way, but I do not know from where that information came.  Through the Intreo and JobPath offices, we work with our two contractors, Seetec and Turas Nua, very closely on a daily basis.  As such, there is a constant review of the cases sent to and returned from JobPath.  We have daily and weekly figures for the numbers of people who are successfully employed and retained in employment thereafter.  There is also a constant review of our internal structures in the case of JobsPlus, jobs clubs, Intreo offices and controls.  We regularly monitor the services we provide so as to ensure they are right for those who are looking for jobs.</p><p> The disability allowance increase is due to demographics.  The large increase is not specific to Ireland.  We are very much in line with all of the trends across the European Union.  Thankfully, people are living longer.  In many cases, they are leading healthier lives.  Those who are not healthy are pressing for various supports, as reflected in some of our schemes.</p><p> The working family payment is under constant review.  I want to be able to tailor it to make it more effective.  We started that process last year.  My predecessor, the Taoiseach, started it before I took over from him in this portfolio in June last year.  I made some changes in the budget in October 2017 and I am planning to make more this year.  The working family payment is under continuous review.  I want to make sure it reaches the widest number of people on low and middle incomes.  This is necessary not only to make sure they have a decent quality and standard of living but also to allow them to upskill and perhaps find a better job and career, as we have discussed.  The report on the working family payment being prepared for the committee is due to be given to us in June.  I hope to be able to come here at that stage to discuss my plans in that regard and get a buy-in and suggestions from members of the committee.</p><p> The Deputy asked me to explain why the level of control savings was on a par with that in previous years.  Our ambition every year is to continue to go after people claiming payments to which they are not entitled under particular schemes.  We will make sure our money is directed towards those who are entitled to receive payments under the various schemes.  I do not need to explain again the control savings of &euro;510 million.  The Deputy is familiar with the multiplication factor used.  The actual or real value of the savings is significantly less than &euro;510 million.  The Deputy is right when he describes the figure as a representation of what the cost to the Department of making additional payments would have been if the control savings had not been made and the payments had continued.  Overpayments of &euro;111 million were made in 2017,  just &euro;1.8 million of which resulted from departmental error.  In certain cases, we paid people who should not have been paid.</p><p> The Deputy also asked about the Citizens Information Board.  He is correct when he says an extra &euro;4.357 million has been allocated this year.  We were very pleased to be able to give this money to the board to pay for various things.  For example, &euro;327,000 is being provided to deliver on commitments made in legislation passed in both Houses on sign language permission, as set out in the national disability inclusion strategy.  A further &euro;650,000 is being provided for the replacement of the current wide area network infrastructure.  The improvement in the telephone systems will facilitate the development of high speed broadband links between the Citizens Information Board and its 220 partner delivery services.  Some &euro;1.4 million is being provided to cover the estimated cost of external restructuring arising from the board's decision to restructure the governance arrangements and reduce the network of regional companies from 93 to 16.  A further &euro;1.98 million is being provided to meet critical staffing needs across the 42 citizens information companies, the citizens information telephone service and the 53 MABS companies.  All of this adds to the total budget of &euro;53.05 million for the Citizens Information Board.</p></speech>

I thank them for coming before the committee.  I want to touch on a few areas.  </p> <p>  Page 42 of the document presented to the committee refers to additional money for branch managers.  I have sent correspondence to the Minister on the ongoing difficulties facing 58 branch managers who have engaged with the Department, but I have yet to receive a response.  Agreement was reached during considerable discussions, but out of the blue the Department withdrew from them.  To say the least, it was bizarre that it cited competition law in doing so.  Has the additional &euro;2.7 million been provided to address the payment issues that have arisen from the increased workload faced by branch managers?</p><p>Is it a new payment for branch managers agreed in negotiations between the Minister and the association?</p><p> On pensions, Deputy O'Dea referred to the mandatory retirement age.  As the Minister will be aware, I introduced legislation on this matter which has completed Second Stage.  I am awaiting a money message from the Government to allow the Bill to advance to Committee Stage.  Late last year, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, announced changes which would allow public service workers to remain in the workforce beyond their retirement age.  Strict guidelines will apply to these new measures, including a condition that persons seeking to continue in employment must first retire and be rehired at the lowest payscale in the relevant employment.  I realise this matter does not come within the Minister's remit.  Despite major concerns being expressed about these changes, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has not introduced heads of a Bill or legislation to give effect to them.  Legislation to abolish the mandatory retirement age could be introduced and older citizens who want to remain in the workforce would thank us for doing so.  In that sense, I disagree with the Minister's response to Deputy O'Dea's question on this matter.  Legislation could be introduced if there was the political to do so.</p><p> On the changes introduced in 2012 and the Minister's welcome announcement regarding her efforts to address the matter, great credit must go to organisations such as Age Action Ireland, which made this the political issue of the day.  While the vast majority of the citizens impacted by the issue are women, a sizeable number of men are also affected.  I commend Age Action Ireland and all the older citizens who mobilised and made their voices heard on this matter.  Will the Minister confirm that to qualify for a full pension under the total contributions approach, a person will require a full 40 years of credits?  Is that the position because people are concerned?</p><p> An issue arises regarding total contributions and self-employed people who became sick and no longer qualified for credited payments.  This is a serious issue which must be examined.  Is the Minister considering this matter and what provision is being made for self-employed persons?</p><p> On employment support programmes such as the community employment scheme, T&uacute;s and the back-to-education scheme, the Minister stated that the drop in spending under the community employment and T&uacute;s schemes was due to a "decline in the number of participants arising from the improved labour market."  Why have referrals to the JobPath scheme soared, while community employment schemes are struggling to fill places?  Is the Minister aware of the difficulty T&uacute;s and community employment programmes are experiencing filling places?  As I indicated, referrals to JobPath are soaring, whereas the number of referrals to these schemes is plummeting. </p><p> Last week, representatives of the Irish Local Development Network, ILDN, appeared before the joint committee.  They stated that there was a direct correlation between JobPath commencing operations and the decline in the number of referrals to their schemes.  They cited the example of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown where in 2015, the year JobPath was established, the number of referrals to T&uacute;s declined from 722 to 261.</p><p>In another area - this applies throughout the State - the local employment service, which was contracted for 20,050 referrals, has only received 15,900 referrals, a drop of 20% in referrals.</p></speech>

I do not mean to be facetious when I respond to the Deputy.  I am unsure who has told Deputy Brady that the workload has increased, but it has actually drastically decreased in recent years because our jobseekers have drastically decreased.  The workload of our branch managers has thankfully decreased from a jobseekers perspective, as has the workload of all the actual offices that are Department offices rather than branch offices.  Since they get paid on a work basis the revenue going into those branches has dropped in recent years because the workload has dropped.  That is why we sought to have a conversation with those involved.  We wanted to talk about giving them an increase in what they are being paid currently on the current workload for potentially changing practices and using more online technology and genuinely having a renegotiation.</p> <p>  Those negotiations were taking place productively but not without some difficulty - I do not think any negotiations are ever as sweet and pie.  Anyway, we had a grand conversation last year.  We came to an agreement shortly after Christmas.  The reason we had to pull out at that stage was because we received legal advice that what we were doing was close to touching the procurement rules.  It was right up to the nose and stretching to being illegal in so far as we were renegotiating a contract without actually putting it out to full public tender.</p> <p>  Now, we have pulled back temporarily to check the legal advice.  We have now gone back into negotiations with the branch managers' association and the talks are being chaired by Kevin Duffy.  I figure we are close to closing an agreement.  I imagine it will happen if not in a matter of days then definitely within a matter of weeks.</p> <p>  The talks have been constructive.  Under the final deal, when we reach it, the figure will be significantly higher than the figure mentioned by Deputy Brady.  This is because of the negotiations that we have had, as chaired by Kevin Duffy in recent months.  We expect a successful outcome.</p> <p>  Anyway, it is certainly not because their workload has increased.  It is because their workload has decreased.  Indeed, it has decreased drastically in recent years because the live register has decreased drastically, thankfully.</p> <p>  With respect, Deputy Brady and I do not agree on a great deal.  I do not think that mandatory retirement is set out in law.  Deputy Brady seems to think it is.  I definitely know that in practice people are made to retire at 65 years of age, but that is because of what their contract says and that is what is being carried out.  What we need to try to do is to change their contracts.</p> <p>  Much as Deputy Brady might have great faith in me and might think that I am running the whole shop, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, is the person responsible for all public sector employees and he is the person responsible for bringing forward the legislation.  I believe he has brought forward heads of the Bill.  He will bring it to the relevant committee to tease through what the actual negotiations had been with unions and public sector representative bodies.  The role from his perspective is to recognise that people in the public sector are living longer healthier lives and want to contribute.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, wants to find a mechanism to say that if they want to stay working until they are 70 years of age, they can do so.  Again, I do not have that responsibility.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Brady completely with regard to the advocacy group and the work Age Action Ireland does.  I think it is an incredible company.  I think the people the company works with and for are among the most good-natured group of people we have as citizens in the country.  We all know that woe betides anyone who messes with them.  Such a person will feel a real clip on the ear.  That is why I like working with Age Action Ireland.  The company is incredibly proactive and exceptionally reasonable.  Those involved do a great deal of helping and assisting when things need to be changed.  They were most helpful and co-operative with me during the time I needed their help.  I am keen to put my thanks to them on record.</p> <p>  I get the feeling some Deputies believe that when we start the public consultation on the total contributions model we will already have an end game in mind, but we do not.  The reason we are going to do a comprehensive public consultation process is to arrive at the end game.  This is one of the most sizeable reforms that we have seen to a particularly large policy in many years and we want to get it right.</p><p>The only way we will get this right is by listening to all of the people who will be impacted by it.  That includes pensioners and advocacy organisations, and might include a person in their 20s or a person in their 50s or 60s.  We will carry out a very public consultation process whereby any of the impacts, whether on self-employed people or people who are retired already and who may be able to move to the total contributions category if there is a window, will be laid out.  That will help us achieve the desired outcome.  There will be straw men put out so that we can go up and down the options and have a look at what it would look like, based on various suggestions, but we certainly have no end game in sight yet.  That will be very much determined by everybody's input over the next couple of months.  I hope to be in a position by the end of this year where we can all collectively say what we want, and where we will all feel that we have had some sort of valuable input into what the retirement situation will be when we all retire in a few years.  </p><p> I am always baffled when people think that one scheme is in competition with another scheme.  The new figures have been signed off on by Cabinet today, and the live register is consistently going down.  The aim of the Department is to help the 230,000 people still on the live register to get back to work, in the most effective way we can.  In some instances that will mean sending people to jobs clubs.  It might mean that people are sent to JobsPlus, or that they are put on a T&uacute;s scheme, which is compulsory.  For some people it might mean community employment, CE, which is entirely voluntary.  Deputies are being told that CE schemes are reporting that people are not being referred to CE schemes.  The Department never referred people to CE schemes.  It is an entirely voluntary scheme.  The jobs are advertised and people on the live register apply for those jobs.  That has not changed.  We are sending people with huge ambition to JobPath in their tens of thousands because we want those people - particularly the people who are long-term unemployed - in the workforce, because that is what they want.  I make no apologies for wanting to help people who present themselves as looking for work to help them get the type of work and the type of training they need to get the kind of job they want to get.  However, no course or scheme is in competition with another.  There are a variety of places and a variety of schemes-----</p></speech>

What did it cost?  People on the household benefit package were impacted just as much as others.  I am aware that the fuel allowance is means tested and is specifically for people who need it.  However, under the household benefit package many people are having gas or electricity paid for.  Those people did not get paid that extra amount.  How many people are on that package and how much would it cost to pay them the fuel allowance?  They were still badly impacted, and were told to put on their heating so that they would not get cold or ill.</p> <p>  Social Justice Ireland brought out a report last week which stated that more than 100,000 working Irish people are at risk of poverty.  The research found that 780,000 people live in poverty in Ireland today, and that over one quarter of those are children.  The point was made that tax credits are not refundable.  That should change.  Has the Department looked at that idea?  I do not know whether the Minister has seen the report or not.  I can send it to her.  Social Justice Ireland said that the failure to make tax credits refundable is totally unacceptable.  </p></speech>

That people who are working are in poverty in this day and age is a serious issue.  The report is called Poverty Focus 2018, if the Minister wants to check it out.</p> <p>  I refer to the pension legislation brought in this year.  This Government and previous Governments have been very creative in creating situations where people who were hiding money in offshore accounts were protected by way of the amnesties and so on.  They did not have to pay the tax they owed.  Here we have a cohort of people, particularly women, who over the last six years have been discriminated against because of legislation that was introduced in 2012.  The Department should have the knowledge and experience to be able to come up with an amnesty for those people, or something that would declare this legislation was discriminatory.  There should be some sort of compensation scheme, or something like that, for that period of time.  Those who got their pensions in 2012 have lost out big time, financially, over a period of six years.  It was highlighted in 2012.  It was not as if it was under the carpet, or Members of the D&aacute;il did not raise with the then Minister how it would impact on people.  It was only when the good people of this country realised what was going on, in critical numbers, and went out on the streets that the Minister was forced to review the situation.  Something has to be put in place.  Pensioners will continue to campaign to get that money backdated to 2012, and I will certainly support them.</p> <p>  I refer to the youth employment scheme the Minister will introduce later this year.  Can we get a report on that?  How exactly will it be run?  Who is running it?  What is the whole protocol around it?</p> <p>  I refer to community employment schemes.  I was at a meeting of the canal communities local drugs task force where people were devising a strategy to link in with the national drugs and alcohol strategy.  They made the point that they have heard that community employment schemes are now being told that workers have to be job ready.  Community employment schemes will now be geared towards people being job ready.    That will raise the question of how the community will be supported through community employment schemes into the future.  That is a serious question if that is the way the Department is approaching community employment schemes, namely, being geared towards people being job ready rather than playing that important role in a community, which needs support for task forces and that sort of thing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-27a.300" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1273" speakername="Joe Carey" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2018032700002#Q00200"><p>I welcome the Minister and thank her for her positive and open engagement with the committee.  It is important to recognise the huge progress that has been made in terms of reducing the live register figures.  The Minister said in her opening statement that there was a 50% reduction from 2011 to now.  The numbers are still high enough and there remains much work to be done on them, but it is important to recognise the work that has been done.  That work has led to a position whereby increases in the weekly payments to pensioners, people with disabilities, carers and jobseekers can be made.  Those increases will come about this week.</p> <p>  I refer to community employment, which a number of members have raised.  The Minister has said she will perhaps tweak the scheme.  There are issues around people who are eligible.  Some people would like to stay on in a community employment scheme, but it is regarded as a training scheme as opposed to an employment scheme.  The Minister received a delegation from Clare County Council on this issue.  The delegation, which included supervisors on community employment schemes, left the Minister with some proposals to bring about changes in community employment that would have a positive impact.  I refer to little tweaks that would enable people to stay on schemes longer, or make people eligible.  The Minister might inform us if she has looked at that question.  When will she be in a position to make an announcement on that?</p> <p>  I welcome the additional placements for the rural social scheme, RSS.  That scheme has a massive impact on rural Ireland and on a county like County Clare, so I very much welcome that.</p><p> Something that concerns me are the processing times for the carer's allowance.  A period of 14 weeks is a long time for someone who is waiting for that payment and who is providing a service to a person.  Does the Department have a target to reduce that processing time for this year?  It is important that we would have one.  I recognise the Minister's work in addressing the anomaly that was there in the State pension.  The compromise position the Minister has reached is a sensible one and it has been recognised by Age Action Ireland and by people who have campaigned for it.  I recognise the Minister's work in Cabinet to bring about that solution.  It is a workable solution and I welcome it.</p></speech>

I refer to the community employment and T&uacute;s schemes.  The community employment scheme, in particular, has been around a long time.  It has tended to evolve to reflect the economy, whether there was high unemployment and so forth.  Apart from the benefit to the individuals who are participating in the schemes, they have a broader community benefit.  It is important that the terms and conditions of the schemes are kept under constant review, both from the point of view of the community good and the individual, but also in the context of where the economy is.</p> <p>  There is a vote in D&aacute;il, so we will conclude very quickly.  I refer to a point that Deputy O'Dea raised.  In regard to the Citizen's Information board, it was surprising that there were no savings as a result of the restructuring.  I refer to mortgage interest supplement, which I have discussed with the Minister before.  The Estimate for this year is zero, so how are those people being funded, or what has happened to them?</p></speech>
