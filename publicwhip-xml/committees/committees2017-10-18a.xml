We will hear from Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, special rapporteur on child protection, and Professor Brian O'Neill, director of research, enterprise and innovation at Dublin City University.  Later we will be joined by representatives of the Law Reform Commission on the topic of cybersecurity with regard to children and young adults.<br/><br/>The first session will consist of the presentations by Dr. Shannon and Professor O'Neill.  I welcome both of them and thank them for their attendance at the committee.<br/><br/>Before we proceed I would like to read a notice on privilege.  In accordance with procedures, I am required to draw the witnesses' attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009 they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such way as to make him or her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/><br/>I remind Members to please turn off their mobile phones.  There is no service in this room and their mobiles will struggle to find a service.  The interference will be particularly acute if they are left on, so I would suggest simply switching them off.  Mobile phones interfere with the sound systems and makes it difficult for parliamentary reporters to report the meeting.  Television coverage and web streaming is adversely affected also.<br/><br/>I also wish to advise witnesses that any submissions or opening statements they have made to the committee will be published on the website after this committee meeting.<br/><br/>I understand the witnesses will make a short presentation, which will be followed by questions from the members of the committee.  We will begin with Dr. Shannon and then move on to Professor O'Neill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Geoffrey Shannon" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017101800002#B00200"><p>I would like to thank the committee for the invitation to address it on  cybersecurity for children and young adults.  As an ever greater proportion of children live more of their lives online, their time there inevitably becomes a target location for predatory adults.  As such, children engaging and socialising online on forums that are difficult for parents and carers to monitor and supervise, are acutely vulnerable.  The technical complexity underlying this kind of online offending offers a very different regulatory challenge to child abuse not perpetrated or facilitated through an information and communications technology medium, and therefore necessitates targeted ongoing legislative and other interventions.<br/><br/>The Internet is the new child protection frontier and is clearly a tool that can be used to the detriment of children by those so minded.  It warrants a particular concern in relation to child pornography and the grooming of children for sexual exploitation.  As the Internet is accessible worldwide, robust regulation is required so as to ensure that a uniform and coherent system of protection is engaged in to the benefit of children.<br/><br/>The introduction of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 last February demonstrates Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to better protecting its children from online predators and it specifically recognises the dangers that come with technological advances by creating a wide range of new criminal offences dealing with child pornography and grooming, with a particular emphasis on the use of information and communication technology in such offences.<br/><br/>A concern associated with children&rsquo;s Internet usage is the prevalence of cyberbullying or harassment.  In order to ensure that children are protected from cyberbullying in their online activities, regard should be had to the recommendation of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child that states should &quot;develop effective safeguards for children against abuse without unduly restricting the full enjoyment of their rights&quot;.  Online bullying is a challenge posed by the prevalence of cyberharassment and is being considered by the Government in the harmful communications and digital safety Bill 2017.  Such harassment can arise in a number of situations and can affect children and young people in different ways.  In particular, there is a need for broader harassment legislation in this jurisdiction and greater clarity on the remedy of &ldquo;takedown procedures&rdquo;.<br/><br/>In Ireland, the law in force at present only deals with harassment to a limited extent and has yet to be updated to take into account the potential for online abuse.  Section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 creates the offence of harassment in criminal law.  While section 10 already criminalises online or digital harassment as it refers to harassment &ldquo;by any means&rdquo;, online and digital harassment is under-reported and under-prosecuted in Ireland.  This suggests that section 10 of the 1997 Act in its current form is not sufficient to deal with these types of behaviour.  For example, the existing reference in section 10 to the use of the telephone alone in outlining the offence of harassment, without any reference to the Internet, makes the current offence appear archaic and outdated.<br/><br/>The definition of harassment should be broadened.  Any new definition should criminalise what is known as &ldquo;indirect harassment&rdquo;.  Currently, the offender must persistently follow, watch, pester, beset or communicate with the victim.  The offence does not include communications to third parties about the victim, such as posting content on public websites or sending emails to persons connected with the victim, but not directly to him or her.  I recommend therefore that not only should section 10 be amended to encompass online and digital communications, the definition should be further developed to allow prosecutions for indirect harassment to fall within same.  Having an overall broader offence of harassment on the Irish criminal Statute Book would be preferable, thereby encompassing new forms of behaviour that have arisen through the development of digital technology and which merit criminalisation.<br/><br/>While the criminal law seeks to prohibit certain behaviour and punish those who do not adhere to its provisions, a criminal prosecution is usually not the first priority for victims of cyber or digital harassment.  This point is particularly relevant in the context of children.  Quite often, the real remedy sought by persons so affected is what is termed a &ldquo;take down&rdquo;.  It is an issue that I have consistently argued should be blended into our legislation and I am urging that this matter be given priority by the committee in its deliberations.  It is the immediate removal of the offending publication or image from the website it has been posted on.<br/><br/>Historically it has been a major problem to persuade Internet service providers to take down material due to arguments that free speech rights are being curtailed.  At present, social media companies have their own self-regulated non-statutory reporting and take down processes.  Each social media company has a different policy in relation to harmful content such as hate speech, content that promotes sexual violence or exploitation, threats, fake profiles and other similar content.  Pursuant to same, individuals can report any harmful content that violates its policies to that particular social media company and request its removal.  The ad hoc nature of existing take down processes, which are dependent on each company&rsquo;s specific policies, means that individuals are at the mercy of each company, its regime and approach as to whether it will take the impugned material down and how quickly it will do so.<br/><br/>I endorse the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in its 2016 Report on Harmful Communications and Digital Safety concerning &ldquo;take down procedures&rdquo;.  All the other recommendations are an integral part of having a safe online environment for children.  The proposed Office of the Digital Safety Commissioner of Ireland should oversee an effective and efficient take down procedure in a timely manner, regulating for a system of take down orders in respect of harmful cybercommunications made in respect of both adults and children.  I would also add that in the terms of the role of the Digital Safety Commissioner and take down procedures there should be a requirement on the Digital Safety Commissioner to take down material within a specified period of time.  It is an issue that is not expressly referenced in the report of the Law Reform Commission, but it is one that I believe should be adopted.<br/><br/>Take down procedures are also to be considered in the context of the right to be forgotten provided for in the EU general data protection regulation, GDPR.  As a regulation, the GDPR will take effect in this jurisdiction automatically from 25 May 2018 and does not require transposition.  In my ninth rapporteur report, I discussed the right to be forgotten and its importance from the perspective of a child.  The right to be forgotten was held to exist in the seminal case of Google <i>v.</i>Spain.  In that decision, the European Court of Justice held that an EU citizen has the right to request that commercial search firms, such as Google, remove links to their personal information when requested, provided that the information is no longer relevant, emphasising an individual&rsquo;s right to privacy which overrides the public interest in access to information in certain circumstances.  Article 17 of the GDPR concerns the &ldquo;right to erasure&rdquo;, known as the right to be forgotten.  The right to be forgotten is not just an important right which may be exercised by adults.</p><p>It is even more relevant and important for children.  This is particularly so as children are less likely than adults to be aware that information they post online may be available long term and they may not consider the consequences of posting something online which may last long beyond their childhood.  They may post material online that may have significant consequences for employment opportunities in the future.  For this reason, I am passionate about the need to give a commitment to the right to erasure or to be forgotten.  While not stated in Article 17 of the general data protection regulation, Ireland should take the opportunity to include specific provisions on this issue in the Data Protection Bill 2017.  I am conscious that the Bill is not currently before the joint committee but given its particular relevance for children, I urge the committee to liaise with the Committee on Justice and Equality to ensure the right to be forgotten at least receives attention.  The relevance of this right should be acknowledged, children should be educated about the matter and it should be understood that the age at which an individual posts information online should be considered a very important factor in decisions about whether to remove an individual's personal information from sites.<br/><br/>In light of the loopholes in existing criminal legislation to which I referred, action has been proposed by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  At the final Cabinet meeting of December 2016, the then Minister received the approval of the Cabinet to draft the non-fatal offences (amendment) Bill, now named the harmful communications and digital safety Bill 2017.  I note that no further progress has been made in respect of the publication of this legislation and I suggest that it receive priority.  The Bill will legislate to put stalking, including cyberstalking and revenge pornography, on the criminal Statute Book and provide for the creation of new criminal offences, including criminalising the act of intentionally posting intimate images of a person online without his or her consent.  Furthermore, the Bill will extend existing offences such as the offence of harassment to ensure it includes activity online and on social media, as well as the offence of sending threatening or indecent messages to include digital forms of communication.  The announcement of an intention to legislate in this area is undoubtedly a positive development and it is anticipated that this Bill will endeavour to plug prominent gaps in existing legislation.<br/><br/>Our response to child victims of sexual abuse at times re-victimises the child.  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017, in recognition of children as vulnerable victims, provides for special measures, including that the child cannot in certain cases be cross-examined by the accused, which is set out in section 36, and includes rules governing the disclosure of third party records such as the child&rsquo;s counselling records, which are set out in section 39.  These provisions are to be welcomed.  However, despite Ireland's obligations, our laws have yet to transpose the EU victims' directive which, among other matters, provides that victims should have access to confidential support services before, during and after criminal proceedings.  The Criminal Law (Victims of Crime) Bill 2016, which is expected to transpose the directive into Irish law, is making its way through the legislative process and I understand it will be discussed in the Houses this week.  Ireland must, in primary legislation, reflect the spirit and terms of the directive and this legislation should be a priority.  The directive is part of domestic law and it is a matter of concern that it has not yet been transposed as this has consequences for victims.  Sexual abuse has a devastating impact on children.  It is imperative that the law requires joint interviewing by the Garda and Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, and the provision of victim support services. <br/><br/>Ireland is a signatory to the Budapest and Lanzarote conventions, both of which are international instruments emanating from the Council of Europe.  The former relates to cybercrime, while the latter relates to sexual exploitation and sexual abuse.  We have not yet ratified either convention.  Child protection should be proactive.  Having regard to those who use the Internet to the detriment of children, this is a prime area where legislation needs to keep one step ahead of the issues as they develop.  All the relevant conventions and directives should, therefore, be implemented immediately and without reservation.<br/><br/>This is not only a matter of law.  The law must be used to protect children as part of a much broader package.  In addition to legislative changes, I recommend the development of a strategy on cyber or online safety.  This should take the form of an overarching strategy on children's digital rights, a topic on which, I am pleased to note, the joint committee is engaging.  The report the committee eventually publishes may very well form the basis for such an online safety strategy.  Such a strategy should examine not merely the issues I have discussed but also wider issues around education and preparing children and young people to empower them to protect themselves from risks online.  A wider strategy on all aspects of the lives of children online could address access to the Internet for children in rural areas with less than optimal access to broadband or children with disabilities, data protection and privacy, the right to be forgotten, access to appropriate information, the right to participate, freedom to assemble online, the right to play online, etc.<br/><br/>I emphasise that many parents, carers and teachers are ill-equipped to advise and protect their children from risks online.  Education and awareness raising around the risks and opportunities and rights of children engaging online should begin very early in primary school and well before the age of digital consent in order that children are prepared and parents and teachers are in a position to advise and support them.  This should be part of the primary school curriculum.  I urge the joint committee to look beyond the legal framework and consider education as a key tool to equip parents and children.<br/><br/>Before making any decisions, policy makers should consider consulting children and young people on the issues they face and their real experiences.  Last week, the UK Government published a green paper on an Internet safety strategy, which can be found at <i>www.gov.uk/government/consultations/internet-safety-strategy-green-paper. </i>I urge the joint committee to consider this interesting report which reflects many of the issues I have addressed.<br/><br/>I am in no doubt that people in Ireland are unequivocal in their belief that children must be protected from online abuse, in particular, against heinous acts of online sexual abuse and exploitation.  The law must, therefore, keep pace with technology in protecting vulnerable young children and must exist as an accessible recourse for those who are victims of abuses such as cyberbullying.<br/><br/>I thank members for taking the time to listen to me and I will be happy to answer any questions they may have. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Brian O'Neill" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017101800002#C00300"><p>I thank the chairperson and members of the joint committee for the invitation to speak on this topic.  Like Dr. Shannon, I welcome the opportunity afforded by this discussion and the attention the joint committee is giving to the matter.</p> <p>  I have submitted a copy of my opening statement and in the interests of time, I will paraphrase some of its key points by way of contributing to the discussion.  My perspective extends somewhat wider than the legal domain and addresses policy and governance issues, as well as evidence from the research field on children's use of technologies.  My background is as a researcher and an academic in the field, with an interest in media and communications policy and related research and specifically in terms of my participation in a large and internationally renowned research project, EU Kids Online.  The European Commission has supported this project for several years as part of its support for an evidence based approach towards developing European and international policy in this field.  Ireland participates in EU Kids Online with 33 other countries in a network of more than 150 members.</p> <p>  The output from the research is available to inform our discussions on this issue.  We have been developing research since 2010 and these data continue to inform our discussion.  We have to keep pace with trends and developments.</p><p>In terms of some of the insights colleagues in this research effort have sought to contribute to the discussion around its policy implications, I will refer to five key points.  First, children are active agents in their Internet use and we should not assume that they are always passive.  They actively engage in online use for good reasons.  Many benefit very significantly from their online interactions.  Part of the challenge is that in many cases the environment within which they engage is not specifically designed for children.  There is always a question of either retrofitting or thinking about safety implications after the fact, where that has not been given due attention in advance.</p><p> Second, much of the research has focused on the risk agenda and risks that children encounter online.  It is as important in the policy domain in terms of promoting opportunities and the positive benefits that go with it.  Risk and opportunities are linked and that is an insight we have focused on in the research.  There is no way to separate them.  Increased opportunities bring risks as part of the experience.  It is a question of building resilience, dealing with potential harm and ensuring that remedies are in place to deal with more challenging situations.  The integral link between risks and opportunities is an important issue.</p><p> Third, risk itself is not the inevitability of harm - it is a possibility or probability.  It does not necessarily lead to harm.  Risk experience is a developmental feature for children and young people who sometimes seek out risky opportunities as part of their ongoing developmental task.  It is something that we need to bear in mind in the Internet domain.</p><p> Across all the empirical data we have collected about young people's Internet use, there are many different factors and it is about recognising the distinctiveness of every child's own experience.  Age is a significant overriding factor that now weighs heavily in terms of how we think about providing for and supporting young people.  They are very different issues.  As my colleague noted earlier, the need to think about ever-younger children beyond any legal definition of ability to consent is now paramount in the context of an ever-present technology based environment.  There are many other factors, but this is one which stands out predominantly.  There is parental mediation and, equally, the availability of digital skills is vitally important in re-enforcing young people's ability to make the most of online opportunities.</p><p> The final point in the evidence base developed from the EU Kids Online project is to support a consistent European emphasis on the multi-stakeholder approach towards developing good policy and good governance in the online space.  It goes back over 20 years of legislation and policy development in this area that there is no single solution, nor any one agent or party, that can take overall control and manage the online experience as it will play out for young people.  It is very much a multi-stakeholder environment.  It is a question and a challenge of finding the appropriate arrangements to ensure that all interested and relevant stakeholders have an opportunity to contribute to that space.</p><p> Through a succession of reports which I am happy to make available to the committee, both from the EU Kids Online project, the subsequent Net Children Go Mobile and Global Kids Online projects, there is a global evidence base around the various different parameters around children's and young people's experience, including experiences of harms and responses to how they deal with that, in order to guide and inform the response to this area.  We have specific studies relating to Ireland's experience and comparisons with EU and international norms.  We have also provided some specific data which is important in engaging with different stakeholders, such as the young people's experience themselves.  Young people have to articulate their own experiences of what they find positive, what they find negative and what has affected them adversely.  We must learn what responses work and whether a focus on technical solutions, such as filters or parental controls, is see to be effective.  We know that their take up is not hugely or universally endorsed.</p><p> There is an issue of so-called underage use and the need to provide independent quantitative data on the numbers of children under 13 years of age using services not designed for that age group, regardless of the merits of it and information about parents' own responses and whether a restriction or more active engagement is likely to be effective.</p><p> I have noted that research in this area is ongoing and has to deal with new and emerging threats.  It has to deal with changing technologies and the different opportunities that will afford.  It is certainly the case that young people are often to the fore in adopting new technologies and will be the first to experiment and find out all the ways in which potential challenges arise.</p><p> On the area of policy response and governance, through EU Kids Online researchers have contributed to European measures such as co-regulatory initiatives, working with industry and other partners in developing good practice in supporting young people's safety and empowerment online.  The Alliance to Better Protect Minors Online, a network of leading Internet companies, is a current initiative supported by the European Commission.  Prior to that the CEO Coalition also focused on a number of enhancements in terms of industry contribution.  Part of this is also responding to the communication on the strategy for a better Internet for children.  The Commission enjoined member states to step up their efforts in developing and supporting digital skills education in schools and requested industry to enhance measures around new areas of content such as user generated content and guidance to parents to support them in their role.  That work is ongoing.</p><p> I am currently leading a study which is a bench marking or comparative assessment of how individual member states have implemented this against the communication which was in 2012.  It informs European thinking in supporting better Internet experiences for young people while strengthening or enhancing protection measures to ensure there is sufficient good quality content, and better support available to young people to emphasise their positive dimensions.</p><p> In an Irish context, I also chaired the Internet content governance advisory group in 2014 which addressed many of these matters and drew on available evidence to assess the adequacy of Ireland's governance arrangements on online content and Internet safety and in advising how they could be further developed.  Our recommendations coincided with the Law Reform Commission's work which was then under way.</p><p>We made limited comment on the legislative framework in deference to the work of the Law Reform Commission which was under way.  We focused largely on the suitability or adequacy of our current support arrangements for Internet safety.  Those recommendations reflected detailed work and consultation with stakeholders and with children at the time and had representation on the group from all relevant aspects.  The recommendations were presented to Cabinet and are available.  They are awaiting a more definitive response on how the Office for Internet Safety, for example, could be further empowered and defined in terms of developing a role.</p><p> We also recommended an architecture for any suitable support for promoting better awareness of protection and education for Internet safety, and supports to ensure more effective communication between stakeholders, principally with industry and relevant Government agencies.  This principally recommended the formation of a council for child Internet safety, which is of particular relevance to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs but would also look to strong interdepartmental co-operation between Departments with responsibility for education and children, all of which are actively involved in a number of initiatives.</p><p> The recommendations have been submitted to Government for consideration and I believe they were positively received but we await further implementation.  I believe it is a resource which complements the work of the Law Reform Commission and its recommendation for the establishment of a digital safety commissioner.  The two in fact are quite complementary and stand as an important statement awaiting further Government response.  I thank the committee and I am happy to answer any questions.</p></speech>

I believe a few things are happening this morning, hence the low attendance.  That is a real pity because the presentations were very helpful.  However, everyone will have been circulated with the presentations by the Chairman.</p> <p>  Reference was made to stakeholders by both witnesses but in particular by Professor O'Neill.  Does he get the impression that there is buy-in from the digital companies such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram and the various fora in terms of how they view this area?  I do not know about all the companies because I am not a child and I do not know the detail of what is available to them or what they are interested in.  How do the companies view this area when it comes to their bottom line?  Obviously, parents, the Government and the Department of Education and Skills are interested in doing as much as they can, but at the end of the day we are talking about businesses.  Is there proper, meaningful buy-in from them?  I have a few other questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Brian O'Neill" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017101800002#E00300"><p>I am happy to respond to that question.  First, on a European level there has been a lot of investment in ensuring an ongoing dialogue with the key Internet industries.  It was not the first initiative but the Vice-President in the previous Commission, Neelie Kroes, made a very specific point of establishing what was called the CEO coalition.  It was a formal invitation to the CEOs of leading Internet companies to take Internet safety seriously on a European Union-wide basis and to support a series of initiatives where it was agreed that progress needed to be made.  That process continues under different headings and different labels.  Other stakeholders were involved as observers to the process.  It was a demonstration that companies do take questions of safety and children's well-being as an important topic and that they are prepared to collaborate and co-operate.  There are corporate social responsibility issues.  There is a recognition in terms of the absolute centrality of technologies in day-to-day life and that the responsibility now weighs on all parties and providers in the process.</p> <p>  While many different issues arose from that, it has been judged to have been a very productive discussion.  Similarly, in an Irish context, as part of the Internet content governance group we consulted very directly with industry.  We held a series of bilateral meetings.  The work of that group followed previous hearings by the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications in 2013, which similarly heard from industry on an ongoing basis about the priorities they were according to this and what they were prepared to contribute.  All in all, I think there is very much a willingness to discuss.  Ultimately, businesses are private concerns and how they develop and shape policies will be informed by the wider environment.  They do, of course, have a responsibility to run a business, but I have found no lack of willingness to engage and to get good insights as well in terms of their particular perspective.</p></speech>

It strikes me that it is one area where children are ahead of adults, not least in their exposure because they are interested in things adults have moved on from.  Do we need to get them involved in informing companies and policymakers of what is on their radar and what is important to them?</p></speech>

I agree absolutely.  One of the central values most interested stakeholders will put forward is that the Internet is an opportunity and a platform for children to exercise their rights to develop as young people and to find many positive opportunities to avail of.</p> <p>  Again, the policy approach at a European level must ensure that children have a voice and are represented.  Part of the commitment under what was originally the safer Internet programme and which is now the better Internet programme is that there is a youth panel specifically on Internet issues in all cases.  That is represented in Ireland under the safer Internet Ireland programme.  They are one part of the engagement but they speak for young people and they ensure that the education awareness raising initiatives speak from the experience of young people and that research itself informs on the basis of both surveys and qualitative work which articulate young people's experiences and their concerns.</p></speech>

They are not too long.  I thank Professor O'Neill for his responses.  It is easy to say that we need to educate parents.  Parents are concerned but they are busy.  In many families both parents are working, and with the best will in the world, they may not be able to allocate time to it or it may be something that is difficult for them to educate themselves on.  How do we educate them in a practical way?  Will they come to education programmes if they are held in the evening when they are not working?</p><p>My experience some years ago of arranging a public meeting to discuss issues relating to nutrition was that even though parents are very interested in such matters and, in the majority of cases, want the best for their children, they might not, for various reasons, attend such a meeting.</p></speech>

Indeed, research has shown that parents are the most important sources of guidance for children in terms of their online experience.</p></speech>

We must empower parents by ensuring they are in a position to give reliable, trusted and authoritative advice, and that type of parental guidance should be widely available.  The National Parents Council - Primary, a partner in the safer Internet Ireland project, offers resources and training to parents and would, I am sure, benefit from greater support for the work it does.  There is a strong recognition that the parental mediation role is absolutely central.  An important point to note is the new research showing the particular challenges facing younger parents and parents of younger children in this area.  There must be a greater effort to develop guidance for even the youngest children, including infants, in order that parents can assess the risks of exposure to the many different types of digital devices that are so widely available.  Children acquire a digital footprint almost from the day they are born.</p></speech>

Another issue I wish to raise is childhood obesity, an area in which I do a lot of work.  We spoke about the importance of getting stakeholders on board when it comes to Internet safety, and the same applies here.  Food companies must buy into the process if we are to succeed in reducing the sugar content of foods, reformulating recipes and so on.  The reality is that Internet companies and marketing providers in the food industry target junk food advertising at children.  This might seem like a frivolous issue when compared with sexual abuse and issues like that, but it is, in fact, a very important area.  Targeting children in this way amounts, in my view, to a violation of their rights.  Instead of targeting them, advertisers and marketers should be using the software and technology that is available to prevent such advertising being accessed by children.  Do the delegates have any comments on the legality of potential solutions to this problem?  We do not want to become too much of a nanny state but children are very vulnerable and impressionable and they are being marketed to in very clever ways.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.27" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Geoffrey Shannon" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017101800002#F00600"><p>This links into the Senator's earlier question about the need for engagement with industry stakeholders.  My view is slightly different from Professor O'Neill's in this regard.  The service providers certainly seem to be very well disposed to engaging on these matters, but there are question marks around the effectiveness of voluntary codes and self-regulation.  The State has a positive duty to ensure children are protected.  This issue, which was addressed to a certain extent in the Law Reform Commission report, requires a statutory framework.  I share the Senator's view on the problem of childhood obesity.  In fact, I dealt with that issue comprehensively in one of my previous rapporteur reports where I described it as a child protection issue.  If we look at the emerging situation in Ireland, there is huge potential for a situation where we will see far-ranging consequences for children.  Companies exploit children by advertising in a way that is especially attractive to young people, and that can have devastating consequences.  I welcome the sugar tax initiative in the budget and was disappointed to hear criticism from some commentators of the measure.  This is an important child protection issue and the sugar tax represents the first step in an attempt to regulate a situation in which children may be deeply affected.</p> <p>  On the importance of listening to the voice of the child, I have consistently raised that issue, including in my opening statement today.  It is of enormous importance that we hear directly from those who are affected by technology.  The Irish people voted to insert Article 42A in the Constitution guaranteeing children a say in decisions likely to affect them.  That constitutional provision should permeate all our legislative frameworks.  The reality, of course, is that children are often very much more aware of and informed about technology than are their parents.  As well as emphasising the role of parents in providing guidance, we must also look to schools, because children spend a large portion of their time there.  I am passionately of the view that if we place this issue on the curriculum, where it becomes a core part of what we teach our children, we will bring both parents and children with us.  The Senator asked how we might achieve this.  We can achieve it by blending it into the school curriculum for children from the youngest possible age.  Parents are already alive to some of these issues.  It is a challenging question and probably the most important issue raised this morning, that is, how we can educate society about the benefits and downsides of technology.  Much of the research in which Professor O'Neill has been involved points to the advantages of the Internet.  Article 5 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child is clear about evolving capacities, and we know children can derive significant benefits from the Internet, whether in terms of accessing mental health websites or otherwise.  The solution then is not to restrict access but to focus more on education.</p></speech>

What is the delegates' view on the prospect of including a life skills class in the school curriculum, including for the very youngest pupils, which would encompass everything outside of the ordinary curriculum?  This would be in addition to the need to have PE as a curriculum subject, which is something I strongly advocate.  I did not study home economics at school but I recall there seemed to be a lot of bun making and production of other sugary dishes, as well as some practical stuff.  A life skills programme would see children learning about Internet safety, how to mind themselves physically and that food is fuel.  Parents should be brought into the process by, for example, inviting them to attend a session on one day per month, so it would be a collaborative process.</p></speech>

We must accept the reality of new and rapidly changing technologies and modes of communication.  If we had an opportunity to discuss them in formal settings, such as what the Senator described, it would greatly enhance our ability to manage some of the risks.  I accept Professor O'Neill's point that there are advantages for children in engaging with technology.  It is a question of how we manage the associated risks in a way that is not damaging to children.  The Senator's proposal could be of significant assistance in this regard.</p></speech>

Part of the difficulty, however, is the ability or otherwise of schools to address the issue comprehensively and consistently.  The social, personal and health education programme offers many opportunities and curriculum points for discussing children's use of technology.  We must acknowledge that digital interaction is part and parcel of how children communicate, learn and access entertainment.  It is important that teachers have sufficient resources and training available to them to make the best use of technology in the context of a world that is rapidly evolving.  Children's usage of new technologies will proceed apace.  Having opportunities within the curriculum to emphasise consistently across all subject areas the importance of effective and responsible use of online or connected technologies is crucial.  That issue is getting a good deal of attention, both within education and in the wider policy discussions.</p></speech>

Many teachers would say that they are not equipped to communicate this important information.  There are clear and powerful messages concerning teacher training in this area.  I accept what Professor O'Neill says.  The information may very well be on the curriculum but it is a question of making sure it is translated to the coalface.</p></speech>

It is amazing what is going on in the audiovisual room at the moment in respect of the Mental Health Commission.  I believe some online activities can also lead to mental health difficulties.  The reason many of our colleagues have stepped out at this moment is to be in the audiovisual room.  One of the ladies involved, Senator Joan Freeman, is presenting her report.  Much of the negativity over the Internet recognises a stepping stone that can lead to mental health issues.</p> <p>  I am going to jump over, as it were, one or two little points.  We might have a conversation as we proceed.  I will follow the theme of education.  I am a mother of three children.  When they were in national school, we struggled to find a speaker to talk to parents about good, safe digital activity, the various sites one should visit, the various links, and the three-letter acronyms.  It was a question of understanding children's conversation.  They can have a conversation very different from what I am used to.  They are far ahead of us.</p> <p>  This brings me back to the matter of buy-in from parents, the Government, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health.  Teachers need the support but they have to get the buy-in from the Department of Education and Skills.  They need the tools to be able to deliver, either through the curriculum or through teacher training college.  The relevant information needs to be nearly as important as Irish, English, mathematics and religion.  It comprises one of their skills for life.</p> <p>  We need to educate children in preschool, for the simple reason that one can do so with a little puppet.  One can teach children about healthy eating and healthy activities.  One can teach children that Peppa Pig dancing in the muddy puddle is actually bad behaviour because her mother has told her not to do it.  My point is on that form of education.  What do both delegates believe we should be doing to support the Departments?  If they had the opportunity to guide us and ask the Departments how they should equip themselves to engage with the parents and pupils, what would they advise us to do from a policy perspective?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.37" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Brian O'Neill" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017101800002#G00700"><p>I fully support the Deputy in raising that issue.  There is a need to focus on the availability of high-profile, well-resourced and trusted guidance and content.  It is a confusing issue for many parents.  It is also confusing for young people if there is not a familiar resource available.</p> <p>  In a report for the Internet content governance advisory group and in some of the other policy discussions, we focused on what exists currently and how it needs to be strengthened.  That is in particular reference to safer Internet centres.  The entire safer Internet programme at European level has delivered over the past 15 years.  A concept evolved in the early 2000s that there should be a network across Europe of helplines and hotlines in addition to an effective reporting mechanism for legal content and, importantly, support for educational and awareness-raising content.  The awareness centre, or the awareness node, has become a crucial part in this regard.</p> <p>  In Ireland, the Professional Development Service for Teachers, PDST, acts as the key educational partner and has a particular role in respect of schools and supporting teachers in terms of providing educational materials, developing campaigns, training teachers through in-service programs and so on.  We felt, however, that this model should be much better known and more widely available.  It has the National Parents Council as a partner.  Likewise, its services to parents, whether through training programmes or good, effective resources and guides, ought to be better known and more widely available.  This experience is borne out across Europe.  I refer to the questions of whether a well-regarded and visible source of guidance would be beneficial, whether the digital safety commissioner, for example, is a very public and visible concept that would give effect to that in terms of offering something to the public through a one-stop shop as a point of contact and place where a person could ask what he or she needs to know as a parent or what that person would do if he or she came across an issue about which he or she was unsure or a problem that person could not deal with.</p> <p>  Safe Internet centres comprise a really important concept in this regard.  We need to emphasise it and continue to determine how those concerned can be assisted to do their job even better.</p></speech>

I agree with the point on cr&egrave;ches, and it is a very important one.  The point I have been trying to articulate in terms of inculcating good practice is, the younger, the better.  It is not just an education issue but also a profound child protection issue.  One of the issues I have consistently articulated is that online grooming is a real vulnerability.  If children are gaining access to material online, there is the potential for them to be exploited.  The earlier we educate children on the vulnerabilities, in addition to the opportunities, associated with the Internet, the more successful we will be in preventing cyberbullying and cyberharassment.  There are all interlinked.</p> <p>  With regard to the digital safety commissioner, I strongly endorse the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission on this issue.  My vision for the future is that the digital safety commissioner will take the lead.  We need somebody to take the lead on this issue.  There is a real opportunity associated with establishing an office designated to deal with this issue.  It would be a society-wide approach rather than a sectoral approach.  My vision is that the digital safety commissioner will liaise with the Data Protection Commissioner and all the other bodies.</p> <p>  At a previous meeting of this committee, I talked about inter-agency co-operation.  We need one lead agency rolling out the vision.  That should be supplemented by a strategy on cyber safety or online safety that would be relevant for the education sector.  We need a comprehensive and cohesive response.  That needs to be led by the Department of Education and Skills and it needs to identify an appropriate curriculum for each level of education, from cr&egrave;ches onwards.  We have seen a very significant expansion in State funding for cr&egrave;ches.  The other side is that there is now an opportunity for the State to insist this issue be addressed at cr&egrave;che level and then at primary and secondary levels.  Then we would have a whole-of-education response to this issue.</p></speech>

The point I articulated in my opening statement was that Article 17 of the general data protection regulation provided a further framework for dealing with this issue.  I am suggesting we have an express statutory provision, modelled on Article 12, in order that this right would be reflected in our domestic legislation.  Who has not posted material which they regretted afterwards?  This is particularly important in the context of children.  We know that teenagers will post material online in haste and may very well regret it.  Where I see it as being particularly poignant is in the context of a young adult applying for a job as such posts might be found if a potential employer were to make a search on Google.

Many may not give their posts thought, but we can presume that they do.  A child does not have the same capacity.  It depends on his or her capacity.  I am suggesting we need to treat children differently and show much more sensitivity and flexibility, given the consequences which may very well follow a child into adulthood.</p></speech>

This also came up in Dr. Shannon's submission and I would like Professor O'Neill to answer the same question, if he does not mind.  It is about the Budapest and Lanzarote Conventions.  Do either of the delegates know what barriers have held up Ireland in enforcing or enacting these conventions?</p></speech>

It is not just a question of signing the international instruments but also of being held accountable in respect of them.  One convention deals with cybercrime, while the other deals with sexual exploitation and sexual abuse.  It is of paramount importance that we send a clear message that this country has signed up to and ratified all of the key international instruments which protect children.  It is my understanding that once the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill is fully commenced, we will be in a position to ratify both instruments.  Another roadblock was the Criminal Justice (Sexual Offences) Act 2017.  It has now been commenced.  There is no remaining roadblock to Ireland ratifying the instruments.  In fairness, it is my understanding the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill is at a very advanced stage.  I suggest the Minister commence it without delay.</p></speech>

There should be no ambiguity about Ireland's position.  We should reinforce the message that we support Internet safety.  We should be able to stand in the international community as having ratified all relevant directives.</p></speech>

How is the panel in which young people participate advertised?  How can children become involved?  As Senator Catherine Noone said - I think we all agree - children's involvement in this area will help to shine a light and that they will bring more people with them.  How is it promoted?  How are children encouraged?  How can we get more of them involved?  Should it be done through secondary or primary schools?  How can we bring everybody into this conversation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.49" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Brian O'Neill" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017101800002#H00900"><p>Schools certainly are central to this initiative.  Many of the current activities are focused on the school.  As schools reach all children, they are vital central points.  There is an advisory youth panel attached to the Safer Internet Centre which is co-ordinated by Professional Development Services for Teachers, PDST. It is, therefore, an agency of the Department of Education and Skills.  The panel is a central part of the annual safer Internet day programme.  Many of the educational materials have arisen from initial discussions with the youth panel which is a relatively small group.  It is operated via schools and activities.  There is an opportunity for schools to replicate that process within each school community.  Peer-led education has certainly proved most effective in communicating with young people.  Many of the initiatives under the action plan on bullying, for example, showed this.  The big focus on good, effective supports within schools has shown the importance of peer-led education.</p></speech>

Twitter is rarely positive.  There was a study carried out of young people in the United Kingdom.  To follow on from a point made by Deputy Anne Rabbitte made about mental health, it is not a crime for someone to only post photos in which he or she looks his or her best.  There are many people who seem to be living lives like those seen in the movies and children are looking at such posts all the time.  There was a study which showed that four out of five of these sites were having a harmful effect of young people's mental health which was leading to feelings of inadequacy and anxiety.  Body-shaming issues and worries about body image also arise.  It is clearly not a crime, but are there interesting developments in this area?  Surely, some of the stakeholders should be encouraged or somehow incentivised to invest a portion of their significant marketing budgets in positive mental health promotion initiatives.  Is there any discussion taking place on that issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.53" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Brian O'Neill" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017101800002#H01300"><p>It should, of course, be a key element.  There is a very diverse environment and young people seek out all kinds of content which guides them in terms of their aspirations and provides key sources for identity development.   All companies have a great responsibility in what they make available in the public domain.  Dealing with these issues also comes down to educating young people about their media literacy in order that they can understand images and how to approach them with real critical discrimination in order to determine their messages and the messages which circulate among peers.  That has been ongoing emphasis of the education effort.</p> <p>  On the mental health domain more generally, there is a lot of expertise among children's charities in addressing this issue and particularly in reaching vulnerable children.  For many, this may not be an issue, but for vulnerable children, in particular, we must ensure there is provision and support, that teachers and parents are alert to potential problems which may arise and that companies and providers are sensitised in how they respond when potential issues of disclosure arise.</p></speech>

I remember that when my parents were younger, I would say such a one had bought a bottle of whatever.  This may have even continued when I was in college.  I remember that my mother would say she hoped I would not be too impressed by it.  Simple things like children feeling they can communicate with their parents probably also extend to the provision of parental education.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.55" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1300" speakername="Alan Farrell" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017101800002#H01500"><p>I would like to put a couple of questions to the delegates.  Their opening statements were clear and concise.  I appreciate their taking the time to come and give the committee a broad overview and a good grasp of some of the issues involved.  I have a couple of observations to make on the points made by Dr. Shannon about terms of service and self-regulation, particularly in social media companies.  While the experience of some social media outlets is positive, with the exception of the knock-on effect, to which Senator Catherine Noone referred and which is a difficult issue to grasp, if one looks at some of the other sites, it is very clear that the terms of service are not applied uniformly.  I have experienced it personally.</p><p>I have experienced it through constituents, colleagues in both Houses of the Oireachtas and while socialising.  People have been subjected to horrendous tirades of abuse.  This applies to adults as well as to children.  The cases that have been brought to my attention have mostly involved adults.  I will not name any particular provider, but I am sure everyone present can guess.  There is no uniform application of the terms of usage.  Dr. Shannon referenced this issue and asked whether it was necessary to introduce a single entity with control or oversight of the whole sector.  Perhaps not uniquely in this jurisdiction we have multiple Departments with multiple oars involved and no single entity is running the show.  From my reading of the documentation and the general air since I became Chairman in July, it is troubling that despite all of the very positive work done by the last D&aacute;il and Seanad on the issue of child protection, including the Children First Act 2015 and the children's rights referendum, there is still no singular entity in place.  </p><p> Dr. Shannon referenced the establishment of an office of the cyber or online safety commissioner.  Such a commissioner would be afforded the opportunity to have overarching responsibility for the various Departments in dealing with the issues of cyberbullying and child protection.  </p><p> The delegates may have comments to make on my observations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.57" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Geoffrey Shannon" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017101800002#J00200"><p>I very much agree with the observations of the Chairman.  I was before the committee recently to discuss the section 12 audit.  One of the key issues to emerge was the absence of robust inter-agency co-operation.  We will never be successful in protecting children unless we actually have cohesion and agencies working seamlessly together.  There is a real danger that multiple bodies will be established which may lead to some issues falling between the cracks, meaning that children will remain unprotected.  The establishment of the digital safety commissioner which I reference on page 3 of my opening statement will bring about the leadership and cohesion required.  Having one office with the responsibility for dealing with digital safety and liaising with other agencies will ensure we will achieve the objectives we are discussing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.58" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1300" speakername="Alan Farrell" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017101800002#J00300"><p>Does either of the delegates have a view on the application of terms of usage of any of the larger social media providers in terms of the implications involved when a person actually reports abuse?  There was reference to figures which suggested around 7% of those affected reported abuse.  It is such a low number.  Many children will report it to a parent or a teacher, but such small numbers are reporting to the service providers.  My own observational experience has been that the service providers' terms of reference are just there for show. There does not seem to be uniformity in how they are applied.  Do the delegates have a view?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.59" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Brian O'Neill" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017101800002#J00400"><p>The terms of use, the community guidelines and all of the various ways companies set forth the rules under which users engage their services are fundamental requirements.  I agree with the Chairman that sometimes there are difficulties in perceiving just how effective they are.  Our statistic referred to the low take-up by young people, particularly when it comes to bullying and abuse.  It was one of the least used options, either because it was felt not to be effective or because it did not deal with the immediate problem.  There are codes of conduct.  We have spoken about the various codes that apply in this area, but all of the major companies providing social media services, with few exceptions, have signed up to the safer social networking principles brokered by the European Union which have been through two successive rounds of evaluation.  Added emphasis in evaluating their effectiveness and how well they are implemented is a very important step in that regard.</p> <p>  On the point concerning how this is overseen and by whom, the office of the digital safety commissioner would be an obvious point where it could be co-ordinated or organised.  That is the basis on which it is operated in Australia.  The Australian eSafety Commissioner has developed a code of conduct to which companies subscribe and which is subject to a transparency audit.  These are some of the mechanisms and ways in which we seek to make progress.</p></speech>

Is this a matter for the Union?  Should it be trying to implement a blanket rule for child protection measures online?</p></speech>

Best practice at European level is something we have tried to document in some of the reports.  The online content governance also references good European practice.  There is a common theme throughout, involving the development of safer Internet centres and support services.  There is a further layer at individual country level.  Different countries have responded differently.  It concerns good, effective co-ordinating strategies to support the inter-agency co-operation about which we have spoken and to bring forward effective measures.</p> <p>  There are different responses.  As was noted at the outset of the meeting, the United Kingdom has put forward a Green Paper on a national strategy for Internet safety.  It has experience of working with a council - the UK Council for Internet Safety - which interestingly also referenced Ireland's Office for Internet Safety when it was set up.  It is a particular type of model and one effect it has had is ensuring there is a forum within which the stakeholders involved can play a part.  There has to be an opportunity for industry representatives both to come in and be held to account.  There must be a platform on which issues, risks and trends can be articulated and aired.  Whatever title it is given, the platform is required and there must be visibility and oversight by a single agency.</p></speech>

I commend the Australian and UK models.  The paper I reference in my opening statement which was issued last week is very interesting and outlines some of the approaches we should follow.  I also reference the Law Reform Commission's report.  The data for other models given in that report are very interesting too.  We need to create a home-grown model, recognising the particular issues facing Irish children.  There is often a tendency to adopt models slavishly from other jurisdictions without looking at the context.  The context is important in any model we might develop.  Regardless of the office that has responsibility for this matter, it is important that these issues be dealt with without delay.  If we are to establish an office of the digital safety commissioner, it is important that we establish time limits.  In the context where material is posted online, that office must be required to deal with issues within a specific period of time because this is time sensitive.  If material is posted online, it is of the utmost importance that there be an adjudication of whether it should be removed within a short timespan.</p></speech>

From a personal perspective, I am not ignoring either of your suggestions.  However, it occurs to me that, as one of the largest hosts in the world of many of these social media entities, we should take the lead with regard to how these providers are governed.  In fact, I think it is our duty to do so.  We have seen benefits from the Data Protection Commissioner having to make decisions on certain aspects of how social media firms import and export data from Ireland.  It shows we have an opportunity to flex our muscles in accordance with our law.  Therefore, there is an opportunity for us to do the same with regard to child protection.</p> <p>  Thank you, Dr. Shannon and Professor O'Neill, for coming in and giving of your time to the members.  I found the opening statements that you both submitted to be fascinating.  As a new member to this committee and as the new Chairman, I found them to be very helpful and I appreciate that.

They include Mr. Raymond Byrne, who is the full-time commissioner, and Professor Donncha O'Connell, professor of law at NUI Galway and head of the law school there.  Ms Justice Carmel Stewart, who is a judge of the High Court, and Mr. Tom O&rsquo;Malley, senior lecturer in law at NUI Galway, are also commissioners.  As you indicated, Chairman, Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Burke is our director of research.</p> <p>  The harmful communications and digital safety project was one of 11 projects within our fourth programme of law reform.  It was the sixth project.  All our commissioners participate fully in and contribute to all the projects.  Our methodology includes the appointment of what we call a co-ordinating commissioner for each project.</p><p>That means that each of the commissioners is a co-ordinating commissioner in respect of two of the projects, and takes a particular interest in and certain responsibility for that with the full-time commissioner, the director of research and appointed and nominated researchers.</p><p> The co-ordinating commissioner in respect of this report has been Professor Donncha O'Connell.  With the permission of the committee, I ask him to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

It is a great privilege for the Law Reform Commission to speak to the committee and we are very grateful for the invitation to do so.  I should acknowledge the obvious at the beginning, namely, that we are all men.  That is not to convey any sense that the report was prepared only by men.  In fact, the lead commissioner before I took over as co-ordinating commissioner was the full-time commissioner, Ms Finola Flanagan, and the lead researcher on the project was Ms Fiona Regan.  Both have since left the commission to work elsewhere.  I do not want to give the wrong impression; this is the manifestation we have today.</p> <p>  The report on harmful communications and digital safety was published in September 2016.  We also published a draft Bill which we intend to be a helpful guide to those who are directly concerned with the legislative process.  It is by no means the last word or definitive guide.  Rather, it is merely intended to be helpful.  With all of its reports the commission publishes draft legislation as an aid to the Legislature.</p> <p>  Our consultative process for this report, as the president has outlined, was part of the fourth programme of law reform whose end is now imminent.  We are, in fact, embarking on a consultative process for the fifth programme of law reform.  One of the innovations in regard to the adoption of the fourth problem was that the Government referred the draft for the programme to the justice committee at the time in order to receive its views.  On behalf of the commission, I would like to acknowledge that was extremely helpful in finalising the fourth programme of law reform because it indicated to us the political priority which attached to certain projects over and above others.  We had 11 projects, none of which were in any sense more important than another, but it was very helpful to us to see what the political system valued or saw as urgent.  I hope in the conclusion of the fifth programme we will have a similar consultation with the Oireachtas.  It was immensely beneficial and added significantly to the legitimacy of the fourth programme.</p> <p>  We engaged in a very extensive consultation process in respect of this project in the fourth programme.  Many submissions to the fourth programme mentioned cyberbullying and online harassment of young people and adults.  That was one of the reasons the report was settled upon.  We published an issues paper in November 2014, which is a consultative pre-report paper.  This is the normal practice for the commission.  We received a lot of feedback on that from various stakeholders.  We had a seminar in April 2015 which was attended by over 100 participants, including some of the social media companies mentioned in the previous session.</p> <p>  With reference to Senator Noone's comment in the earlier session, we held consultative workshops with young people.  Over 70 people were facilitated by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  The full report on the consultation is contained in appendix B to the report.  The president attended the consultation and can give direct evidence as to the benefits of engaging with young people aged from 13 to 17 years.  The view at the time was that was hugely beneficial and added enormously to the insight that we, as older people, would not have had.</p> <p>  As with all Law Reform Commission reports, the report is heavily influenced by comparative analysis.  We always look to other jurisdictions.  In the previous session Dr. Shannon referenced Australia quite a number of times.  We were quite strongly influenced by developments in criminal law in jurisdictions in Great Britain.  We were also heavily influenced regarding the digital safety commissioner by developments in Australia.</p> <p>  We are very happy that our work has been included in the deliberations of the committee.  We are also aware that the Departments of Justice and Equality and Communications, Climate Action and Environment are reviewing the report with a view to bringing forward proposals.  We are aware of Private Members' initiatives in this area over the past year.</p> <p>  Regarding the core subject matter of the report, it would be wrong not to acknowledge that there are positive and negative aspects to the digital revolution.  We have all become accustomed to smart phones as a way of staying in touch with family and friends anywhere in the world.  We plan and book holidays using these devices.  We can participate in civic society, regardless of national boundaries, and in public discourse.  As people who are intimately engaged in the processes of public discourse, committee members would be more aware of this than most.  We have to see this as a major boost to freedom of expression.  It magnifies voices and multiplies information.</p> <p>  There are, of course, negative aspects.  As we all know, there can be a tendency for some online and digital users to engage in communications which cause significant harm to others by, for example, posting intimate images without consent or gross breaches of the right to privacy.  In this regard, we conceive of privacy as embodying concepts like personal safety, the right to a good reputation and the right to human dignity.  We are not in any sense denying that these are real hazards, with the indisputable benefits to freedom of expression which come from the digital revolution.</p> <p>  We identified different types of harmful communications, which formed the core focus of our work.  Victim shaming, or what is more loosely referred to as revenge porn, that is, posting intimate material without consent which is intended to cause harm and violate privacy, was one form of harmful communication we identified.  We also looked at posting intimidating and threatening online messages directed at private persons and public figures, voyeurism, or what is loosely referred to as upskirting and downblousing, and intimate images taken without consent and posted online.  We focused on online and digital harassment and stalking, mirroring, to some extent, pre-digital versions of these harmful behaviours dealt with in legislation from 1997. </p> <p>  That is why we propose that the pre-digital laws be consolidated into a single piece of legislation covering digital and non-digital harmful communications.  I will explain in more detail what we did in respect of those offences later.  Other, arguably less harmful but still hurtful types of bullying behaviour, such as sending unpleasant messages, unfriending, freezing out from groups, etc. were also considered and these would bear largely upon the civil, not necessarily judicial, remedies we considered.</p> <p>  The guiding principles we used in addressing harmful communications were to focus on the wider context in which these issues occurred.  We were very mindful of the importance of education, as was stressed by Dr. Shannon in the earlier session.  We were very influenced by that.  We make no exaggerated claims for the value of law in this area because, clearly, there are significant issues which are, in a sense, beyond the reach of law and require perhaps more preventative approaches.</p> <p>  We were also very mindful of the need for balance and proportionality in the approach we take.  That comes from a profound respect for freedom of expression, but also for the other rights which can be violated by the abuse of freedom of expression which I set out earlier.  Thus, we have stressed education, emphasising user empowerment and safe and positive digital citizenship as being of primary importance.  </p> <p>  We have considered and proposed a system of statutory oversight in the form of a digital safety commissioner, with a range of remedies open to that office and a strong focus on the need for a statutory code of practice.</p><p>When it comes to criminal law, we have made proposals for certain offences but only with regard to the most serious and harmful communications.  It is critically important to stress that we are not starting from the perspective that criminal law is the major weapon against or solution to the harm addressed in this report.  It is decidedly not the first port of call.  It is in fact the third port of call having already looked at the other mechanisms available to deal with these issues.</p><p> On the topic of education and oversight, we propose the establishment of an office of digital safety commissioner, like those already in existence in Australia and New Zealand.  If legislated for, this office will promote digital safety and will also have an important educational role in promoting positive digital citizenship among children and young people.  We state very explicitly in the report that the digital safety commissioner should work with the Office of the Ombudsman for Children and liaise with all education partners to develop guidance material for young people in schools, including guidance on encouraging mediation and restorative processes, especially for issues for which the criminal law is not suitable.  I will return to this point shortly.</p><p> On the issue of a code of practice on take-down procedure, what we have proposed in the draft Bill and in our report is that the digital safety commissioner should publish a statutory code of practice on digital safety, setting out nationally agreed standards on the details of an efficient take-down procedure.  In the previous session Dr. Shannon emphasised timelines and time limits for this.  We have not presumed to prescribe what the absolute limit on timelines might be, but this would certainly form part of the task of the digital safety commissioner in developing a code of practice.  We need to bear in mind that this code of practice would not be some kind of voluntary code but that it would have a statutory underpinning.  The type of procedure that we envisage for a take-down is that individuals who feel aggrieved by a harmful communication would initially apply directly to social media sites themselves.  This would encourage social media hosts to have robust mechanisms for taking down harmful communications to avoid engagement with the more formal process.  If the site did not comply with such a request, and in so doing did not comply with the code of practice, the individual could appeal to the digital safety commissioner who could then direct that site to comply.  The digital safety commissioner would be empowered statutorily to enforce the code.  If the site did not comply with such a direction from the digital safety commissioner, the latter could then apply to the Circuit Court for a court order.</p><p> This proposal, then, is not without teeth.  It is an example of nudge theory, something that has been receiving quite a bit of publicity since Mr. Richard H. Thaler was awarded the Nobel Prize last week.  It is designed to encourage better behaviour on the part of those who use social media but also on the part of those responsible for providing social media services.  It is, in a sense, the suggestion of a regulatory framework just like the many regulatory frameworks already in existence for these kinds of large companies, which are well accustomed to operating in a regulated environment and are engaged with sophisticated understandings of corporate social responsibility.</p><p> Returning to criminal law, and this again is something that I deliberately de-emphasised in the opening statement, the serious harmful communications that we feel should be subject to criminal sanction are decidedly serious and harmful communications.  We talk about two new criminal offences here, one being intentional victim shaming or what is colloquially referred to as "revenge porn", which I can explain in greater detail if it would be any assistance, and two, the voyeuristic offence of what is colloquially referred to as "upskirting" and "down-blousing".  When it comes to existing harassment offences, we have made it explicit that these cover online activity such as posting fake social media profiles.  We have proposed a separate offence of stalking, which we have defined as an aggravated form of harassment.  We also propose to reform the existing offence of sending threatening and intimidating messages so as to capture the most serious types of online intimidation.  These are essentially amendments to post office legislation that is now quite dated.  The thinking behind our proposals on criminal offences is to deter this kind of behaviour but also to name these explicitly as offences.  This is on the basis of evidence from other jurisdictions that naming these offences can increase the reporting.  It is also important to the victims of these offences that the offences be named for what they are.  We are essentially proposing the re-enactment of harassment legislation from 1997 with additional elements and two new additional offences.  It is more complicated than that, of course, so Commissioner Byrne, our other colleagues from the Law Reform Commission and I are very happy to answer any questions that the committee may have.</p></speech>

Several years ago, I think it must have been shortly after the publication of the Law Reform Commission's report in 2016, I did a release myself in the area of revenge porn.  The Garda does not seem to be very well protected in this area, though protected is probably the wrong word, and it does not have the tools it needs to prosecute people.  This is a very serious crime and one that is not very easy to discuss in this kind of environment.  I welcome and support the findings of the Law Reform Commission's report in this area.</p> <p>  It is great that the code of practice mentioned by Professor O'Connell is not a voluntary one.  Professor Shannon referred to voluntary codes in the earlier session.  They are obviously similar to self-regulation and real difficulties arise from this.  What do people do in these circumstances under the current law?  I would like to be clear on that.  Finally, has the Commission had any interaction with the Minister for Justice and Equality or with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs on the proposal for an office of digital safety commissioner?  This is an absolute no-brainer to me and I would like to think that very positive signals would come from both of those Departments in this regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.72" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Donncha O'Connell" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017101800002#M00400"><p>The Senator is correct is commenting that this is a difficult area for the Garda.  It is also a very difficult area for an individual to report because of the nature of the offence and the fact the perpetrator focuses on shaming someone.  This creates a difficulty.  We propose in section 4 of the Bill what we define as actual or threatened distribution or publication which intentionally or recklessly seriously interferes with the peace and privacy and causes alarm, distress or harm, and would be viewed as such by a reasonable person. There is a threshold to be crossed then.  We do say, however, that this can be a once-off offence and does not have to be persistent, as would be the norm with harassment-type offences, while acknowledging that it can be more than a once-off.  When it comes to punishment, we propose a class A fine, 12 months' imprisonment on summary prosecution or both, or an unlimited fine, up to seven years' imprisonment for a prosecution on indictment or both.  That provision of the Bill includes quite a strong legislative underpinning for anyone investigating such an allegation and thinking of bringing a prosecution.  This is not in any way to underestimate or understate the contextual difficulties around a crime of that nature.  It is, however, very important that we name it as a crime.  This is what we propose here and this has been publicly welcomed by some victims of that offence who have themselves gone public.</p><p>On the code and what people do now, people have civil remedies available to them.  In a sense, what we are proposing would supplement what is there already.  If somebody is defamed in social media, he or she is not prevented from suing for that.  We have engaged with the companies, and they spoke at the April 2015 event we had.  The Chairman made the point in the previous session about the presence of these companies in significant terms in this jurisdiction, possibly providing an advantage to greater engagement with them.  As regards the interaction with the Minister, the previous Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, was quite keen on this and the Departments of the Ministers, Deputies Denis Naughten and Charlie Flanagan, are working on this as we speak.  I do not know whether there has been formal contact.</p></speech>

We hope the recommendations are implemented, and we would be delighted and pleased if they were.  We will not pursue them unless an interest is shown by the particular agency or Department, but we are very keen to co-operate immediately.  I do not know whether there has been a formal discussion with us as yet, but if the Government and the Oireachtas decide to proceed, there is no doubt we will be delighted to co-operate of course.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.75" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Raymond Byrne" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017101800002#N00300"><p>It is so important that, as Professor O'Connell has said, those offences are named.  One of the real difficulties for the Garda at the moment is that it operates under the 1997 Act, which is fine in so far as direct harassment is concerned, but social media indirect victim shaming is not covered by the legislation, so this gap filling is extremely important.  Without this it is not possible to pursue this particular form of online harassment.  This is where the commission identified a very serious gap in the legislation, which is completely understandable when we consider the 1997 legislation was far-reaching in its time but it is now 20 years on.  That is one aspect of the gap filling required.  The other aspect is what people do now.  Yes, there are civil remedies but we know it is far beyond most people's reach to go to the High Court and get any kind of remedy.  This is why it is so important to have codes of practice that are statutorily underpinned.</p></speech>

We were launching a children's mental health document, and after a lot of online abuse, children will be in need of it.  An observation is we were very innocent when we started off with mobile phones and then Bebo came along.  Does anyone remember Bebo?  Then there was an explosion of communication possibilities.  I give out about it because people have ways to get us do stuff for them.  For our children perhaps it is part of their day, but for me it is a bit overwhelming at times because every and each way we turn, social media has us and we are sucked into it and we have to do it.</p><p>The digital safety commission is a must do and we must deal with all of these different ways of communication and potential harm for our children.  I want to ask about harmful material, stalking and grooming.  If the perpetrator is a child according to law, and this varies in different Departments, will the full wrath of the law come down on that child?  Will that record follow him or her in perpetuity and affect his or her job and career possibilities?  Will it have a long-term impact or will children have the sealed records that are <i>de rigueur</i>in other areas?</p><p>We spoke about the statutory system in place in Australia.  Does the child need his or her adult guardian to follow this through?  This is a big stumbling block because many children will not report it if they must tell their parents or guardian what they have been doing online, although they are feeling guilty about it and know inside somehow it is really wrong.  The stumbling block is whether they want to own up to their parents that something is going on.  They will be thinking about how much trouble they will get into and that their pocket money will be gone.  There are also other serious measures, such as being told they must stay at home and not go out.  This is important to children.  It might not be important to us because we have the ability to come and go.  Must an adult start the process which the witnesses envisage might be useful here?</p><p>Upskirting was mentioned and there was a recent case in England.  What law did it come under?  A woman successfully prosecuted and got a mobile phone taken off a man.  These were young 20 year old adults and it happened at a festival in England.  She was on the radio about two months ago discussing it.  I cannot remember what aspects of that law were involved.  Do we have such a law here?  Perhaps the witnesses do not know but I ask them to think about it.</p><p>Gambling is a big issue and children are targeted online.  Is this considered in the report?  It is probably a bit off the mark, but through games children's brains are being fed with the thrill of the chase and the gamble.</p></speech>

With regard to child offenders, we recommend the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, is obtained for anyone under the age of 17 before a prosecution can be taken.  We have not classified these offences as sexual offences, so the normal implications of conviction for sexual offence would not apply, such as being on the register of sex offenders.  This is not uncontroversial, but we took the view as a commission that it was the more appropriate and proportionate thing to do regarding what we are dealing with here.</p> <p>  We have distinguished the issue of sexting, which is a colloquial term used to describe some of the mobile phone interactions or Instagram interactions of younger people, from the voyeuristic offence of upskirting, which is a non-consensual offence.  We see it as more appropriate for the guidance material to be developed by the digital safety commission in consultation with the Office of the Ombudsman for Children.  We are looking at these issues in a way that is less brutal than the criminal law-driven way that might be suggested for other types of situations.  I am not aware of the case the Senator mentioned, but Mr. Byrne might be aware of it.</p> <p>  I will pass the issues of child reporting, the Australian example and gambling to Mr. Byrne.</p></speech>

In our proposals we certainly thought an upskirting offence should be legislated for here, but not as a sexual offence, as Professor O'Connell mentioned.  We certainly think there is a gap in the law here and this needs to be clarified.</p> <p>  In terms of reporting generally, the ordinary rules about people under age making a report on the criminal law side are that they must be accompanied by somebody to the station, but in general terms education is very important, and this came out of all the consultations we had with a number of groups, including the young children to whom we reported.  Reform of the criminal law is important and significant, but so is educating parents interacting with teenagers on having to take a responsible attitude, but without stating a child is grounded from social media, which can be worse than being grounded.</p><p>Another part of the report we really want to emphasise is the idea of taking away the mobile phone and how we, as parents, need to educate ourselves about our responsible attitude.</p><p> Our focus on gambling was on a particular group of harmful communications but I am aware that the gambling control Bill which has been around as a draft Bill for a number of years deals with the question of vulnerable adults and children.  The enactment of that legislation would be very welcome.</p></speech>

The intention element is not there as would exist for the revenge porn offence.  The way in which the offence is drafted is a serious matter.</p></speech>

I assume when we speak about the law that there would be different penalties for different levels of offence.  Some offences will be dire, and others will be less dire in nature, depending on involvement of children, peer pressure and the age groups concerned.  What happens in the school yard is taken online at different ages.  That is not belittling some of the more extreme offences but I am talking about general harassment.  I am trying to find the right word for it.  When peer pressure is involved with kids in the school yard and that is talked about online, we have to tease out to what degree that is acted on.  We are behind the curve in education.  This is very fluid and is happening quickly.  I am online, reading <i>internetsafety.ie</i>, about sextortion and all the latest things that are happening.  Once existing things are combatted, something new will appear, so we really have to provide education.</p><p>It is probably the role of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills to decide which bodies should provide education, when and where is best to provide it and what age group is best to target for this education.  I see some alarming statistics on it here.  Education is key.  If underage people or even adults see something coming in, such as a scam, they should be educated enough to be able to see the wood from the trees and determine that it does not add up, as opposed to falling into the trap.  Many of these things would be bait for people.  We should have an educational side along with the legal element.  If one can educate children when they are young and teach them how to behave as they would in the school yard, that might go a long way too.</p></speech>

He was talking about education at creche level with regard to digital safety, which I thought was very valuable.  On the penalties for offences that we have set out, we have recommended that the normal diversion programmes available to children in the criminal process would be available to those under 17 accused of offences that are specified in our report.  The penalties we have suggested for each of the offences on summary or on prosecution following indictment are maximum penalties.  The option of a fine also exists.  I could go through them individually but it will not add hugely to this.  There can be class A fines or up to 12 months imprisonment on summary indictment and unlimited fines or up to seven years when there is a trial on indictment.  There is judicial discretion in the giving of a sentence.  On the offence of stalking, which we would define as an aggravated form of harassment, if it is accepted as a matter of evidence that such an offence has taken place, that will be relevant to the sentencing in that case.  It is not merely harassment but an aggravated form of harassment using cyber methods or such and that would be reflected in the exercise of judicial discretion in the giving of a sentence in that area.  With regard to children, we support, as we would with regard to all criminal matters, the use of diversion programmes that exist and other restorative practices where they can be effective.</p></speech>

Professor O'Connell spoke about judicial discretion on sentencing.  I am concerned about the area of upskirting, downblousing and revenge porn, and the degree to which a victim's history may be taken into account when it comes to sentencing.  We all know the challenges and difficulties related to rape and sentencing and the often very traumatic process that a victim is subjected to with regard to his or her sexual history.  Has Professor O'Connell examined when, for example, an intimate image is posted online with or without consent, whether revenge porn or downblousing, the degree to which a person's Instagram or Facebook page and photographs that the person has posted could be used against an individual?  It might be said that the person did not suffer that much harm and is used to putting up photos of that nature.  Has Professor O'Connell explored how we deal with this?  Do we need to put a provision in the law to protect victims and allow them to feel safe coming forward to report these crimes and follow through on prosecution?  The sentencing for rape is not at a sufficient level and the degree to which the victim is further humiliated and shamed through the courts process is a matter which leaves much to be desired.  I fear that unless we address this legislatively to deal with that, we will end up in a similar scenario with these crimes, and we will require guidance from the witnesses about that.</p></speech>

A reason why we did not examine that is that we decided not to describe these as sexual offences as such.  They are no doubt abuse of power offences and, in that respect, we were very conscious that clear comparisons could be made but the issue of the provision that is still in the rape legislation for cross-examination of history does not relate to these particular offences.  They are based on the harassment and stalking offences that are already in place.  We have specifically said that that does not arise in the context of these prosecutions because the offence relates to whether it has actually impinged on and interfered with a person's privacy.</p></speech>

In a sexual offence case, if there is a question in the evidence of previous history, that may be admitted with regard to the crime itself but once the crime has been committed and there has been a conviction, I do not think that the history of the victim would be admissible or relevant to sentencing.  The same should apply to this type of offence, once the offence has been proven and there is a conviction.  The Deputy makes a point that there might be a history of one person publishing intimate photographs of himself or herself on the Internet.  That might be relevant in relation to whether the offence had been committed, but once the offence has been committed, the sentencing process is based on the harm that has been done.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.91" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Justice John Quirke" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017101800002#P00400"><p>As I understand it the history of the victim may be relevant and admissible with respect to the offence itself, or whether the offence was committed.  Once there is a conviction, I cannot see the relevance of the victim's previous sexual history in the sentencing of an accused person being convicted of rape or sexual assault.  I do not know of any judges who would admit that.  I have certainly heard a number of rape cases and other cases of that kind but I would not dream of listening to sexual history as a relevant factor in sentencing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.92" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1336" speakername="Lisa Chambers" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017101800002#P00500"><p>I agree wholeheartedly and hope that is the case across the board.  I am not suggesting for one moment that the witness would ever engage in such conduct and I do not for a moment believe he did.  The point I am trying to make is we have seen it happen in separate events.  The history and conduct of an individual has been taken into account in rape cases.  I am merely making the suggestion that we could have a similar position here.  For example, we know it is predominantly women who are the subject of this particular crime.  If a woman has images on her Instagram where she is wearing a low-cut top and she is then "down-shirted" or "down-bloused" - whatever term one wants to use - the suggestion could be made that no harm has come to that person because she has posted similar images online.  My question is whether it is an absolute crime.  Is it enough to prove that a photograph was taken without consent and posted, where it is considered an intimate photograph?  Who decides whether the photograph is intimate?  Does it continue to be intimate if the victim posts similar photographs?  Does one have to justify or explain previous actions?</p> <p>  I appreciate that once a crime is committed, it is committed, but there are major variances in sentencing because of the discretion that exists.  The public will ask these questions and I am posing them as a devil's advocate.  What informs the sentencing if there is a level of discretion?  I could hear what I would consider an attack on a victim in terms of previous history and judges are people too.  We are all influenced by what we see and hear and the suggestion is that all of this, all of the time, can be left at the door and separated.  If one is subjected to hearing that information one cannot but in some ways be influenced, no matter how hard one tries not to be.</p></speech>

That does not mean consent can be questioned and it is more about whether it seriously interferes with privacy, peace, alarm or distress, etc.  It is a very interesting point.  I do not think it arises in the sentencing matter but the Deputy's point relates to that type of evidence, if it arose, having an influence.</p></speech>

It is difficult to know what is admissible in those circumstances and in asking whether the offence has really interfered with a person's privacy.  It will take a number of cases to decide on that.  It is a very well-made point.</p></speech>

I asked earlier about the Budapest and Lanzarote conventions.  We have signed up to them but we have not brought them through the Oireachtas.  Has that influenced this morning's presentation or what is the take of the witnesses on that?  I asked the previous two speakers the same question.</p></speech>

I will draw attention to another project in the fourth programme of law reform, now that the Deputy has asked the question.  It is project No. 10, which is on the domestic implementation of international law more generally.  In the next year we are going to publish a discussion paper on that, which is quite a new prospect for the commission.  It has a definitive inventory of all our international obligations, which is really useful.  It will look at models for the effective implementation of different types of international instruments.  This is a topic close to my and Mr. Burke's heart.  When the discussion document is out there, it would be wonderful if people engaged directly in the legislative process.  We are aware it will be large document considering exactly the different ways in which one can give effect to international instruments.</p> <p>  As the committee knows from Dr. Shannon's reply this morning, ratification of these instruments is dependent on us completing the coming into effect of two items of criminal legislation that are imminent.  He is confident that will take place.  We always look to the State's ratified international obligations when we are doing our reports.  Perhaps more importantly, we look at the domestic law of other comparable jurisdictions to draw on their experiences to inform what we do.  We always take an international or comparative approach, mindful of the need for adjustment to the peculiarities of this jurisdiction, with which we are more familiar.</p></speech>

It was referred to earlier.  Will he tell us a little about that or how the engagement went?  I gather it was over two days.  They are the key main stakeholders.  How did Mr. Justice Quirke find the process of listening to young people?</p></speech>

I was very impressed.  I know about technology now but they knew more at that stage about the technology involved.  Their level of responsibility was remarkable.  They varied in age from approximately 11 or 12 to 17 years.  I was taught much, not just about technology but also about the nature of abuse.  Their solutions seemed to be by far the most sensible we came across.  They were extremely careful about the use of technology.  It was a very helpful and interesting experience for me and everybody who attended.</p> <p>  I was on the side of this and I was not able to participate.  I was learning new terms like "catfishing", which is apparently the stealing of another person's identity.  I am sure the committee knows that but I did not.  I learned other things as well.  I also learn from my grandchildren, I am afraid, who tell me how to use the technology.  The children explained how it is being abused by children and adults in the interaction with children.  That experience made us understand that criminal law was not necessarily the only route.  It was very helpful with the idea of the digital safety commissioner and all the powers needed for that commissioner.  I do not know if that is very helpful.  I am not going into any detail but I would have shortly afterwards recalled instances where they were able to explain issues I would never have thought about that could happen.  The stealing of an identity is one example.  They explained how one school group might be able to interact with another and cause damage of a kind that we had not come across before.</p><p>Mr. Byrne may be able to give better detail in relation to some of the activities that they explained.  I cannot immediately recall them.  All I can say is that I was very impressed by them, mainly by how responsible they all were.  They wanted to draw our attention to the potential abuse of their contemporaries that they did not want to happen.</p></speech>

That was incredibly important for a number of reasons.  The structure of the workshops was very well facilitated for us.  The experience of the Department in that regard was most helpful.</p> <p>  It also allows me to say that Comhairle na n&Oacute;g played a huge part in the selection process so we had that great strength in the way in which we approached those two sessions.  The group was representative from the entire State.  They all came to the Ashling Hotel in Dublin and they were facilitated very strongly.  The backing we had from the Department was incredibly important in that regard.  The Department was also very helpful around the child protection issues that would have been necessary to look at.  A child psychologist was available on both of the days to ensure, if any issue arose that required assistance and intervention, that help was available.  The assistance we got from the Department was invaluable.</p> <p>  The process itself was very well done through having people around the table.  As Mr. Justice Quirke has said we were really onlookers.  We went around observing the discussions at the different tables and the Post-it notes that were going up on screen.  As Professor O'Connell has said, out of that we had a great report written by Sandra Roe on the two day sessions.  This report indicated, especially from the point of view of young people, that they were extremely concerned to ensure there was an effective take-down process in place.  That was one of the reasons we emphasised the need for a statutory arrangement in which take-down procedures could be done in a very effective and efficient way without going to court.  This aspect  came out very strongly from the sessions we had on the two days.</p></speech>

The report is done but maybe we should look at doing it on an annual basis.  Technology and digitisation is changing so quickly that this information needs to be out there, for young people, for their parents and for educators.  I thank the witnesses.</p></speech>

We hope to have it completed by the end of the first quarter of next year, but as far as we are concerned it is urgent for reasons of that kind.  We have had round table discussions with the Judiciary, with the professions and with the media especially.  The media were very helpful again and were very responsive as to their view of the harm it can cause, and to the fact that it does interfere with the administration of justice.  It is capable of doing so-----</p></speech>

I want this to be a committee at which everybody feels they can say what they wish to say without feeling any sense of nervousness or other feelings to witnesses or otherwise.  It is quite reasonable for members of this committee to leave the room for a variety of reasons.  It has already been indicated in private session that a couple of members must speak in the D&aacute;il presently and there is no doubt certain members will have to speak in the Seanad on occasion.  People must leave the room for a variety of reasons.  The nature of our business in politics ensures that there is a very busy environment in Leinster House.  The message must go out that this is a very important committee that has a very high attendance rate by members and it does happen, on occasion, that people need to leave for a variety of reasons.  I just wanted to put that on the record.  </p> <p>  If members have concerns, it is better to indicate.  If a member has a concern about something another member has said please indicate and I will come to that person at the appropriate time.  I do not want members interrupted, which is really important to note.  Everybody has a certain amount of time with the witnesses.  It is very important that we respect that space for the individual member within the confines of the rules of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  When somebody has the floor I want everybody to respect that in so far as is possible.  If members have concerns I would appreciate if they could be raised in the committee.  If there is an issue that they do not wish to raise in the committee, publicly, I can be approached at any time for a chat if there is something a member wants to discuss.  </p> <p>  On the matter of witnesses who present here, witnesses need to be respected.  They are professional individuals.  They are well used to taking strident cross-examination and questions in circumstances like this one.  I have no difficulty with witnesses being asked questions.  It is difficult to control the time and there is an issue with regard to the amount of time for members.  We have reached agreement in terms of how we will conduct ourselves timewise.  Again, if people have issues in that regard please highlight them to me.  I am doing my best as Chair to be fair to everybody and that is all I can do.  </p> <p>  With regard to a perceived bias in terms of this committee, concerns have been raised again, mainly outside of this room, regarding the witness schedule.  The committee itself decided who should attend.  I, as Chair, do not choose which witnesses come before this committee.  It continues to be the case that any member who believes that any other person or institution should be represented at this committee should make that known to me.  Travel by an individual is justified in terms of the method that we agreed at the outset of this committee.  Any concerns about specific witnesses should be raised ideally with me and not with the media so that I can be put on notice of any issues that members have.  I refer in particular to the Centre for Reproductive Rights where issues have been expressed about fundraising and issues in the media.  Again, I am seeking to address this matter and will come back to the committee. </p> <p>  At the outset I just wanted to be really clear on a few issues.  Our witnesses are present and some of them have travelled.  We are very grateful to them for their attendance.  I want to move on in that regard, subject to Deputy Mattie McGrath making a comment.  I want to give him an opportunity to address an issue that he has raised, and wants to raise in public, that follows on from last week.  The Deputy has the floor.</p></speech>

It was published in a respected peer reviewed medical journal entitled <i>Prenatal Diagnosis</i>.  If Deputy Buttimer and his consultants had more carefully reviewed this study they would have noted that the authors recruited the majority of participants from a pre-existing study database, the Hereditary Basis of Neural Tube Defects study conducted at Duke University Medical Center and only approximately one third of the participants originated from social media.  Objective reporting on the study would recognise that the authors reported a possible bias based on the recruitment source; they recognised that there was a difference in severity of symptoms in the two groups, and recognising this potential influence on results, made source of referral a covariate in the analysis to limit the source impact.</p><p>Cope et al. is a comparative study of women and their outcomes after terminating or carrying a child with anencephaly to term.  It is not, as some might believe after listening to Senator Buttimer and Professor Fergal Malone, simply a report from women recruited from social media who carried a child to term with anencephaly.  This study offers important insights into outcomes for women after termination of pregnancy following a diagnosis of anencephaly in contrast with outcomes where the pregnancy was continued.  To dismiss this study is scientifically unreasonable but it might be understandable if there were significant data to suggest that termination of the life of an infant with anencephaly had no impact on mothers or improved the medical health of mothers later in life.  The fact is there is no such study and all we are left with is the unsupported opinions of those who are committed to the expansion of abortion services.  It is dismaying to see anyone being dismissive of research that identifies poor mental health outcomes for women related to abortion after a diagnosis of anencephaly simply because they do not suit a pro-abortion narrative.</p></speech>

I want to reiterate the fact that it causes severe interference.  If RTE or other broadcasters try to show clips, devices really impair the quality of the material.  I ask everyone to please co-operate on that matter.</p><p>It is very warm in this committee room of which our guests in the Gallery will be aware.  I have complained about the heat and I have been told that the OPW has been called to sort out the issue.  We will have to arrange to change rooms if this situation continues because we will probably meet here for six or seven hours.  It is very difficult to concentrate on proceedings when one is as warm as we are at the moment.</p><p>I would like to extend, on behalf of the committee, a warm welcome to our witnesses - warm being the operative word - for this afternoon's meeting.  I welcome Professor Sabaratnam Arulkumaran, President-Elect of the International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecology and author of the report on the death of Savita Hallappanvar.  I also welcome Dr. Peter Boylan, Chair, Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and Dr. Meabh N&iacute; Bhuinneain, obstetrician and gynaecologist, Mayo University Hospital, Castlebar, County Mayo.  I do not know if she is a Mayo woman but she is in the right county.  All of the witnesses are very welcome to this afternoon's meeting.  </p><p>Before we commence formal proceedings, and at the risk of boring some members, I must go through the formalities.  I wish to advise the witnesses about privilege.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.

A confidential inquiry into maternal deaths in Ireland indicates nearly half are due to indirect deaths, not related to pregnancy but due to cardiac and psychiatric conditions and so forth.  This is of some relevance to the issue under discussion.  The detailed report on the confidential inquiries is included and referenced in my statement.<br/><br/>I greatly appreciate the first report and recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on the eighth amendment of the Constitution, published on 29 June 2017.  I commend the Citizens' Assembly on its work.  The report is an impressive achievement by people who are not health care specialists or experts, but spent five weekends considering the issues.  The members of the Citizens' Assembly voted on their recommendations for access to abortion for certain medical and other conditions.  Members are, of course, familiar with the results of the ballots and these can be viewed in the report.<br/><br/>I would like members to consider the opposite side of the coin and if the same questions were asked such as: &quot;Would you send the women who procured abortion for these reasons to prison?&quot;  A research project in Brazil led by the eminent obstetrician and gynaecologist, Professor Anibal Faundes, surveyed 1,660 civil servants and 874 medical students.  They were asked two different questions: first, under what circumstances should abortion be allowed under law; and, second, if they agreed that women who had abortions outside the law should be imprisoned.  The research concluded that Brazilians have different views on when abortion should be legal, but most do not agree with imprisoning women for abortion.  Hence I urge parliamentarians, the newspapers and the public to take that into consideration and ask the question as to whether they would wish to imprison women who procure abortion.  A law that allows abortion for only certain minimum grounds mandates the imprisonment of women who have abortions under all other grounds.  I think members would find that this is not what the public wants, neither in law nor in practice.<br/><br/>I shall now give my views on the specific health issues that were raised in the Citizens' Assembly report and other health issues that were not raised but are of relevance to the eighth amendment of the Constitution.  First, abortion is life saving in certain health conditions, for example, a mother with chorioamnionitis and severe sepsis, pre-existing severe heart disease, and poor mental health and a threat to commit suicide.  There are examples of such incidents from the Republic of Ireland.  Deaths from these conditions occur due to the difficulty in assessing that the seriousness of the condition meets the legal criteria of &quot;real and substantial risk&quot; that can only be averted by ending the pregnancy, and the fear of legal punishment that prevents a doctor from taking a firm and early decision.<br/><br/>Abortion in certain health conditions will avoid deterioration of health, for example, cardiac, renal, and neurological conditions.  We could formulate a list of conditions but we will not be able to cover all the different conditions and combinations of conditions that we encounter as clinicians.  Each mother needs to be individually assessed as to whether the condition is serious enough to terminate a pregnancy.  Such lists are used in certain countries where restrictive abortion laws operate.  However, mothers slip through the net and end up with worse organ damage.  A list of the medical conditions that are considered serious enough to terminate a pregnancy in Peru include hyperemesis gravidarum refractory to treatment with severe hepatic and-or renal impairment; malignant neoplasm requiring surgical treatment, radiotherapy and-or chemotherapy; functional class III or IV cardiac failure; severe chronic arterial hypertension and evidence of organ damage; systemic lupus erythematosus with severe renal damage refractory to treatment; advanced diabetes mellitus with vital organ damage; and severe respiratory failure demonstrated by certain parameters.  The Peruvian document is included in the references.<br/><br/>The errors due to conservative management of continuation of pregnancy compromise the mother's health with further deterioration of organ function that leads to shorter life span and at times death.  Such incidents are greater in the countries with restrictive abortion laws and are due to fears by the doctors of facing legal action.  An article showing an example of such deterioration involving a cardiac condition is included in the references.<br/><br/>Abortion under optimal conditions has less maternal mortality in developed countries compared with continuation of pregnancy.  It is 0.7 per 100,0000 with safe abortion care compared with ten per 100,0000 with continuation of pregnancy.  These are due to life threatening complications such as thromboembolism, hypertensive disease, postpartum haemorrhage, amniotic fluid embolism, and so forth as referenced in WHO document.<br/><br/>In the United Kingdom, approximately 190,000 abortions are carried out each year and there were only two recorded maternal deaths in the five years from 2012 to 2016.  The statistics of UK abortions are referenced.  The clear majority of abortions were done under clause C, that is, that &quot;the pregnancy has not exceeded its twenty-fourth week and that the continuance of the pregnancy would involve risks greater than if the pregnancy were terminated&quot; of injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman mainly on grounds of further deterioration of mental health.<br/><br/>Abortion is not associated with physical or mental health hazards to the mother and it has no impact on future pregnancies.  This has been made clear by the statement of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and is included in appendix 1.<br/><br/>Abortion should be permitted for lethal foetal malformation and severe congenital malformation that may have a major impact on life.  This is also the position of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologist and is included in appendix 2.<br/><br/>Safe abortion care should be consider as a public health and human rights issue.  Despite good contraceptive coverage, about 10% of women get pregnant and seek abortion.  In countries where abortion is legalised, the total abortion rates and maternal mortality have declined due to safe post-abortion care and post-abortion contraception.<br/><br/>Making abortion illegal has not stopped illegal abortion for centuries and in different countries.  It increases maternal mortality, and this is referenced.  About 4,800 women in Ireland have their abortions done in the United Kingdom.  These are the reduced figures as the numbers have reduced by 20% in the past year or so due to availability of medication by post for self-procuring abortion.  These have their own complications.<br/><br/>Abortion is a sexual and reproductive rights issue and the decision should be made by individual women after adequate information is given.  If abortion is not made legal, it will promote illegal abortion.  Those women with influence and financial resources will get it performed in a safe environment.  Those who are poor with less influence will resort to unsafe abortions.  This would be a social injustice.<br/><br/>I shall conclude with a few extracts from some of the world bodies.  The WHO states that &quot;abortions and the high maternal and child mortality rates constitute a serious public health problem in many countries&quot;.  It continues:</p><blockquote>Criminal laws penalising and restricting induced abortion are the paradigmatic examples of impermissible barriers to the realisation of women's right to health and must be eliminated.  These laws infringe women's dignity and autonomy by severely restricting decision-making by women in respect of their sexual and reproductive health.</blockquote><p>The report of the UN special rapporteur on the right to health to the UN General Assembly in 2011 stated:  &quot;Certain criminal laws effectively shift the burden of realising the right to health away from States onto pregnant women, punishing women for the lack of effective provision of health-care goods, services and education by the Government.&quot;<br/><br/>Ireland can and should provide first class sexual and reproductive health based on rights and public health perspectives.  There are minimal ill effects to health with a well-informed safe abortion.  This is from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, appendix 4.  Health advantages of avoiding or not having unwanted pregnancy need to be considered in addition to specific socio-cultural issues faced by the women.<br/><br/>The excellent maternal mortality rates in Ireland as number six in the world may become 20th or 40th in the world if legal access to abortion is denied to the 4,800 women who may not be able to go to the United Kingdom, but may procure illegal abortions.  At any cost, we must avoid having illegal abortion.  I thank the Chairman and members for considering my submission statement.</p></speech>

My opening statement is a summary of the longer position paper, which I also supplied to the committee.  The content of this statement is rooted in over four decades of the practising of obstetrics, caring for women in Ireland, London and the United States.</p><p>I hope to assist the committee in its deliberations.<br/><br/>I am currently chairman of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Ireland.  I was master of the National Maternity Hospital from 1991 to 1997 and clinical director from 2008-2014.  In 2012-13, I served as a member of the committee of independent experts which advised the Government on the implementation of the European Court of Human Rights judgment in respect of the X case.  The outcome was the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013.  In 2013 I was the independent expert witness for the coroner in the inquest into the death of Savita Halappanavar.  In 2014 I was an expert witness for the family in the case of Miss P <i>v</i>HSE in the High Court.<br/><br/>The Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Ireland has not been asked to provide a position paper.  However, in preparation for this hearing, I canvassed the opinions of members and have incorporated feedback received into this statement.<br/><br/>When put to the vote, the majority of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly voted against maintaining the <i>status quo</i>of the eighth amendment.  By a substantial majority the assembly voted in favour of legalising termination when a woman&rsquo;s life or health is at risk, when pregnancy follows rape, in cases of foetal abnormality, for socioeconomic reasons, or without restriction.<br/><br/>The assembly also made five ancillary recommendations, including those relating to improvements in sexual health and relationship education; access to early scanning and testing in pregnancy; counselling services; and that consideration should be given to who will fund and carry out terminations.  I support the ancillary recommendations without reservation.  On the fifth ancillary recommendation, it is my opinion that if termination is legalised it should be funded by the State, rather than delegated to private agencies.  All terminations should be medically supervised.  Medical personnel with a conscientious objection should be excused from involvement.<br/><br/>Article 40.3.3&deg; gives rise to significant difficulties for doctors practising in Ireland and has caused grave harm to women, including death.  The two outstanding examples of which I have direct personal experience are the death of Savita Halappanavar in 2012 and the case of Miss P in December 2014.  These are only two examples of cases where doctors in Ireland continue to be put in the inappropriate position of having to interpret the Constitution in the course of caring for sick women.  Medical personnel have no difficulties in obeying clear legislation and medical regulations, but we are not trained for the complexities of constitutional interpretation, nor should we reasonably be expected to be.<br/><br/>The eighth amendment has given rise to legal cases including the X case; the C case; A, B and C; D <i>v</i>Ireland; the Miss D case; A, B, and C <i>v</i>Ireland; Miss Y; Mellet <i>v</i>Ireland; and Whelan <i>v</i>Ireland.  These are the difficult and painful cases of Irish women and girls who have had to resort to stressful legal processes in the absence of comprehensive legislation on abortion.  If the eighth amendment is not repealed, this list will continue to grow and Ireland will continue to be censured by international bodies such as the European Court of Human Rights and the United Nations.<br/><br/>Currently, termination of pregnancy on grounds other than risk to the life of the woman is subject to criminal prosecution with the penalty of imprisonment for up to 14 years for women and their doctors, while simultaneously the 13th amendment provides constitutional protection for women to travel to obtain a termination outside the State and the 14th amendment protects the right to access information necessary to achieve this.  This is profoundly hypocritical.  Our Constitution enshrines a woman&rsquo;s right to commit an act which is a criminal offence in her own country, as long as it is committed outside the State.  By any yardstick this is a bizarre situation.  Testimony from numerous Irish women demonstrates the pain and stress they have undergone and continue to experience as a result of Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing failure to legislate comprehensively.  Members of the committee should not underestimate the anger felt by women who have to travel abroad for termination of pregnancy.<br/><br/>In my longer position paper, I have included an analysis of EU legislation.  Some 99% of women in the EU live in countries where their legislatures have grasped the nettle of legislating for termination of pregnancy.  No doubt many other EU countries have had difficulties with the subject, given their own religious, political and social histories, but their legislators have had the will to deal with the issue.  The Irish position remains deeply anomalous and obviously politically contentious.  In the matter of women&rsquo;s reproductive health, we remain outliers in a tiny minority in Europe.<br/><br/>Legal provision in the EU for termination of pregnancy is as follows.  In the case of risk to the life of the mother it is provided for in all countries except Malta.  In the case of risk to the health of the mother it is provided for in all countries except Malta and Ireland.  Termination for pregnancy as a consequence of rape is available in all countries except Malta and Ireland.  Termination in the case of foetal abnormality is available in all countries except Malta and Ireland.  Termination for medical reasons beyond 12 weeks, which varies by country, is available in all countries except Malta, Ireland and Poland to a varying degree.<br/><br/>I suggest that in 2017 the eighth amendment is unworkable.  When it was enacted 34 years ago, neither the worldwide web nor the abortion pill had been invented.  The committee heard evidence last week that the rate of women accessing the abortion pill from online service providers is increasing.  In reality, there are many services that facilitate people living here with a means of securing delivery to a designated address, which means they access items such as abortion pills.  While importation of these pills into Ireland is illegal, in another bizarre twist which mirrors the contortions of the Constitution, An Post offers customers a virtual UK address to use as their shipping address via the <i>addresspal.ie</i>service.<br/><br/>The genie is therefore out of the bottle in respect of online access to the abortion pill.  The grave concern that we, doctors, have as a consequence of this reality is the potential for harm caused by the use of unregulated medication by Irish women and girls.  I believe it is a matter of priority for the Oireachtas to address the reality of this situation.<br/><br/>The Citizens&rsquo; Assembly vote clearly recommends that the Oireachtas deal with the question of termination by legislation rather than through the Constitution.  I entirely concur with this conclusion, but I would add that legislation needs to be supported by regulation with regard to clinics and hospitals, and by the Medical Council and An Bord Altranais.<br/><br/>The question of viability needs to be addressed in the practical implementation of the recommendations of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly.  In Ireland, viability is currently considered to occur at approximately 24 weeks' gestation.  When obstetricians deliver a baby at the margins of viability, it is standard practice in this country to have a full neonatal team present at the birth to make an immediate assessment about viability and institute intensive care in every case where appropriate.  I cannot envisage a scenario whereby any doctor in Ireland would support any proposal that termination of pregnancy would be contemplated beyond 23 weeks.  I hope this is reassuring to the committee in respect of the uninformed discussion that regrettably occurs in respect of so-called &quot;late-term abortion&quot;.<br/><br/>Medical termination is performed by the administration of two medications.  Mifepristone blocks the action of progesterone, a hormone necessary to support pregnancy before the placenta develops and misoprostol makes the uterus contract.  Taken in combination two or three days apart, these tablets have a success rate greater than 90% if taken in the first trimester, preferably before ten weeks.  The first tablet is taken in a clinic or doctor's surgery and the second is taken at home.  The woman then experiences symptoms the same as a miscarriage.  The rate of side effects is extremely low.<br/><br/>For pregnancies of later gestation the procedure needs to take place in the hospital setting and will require more medication over a longer period of time.  If the Oireachtas legislates to allow termination, it is likely that later terminations will only be legalised for reasons other than socioeconomic or without restriction.  Surgical termination is where the contents of the uterus are removed either by suction or curettage following dilatation of the cervix.<br/><br/>The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 deals with the question of termination of pregnancy in circumstances where there is a threat to the life of the mother, including by suicide.  In the years in which it has been in force there have been approximately 25 terminations each year.  A major difficulty with this Act is that it is entirely the responsibility of doctors to determine how close to death, or how sick, a woman must be before legal termination can be performed.  The woman herself has no input into the decision, other than the option of refusing termination and placing her life at risk.  Doctors are subject to criminal prosecution if it can be established that they acted in bad faith in recommending a termination, even if the woman herself is happy with the decision.<br/><br/>Serious risk to the physical or mental health of the woman overlaps with threat to the life of the mother in so far as a risk to health may develop into a risk to life.  Under current legislation doctors have to make judgment calls as to when a risk to health becomes a risk to life.  If the judgment is wrong, either the mother will die or the doctor will be guilty of committing a criminal offence.<br/><br/>Risk to the health of the mother, either physical or mental, raises the important question of how different people deal with risk.  Some women, perhaps those expecting a much longed-for first baby, are willing to accept any risk in order to have a baby, while for others, perhaps those with small children at home, the deterioration in their health represents an unacceptable risk.  In these complex circumstances, a decision to terminate is best left to the woman and her doctor.<br/><br/>Pregnancy as a result of rape could be dealt with in a straightforward way by legislating for the legal prescription of the abortion pill which I have previously described.  Pregnancy tests are now so sensitive that they are positive just before a missed period and so the pills would be 99% successful if taken within the first eight weeks.</p><p>There is no diagnostic test to confirm rape, so I strongly recommend that a woman who has undergone the trauma of rape should not be forced to "prove" rape if she chooses to terminate a resulting pregnancy.  Women should be taken at their word - hardly a revolutionary concept.</p><p> Foetal abnormality likely to result in death either before or soon after birth of the baby was covered in detail in evidence last week from the masters of the Rotunda and the National Maternity Hospital.  They both outlined the clinical risks associated with current legislation.  For those who continue with the pregnancy, hospice care for the newborn with little or no chance of survival outside the womb has, in my experience, been a long-standing practice in this country in our hospitals.  It is simply incorrect to state that this care is not available.  I have considerable personal experience of couples that have had the misfortune of receiving diagnoses of foetal abnormalities.  In some cases, the parents have chosen to continue with the pregnancy and have been much comforted by having some time, however brief, with their baby.  In other cases, couples have been unable to continue with the pregnancy and have travelled abroad for termination.  However, what is not so well understood is that some couples experience a diagnosis of foetal abnormality on subsequent pregnancies - in other words, twice or more.  My experience has been that in the vast majority of these sad cases, on the second or subsequent occasions the couples choose termination, even if they had elected to continue with the pregnancy on the first occasion.  I also have experience of couples who, prior to screening for an abnormality, declare confidently that they would not seek termination in the event of a serious abnormality being diagnosed, only to change their minds when confronted with the reality of serious foetal abnormality.  I think most people in Ireland would sympathise with this.</p><p> Significant foetal abnormality unlikely to result in death before or shortly after birth raises more difficult questions.  In particular, how can we define "significant" abnormality?  Antenatal diagnosis, including ultrasound, genetic testing and magnetic resonance imaging, MRI, is now much more sophisticated than in the past.  When the eighth amendment was enacted, this level of diagnostic capability was not available.  The "significance" of the abnormality may depend on the extent of the disability and-or parents' ability to cope with the consequences.  In some conditions, particularly genetic ones, there is a wide spectrum of severity.  Parents, in consultation with their doctor, are the people best able to make decisions in their individual circumstances.  Diagnosis of genetic abnormalities can now be made before 12 weeks' gestation by a blood test, confirmed by either amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling.</p><p> I now come to termination for socio-economic reasons, or without restriction.  As I have said, throughout the European Union, 99% of women have access to termination of pregnancy without restriction up to ten weeks of pregnancy.  The remaining 1% are those women who live in either Ireland or Malta.  Of course, the majority of these women live in Ireland.  The method used in these cases is medication, which, as we know, is increasingly used by women in Ireland.  Of the citizens who voted for termination without restriction, 92% voted to limit gestation to 12 weeks.</p><p> It is well documented that in countries where abortion is banned, the rate of women dying remains high.  Approximately 70,000 women die each year from complications relating to unsafe abortion.  The committee heard testimony last week from Dr. Abigail Aiken that Irish women today are attempting self-abortion with potentially fatal consequences.  It is equally well documented that countries with liberal laws and easy access to contraception have lower rates of abortion than those with restrictive laws.  Women in Ireland with financial resources have access to termination of pregnancy, primarily in the UK.  However, women who are poor, in the care of the State or refugees, for example, do not have such access.  The thirteenth and fourteenth amendments to the Constitution are of no assistance to these women.  Without access to abortion in the UK, it is inevitable that Ireland would have an epidemic of illegal abortions and a massive increase in maternal mortality.  If Ireland were to enact legislation in line with EU consensus, including termination without restriction up to ten weeks, our law would be among the most conservative in Europe but would deal with the vast majority of circumstances in which women currently access services outside the State.  I believe that the forthcoming referendum on the eighth amendment should put a simple binary question to the electorate for or against repeal.  Legislation is the responsibility of the Oireachtas, not the people.  On repeal of the eighth amendment, Irish law on termination of pregnancy would continue to be governed by the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act and there would be no legislative vacuum pending further legislation.  In the meantime, women in Ireland will continue to access services in the UK or elsewhere in Europe, or access abortion pills illegally.</p></speech>

I am a practising consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist in Mayo University Hospital, Castlebar.  I am national speciality director for basic speciality postgraduate training in obstetrics and gynaecology in the institute.  I am dean of medical education at Mayo Medical Academy, Castlebar, a teaching academy of the School of Medicine, NUI Galway.  My clinical and teaching practice encompasses general obstetrics and gynaecology in the rural, non-tertiary setting in Ireland and an interest in global maternal-reproductive health and development.</p> <p>  As requested in the invitation to today's proceedings, the comments I will make refer to the issues that may arise if the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on the eighth amendment are adopted in part or in whole by Irish society.  My status is as a witness from a professional body whose membership replicates the diverse views of Irish society.  The institute does not have, nor should it purport to have, a common stance.  These comments are my opinions, except where otherwise noted, informed by the views of members who wished to contribute and wished to be clear about the status of the presenters today.  The complex and often conflicting elements that inform discussions on termination of pregnancy cannot be disaggregated, although they need to be studied as separate entities for the sequential programme of work that this committee is undertaking with diligence.  The work of this committee on the matter of the eighth amendment requires consideration of the guiding principles of ethics and human rights balanced by the right to national and individual self-determination.</p> <p>  Globally, maternal-reproductive health outcomes are one measure of effective civil society and government partnership.  In high-income settings, sub-national adverse outcomes are often concealed if the metrics used are the rare frequency of mortality over the common frequency of physical and psychological morbidity.  Globally, restrictive termination of pregnancy legislation contributes to maternal mortality and significant morbidity disproportionately in vulnerable women and girls, as supported by the witnesses from the World Health Organization, WHO, last week and today's witnesses.  While I speak as a health professional in active clinical practice, I wish to re-emphasise the inter-sectoral and social determinants on quality reproductive health outcome as included in the first two ancillary recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  Outside the scope of today's meeting, Members of the Oireachtas may consider their ability to influence the wider development of reproductive health care when deliberating over connected interventions that are delivered in the sectors of education, social welfare, youth development and finance.</p> <p>  If the introduction of a woman and girl centred safe termination service is the desire of the Irish electorate, it should be considered as just one element of a comprehensive reproductive health programme.  Engagement with women and girls and men and boys is required to develop formal and informal reproductive health education programmes, strengthen peer education as a delivery method for life skills learning and develop responsive, acceptable, affordable and locally accessible services while also facilitating the bypassing of local services, especially in rural areas, where anonymity and distance from home may be preferred.  Delays and barriers in access to safe reproductive health services, including termination of pregnancy, are influenced by distance, institutional reception, cost and bypass behaviours.</p> <p>  Health care workers in women's health in Ireland are guided by the legislative framework of the country, the professional standards of the registration authorities, their professional bodies and their personal value systems, whether conscious or unconscious.  Obstetricians and gynaecologists in Ireland to date, whether specialists or postgraduate trainees, have not been systematically studied to explore their position on the specific items on which the members of the Citizens' Assembly have been balloted.  The process to secure professional readiness to respond to possible legislative change has not yet been determined.  It is not known if the views of the women's health professionals will reflect the results of the Citizens' Assembly ballot.  Many clinical providers in Ireland in women's health have trained or completed some part of their training in other countries where termination of pregnancy is lawful.  Some of those providers would have already explored their personal ethical decision-making pathways.  For some, new legislation would involve the unlearning of restrictive practices in providing health care in Ireland at this time.  However, for the majority of clinical providers in this country, the possible enactment of lawful termination of pregnancy in Ireland may lead to individual professional moral distress for the first time.</p><p>Training needs also include cultural and diversity competence, unconscious bias awareness and the development of a national framework for ethical decision-making.  Care, support and sensitive leadership within the professions to deliver a new service following ethical decision-making is required.  Societal care, support and avoidance of alienation of health care workers during such transformative change is also required. </p><p> Regarding health systems, if in due course there is legislative change, the new system would be commissioned and provided.  Regulatory codes of practice would be revised and the professional bodies would review their competence standards, training curricula and assessment tools.  Quality assurance and suitable designation of centres that provide termination of pregnancy would be required.  Centres may include certain primary care services, family planning and sexual health clinics, infectious disease clinics, maternity units, and general hospitals with gynaecology and sexual assault treatment units.  The logistical challenges are those faced in the development of any new health service.  The process would involve a multi-dimensional approach, including biomedical health system strengthening, informal health system strengthening, and engagement with women and families in addition to the actual service development.</p><p> The skill set for the medical and safe surgical procedures in relation to termination of pregnancy already exist in obstetrics and gynaecology and women&rsquo;s health services in Ireland.  Some exist in the primary care setting as discussed by the ICGP witnesses last week and some exist in the early pregnancy care units and the tertiary maternal foetal medicine units throughout the country.  The training and service expansion needs are in the domains of professionalism, communication, inter-sectoral and inter-professional team work.</p><p> Conscientious objection would be facilitated for all cadres of health care staff.  This may result in logistical problems in the smaller rural centres, especially as there are already existing rota gaps, a mismatch in the urban-rural distribution of doctors, nurses and midwives, and a dependency on agency workers.  One third of obstetricians, gynaecologists and midwives in Ireland work in the smaller centres with significant dependence on international medical graduates to provide specialist obstetrics and gynaecology services.  There is the mixed challenge of providing continuity of services with unstable manpower in some disciplines and also overly stable workforce in other disciplines, where the introduction of change is less common.  Of importance for the smaller centres is the agreed tertiary pathways for complex care with agreed automatic acceptance protocols for maternal transfer, whether it is an emergency or elective case in nature.  Conscientious objection may also compound the problems of recruitment to the relevant disciplines, the attrition of trainees and retention of older providers in the specialties during a period of transformative change.  We do not yet know the unknowns in this subject area.</p><p> There has been significant initiation of organisational development in women and infants' programming in Ireland at national level in the past decade, sadly in many instances in response to unacceptable adverse outcome.  Women&rsquo;s advocacy and advisory contributions, national governance, regulatory standards, guideline development and implementation, hospital group structure, managed clinical networks, HSE clinical programmes, primary care teams, the frameworks for quality and the National Office of Clinical Audit have contributed to progressive system strengthening in both urban and rural women&rsquo;s health care provision.  All these developments provide a degree of organisational preparedness for the introduction of an expanded reproductive health service, if required to do so by the Irish people.  However, by international and OECD standards, the women&rsquo;s health service continues to be considerably under-resourced, fragmented and, in public opinion, as surveyed in the preparation of the first National Maternity Strategy 2016, is not yet considered to be woman and family centred or woman led.</p><p> My final comments reflect individual notes from institute members.  In other jurisdictions, initial restrictive termination law has evolved into more liberal practice.  Members have noted that overly prescriptive categorisation of foetal anomaly may prevent the evolution of matching options with health technology advancement.  They recommend that the detail is provided for in the initial legislation and subsequent regulation rather than by constitutional amendment.  Some gynaecologists have expressed potential personal moral distress at the dual challenge of providing extraordinary life-saving interventions for one foetus or infant at borderline viability while also providing foeticide for a potentially normal foetus at the same gestation.  Those members who wished to contribute gave general support for the provision of termination for fatal foetal anomalies.  Some members view the current law as excessively restrictive for crisis pregnancy.   I thanks the committee for the opportunity to present today. </p></speech>

I am substituting for my colleague, Senator Paul Gavan, who had to leave for a vote in the Seanad.</p> <p>  I am interested in the three witnesses' views on the issue of risk.  Is there such a thing as a gradation of risk such as serious risk and grave risk?  Those are the types of terminologies we are using and indeed that the Citizens' Assembly used, but I am not sure if they are legal terminologies or if they translate easily or at all into a medical setting.  If we are going to have a discussion about that, we should try to guide ourselves towards being helpful to the medical practitioners who ultimately are going to be at the business end of the results as it were.  Could the witnesses let us know their views in relation to risk?</p> <p>  Professor Arulkumaran said there is an immediate and urgent requirement for a clear statement of the legal context in which clinical professional judgment can be exercised in the best medical welfare and interests of patients.  Could Professor Arulkumaran explain to us why and how the team reached that conclusion and how that can best be implemented through legislation, regulations and guidelines? </p> <p>  My final question is to Dr. Boylan and Dr. N&iacute; Bhuinne&aacute;in.  It relates to the Irish system as it currently stands, its resources and personnel.  In the event of a repeal of the eighth amendment and the provision, in circumstances however limited or otherwise they may be, of wider availability of access for woman to abortion health care, do we have the personnel?  Do they need to be trained?  In particular, will there be a rural and an urban split?  There is clearly in operation somewhat of a postcode lottery with regard to access to some maternity services.  We have discussed this at the health committee.  Is it the witnesses' contention that we would need to see significant investment in capital or in people?  Do we have the buildings, and we just need to put the people in them?  Do we have the people and do they need additional training?  How close would we be to implementing a more liberalised regime?</p></speech>

There are problems in trying to categorise because risk is a continuous process.  What can start as a little bit of risk can be a medium risk or a high risk within minutes to hours.</p><p>Therefore, it is sometimes dangerous in acute conditions to classify risk.  A typical example is Savita Halappanavar.  In her case, sepsis became severe sepsis and then septic shock within hours, so it is difficult.  To take other conditions, for example, if the mother has renal disease or cardiac disease, that again can change very rapidly.  What we might think of as a minor risk or mild risk in a renal condition, if she gets superimposed preeclampsia or hypertensive disease, it can suddenly become moderate to severe.  The risk is something we can sometimes predict but we cannot judge, especially in pregnancy, because of rapidly changing sequences.  Unlike a non-pregnant patient, pregnancy is quite dangerous both in the antenatal and intrapartum period.</p></speech>

For example, we can say she is at low risk of thromboembolism but she can suddenly become medium or high risk.  When it comes to termination, it has to be judged based on what is perceived by the clinician at that time.  If it is a question of low risk and no termination, by the time one waits for it, it can become medium or high risk very suddenly.</p></speech>

In the context of pregnancy, which is a very dynamic process where risk can change and the disease process can deteriorate very rapidly, women will approach risk in a different way.  I think it is important to take women's viewpoints into consideration when we are dealing with them in the management of pregnancy - it is their lives that are at risk.  Some women will risk anything to have a baby.  For other women, for example, a woman who is 40 years of age and has four young children at home, who has diabetes which is deteriorating, and who finds herself pregnant and knows that if she continues with the pregnancy, her diabetes will get worse, her eyesight might be affected and her kidneys might deteriorate and so on, for her, that is not an acceptable risk.  For a woman in her first pregnancy after, say, years of IVF, she may well be willing to accept that risk.  So, while we can describe risk as low, middle and high, it is the woman's interpretation of what the risk is to her personally that is critically important in how we deal with women who are pregnant, and that side of it really has to be taken into account.</p></speech>

When it comes to some categorical variables, one can talk about probability and the likelihood of something happening.  In general terms, however, it is not possible to define in a clinical situation and it is an arbitrary decision.  Even categorising somebody as having high blood pressure is just based on where we drew a line in the population.  In terms of helping the members to deliberate, the language in the Citizens' Assembly in trying to differentiate between serious risk when it comes to health as opposed to life is not going to be supported, by definition.</p></speech>

With regard to training, that is the function of the institute.  The skill levels required in termination of pregnancy, every trained obstetrician possesses, so we are more into resources and so on.  It is well known that the Irish maternity services are under-resourced - that is no secret.  The maternity strategy is supposed to be addressing that issue and we look forward to increased and more appropriate investment in the health services in the future.  In a broad sense, yes, we would require more investment, more personnel and so on.  The training issue is something that can be quite easily addressed because the skill sets are there.</p></speech>

There is usually separation of early pregnancy services and termination services from ongoing services where women are attending an antenatal clinic and presenting with intended pregnancy and continuing pregnancy.  This is not the same in all European countries.  In hospital visits in many other jurisdictions, one sees signposting for all women's health services in the same area.  In Ireland, traditionally, we divide services by times of day, so we are using multi-function areas that may be for one function early in the morning and another function later in the day.  This is not satisfactory to the women and girls using our service and this comes through in patient surveys and in the advisory groups with regard to patient and family engagement in the general hospital setting.</p> <p>  In the women's hospital settings in Ireland, greater attention has obviously been paid to the reception of women and their families in regard to pregnancy.  In the general hospital setting, it is harder to differentiate between reception for those coming with physiological problems and socially determined health problems as opposed to those coming with pathology and disease.</p></speech>

It is not about the issue of protection of the foetus <i>per se</i>.  We have to really balance between the foetal and the maternal side.  Let us suppose that for a condition very early on in pregnancy, in assessing a situation, medical or otherwise, if I believe that if I do not do the termination, she is going to go and procure an illegal termination and run into difficulties like that, I would take that responsibility and perform that abortion.  However, if it is after foetal viability, then I will not go near the scene.  I will assess the whole condition and do that.<br/><br/>This particular question about mortality, legality and ethical issues is asked of me from time to time.  Everybody in this room is abortionist.  Some support legal; those who do not support legal support illegal abortion.  We are lucky in Ireland because they are able to go and get it done in England.  Otherwise, can we imagine what will happen to the 4,800 women within Ireland?  I would rest my case on that.</p></speech>

While we do not park our ethical beliefs at the door and we certainly carry them with us, we have to respect what the women's views are.  I think it is true to say that there is a wide range of ethical views on the acceptance of abortion in different circumstances right across the board.  For some people, it is totally unacceptable in any circumstances whatsoever, even if the woman is going to die.  Others would have a much more liberal approach where they are happy to provide abortion services under any circumstances whatsoever, and there is everything in between.</p><p>I believe that every person's viewpoint has to be respected.  If termination is introduced into Ireland and legalised, there will be facilities for people who are uncomfortable with whatever the circumstances of the termination of pregnancy are.  For example, there will be some physicians who are comfortable with termination for pregnancies where the baby has little or no hope of survival and there will be others who are uncomfortable with that.  Other clinicians will be comfortable with termination of pregnancy for whatever reason; there will be others who would resist that.  The full range of ethical positions and personal opinions is out there but the most important person in all of this, of course, is the woman who is pregnant.  It is her concerns we must address.</p></speech>

We in Irish obstetrics are facing a position of uncertainty in knowing where we stand.  As most of my 27-year career was spent working in Ireland, with a hiatus in Australia, in recent times I have not had to make that personal decision.  I would individualise it, however, for the care of the individual mother.  As in Dr. Boylan's statement, the mother may determine before she has a test that she is not going to have a termination under any circumstance but might change her mind.  I believe that clinicians, as we evolve and if we were working in a different legal environment, might start in a position where we would not engage in termination of pregnancy under any circumstances short of the protection of life in pregnancy.  Over time, however, I suspect that the individual nuance of the cases will provide many grey areas for us to have to use ethical decision making to face the moral distress that is involved.</p></speech>

He attended the launch that would bring in abortion.  He also said that he has been involved in London and the United States.

People will draw their own conclusions about Dr. Boylan's answer.</p> <p>  Professor Arulkumaran has written several scholarly articles on the injection of potassium chloride into the heart of an unborn at around 21 or 22 weeks as the most desirable method of terminating a pregnancy.  Regardless of what method is used at that stage, does the professor agree that in that moment, a child is being killed?  </p></speech>

If there is a little malformation for which we are carrying out a termination of pregnancy at 21 weeks, if we do not do the foeticide and if the baby comes out alive then it becomes a dilemma for the mother and the caregivers.  This is taken into careful consideration and the issues are discussed with the parents about whether they would like to see the baby coming and having a few gasps and dying, when even if one supports the baby it will die.  The option can be to do that or to have the foeticide and do the termination.  Globally this is a well-established process and it is not something new to me or my practice.  It is an established process globally.</p></speech>

As it is illegal here, any woman who imports pills into this country faces a criminal prosecution and 14 years in prison.  That is an unacceptable position for women to find themselves in.</p></speech>

It is well known that some medications that are supplied over the Internet are not what they purport to be.  There is another issue of concern, which is that women will be taking these pills without medical supervision and that has its own inherent dangers.  There is also the psychological impact on women.  One can picture a young woman in an apartment who has managed to get the pills.  She is terrified that she will be found out for having taken the pills - as has happened in Northern Ireland - and that she could end up being prosecuted.  That has a huge further psychological impact to her, on top of the distress of having a termination of pregnancy.  No woman goes out in the morning or wakes up and says "Ah sure I will have a termination today".  It is a very stressful process and women remember these things for the rest of their lives.</p></speech>

The professor evokes a situation where Ireland is dangerous, despite the fact that we have not had any criminal prosecution of doctors and despite the fact that we do not have a history of mothers losing their lives because of the lack of abortion in Ireland.  The professor's own report into the Savita Halappanavar affair did not claim that.  The doctors involved in that case did not claim that it was down to the law in Ireland but that it was down to mismanagement of a situation.  Has Professor Arulkumaran ever referred to or commented on - by contrast - findings made by the Care Quality Commission in England?  For example, in its spot checks on the Marie Stopes clinics, which is an abortion provider in the UK, the commission found as recently as five months ago that some 400 botched abortions had been done in a two-month period.  Has the professor ever commented on the problems with the provision of abortion in England and the adverse health effects for women, leaving aside the fatal effects for the unborn?</p></speech>

I have a number of questions.  My first question is for Dr. Boylan.  He said in his presentation, with regard to foetal abnormalities, that up to ten weeks, amniocentesis or chorionic villus testing-sampling could identify whether there is a genetic abnormality.  How late in the gestation period would we have to allow for all testing to be done to identify any other forms of fatal foetal abnormality other than the genetic ones?  Would we have to legislate for up to 22 weeks, 18 weeks or 16 weeks?</p></speech>

For example, some congenital heart anomalies are not detectable until around 18 to 20 weeks when a detailed ultrasound scan is done.  It is worth noting that only about 50% of all congenital abnormalities of the heart are diagnosed antenatally. That is a universal figure, no matter how good the scanning is, so there are problems in that respect.</p> <p>  We can diagnose conditions such as anencephaly very early on in pregnancy, but sometimes more complex problems are not apparent.  However, certainly by 20 weeks, we should have been able to diagnose the most obvious or the severe ones.  It is not always possible though and there is often a bit of uncertainty about the outlook in a condition, and women are followed throughout the pregnancy when there is an abnormality and they are continuing on with the pregnancy.</p></speech>

It has to be when there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother.  Dr. Boylan said, and I assume this is corroborated by the other witnesses, that the woman does not have any discussion in this.  The medical professionals make that assessment and the only opinion the woman can offer is to refuse a termination.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

We would discuss with women, for example, indications for induction of labour for a caesarean section, for how often she should attend, whether she wants an epidural in labour and so on.  Women are involved in these discussions the whole way through, but the problem with the current legislation is that it is up to the doctors to make a decision and then to advise the woman that her life is at risk and she needs a termination of pregnancy to minimise that risk or remove the risk.  However, it is a fine line.  The only way one can find out whether one has made the right decision is not to do a termination and, if the woman dies, one has made the wrong decision.  That is the only way a doctor will know for definite that he or she has made the wrong decision.  It is an unacceptable environment in which to practise medicine in 2017.  Also, the lack of involvement of the woman in making the decision is not acceptable.</p></speech>

The medical ethics used at the clinical coalface include the autonomy of the woman at all times and her supporting partner and family.  The provision of her involvement in the discussion is not purely just to receive advice and information but it is an informed consent process over time, if the time allows.  In general, if the woman is aware that time is not allowing, she makes her decision quite quickly, but in some situations informed consent is a process and it is revisited over hours and days, if time allows.  Women may choose to opt out of life-saving procedures when their life is at serious risk if they have the capacity to do so.  Our duty as clinician providers is to assess their well-being and ability to have capacity, and capacity may be an issue in distressing circumstances with psychoses, drug use or intellectual disability.  We would involve other professions in helping us reach that decision if there is any concern over it, where time allows.</p></speech>

Informed consent in modern obstetric practice means the partnership is not just equal, the woman is the centre.  Her autonomy is respected.  There is much implied consent used in work on a day-to-day basis in the sense that checking of the receipt of information, the tell-back of the information and if this what the woman agrees with is taken in many forms of communication, including verbal and non-verbal, written and non-written.</p></speech>

In my experience, outside a tertiary institution, the commonest reason in our current practice for invoking the protection of life in pregnancy is with ruptured membranes before viability.  That is where the waters have gone around the baby and the mother is at risk of the subsequent impact of infection.  That process of information, education and communication with the woman starts from the time we are giving the diagnosis.  It is a process over time.  It is not a single act.  While the witnesses have advised that there may be uncertainty, the timeline to advancing to more serious signs of infection, what we call sepsis, and then to times where the mortality rate significantly goes up, what we call septic shock, are very variable among women.  We are always conscious of that because, as I mentioned, we are measured in retrospect if there is an adverse outcome, but we do not have that ability to see ahead at the time.  Communication, information and consent are changing and evolving over time.  The paternalistic approach to consent in Irish medicine across many domains is evolving over time as medical ethics develop over time.</p></speech>

Dr. N&iacute; Bhuinne&aacute;in is saying that a woman has a say and can discuss this with her clinician and they could ultimately come to a decision, but realistically it is only the clinician who can decide at the end of the day.

It will certainly have an effect on a young vulnerable girl, who takes the pills and then has more bleeding than she would anticipate and must go into hospital and her fear is being asked what happened.  If she has an infection, it may become a little bit more obvious what she has been trying to do.  She does not know whether while in the hospital a doctor, midwife, secretary may report her case to the police.  That will have a chilling effect on her and adds to her distress.</p></speech>

Given the explanations as to how the system is working in the context of the amendment, where superficially everything is working, but underneath it is not working, then if it were working why should 4,800 women travel to another country to procure an abortion?  In my view, things will have to change.  I do not think the eighth amendment as it stands is good for the women in Ireland.</p></speech>

I believe human rights, autonomy of the woman and her considered right to self-determination is more apparent now than it was in 1983.  I was not of age in 1983.</p> <p>  Societal change has happened in many different areas of sexual, reproductive and health issues in the past century.  Society has struggled with each development in these areas.  They are very emotive and our value system come into play.  It is not possible to prevent women from accessing safe abortion services in other jurisdictions.  Is it acceptable in our society to know that we are not looking after our women and girls in this country at this time?</p></speech>

It has resulted in cases such as Savita Halappanavar, Miss P and the whole alphabet soup we have of women going to the European Court of Human Rights and the UN and so on.  It is also not working because as I have said, the genie is out of the bottle, with the abortion pill which is freely available and can be accessed via post offices in this country.  There are many anomalies.  Time has moved on and the eighth amendment is no longer fit for purpose in 2017.</p></speech>

Given that backdrop, and the commentary that the floodgates could open in other jurisdictions, as medical professionals what is their view of the situation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.301" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Sabaratnam Arulkumaran" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017101800002#M01300"><p>The experience in France, Italy and Turkey is that once termination of pregnancy is legalised, the abortion rate comes down.  The only reason for that, is that it is combined, as Dr. Boylan mentioned, with good post abortion contraception.  It is a very clear distinction that it comes down without any difficulty.  Second, because medical termination of pregnancy is available, things are getting safer and safer.  The World Health Organisation document shows that the chance of the mother dying during a termination in the first trimester is 0.1 per 100,0000, which is minimal.  As the gestation period increases, so do the complications and so on go up and illegal abortion comes to the fore when she is in the later period of gestation and runs into difficulties.  The answer is that legalisation of abortion brings the termination rates down.  That is the experience not just in one but a number of countries, including South Africa.</p></speech>

Already it has been raised here as to how to define a serious risk to mental health as was the case in the UK, in which a member of the institute has commented on.  The law will be tested when it is in use.  In spite of the best efforts to legislate in appropriate language, allowing some freedom in regulation would be advisable.</p></speech>

There was a great deal of concern expressed by some people about the inclusion of suicide as a risk to the life of the mother in the Protection of Life in Pregnancy Act, and that women would abuse this provision.  That has not happened.  I do not think women will abuse any legislation.  </p> <p>  Termination is a very distressing thing to have to go through.  I should also say that women who have terminations for babies with serious abnormalities grieve for those babies.  They name them, they really feel deeply about it and they are very angry at having to travel abroad.  I do not think members should underestimate that anger.  It is out there, justifiably.</p></speech>

I thank all three witnesses for their presentations.  I am finding the testimony of the medical experts and professionals very powerful and telling because they are people who are dedicated to the care and health of others.  They have a very clear message.</p> <p>  I want to ask a question about the thousands of women who travel each year to Britain for abortions.  We know that because they have to travel it means the termination will be delayed by a number of weeks.  Is the fact the terminations are delayed because the women have to travel a significant factor in terms of the health of those women?  That question is open to any of the witnesses.</p></speech>

Health, in its widest sense, is not just the absence of disease.  The woman does not have to have a complication as a result of this delay.  The issue is the physical, psychological and social well-being she no longer has during this delay.  The delays are not just because she has to travel to another jurisdiction.  As a result of the current stigmatisation of openly seeking termination services and because of the concern about host responsiveness, her decision-making is often delayed in the very beginning.  That is the first delay.  The second delay is when she gets into a track where she is receiving some degree of advice.  Is it impartial?  Is it coming from an informal system?  Is it coming from systems that are driven for missionary or fiscal reasons or is it coming from an open, objective and balanced system?  The third delay is in actually accessing the care when she gets there.  We are starting to see, as the Senator is aware from the media, that the host nation does not always have the capacity to meet the needs of these women when they arrive.  That national capacity of the UK to continue to provide for us is under re-examination.</p></speech>

The complications are much greater with surgical termination.  The second issue is they cannot have a medical termination in the UK because they go one day and have to travel back so they all end up in late surgical termination at 11 weeks or 12 weeks.  If it is done in Ireland with the legislation, they could have a medical termination at seven or eight weeks with minimal complications, minimal blood loss and minimal chance of infection.</p></speech>

We think we have our positions when we come in here but we realise how much we do not know.  I thank the witnesses for their expertise.  Some of my questions have been touched on, in particular by Senator Gavan's last question.  I am conscious we are coming up to the anniversary of Savita Halappanavar's death.  It is easy for us, as we are not her family, friends or people who knew her, to keep hearing her name.  However, it is important to ask the question while being sensitive of the impact it could have for people who are watching proceedings.  Dr. Boylan said that Savita would still be alive today if she had been given an abortion when she first requested it.  This is contested in some quarters by those who claim she died as a result of sepsis due to an inevitable miscarriage.  Perhaps my question is for Professor Arulkumaran and Dr. Boylan because they were aware of the case and involved in the inquest.  Do they believe the presence of the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution cost Savita her life?  There have been claims that the eighth amendment saves lives but we very rarely look at the lives it has cost.</p> <p>  My other question is to all three witnesses and is about the socioeconomic grounds.  Sometimes it is seen as a ground in isolation.  In women from low socioeconomic backgrounds there is an intrinsic link between their background and poor health.  How can we begin to look at those two together instead of separately?  There is a connection between socioeconomic status and the overall health and well-being of women from poorer socioeconomic backgrounds.  When assessing the risk to health or life of a pregnant woman, are any social indicators taken into account in that assessment and, if not, should they be?</p></speech>

It was very clear to me during the inquiry that the thing preventing the physician from proceeding was the legal issue because she repeatedly said she was concerned about the legal issue.  I will give a little bit of explanation.  The mother was sick.  There was no question about that.  Even at the last minute they were using a hand probe to see whether the baby's heartbeat was present or not.  Any junior doctor would have said it was a serious condition and they must terminate.   They were just keeping her going because of the mere fact the heartbeat was there.  The legislation played a major role in making a decision.  Somebody else might say they would have done the termination much earlier.  That is a personal interpretation.  It is why things are made difficult because of the legislation.</p> <p>  With regard to the second question on the socioeconomic situation, one has to look at each individual mother's case separately.  One mother might be a single mother and might have difficulty in managing or feeding the children.  Another might have been using contraception or experiencing physical or other abuse by the husband.  As medical physicians, we have to take the socioeconomic background into consideration when a mother makes a request.</p></speech>

There is no question about that.  There were deficiencies in her care.  There is no question about that.  However, had she had her pregnancy terminated when she asked for it in the first few days of admission, she would not have developed the sepsis because her uterus would have been empty.  The unfortunate fact is that when the waters break the barrier to infection ascending from the outside into the womb is broken and so infection ascends into the womb and then there is a problem.  If the womb is empty and the woman is delivered of her baby that does not happen.</p><p>If she had had her termination when she had asked for it, the question of developing sepsis and so on would not have arisen, we would never have heard of her and she would be alive today.</p><p> Regarding the socioeconomic risk, we take everything into account.  However, it is not taken into account in current Irish legislation, under which we can only take into account risk of death or risk to physical or mental health, which should be considered together.</p></speech>

We check understanding if the woman does not have the first language of the country or the health providers.  We use gender inequality and check for domestic and gender-based violence.  We use immigrant status.  We use ethnicity.  If we are not the major ethnicity of the country in which we are receiving reproductive health services, we tend to do worse than those who are of the major ethnicity.  It is more difficult in deliberation over life.  Where we are not familiar with the different ethnic groups, there may not be the same responsiveness to their needs.  We also use social indicators in health assessment and risk assessment in part of our education communication strand of care.</p> <p>  In terms of the committee's deliberations, social indicators probably best fit when it comes to determining where services are provided.  If they are not integrated fully in the public health system, those who are most socially disadvantaged through urban or rural poverty will still not be able to succeed in gaining equitable access to care.</p></speech>

Dr. Boylan stated that doctors were currently in a position of having to interpret the Constitution.  From his experience, even if it is just anecdotally if he does not have figures, does that happen on a weekly or monthly basis?</p> <p>  I take it that the best outcome for clinicians is that abortion be allowed purely on medical grounds between a doctor and a patient.  Is that correct?  Perhaps the other witnesses might wish to address that point.  Is that the best outcome from a clinical point of view?</p> <p>  Dr. Boylan stated that he could not imagine any doctor in Ireland contemplating performing an abortion after 23 weeks.  Will he expand on that?  It is an important point for this committee.</p> <p>  Dr. N&iacute; Bhuinne&aacute;in works in a level 3 hospital.  In the event that abortion becomes available in Ireland, would it require centres of excellence?  Would regional hospitals be equipped to perform these procedures?

We are discussing health and risk to health, but "health" is broader than "medical reasons".  As to the use of the word "doctor", there may in time be task shifting to other cadres of specialist staff who come from a nursing or midwifery background.  "Clinician-woman relationship" is the broader interpretation of the Deputy's question.</p> <p>  It is not possible to be proscriptive on every indication as to why a woman or girl may request a termination.  The commonest reasons where there are liberal laws are that the pregnancy is not affordable for her at this time or her other responsibilities would be compromised at this time, for example, the impact on other people for whom she is responsible.  If we become restrictive as regards purely clinical indications of physical and mental health, which is what the Citizens' Assembly has recommended, we will miss the other social determinants of health and well-being that influence women's decisions to seek termination of pregnancy and we may not legislate for those women who are currently self-terminating for what we may not consider to be socioeconomic or medical reasons.</p> <p>  Regarding the Deputy's question on model 3 hospitals, a safe termination of pregnancy is part of what is considered basic emergency obstetric care.  Centres of excellence have an important role in termination care where the woman has complex medical disorders or the foetal complexity may prove difficult to manage in a rural hospital setting that is in a model 3 unit.  There is still one unit in a model 2 hospital.  Occasionally, there will be reasons to attend a tertiary unit where there is a maternal foetal medicine specialist practising with a full multidisciplinary team.  In general, termination of pregnancy would be considered within the core competencies of general obstetricians and gynaecologists and general practitioners, GPs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.340" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Peter Boylan" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017101800002#O01200"><p>As to interpreting the Constitution, the most egregious example of that was the Miss P case.  Everyone present is aware of it and the appalling vista that it presented.  The doctors were unable to make a decision as to whether they could turn off her life support because of the presence of a foetal heartbeat.  That is the best example.  In terms of day-to-day practice, the issue would not arise on a daily basis.  In a busy unit like a tertiary referral centre, however, it would be an issue and people would wonder whether it was legal to provide a termination in a particular case.</p> <p>  Another problem is that cases going to the European Court of Human Rights makes the eighth amendment difficult on the ground for practising staff.</p> <p>  The best outcome is the interaction between the patient and the health care professional.  There is no question about that.  No two situations are identical and many nuances are involved in all scenarios.  Some people have different attitudes towards risk, for example.  All of these factors need to be taken into consideration.  The best person to make those considerations is the patient with her health care professional.</p> <p>  Twenty-three weeks and on is where foetal viability is now regarded as a practical proposition.  Many of those survivors at 23 weeks will have significant disabilities, for example, cerebral palsy and blindness, and be completely dependent for the rest of their lives.  It is not that everything is fine at 23 weeks - it is not like that at all - but if a baby is born at 23 weeks, physicians in Ireland will do everything to care for that baby.  For example, if we have a woman with a severe condition who is at 23 and a half weeks with twins and we tell her that she is really sick and we need to deliver her, and if she asks us to do everything to save the babies, we will perform a caesarean section and intervene in the best interests of those babies.  That is theoretically a termination of pregnancy, but we will in fact do everything to look after those babies when they are born.  It is not a simple situation and viability changes.  When I was in training, a baby born at 28 weeks had little chance of survival.  The situation is improving all of the time with intensive neonatal care, advances, research and so on.  Is that a satisfactory answer?</p></speech>

If a woman presents to a hospital bleeding and in the course of having a miscarriage, we do not know whether she has tried to use abortion pills.  We take at face value whatever she says.  Obviously, we look after her regardless and do not make any judgment call whatsoever.  If she wants to tell us, that is fine, but I have little experience of that.  That is probably because most of them are successfully completed at home and they do not need to attend hospital.  They would be in the minority.</p></speech>

My first question is to Professor Arulkumaran.  In regard to the British health system, all health care systems are dependent on their being able to recruit and retain medical staff, which has become a huge issue recently.  We heard last week that Liverpool Women's Hospital has had to delay admissions of Irish women with a fatal foetal abnormality.  In the context of Brexit, there seems to be a large immigrant cohort in the UK health service.  In that regard, is it correct to say that we cannot depend on the British health care system being capable of delivering for people outside of the British jurisdiction?</p></speech>

It is true that there is a shortage of doctors, nurses and ancillary staff in the health services and that the level at which these services can be provided might be questioned.  I will try to explain how the system is organised in regard to, for example, terms of termination of pregnancy.  I work in St. George's Hospital, which provides this service for all of south-west London, despite that there are seven different hospitals in the area.  The vast majority - 60% to 70% - of terminations are carried out by prescription.  Every week, there are two clinics and two operating lists for suction termination.  We manage all the referrals for south-west London.  I do not know the population of Ireland versus south-west London.  One clinic offering suction termination in each of the big cities in Ireland would be sufficient.  Whatever the outcome of Brexit there will be no need for concern if legislation providing for liberal abortion is enacted.</p></speech>

In regard to the 99% versus the 1% in terms of Ireland and Malta, is there a model of best practice within the European Union that he believes Ireland should emulate?</p></speech>

Ireland always seems to look to the UK for examples of how things should be done in this country, particularly in the medical sphere.  The UK legislation dates back to the 1960s, such that it has been in operation for more than 50 years now.  We do not have to adopt it.  This is not reinventing the wheel.  There are many countries within Europe from which we can pick and choose legislation.  There are very good analyses of the different types of legislation throughout Europe but the common theme of all of them is that 99% of women in the EU have access to safe termination in the first ten weeks-first trimester of pregnancy.  That might well be a starting point.</p></speech>

Under that Act, the only indication for termination of pregnancy in this country is a risk to the life of the mother.  That would stand.  There would be no change in that respect.  We would still have the most restrictive legislation in Europe.  In regard to regulation and so on, as the Deputy correctly mentioned, regulation is the function of the Department of Health.  It would regulate where the procedure could be done and so on.  The Medical Council interprets medical ethics and provides guidelines for practising obstetricians.  If we step outside those guidelines, we are subject to sanction by the Medical Council, which can, although rarely, result in the withdrawal of a right to practise in the country.  That is how the system would work.  Education and training would be the function of the Institute of Obstetricians an Gynaecologists.</p></speech>

I will read the transcript of the proceedings after the meeting.  I found the presentations very helpful.  Dr. Boylan said in his presentation that the eighth amendment has caused grave harm to women, including death.  I welcome Professor Arulkumaran's clarification for Senator Ruane of the Savita Halappanavar investigation team.  My understanding of what he said was that the legislative position did have a serious impact on the clinical professional judgment.  In that context, and in regard to Professor Arulkumaran's statement, does this arise because of the artificial divide between health and life?  It is a fine line that can change in that often one is waiting for a situation to become life threatening.  Would the removal of that distinction tidy up that matter?</p> <p>  We hear a lot that Ireland is a safe place to give birth.  Is it not the case that many of the countries that are better than us have quite a liberal abortion regime and it is not, therefore, an argument that because we do not have abortion in Ireland we have safe maternity care?  The countries rated higher than Ireland have a liberal abortion regime.  Perhaps the delegates would elaborate on how that is linked to our ability to access abortion services in Britain.</p> <p>  I would like to discuss the abortion pill, which ties into the area of resources.  Last week, the head of obstetrics and gynaecology in the UK said that in her opinion the legislation in the UK needs to be changed to allow nurses and midwives to make the abortion pill available.  They currently make this medication available in cases of missed miscarriages and they carry out vacuum aspiration.  Is this not a way in which to deal with a resources issue?  As this is an approved medical pill that is certified in Ireland, why cannot it be administered in a GP's office by a nurse?  Given the number of people who access it in the first trimester there is no real resources required.  Perhaps this could be teased out further.</p> <p>  On consent, is it not the case that whereas normally the patient dictates his or her treatment, the woman's ability to consent, because of the eighth amendment, is diminished?  I am thinking particularly in cases of people who are happy to parent but were brought to court because they did not want a caesarean section, it was deemed that the life of the unborn was threatened by their decision and, therefore, an action was taken to cut across their opinion.</p><p>I apologise for throwing these issues in together, but will the delegates address the points made?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.360" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Sabaratnam Arulkumaran" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017101800002#Q00200"><p>I will start with Savita's case which was very clear.  There are certain conditions in which a disease can escalate steeply and there is no time.  By the time the condition is recognised one has missed the boat.  For example, the maternal mortality rate in cases of severe sepsis is between 20% and 40%.  If the mother develops septic shock, the figure rises to 60%.  For every hour treatment is delayed, the chances of maternal mortality occurring rise by 6%.  There is no time to waste and a clinician must recognise that the mother is going into septic shock, has a fever and a high pulse rate.  However, because there is a heartbeat the clinician starts to dilly-dally.  There is no question that the medical practitioner should be given the opportunity to act.</p> <p>  The second question was about the dispensing of tablets by nurses, pharmacists and so on.  The crucial issue in liberalising termination is that it must come under regulation.  As Dr. Boylan mentioned, it must come within the remit of a medical council, or a nursing council if nurses are to be allowed to dispense.  The most important point is that the patient be registered with some clinical medical professional, whether it be a nurse, a midwife or a doctor, who could say the patient was at such a gestation period and that such a medication had been given.  This person should give a telephone number to the patient in order that she could call if she was to experience fever, have a high pulse rate or bleeding in order that she could make immediate contact.  There is no medical procedure without risk.  The moment the patient feels something is wrong, she should be able to ring and gain access to health services in order that it can be managed.  There are a number of countries which allow nursing and midwifery professionals to prescribe and administer the drug, but they always have communication and a centre which can deal with complications should they arise.</p></speech>

Ireland is a very safe place in which to give birth, but it is not the safest in the world.  The margins are quite small, but it is a very safe place in which to give birth.  However, if we did not have access to the United Kingdom, our maternal mortality rate would shoot up because women would access unsafe illegal back-street abortion services.  That is undeniable.  The best example is Romania when Ceauescu came to power, on which I have provided information in my position paper.</p> <p>  There is a nurse practitioner programme which allows nurses and midwives to gain prescribing skills.  That happens in maternity units nowadays.  As Professor Arulkumaran said, it is important that they have backup and a telephone number and so on.  </p> <p>  On the issue of consent, the Deputy mentioned forced caesarean sections because of a concern about the condition of the baby.  That is very rare.  It does happen, but it is extremely rare and I am not really sure what the eight amendment has to do with that issue.  It is more about a clinician's concern about a woman's capacity to make the decision to continue a pregnancy.  These are pregnancies which are well into term - 38, 39, 42, 43 and 44 weeks - and which involve significant foetal concerns which are not related to termination of pregnancy.</p></speech>

I hope it will happen under Dr. Peter Boylan.</p></speech>

Is that correct?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.374" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Sabaratnam Arulkumaran" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017101800002#Q01600"><p>That is correct.  As an example, if a woman has an underlying renal disorder which was not picked up before the pregnancy started and develops a condition - during pregnancy conditions such as pre-eclampsia, diabetes and hypertension can develop - her condition will deteriorate rapidly.  If we had proceeded according to stratification, we would have missed that lady.  That is why it is sometimes not that easy.  Even if we had a list, it could not cover the entire spectrum.</p></speech>

It was the citizens participating in the assembly who did not want the words "substantial" or "real" being included.  Does he think that would be wise and that risk alone should be the basis of any health-based ground for abortion?</p></speech>

Health issues are limiting.  We must also think about women's rights and the other sociodemographic  issues we are discussing.  My advice is that only focusing on death and health and such things would restrict and might not give the greatest advantage.  If the legislation is to be changed, the best approach is to take all facts into consideration to see what is best for the women of Ireland.</p></speech>

We heard evidence on this matter last week which included a study which had been carried out.  What is his opinion on legislation which does not cater for those women whose health is not at risk but who are going to access abortion services?</p></speech>

If those 4,800 women could access the same care which they can receive in England and be assessed by a doctor who could offer an abortion legally, that would be the best outcome for the women of Ireland.</p></speech>

He has spoken about the genie being out of the bottle because pregnant women can access abortion pills on the Internet and also find out quite a lot about them.  It is not like 1983.  What percentage of abortions would be covered by the 12-week period recommended by the Citizens' Assembly?</p></speech>

Indeed, they have come up a lot in Ireland generally, with images being used by anti-abortion groups.  How frequent are these post-23 week abortions?  What percentage of the overall abortion rate do they represent and for what reasons would they be carried out at that very late stage?</p></speech>

Yes, they would be under 1% and would be carried out for fatal anomalies that become apparent later in pregnancy.</p></speech>

References were also made to injections into the heart and so forth.  Could Professor Arulkumaran clarify that he was referring to parents who are experiencing fatal foetal abnormality or some other situation where the prognosis is that life is not possible?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.390" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Sabaratnam Arulkumaran" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017101800002#R01000"><p>Yes, in the UK practice I mentioned earlier, if there is a fatal foetal malformation, it is very distressing for the parents to look at the baby gasping a few times and dying.  We have counselling, repeated counselling and discuss it with them.  If it is anencephaly, for example and there is no brain, just a little bit of tissue there or a major spinal defect where most of the organ systems will be paralysed and so forth, then we would offer that.  If the mother says "No", that she does not want to have foeticide done and will take the consequences, then we say "Okay".  We terminate the pregnancy and sometimes the baby might be alive.  We just leave them there to really grieve with the baby and then we take it on.  Many of the mothers, as Dr. Boylan mentioned earlier, want to do a registration, they want to have a funeral, to have a footprint of the baby taken and they like to remember that baby.  Mother to mother, though, it varies quite a lot.  There are some mothers who do not want to even look at the baby because they are worried that it might affect them and come back to them like a dream later on.  We offer but if they do not want it, we do not force them.</p></speech>

In terms of Professor Arulkmaran's opening statement, it really depends on whatever question one asks.  What I am asking here is what we are trying to achieve.  If we are trying to achieve something that is politically palatable or palatable to the wider public who, for some reason, people within these Houses seem to think are not engaged in this process, then we are going down the right road in this committee.  We are trying to deal with the issue of the almost 5,000 women travelling to the UK.  I was on a flight home from the UK last week and as I walked up the aisle, I wondered who on the plane was travelling back.</p> <p>  What we should be trying to achieve at this committee is the provision of appropriate maternity care for the women of this country without fear of political consequences for our own careers.  We should be doing our job as legislators and we need to be brave here.  </p> <p>  We have listened to many experts in the past few weeks, including the witnesses before us today but we keep talking about women as if women are some sort of abstract concept.  I am one of those women.  When I present myself in the Coombe Hospital to have a baby, I have a reasonable expectation that I will come out the other side alive and that my children will not be left without me.  Professor Boylan said that the maternity strategy does not have women at its centre.  If women are not at the centre of the maternity strategy, as we discussed at the Committee on Health, then where are we going in this country?  There is this idea that we cannot trust women in this country with their own medical decisions.  I totally agree with the Professor that risk depends on where one is in one's life.  If I am told at 42 - in a few years time - that I have a high-risk pregnancy, I am not going to risk not coming out the other side but if I was 42 and having my first child, that would be a completely different decision.  As one of the witnesses said, the individual nuances of cases present grey areas.  I think it was Professor Boylan who said that but I might be attributing it to the wrong person.  This has been made clear to the committee and those who are ignoring it are just putting their heads in the sand.  We cannot allow for every permutation of every gestational development, every kidney function, every liver function or heart function of every individual and come up with some sort of formula whereby we, in here, allow women to do X, Y or Z with their lives.  </p> <p>  I am getting frustrated at this stage.  We spoke about floodgates opening and I always find this humorous-----</p></speech>

Pregnancy is something that progresses.  If a woman is not going to get sorted in her GP's surgery, she is going to go onto <i>aerlingus.com</i>or <i>ryanair.com</i>or wherever.  I hate being racist against Irish people but we are trying to get an Irish solution to an Irish problem here.  I cannot understand why we are - to use Dr. Boylan's word - &quot;shrouding&quot; the decision in terms of trying to keep this person or that person happy.  I think it is right to say that we are all abortionists in this room.  It is just that some of us are willing to face up to the realities while some are willing to shove it onto someone else's plate.</p></speech>

There is no greater pain than such a diagnosis, as he knows.  These are babies that are wanted.  At 22 weeks into a pregnancy, to be told that is just heartbreaking and for us to sit here and judge those women for what they choose to do with their bodies and their lives is appalling.  We were asked to "get real" here by Professor Binchy a few weeks ago.  I think we need to get real on this committee.  The witnesses before us need to spell it out, in black and white, to us today that there is no way that we can legislate for everything we can think of here because in five years time, something might happen.  Something might be developed that will enable children to survive at 22 weeks and that will be great and we will use it but we cannot-----</p></speech>

I would recommend that legislation should, instead of saying this, that or the other, refer to it being discussed with the woman and, based on the women's request, a termination is offered if she wants it.  That is based on 60 years experience in the UK and that is a perfect example of what is happening.  It is not uncontrolled but is registered and these things are discussed.  Otherwise, we are just, as the Deputy said, pussyfooting around, trying to invent reasons to do it.</p><p>That will not be the main objective.

I thank the witnesses.  I have read the presentation Professor Arulkumaran made to the Citizens' Assembly.  Clearly women can go to Britain.  We have abortion, but it happens to be in Britain.  The professor presented figures from South Africa showing a 91% decrease in deaths from unsafe abortions when it was legalised.  Yesterday I attended the launch of the UN report on the Sustainable Development Goals.  The reality of women who die on the African Continent because they do not have access to a place like Britain is very stark.</p> <p>  Professor Arulkumaran presented graphs showing the reduction in abortions after legalisation in France, Italy and Turkey.  I ask him to outline the reduction in abortion following legalisation so that we can be clear that we are talking about either unsafe abortions or legal abortions.</p> <p>  Several people have referred to the anniversary of the death of Savita Halappanavar and the sensitivity and difficulty for her family.  Senator Mullen - I am sorry he is not here - referred to another woman who died.  The witness did not have time to respond to the question because he had gone over his time.  Is that the same woman referred to last week by the master of the Rotunda Hospital?  If it was, it was a very different interpretation of why that woman died.  I will give the witness more time to respond to that issue raised by Senator Mullen.  His statement as to the reason that woman died does not seem to be true.</p> <p>  My final question is to Dr. N&iacute; Bhuinne&aacute;in and perhaps to Dr. Boylan.  Deputy Naughton asked about training and systems, and people having conscientious objections.  When representatives of the Irish College of General Practitioners appeared before the committee, they made it clear that somebody with a conscientious objection has an obligation to refer the case to somebody who does not who will deal with the issue.  Is that the same for obstetrics and gynaecology?  If so what would be the practice whereby somebody in a hospital in the west of Ireland or the mid-west in my case can be certain that they will have access to the care they require irrespective of the geography?</p></speech>

Early terminations with tablets can be done through GPs surgeries and clinics, and by nurses who are certified to prescribe.</p> <p>  A person with a conscientious objection has an obligation to refer the woman on to somebody else who will have a different view.

Not all termination services will occur in the hospital sector.  In time if abortion is liberalised in Ireland, early first trimester termination with medical management will occur in the community.  Therefore the access to practitioners is possibly more streamlined in many areas around the country.  If there are clusters of conscientious objectors that limit the geographical access for women and girls to services, the Medical Council is very clear at the moment - it will revise again in response to legislation - that the duty of care continues.  Trying to arrange a transfer and access is part of that duty of care.  A conscientious objector must have a very sincere belief in the ethical dilemma and be conflicted with it.  It is not just a convenient opt-out by the professional.  The testing of conscientious objection may become part of the assessment of competence and become a training issue.</p> <p>  The Deputy said that we have abortion; it is in the UK.  It is not the perception of all women.  Some women may get a late diagnosis of foetal anomaly at 22 or 23 weeks.  The timeline to make a decision to seek support, to mobilise resources and to self-refer to the UK does not allow them to complete that in two or three weeks.  We are familiar with women who have continued pregnancy even though that was not their desired option.  We need to be careful that we do not allow that to become a commonly used phrase.  Referring to my previous comment, we cannot underestimate the morbidity that we are not measuring at the moment.</p></speech>

The General Medical Council regulation in the UK is that if any doctor - GP, physician or obstetrician - does not want to do something, it is their responsibility to refer the case to somebody in time and in the right place so that procedure can be carried out.  I am sure the Medical Council here will also have the same regulations to prevent women being bypassed or delayed because of conscientious objection.</p></speech>

The WHO has reported that the introduction or liberalising of abortion in France, Italy and Turkey has reduced the number of terminations mainly because of post-abortion contraception.  Many women will accept a long-acting reversible contraceptive such as an IUD or implant.  Therefore they do not get pregnant or run to the same cycle.  I am sure the same process will happen if it is legalised and takes place in Ireland.  When these women go to Britain they do not have the opportunity to have that particular counselling and have contraception there.  Here they are not going to come and say, "I had an abortion.  I want contraception", unless they go and say they want contraception.  As Dr. Boylan mentioned earlier, if termination is liberalised, it needs to be linked to contraception services.</p></speech>

I have a question on the chilling factor.</p><p>On the issue of women or girls who may have accessed abortion pills through the Internet, I understand that there have been situations in Northern Ireland where prosecutions have taken place.  Is there evidence that such prosecutions have happened here?</p><p> In the Citizens' Assembly, of the citizens in that group who voted for termination without restriction, 92% voted to limit gestation to 12 weeks, which is intervention at not later than 12 weeks.  Does this meet the witnesses' requirements?  I am mindful of the fact that we have discussed tragically unfortunate cases, and one case in particular that has been most under discussion.  There are pre-exisiting conditions that have the propensity to accelerate dramatically if they are in combination with other conditions.  At this stage, in relation to that case and to others, and in the event of there being evidence to that effect, will each of the witnesses say that they would now be prompted to intervene more quickly?  During my time in the House I have dealt with a number of cases in this area where tragic consequences took place.  That is the basis for my question.</p></speech>

I have not heard about any.</p> <p>  The Deputy's second question was about the limits of gestation for terminations, based on the outcome from the Citizens' Assembly.  The records in the UK say that nearly 90% of terminations are done under 12 weeks.  That would cover a vast number of them.</p> <p>  With regard to the third question posed, there are special circumstances where the mother may have an illness and if it were to escalate there could be organ damage.  There might be some special provision given and taken.  The Citizens' Assembly vote, in terms of percentages, reflects those dilemmas in some way.  We must take everything into consideration.  If it is just on request or for social reasons or otherwise, then it might be 12 weeks and that would cover 90%.  There must, however, be a provision to have a later termination for those who have illnesses or conditions that can escalate.</p></speech>

In terms of delaying access for post-abortal care, the fears among vulnerable groups are not always about criminalisation.  The fear is of social rejection, disclosure to family and friends and the consequences in their immediate community.  The Deputy framed his question around whether the legislation would meet our requirements.  With regard to the women and girls we serve, having no reason for termination up to 12 weeks will not meet the requirements of all the women and girls who are currently seeking termination of pregnancy.  While the diagnosis of pregnancy is made early in most cases, there are still many women who may not reach the self-diagnosis of pregnancy until beyond 12 weeks, although that is becoming less frequent.  With education and a comprehensive reproductive care package, in time the earlier diagnosis of pregnancy may occur, especially with younger women but not always with older women.</p></speech>

Evidence has been suggested that where abortion is readily and legally available in a country, the number of abortions decline.  What is the basis for that conclusion?  Different regimes apply in different countries.  Germany has fairly strict regulation of termination of pregnancy.  As medical practitioners, are the witnesses aware of the system in Germany as opposed to the UK system?</p></speech>

The restrictive practice in Germany is that the counselling is supposed to be directive counselling as opposed to non-directive.  Germany is, however, one of the group of countries, along with the Netherlands, Belgium and Scandinavian countries, where abortion rates have fallen.  It is not necessarily clear that abortion rates would fall immediately here because it would depend on the strength of the education programme and access to contraception, including post-abortal care contraception, as the professor has alluded to, and planned contraceptive services in a more informal delivery system than we currently have.  In the long-term, if there is liberal termination of pregnancy legislation, we would anticipate a fall in the numbers of women seeking termination.  In the short term, unless it is matched by other sex education programmes and other changes in contraception delivery, we might not see that fall immediately.</p></speech>

The committee has been talking a lot about the safety of abortion for women.  I would like to hear from Dr. Boylan about how safe abortion is for the baby in the womb.  It seems to me that we must be prepared to say, here and now, that abortion is never safe for the baby.  With abortion, the baby's life always ends.  How does Dr. Boylan feel about introducing a procedure that would ask doctors to do the opposite of what they have always been asked to do?  We have always trained doctors to save human lives.  Abortion would expect doctors to end human lives.</p></speech>

The mortality rate of mothers from abortion is in the order of one in a million.  It is much higher, obviously, in pregnancies that continue on.  We need to talk about the belief systems that people have.  Many people hold the very firm and sincerely held belief that it is morally wrong in all circumstances to perform an abortion.  They firmly believe that it is morally wrong to end a foetal life.  That is absolutely true, those views have to be respected and they are quite widely held.</p><p>On the other hand, there are huge numbers of people who do not share those beliefs.  As I alluded to earlier on, there are people happy to perform terminations for all sorts of different reasons and at different gestational ages, depending on their set of beliefs.  One has to depend on what a person's belief systems are.  Those are influenced by where they grow up, what they are taught in school, their religious background and so on.</p></speech>

It is important to understand, however, that in the womb one does not have what used to be called a homunculus or fully-formed human from the early stages.  There is a huge amount of complex development.  When one can see a heartbeat in the womb, what one is looking at is a tube which is pulsating.  It is not the heart as we know it.  It is important to understand there are complex developments which take place from the beginning of conception right up until us, if one likes.

Surely viability is just another stage of pregnancy.  The baby is still the same member of the human race before viability as after that point.  The only difference is that a baby is a bit bigger and more developed after viability.  In countries where abortions are allowed, doctors are expected to ignore the rights of one of the patients, mainly the unborn.  This is very different to what happens in Ireland where doctors do their best to save every life.  What makes viability so important?</p></speech>

The committee heard evidence last week from the masters of the Rotunda and National Maternity Hospital about how we define viability as 24-weeks' gestation.  Some babies can survive if they are born at 23 weeks while some babies born at 25, 26 or 27 weeks will not survive because they are not developed enough to survive.  Among the survivors, there is a high rate of disability.  That is why viability is important.  For example, if a mother develops severe high blood pressure at 24 weeks, we will intervene.  As the baby is viable, we will make every effort to save the baby.  If a woman develops the same degree of hypertension at 20 weeks, there is no point in trying to save the baby because it has zero chance of survival at 20 weeks.  That is the difference between pre-viable and viable.</p></speech>

Dr. Boylan mentioned that this probably is the strictest country in Europe but I believe Poland is a little stricter than are we at present.  I want Europe and the world to realise that Ireland is a safe place to have a baby.  We have fantastic medical doctors and everything else and look after the child and the mother.</p> <p>  There are two people involved, the unborn and the mother.  The point I am trying to make is it is important that the doctor realises he has two patients.</p></speech>

The only thing that keeps us having a low mortality rate is ease of access to termination of pregnancy in the UK.  That, unfortunately, is a reality.</p></speech>

The last thing I want to see is Ireland following suit.</p> <p>  We have a fantastic health system in Ireland and it is a safe place to have babies.  I want to continue that.  I want Ireland to be known as a safe place to have a baby.  Perhaps the Government could do more.  When a woman presents herself to a doctor and does not know whether she wants an abortion or not, the information she gets from the doctor is important.  This is my first time meeting Dr. Boylan and I know he is strong in his beliefs.  If someone went to Dr. Boylan with his beliefs or to another doctor with other beliefs, then we have a problem.  That is my concern.</p> <p>  I am not criticising Dr. Boylan for his beliefs.  In fairness, he has given his honest opinion on every question I have asked.  I am giving my honest opinion that if a woman presents herself, whether she is suicidal or raped, she is dependent on that doctor to give her the information.  My problem is whether the doctor is pro-life or pro-choice.  The woman is vulnerable and we trust the woman but the problem is with the doctor.  Dr. Peter Boylan is strong in his views.  My problem is if the woman went to him or another doctor.</p></speech>

Ultimately, she is the person who has to live with the decision.  I respect the Deputy's view.  I would not be persuading a woman to have a termination of pregnancy and I would not be persuading her not to have a termination of pregnancy.  I would give her all of the information.  It is up to her to make her decision.  That is the role of a doctor as a non-directive counsellor.  One has to respect a woman's view.  One of the functions of a doctor is not to be an advocate of a particular moral point of view when it comes to termination of pregnancy.</p></speech>

The Royal College of Surgeons of England is trying to reintroduce that.  Let us consider the 2016 report.  Almost 60% to 70% of the terminations are done medically.  Only a small percentage will need surgical termination.  I work at St. George's, University of London Hospital.  We offer termination by suction termination.  Late terminations are very rare.  As I mentioned, after 20 weeks a lethal malformation is 1% to 2%.  In such cases we do not really have to look at the foetus and dismember, or something like that, because we use medication, like Misoprostol and other drugs, that can procure the termination without difficulty.  The past practice of traumatic termination is going away.  Mostly, medical terminations are coming into practice.</p></speech>

In future we will have to revamp.  As Dr. Peter Boylan mentioned, there was a stage when the hospitals were giving certain services on contract to private agencies.  As a result, most of the cases went to the private agencies and there were hardly any cases to be trained within the hospital, except a few hospitals like St. George's, which I mentioned.  We retained the services throughout.  That practice will come back again because now those responsible are reviewing the cost.  The cost of providing the services in the hospitals will be far cheaper compared to private agencies.  It is nothing much to do with doctors' personal wishes; in many cases it is to do with how the services are contracted.  I hope it will reverse itself.</p></speech>

However, we have not done a survey of anything like that to see whether it is because they do not want to do it, because they lack training or because the contract has gone.  I will not be able to tease out the reasons or ascertain which is the right reason that fewer people are now keen to offer termination of pregnancy.</p></speech>

During the debate on the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill, the legislation was described at the time as being necessary to provide certainty to the legal profession as to when terminations could be carried out.  In my opinion, we, as legislators, failed to do that with that legislation.  Not only did we fail the medical profession, we failed women in general.  Do all three witnesses agree that we can ill afford to do that again?  Do they agree that a decision by this committee to repeal the eighth amendment would send a clear and positive message to the medical community?</p></speech>

I note that Dr. Boylan mentioned earlier how different people will assess risk, especially woman.  Dr. Boylan gave the example of someone who was trying<i>in vitro</i>fertilisation for years.  She may assess risk differently from someone who may be in her 40s with a family.  Therefore, the views of the woman need to be incorporated into the decision.  Does Dr. Boylan agree that it would be practically impossible for us to legislate for the risk in primary legislation, given those scenarios?  Does he agree that the issue of risk would be best looked at in guidelines or regulation?</p></speech>

Life is untidy and so I do not believe we can legislate for every particular circumstance in human life &ndash; that is simply not possible.  I think it should be a decision between the mother &ndash; the woman herself &ndash; and her care-giver, whether a doctor, nurse, midwife or whoever.  That is the right environment to make that decision because of the inherent variation from one individual's circumstances to another.  I do not think we can legislate for it.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Brien asked about guidelines.  The more we can direct guidelines to the decision being a case of one between the patient and the doctor, the better.  I also think that we should absolutely repeal the eighth, but not put anything else in the Constitution.  Legislation is the place to deal with this.</p></speech>

I was reading through the appendix that the Professor provided.  The issue of counselling came up.  I know that this is an issue some people who are opposed to terminations have raised.  This is the issue of a reflection period or a cooling-off period when a woman decides that she wishes to have a termination.  I note that we have also heard evidence that any delay in providing a termination can also increase risk.  Is it the Professor's opinion that we should never have a situation where there is mandatory cooling-off or reflection period, as some people have called for?</p></speech>

We have to give counselling about the advantages of continuing with the pregnancy and the risk of termination etc.  If she makes the decision and she still wants to proceed with the termination of pregnancy, then that should be final.  There should not be a mandatory two week period of thinking that she might change her mind.  If she says on her own that she needs some time to think about it, that is not mandatory, but that is a different question altogether.  Increasing the gestation causes more complications in terms of terminations.</p><p>She has to wait in personal agony for two weeks.  By and large, we do not recommend that so-called mandatory waiting period.</p></speech>

They are committed, whereas if they were in this country, they would have more time to consider their options and there would not be the panic and the emotional pressure to get on with it and make a decision they might regret when, if they had had more time here, they might have made a different decision.</p></speech>

There is another issue at play.  There is mention in the national maternity strategy of ultrasound, but there has to be a national debate on providing a full prenatal diagnostic service that would include chromosomal testing.  The numbers of women in Ireland who have the opportunity to terminate a pregnancy in the case of a disability as opposed to a potentially life-limiting condition are not yet at the level of international norms for those who have that information.  We are not yet in a position to anticipate what would happen because we do not yet have organised screening services.</p></speech>

The Senator was here for the private meeting.  Many different things were discussed and various people submitted motions.  There was a counter-motion and then a proposal was made.  We are taking a vote on a proposal suggested by Deputy O'Brien.  Senator Mullen knows why we reached this point as we have been discussing this for the past hour.</p></speech>

I have already stated that this is a farcical process and people know my view on this.  We have not had enough time to question witnesses and there has been a whole range of problems.  I think I am entitled to ask whether I am at this point entitled to propose an amendment to the motion, which is that the matter be deferred until all witnesses have been heard.</p></speech>

Senator Mullen and I did not take part in the discussion over the past hour because it was farcical in the extreme.  This now is an even bigger farce.

He has a very good knowledge of procedure and both he and the legal adviser have informed me that the question, "That Article 40.3.3&deg; should not be retained in full", has been put and that we are now to vote on it.  We discussed this for the past hour and this is how we came to this point.</p><p>It is usual in committees that we have a discussion in private before we go into public session.

What matters is that Senator Mullen is not taking on board what has been arranged and agreed every week.  The Chairman asked two weeks ago.  If members felt so strongly about having a motion in, they should respect the fact that we are all putting time and effort into submitting our motions in time.  If they want to submit motions, they need to abide by the rules.  It is not about being in public or private session.  They are coming up with solutions and suggestions while they are sitting there now in public session but they did not have a solution while we were in private session.  Why could they not have suggested, as Deputy Mattie McGrath said, going on and off into private session if necessary?  Why could the Deputy not say that four minutes into the meeting?</p></speech>

I will go through the six options.  Of course, it is not an exhaustive list of options.  Option 1 is repeal <i>simpliciter</i>.  Option 2 is repeal based on published legislation entrenched in the Constitution.  Option 3 is repeal based on legislation published in tandem with a referendum.  Option 4 is repeal and replacement on specific grounds.  Option 5 is repeal and replace on broad grounds and-or expressing a rebalancing of rights.</p><p>Option No. 6 is repeal and replacement with provision conferring exclusive power on the Oireachtas to regulate.  I will allow members approximately five minutes each.  They should indicate if they would like to speak.  The first speaker is Deputy Lisa Chambers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.592" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1336" speakername="Lisa Chambers" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017101800002#KK00200"><p>I welcome the fact that the committee has deliberated at some length and we have reached a broad consensus that the <i>status quo</i>cannot pertain and that at least some change will be made.  We have not discussed what those changes will be yet and we are about to deliberate on those options now, but there appears to be broad consensus that the <i>status quo</i>cannot be maintained.  That is progress at the end of a number of weeks of very hard work on behalf of each member of this committee.</p><p>We discussed at length with our legal advisers the options available to us.  The first option was repeal <i>simpliciter</i>.  The difficulties posed by that potentially are that it may be considered in conflict with the Citizens' Assembly but we are open to reporting in our own right as a committee and that is an option we will consider very carefully.</p><p>I propose to discuss option No. 2, which is repeal based on published legislation entrenched in the Constitution in that the legislation would be drafted and then it would be given a constitutional status.  The difficulties were outlined very clearly to us on that particular option by our legal advisers and the challenges that would present.  The advice to us was that it would be impractical to say the least to have option No. 2 in place because minor amendments or even procedural amendments would require a constitutional referendum, which appears to almost take that option off the floor but we will make a call on that as a group.</p><p>Option No. 3 is repeal based on legislation published in tandem with a referendum.  It does appear that this is certainly one option that is quite viable as it does provide a reasonable approach in that I think it is reasonable to say a lot of people, perhaps the majority, will want to know what will be in place after a potential repeal.  If legislation is to be published, it does make sense that citizens would know what the legislation would be and what the intention of the Government would be in terms of drafting it.  That makes sense.</p><p>Option No. 4 is repeal and replacement on specific grounds.  That would be a situation whereby we would repeal the eight amendment and we would replace it with another constitutional article which would then detail the specific grounds on which an abortion could be obtained.  I believe the intention under that option is that the grounds would be quite restricted.  Again, that posed challenges in some ways.  There would be an interpretation then by the courts in terms of how that would operate and it would require legislation as well.  That option is, again, not without its challenges.</p><p>Option No. 5 is quite similar to option No. 4.  It is repeal and replace on broader grounds, providing a greater degree of flexibility to legislators and to the medical profession.  That is an option we would have to consider in more detail.</p><p>Option No. 6 is repeal and replace with a provision conferring exclusive power on the Oireachtas to regulate.  That would repeal the current Article 40.3.3&deg; and replace it with another constitutional article dictating that the Oireachtas would have the sole power to legislate.  This, technically, is what the Citizens' Assembly called for, but again we have the option to discuss that further as a possible outcome.</p><p>What is very clear is that there are a number of outcomes and options available to us as a committee.  They will be available to the D&aacute;il to adjudicate on and ultimately to the people.  That is the point to be made.  We are doing a lot of work here in terms of trying to compile a report and have the greatest degree of consensus that we can, although I believe there is an acceptance that we will probably not have full consensus among every committee member, and that is reflective of Parliament and the country.  This is not a decision that will be agreed upon by everybody.  In the context of the legal options available to us, it is incumbent upon us as legislators to discuss in detail how each of those options could be catered for, and that will require us then to look at the possible ways we could legislate for each and every eventual outcome.</p><p>In terms of the proposal that was put to the committee today not to retain Article 40.3.3&deg; in full, what that allows us to do is to explore all six options and to decide how best to proceed, but I think there is an acceptance on the part of the majority of members that the <i>status quo </i>cannot be maintained.</p></speech>

I was the first person to propose that we should go into public session when we assembled here this evening.  I think we have seen evidence of why it would have been desirable to go into public session sooner because many members of the committee did not engage in the discussion we had previously.  My understanding is that the Chairman put a proposal that we generally agreed with regard to procedure before we went into public session but we had the opportunity to not agree to that procedure.  The Chairman asked us, and it is disingenuous then to come along in public session and have the opportunity to say why one does not agree with it.</p></speech>

I am making a general point not directed specifically at Senator Mullen.  Unless it is a point of order or a point of clarification, Deputy O'Sullivan has the floor and the same applies to every other member.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.596" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1325" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017101800002#KK00600"><p>The reason I say that is that a number of us here have engaged in discussion in private in good faith to get to a position where we could go into public session.  There are many things that I would have liked to have said in public session that we did agree in private session but I do want to put on the record that I did submit a motion that the committee recommend the holding of a referendum to repeal Article 40.3.3&deg; of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, as did other members of the committee who may wish to state that on the public record.  We recognise that there were other members of the committee who in good faith did not want to have to vote on the issue this evening or this week.  In good faith we accepted that because we do want to reach as much consensus as we can in the committee.  That does not change my position, which is expressed in my motion, but it does mean that we are giving the time we have been asked to give.  That now has to go on the public record because, effectively, there is so much going out in public anyway that we are talking about in private that I do think it is important that we are all able to put our positions.  Clearly, I am not going to push that motion today and we have agreed a procedure.  However, I wish to address the issue of the various options that are before us.</p><p>There are three that deserve consideration, one being repeal <i>simpliciter</i>, which is the first option, and the second being No. 3, which is repeal with accompanying legislation, although I do have a bit of a problem with the title of that which is &quot;repeal based on legislation published in tandem with the referendum&quot;, because the legal advice in private indicates that there would be no legal obligation on the Oireachtas to enact that legislation.  However, I think it is helpful to the public politically if people have some idea what legislation the Government is proposing side by side with putting the question to the people by way of referendum.  The third option which I consider to be worth considering is the sixth option, namely, repeal and replace with a provision conferring exclusive power on the Oireachtas to regulate, but I do have a difficulty with that one because there would be an issue with the public because we would be seen to be taking away the power of the Judiciary and taking the power exclusively into the hands of the Oireachtas.  It is a simpler way to accept what is the constitutional convention anyway that the Oireachtas has the power to legislate once it is within the various articles of the Constitution.  While that is technically the recommendation of the Citizens' Assembly, I do think there might be an issue with it.  That is something we teased out in private and I am happy to put that much on the record.</p><p>We have six options and I think we have made a decision.  I was one of the people who campaigned in 1983 against putting Article 40.3.3&deg; into the Constitution, or at least the original amendment which has subsequently been changed slightly.</p><p>I wish to record my satisfaction that, as a committee, we have at least voted to recommend that it should no longer stand as is.  As soon as possible, we should move to make a recommendation on what would be put to the people and, side by side with that, consider the Citizens' Assembly's various recommendations.</p></speech>

I understand why it can be necessary to have meetings in private session to allow people to, for example, avail of legal advice.  Not everyone has the same legal background or knowledge or people may need issues clarified.  Being able to do that in private session is every member's right.  However, I do not feel in any way bound to communicate my views on procedures or otherwise in private session when those procedures are material to what is going on at this committee.</p><p>I have put it on the record in public, and will happily say it again now, that what has gone on here has been a farcical and cynical process for many reasons: a thorough preponderance of witnesses-invitees in favour of abortion; no time to question people properly; and no distinction in practice between supposed experts and advocates for abortion.  To put the tin hat on it, we have moved to vote on proposing that the rights of the unborn be taken away to some extent or completely.  That is the implication of what was voted for today.  Not only did we do that without a debate among ourselves on its merits, but we did so without even listening to all of the invitees who were supposed to appear before us.  That illustrates just how cynical what is happening is and it makes a nonsense of the Chairman's protestations in private and public that she would be open to considering inviting more witnesses.  Presumably, there are people who may yet appear before the committee who propose that the retention of the <i>status quo</i>is the only thing that would not substract from some people's human rights.  All of that has been set at nought by the pre-emptive decision of this committee without a debate of the merits among ourselves - our only debates have been on procedures - and without hearing from other witnesses.  It would be laughable if what was at stake was not the denial of the human rights of a whole section of our community.</p><p>I am disappointed by the two mainstream centrist parties in particular.  In the case of Fianna F&aacute;il, two members voted to take away in some shape or form the eighth amendment, which protects the human rights of the unborn as well as the mother, and two abstained.  That is a million miles away from what the ordinary members of that party decided at their own Ard-Fheis last Saturday.  In the case of Fine Gael, only one of its five committee members voted against substracting from the human rights of the unborn.  That is a million miles away from where so many of the ordinary membership of that party is.  It reminds me of the famous line from William Butler Yeats:</p><blockquote>The best lack all conviction, while the worst<br /><br />Are full of passionate intensity.</blockquote> <p>What is at stake is unprecedented, namely, the denial of human dignity, or respect for same, for a whole section of our community.  We had a great tradition in this country.  Please God, and regardless of whether people are persons of faith, I hope that the Irish people will vote to protect and include everyone in our society.  What has been decided by the committee's majority tonight is a repudiation of that.  It is shameful in terms of human rights and human dignity.  This is a bad moment for respect for human dignity in these Houses.  It may be happening downstairs in a quiet chamber with not many people listening in, but human rights are being denied in these Houses.  Consider what those who fought for independence for and that the 1983 amendment was a beacon to the world.  To have a denial of all of that without even a debate on the merits among members or hearing from all of the witnesses is cynical and tragic.</p><p>I do not know what we can do now.  What the committee has done is create a situation in which every proposal is bad because it takes away respect for some people's human dignity and implies that some people will no longer have the protection of the law - vulnerable young babies, sick young babies, disabled young babies or perhaps just every young baby who is not wanted or for whom an abortion is sought.  That is a tragic situation and a bad pass for the committee to have arrived at tonight.  I deeply regret it.  Many people in this country will regret what the committee has decided.  Thankfully, the committee will not have the final say.  Nor will the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  The great achievement of the eighth amendment was to take this issue away from judicial and parliamentary elites and give it to the people of Ireland.  I hope that the Irish people will decide to be inclusive rather than exclusive of human dignity if and when this comes to a vote.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.600" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1229" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017101800002#LL00400"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak in public on this matter.  The purpose of the motion that I tabled was to arrive at a situation where we could consider the Citizens' Assembly's recommendations.  Tabling it was important because we were asked to consider those recommendations as part of our terms of reference.  If we had just opted for a repeal <i>simpliciter</i>, we would have had parked the substantive recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly, namely, that Article 40.3.3<sup>o</sup>should not be retained in full, it should be replaced or amended or it should be replaced with a constitutional provision that explicitly authorises the Oireachtas to legislate to address termination of pregnancy, any rights of the unborn and any rights of the pregnant woman.  These were the three substantive issues on which the Citizens' Assembly voted.  Had we supported a repeal <i>simpliciter</i>, we effectively would not have been debating those recommendations anymore and it would have been difficult to move on to its following recommendations in view of the fact that we had rejected them without consideration.</p><p>This is a compromise.  We can still debate the substantive issues and all of the legal advice and options that have been placed before us.  Deputy Chambers and others have gone through them.  Some of them sit uncomfortably with me not only in the context of what they propose, but predominantly on legal grounds.  Entrenching legislation in the Constitution, which was recommended in option No. 2 on a repeal based on published legislation entrenched in the Constitution, would be a dangerous road to take.  While it might give certainty, it gives no flexibility.  We could be tying the hands of legislators and others for many years to come if we opted for the entrenchment proposal.  Even if people just wanted to change a comma, we would have to hold another constitutional referendum.  That option should be parked fairly soon in our deliberations.</p><p>On the broader issue of repeal <i>simpliciter</i>, it allows for the Oireachtas to legislate in its own right and within the confines of judicial oversight.  This might affect the rights of the unborn that are already recognised without being explicit in the Constitution, but we would not know what the effect might be until after the legislation was enacted and subjected to constitutional challenge on grounds of expressed or inherent rights in the Constitution for the unborn, bodily integrity, privacy or the other areas stated in the legal opinion.</p><p>This is probably the option that many people believe would give the Oireachtas the most flexibility to legislate but, once the repeal <i>simpliciter</i>is passed by the people, what do those who are currently proposing it propose in terms of legislation?  This is an important question and people need to be up front about it.  Have they in mind a restrictive proposal in terms of fatal foetal abnormalities, incest, rape or something else?  Will it relate to the health of the woman?  Where do they sit in this regard?</p><p>That is an issue the committee will have to tease out if there is a recommendation for a repeal <i>simpliciter</i>.  It would be disingenuous to propose a repeal<i>simpliciter</i>without setting out in a broad legislative format what one will recommend in the context of a referendum.  The publication of legislation in tandem has been proposed before and tried before.  There is no legal framework that underpins it other than that it would be a political intention to pass legislation if the public changed the Constitution or repealed Article 40.3.3<sup>o</sup>.  That is probably just a political possibility whereby there would be broad consensus as to what would be put before the people by political parties or broad opinion in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There could be no legislative guarantee in view of the fact that very soon after the referendum, there could be an election, a change of opinion or proposed amending legislation.  As such, the draft legislation might be substantially changed.  However, it might give comfort to some individuals to have an opinion as to what they are voting on in the context of repeal.  People should be upfront and honest, individually and politically as parties, if they have an opinion or a policy as to what should be in that legislation.<br/><br/>We have been discussing this issue for quite some time over the past couple of weeks.  We should not be complaining about that, however, because we are charged with a fundamental issue and should take our deliberations very seriously, as all members are doing.  We have a deadline by which we must report.  Whether we make a decision today, tomorrow or next week, we ultimately must report by mid-December.  There is no prevarication on my part.  The motion I tabled was never intended to delay decisions.  All decisions must be made within three months of our first public meeting, which took place in mid-September.  Regardless of whether motions are put down to delay a decision in the context of the modular process, my motion was not put down to delay the final decision, which will be made when the committee has completed its full deliberations.  Some people seem to suggest the motions were put down for prevaricative or even provocative reasons, which was certainly not my intention.  I have never tried to make political capital out of this particular issue since I was appointed spokesperson by Fianna F&aacute;il six years ago.  I wish that to be clear to everybody in the room.  People can look at the views I have expressed publicly in the D&aacute;il and in committees in previous times.  They will see that I have never tried to put other political parties under pressure in this context.  It is too serious and emotive and it deserves that respect from others as well.</p></speech>

I voted not to amend the Constitution because it is not the place to legislate.  That is what is being done.  One is legislating in the Constitution if one includes something in the Constitution.  That has coloured my opinion in respect of the view I have taken.  Like Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, I tabled a motion for a straightforward repeal and that is how we should proceed.  We were told by our legal adviser that there is no such thing as legal certainty, which we all accept.  However, the more legal certainty there is, the less flexibility there is.  We have been cursed by the fact that there has been no legal flexibility by virtue of the fact that we tied ourselves into an article in the Constitution that requires change even for the most extreme situations.  That eliminates for me a number of the options that are put in front of us, which are based on entrenching legislation in the Constitution.  There is nothing else entrenched in the Constitution.  It would be a new departure and it would be the wrong way to go.</p> <p>  While I accept some of the points which have been made, my concern about repeal based on legislation published in tandem is that if it is overly restrictive, the courts may interpret it in an overly restrictive way.  I have no problem specifying that this is an issue that should be embedded in health care.  I will have no problem specifying that when we come to the last phase of the process when we deal with the individual items we recommend be included in legislation.  Option No. 5 on "broad grounds" does exactly the same thing, in that it takes away flexibility.</p> <p>  Option No. 6 is the provision of exclusive powers to the Oireachtas, which is what the Citizens' Assembly recommended.  I note the previous referendum result where it was sought to give more powers to Oireachtas committees.  Changing the balance between the courts and the Oireachtas is not necessarily favoured by citizens.  They like to have that balance and this option is, therefore, not a good way to go.  I am firmly of the opinion that to repeal or not is the option that should be put to the citizens.  That comes down to who one trusts.  We are asking citizens to make this decision.  I certainly am willing to trust women and doctors.  I certainly am willing to accept the decision the citizens will make.  However, we have to be clear and coherent with the question we put to them.  The more straightforward question is the one which is largely expected.  It is open to people to vote "Yes" or "No" to that.  Those are the reasons I came to the conclusions I did on the options.</p> <p>  We decided on a modular approach in July and some of us expected there would be decisions after each one.  I am perfectly willing to accept the honestly-held position of many members that they want more time.  For that reason, I will certainly not be pressing my particular proposal until people feel comfortable with us discussing that.  If that takes another few weeks, so be it.  However, there are people in the room who do not want this put and who want to retain Article 40.3.3o in the Constitution.  I believe they are frustrating the process and that should be called out.  It is not about being in here and being disingenuous.  It is fundamentally about not wanting a repeal or a discussion on it; it is about retention.  Let us just say what it is.  We have heard some discussion of human rights.  Health is a human right and women have a right to have their human rights respected in the context of health.  That is part of the reason I have taken the position I have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.603" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017101800002#MM00300"><p>It is very unfair to say we are making decisions before all of the evidence has been heard and without fully debating the issues.  Most members have engaged very frankly, wholeheartedly and sincerely.  For weeks, we have been listening to the very real difficulties with the current arrangement.</p><p>Dr. Peter Boylan said today that grave harm was done to women, including death.  We know the present arrangement is hugely problematic for women in respect of their lives and health.  The top echelons of the medical profession have told us week after week that they need flexibility and capacity to respond in terms of best practice in medicine in respect of maternity and foetal care.  They claim the present constitutional arrangement does not give them such flexibility and capacity.  The decision we made earlier was not to retain the present constitutional arrangement; that is all that was decided.  Many members are in different places on that issue, which is absolutely fine, but to say we have not debated enough to get to that position is very disingenuous.</p><p> We have had much discussion on the intention of the Citizens' Assembly.  We debated it yesterday with our legal adviser and with Ms Justice Laffoy.  Anybody who reads the transcripts of the proceedings of the Citizens' Assembly and accounts for the voting process will realise it was very clear that the citizens wanted to take this issue out of the Constitution.  There was an overwhelming vote for repeal and a little complication about something being replaced, but we teased that out and it was very clear that the citizens were afraid that the courts might try to tie the hands of the Oireachtas so it would be limited in its capacity to legislate for abortion provision.  We had a discussion on these issues.</p><p> Arising today and every week was the idea that putting anything in the Constitution on such an intimate, private, individual health matter is very problematic in any of its formats.  In that sense, option No. 2, which involves putting specific legislation into our Constitution, is the worst.  In no other case is such an arrangement at play.  If there were technical changes, or otherwise, the provision could not be changed.  The legal adviser said it is completely impractical and without precedent.  On that basis, option No. 2 is really a non-runner.</p><p> We were told option No. 4 would be incredibly legally difficult.  I agree.  It would not be so totally impractical as option No. 2 but near enough.  It would put down woolly grounds in the Constitution.  Again, it is open to wide interpretation.  Option No. 5, which would put in broader grounds, was a little bit more problematic. </p><p> We did make a comparison with the divorce referendum and tease it out.  Regarding divorce, some criteria were put into the Constitution in this regard.  We said in private session yesterday that we have to take into account that the Oireachtas and Attorney General are now considering taking all that out of the Constitution because it proved cumbersome.  The idea of a constitutional referendum to change this is not really practical.  These matters of personal decision-making are really best left out of the Constitution.  That issue was dealt with in terms of options Nos. 2, 4 and 5.</p><p> I agree with the points made that, although option No. 6 was the one chosen by the Citizens' Assembly, it is putting something in the Constitution and is writing out a role for the Judiciary that I do not believe would be welcome .  It is not something that exists in other scenarios.  Generally speaking, the interaction between the Constitution, the Houses of the Oireachtas and the legislation is fairly flexible.  It has worked pretty well.  The courts have been pretty good at interpreting matters when given space in this regard.  Including in the Constitution something that, in effect, is trying to diminish the role of the Judiciary is not a good thing.  It means one is left with options Nos. 1 and 3 as runners.  My belief is that option No. 1, a simple repeal, is the best.  Option No. 3 is repeal while publishing some sort of legislation in order that people might have an idea as to what legislation might look like.  Our legal adviser told us that is really a political matter rather than a legal matter.  It would not necessarily have any legal status but might be a little reassuring.</p><p> A constant theme in all this is that no matter what option we pick, criminalising women who have abortions is completely unacceptable to people.  It arose again today.  I believe the professor put it very well when he turned it the other way and said that, while many people have different opinions on abortion, they would give a very different answer if asked whether they wanted women to go to prison for abortion.  Decriminalisation is an issue we have to address.  It will deal with many of the issues. </p><p> We have made good progress.  There was really genuine engagement by most members of the committee.  I have seen games, however.  Deputy Catherine Murphy is correct that there are games being played here.  We have heard the opening salvos of the referendum campaign in some of the speeches tonight.  It is not something to look forward to.  There are also elements of the media playing games with this issue.  Perhaps, through creating a big, cut-and-thrust divisive debate bringing us back to 1983, it is an attempt to halt flagging newspapers sales.  People are not in 1983.  The committee has demonstrated an ability to listen to impartial evidence-based advice.  We can be adamant enough in making decisions on that basis without other people, inside or outside, trying to goad us on these matters.</p></speech>

I will always stand for the right of both sides in an argument but we are legislators.</p><p>I was in favour of Deputy Kelleher's motion and accepted it in the spirit of where we are going tonight.  This is a very emotional issue for many people.  I was two pounds when I was born.  To me, life is precious, including the life of the mother and the unborn child, but we are not in 1983.  When we examine the evidence of Drs. Boylan, Malone and Mahony, we note a gargantuan question must be put in the minds of all of us: do we keep the <i>status quo</i>, stand still or change?</p><p>Are the eminent medics who were before us all wrong and all saying one thing by way of groupthink?  I do not believe so.  The eighth amendment is a testament to a different era.  It is also about the fact that people can afford to go to England.  Dr. Boylan put across very clearly today that people can afford to go abroad.  A generation of people are looking to us, as politicians, to be leaders.  The human rights bodies have made a decision and rulings on us in respect of the eighth amendment being too inflexible.  Dr. Boylan made it quite clear that Savita Halappanavar, whose anniversary is approaching, would have been alive today but for the eighth amendment to our Constitution.  We may quote the Mellet case, where the State had to make a payment because of the eighth amendment but I fundamentally believe there is no such thing as legal certainty, as Deputy Murphy said and as we heard from the evidence.  Whatever we do as a committee, we should travel with haste in arriving at whatever outcome we come to.  We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity.  The Irish people will decide.  I am sorry Senator Mullen is not present to hear this.  Men and women fought for all of us to vote.  There was a very genuine work ethic in private session and a business-like arrangement.  </p><p>The Chairman has been fair, diligent and courteous.  She has pulled us up and has been assertive when she had to be.  In no way was she unfair to members.  She was impartial and offered all of us an opportunity to put forward witnesses.  Anybody who tries to discredit her or all of us in this room is doing the Oireachtas a disservice.  One of the good things about the Houses of the Oireachtas is the integrity of the public servants, men and women, who work alongside the Chairman.  They do their job to advise us.  The Chairman has been very fair to all of us.  I am glad Senator Mullen is back because I would not want him to believe I was giving out about him in his absence.</p><p>It is unfair to blame the Chair or to be unfair to her because she has been very fair to all of us.  I would like to say that on the record.  We may disagree and I respect Senator Mullen's right to have a different viewpoint from any of the 20 of us in this room.  However, the Chair of our committee has reached out to all of us in a very fair and non-partisan way and in a manner that behoves the Chair.  I would hate for people to think she has not done that.</p></speech>

Senator Buttimer was making a point while Senator Mullen was not here.  In fairness to Senator Mullen, he walked in the door as his name was being mentioned.

I found it very fair and productive.  When I tabled the motion on repealing the eighth amendment and the amendment on the modular process, I had not yet witnessed transformations before my eyes.  I can see when people are honestly and actively engaging with information and witnesses.  I am watching that journey and I recognise it because it was a journey I took not too long ago in coming to a certain position.  It happens especially when one is faced with the mountain of evidence and clear literature such as in the presentations we have seen.  I commend that process no matter how much people who are not in the room right now want to undermine it.  It is amazing what people will say when they come to realise they no longer have a monopoly on setting the moral standard or agenda.</p><p>Deputy Daly spoke about the legal evidence and went through each option.  I am conscious that people at home are not privy to what we are looking at.  We are talking in abstract ways about options one, two and three, for example, so five minutes is not sufficient for those to translate in such a way that people watching proceedings at home will understand.  Now that the evidence has been given and discussed in public, will that legal advice become part of the Official Report in order that people can check what we were referring to when we talk about options? </p><p>I accept we cannot jump straight into the issue of whether people want to repeal, replace or repeal in tandem with drafted legislation.  It has become very clear what is off the table and what is not workable or practical.  Much of the evidence in the beginning was on certainty.  The further we went along, it became evident that certainty is not the most important thing to look at.  We are looking at what is workable and flexible.  Based on what has been said about option two and entrenched legislation and option four which is repeal and replace on certain grounds - I could be referring to the wrong option numbers - it is very clear they do not work.  Whatever we do after today, we should definitely work towards narrowing the legal advice in order that everything is not still floating around in the ether as something that needs to be discussed.  We have already figured out that retain in full is off the table and we do not need to discuss it.  I propose that, going forward, we narrow down the choices in terms of what is practical and flexible in order we are not rehashing this over and over again.  I will not go back into everything that has been mentioned because Deputy Daly summarised the options very well.  I want clarification on whether people who are watching proceedings will have access to the options.  They were in <i>The Irish Times</i>at one stage but I am sure it was a paraphrased version.</p></speech>

The six options are out there.  The Senator made a good point.  If the committee wishes to address it formally, it is an issue for another day.  We should get through everybody's contribution first.</p></speech>

One member referred to 1916 and asked if it is what our forefathers gave their lives for.  The people who fought in 1916, certainly in the case of James Connolly, were advocates of women's rights and I assume would have been open to women having bodily autonomy.  The sands have shifted in society.  People who had a hegemony in the past are now struggling to find anyone in authority who will back up their desire to retain the eighth amendment.  That is the real problem.  We have had a vote on not maintaining the eighth amendment in full and the public should be apprised of the words in full.  That was the wording that was given to the Citizens' Assembly and is quite pointed.  It was not just about retaining the eighth amendment.  One can see how the Citizens' Assembly would have arrived at the decision it arrived at.  It is fine to vote for that but we cannot leave it at that.  We now have to go on to look at the options.  It would be a bit ridiculous to make that decision and then tell the public we will come back and review what we do with the eighth amendment and the Constitution in five weeks.  People are saying we have made a decision but to the public it would be seen as though it were a snail's pace decision.  Why are we here?  We are here because there is a problem with the eighth amendment.  We all knew this was a forward-only process.  It was not a backward process.  Let us not try to pretend this is earth shattering.</p> <p>  I want to deal with some of the options that have been put forward and then some of the motions.  Six options have been suggested by the legal adviser.  Three or four of them are similar in that they still envisage some kind of amendment or replacement of the eighth amendment that would either entrench legislation in the Constitution or list grounds that would be in the Constitution.  There is no legal certainty with those because any of them could be challenged by a woman whose rights are being violated and she could take a case.  The United Nations would continue to challenge it.  It would also be politically unacceptable to most people for us to deal with this issue in the Constitution in a restrictive way when most people see there is a reality we are meant to be dealing with.</p> <p>  The Citizens' Assembly took option six and it was said either in this session or during the private session that we would be going against the Citizens' Assembly if we went for a simple repeal.  That is not the case because the intent of the Citizens' Assembly was clearly to repeal the eighth amendment to allow abortion legislation to be introduced on a very widespread basis judging by the vote it took the following day.  It received legal advice that convinced 53% of the assembly to go in one direction which was that some kind of clause was needed to make sure there would not be a challenge to that legislation.  It went with that advice.  When Ms Justice Laffoy attended the committee, it could have been put to her there was an overemphasis on the dangers of a simple repeal and not enough consideration in the Citizens' Assembly because it is dangerous to put any wording into the Constitution.</p><p>Unfortunately, the option suggested in the wording, although the Citizens' Assembly did not write it, politically would be quite dangerous.  It would mean that any legislation could be immune to challenge by an individual in the courts.  If that were to be put to a referendum, I do not believe that it would be acceptable to people.  Therefore, a simple repeal would be best.</p><p> My motion is still on the table because we need the eighth amendment to be repealed.  I do not think this discussion will be concluded tonight.  I do not know how many people have indicated.</p></speech>

I want to make another point.  We heard a lot about Savita Halappanavar today.  It would have been good if this committee made the decision that the eighth amendment would be repealed before the anniversary of her death.  The Oireachtas has had five years to deal with this.  Although some people say they are not ready, we agreed on 11 July to have a modular structure.  It is a pity that that is not being adhered to, but this is not about procedure.  The first question is why people are not ready.  This has been known about for  years and the Citizens' Assembly reported in April, so people had ample time to get legal advice and to consider the issues.  My fear, however, is that those who are saying they are not ready but in private session are saying that they are in favour of repeal will use the repeal vote to bargain against other things being agreed.  It is not my fault they are gone, but everyone noticed the vote that was taken at the Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis three days ago, which might have had a bearing on people over the last day.  However, I do not think those people are representative, given opinion polls have shown that 10% of people oppose changing the eighth amendment.  Therefore, most people realise that there has to be change.</p></speech>

I do not really understand why people would not be capable of making a decision on this now unless they wanted it to be linked to some restriction which they think will make their vote more palatable.  There are dangers in that.  We should agree on module 1 that there should be a repeal.  Then we should discuss the legislation.</p></speech>

I am particularly proud that it was Sinn F&eacute;in's Deputy Jonathan O'Brien who made the proposal this evening.  It is fitting because I think the republican position would be to repeal Article 40.3.3&deg;.  Unfortunately, I am old enough to remember the original amendment.  I was 17, it was my first vote and I voted against the proposal.  I campaigned against it too and I remember how divisive it was at the time.  I was accosted on a train because I was wearing a "Vote No" badge.  The local postmaster, God bless him, a man in his 80s, chased me with a stick because I left leaflets campaigning for a "No" vote.  I hope the votes next year will not be as divisive.  Despite having a range of different opinions in the room, I am encouraged that most of us have decided genuinely to try to work towards consensus, to build towards the best decision we can make and to work constructively.  That applies to almost all the members here today.</p> <p>  I also recognise that people are on a journey.  Having listened to the evidence over the past number of weeks, there are two possibilities.  One - the outlandish possibility - is that there is a giant medical conspiracy and that all these people got together somehow in a darkened room and decided to unleash abortion on us.  The other is that these medical professionals, whose jobs are to care for women and babies, are telling us the truth, which is that there is a major problem with this amendment.  Senator Mullen referred to a denial of human rights to a whole section of our society.  We had that denial for 34 years.  This amendment was always wrong.  Thankfully, we now live in a changed time.  All of us have to have the courage to continue to work constructively together and to listen to the evidence, which is so clear.</p> <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in also put forward a motion for straight repeal.  That is our position.  Again, as we understand and everyone is in the same place we are, we are happy to work constructively with the rest of our colleagues to try to reach the best decision possible.  Let us be proud of taking one small step today.  This committee is not a farce.  Most of us are working constructively.  I compliment the Chair on the work she is doing.  Those making a farce of it are those dancing outside the gates of Leinster House when they should have been in here listening to evidence.  Let us try to work together constructively.  Let us accept that we will not agree on everything.  Our position is clear.  We believe in a straight repeal.  We have heard enough already in terms of the various options, so I will not repeat those comments.  Today is a good day.  Let us try to make further progress.</p></speech>

As the committee is aware, I was one of the people who preferred to have a vote on any procedural changes at the end, when we had discussed the entire issue, as the Citizens' Assembly did.  However, in order to facilitate the ongoing cohesive nature of the discussion so far, I decided on balance that it was better to do so.</p> <p>  I do not accept Senator Mullen's criticism at all.  In fact, he had an opportunity himself to raise all of the issues that he complained other people did not raise but he did not.  For instance, he could have invoked the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which is not at all silent of the subject and gives myriad areas for him to pursue.  Perhaps he will do that, and I hope he will, to ensure that the committee is not skewed, as he suggested.  He could have invoked the charter for fundamental rights, which refers in a particular way to the issues under discussion here, and he did not.  I would have thought that he would have done it as a matter of course in order to strengthen the case.  He then would not have to accuse everyone else of being pro-abortion or whatever it was that he was suggesting.  Incidentally, I am not in favour of abortion and have never been in favour of it but I realise that certain things have to be done from time to time to address the issues that have become contentious in our society.  I have spoken about them many times in the past.  I know that some people got very excited when I referred to some of those subjects but I assure the committee that I will continue to speak on those subjects, as is my right.</p> <p>  We have not decided to change the Constitution.  We have decided to refer a question to the people.  It is a decision that they alone must make.  The decision we made tonight was to refer to the people a proposal not to retain it in full.  The people can retain it in part or a replica thereof, whatever the case may be.  That is their decision, not ours.  The people will make the decision, presumably, on the basis of having heard all the evidence that is being made available.  Our job is to test the evidence adduced at the Citizens' Assembly and to try to identify the basis on which the assembly came to its conclusions.  Most if not all of the options have been discussed by others so far, and I do not propose to go through them all-----</p></speech>

I have doubts about that because it is loaded with options, trip wires and challenges and I think that will emerge ultimately.  The second option is to repeal based on published legislation entrenched in the Constitution.  There will be a lot of discussion about certain subjects not being suitable for entrenchment in the Constitution.  I hear another debate at the present time in which it is stated that the ownership of the country's water supply should be entrenched in the Constitution.  I find that conflicting.  On the one hand it is a good thing, but on the other it is a bad thing.  Suffice it to say, if we are going to be legislators, we should be legislators and do the job that must be done.</p><p>We must do so having taken into account all the issues concerned and avoid, in so far as we can, anything that is propaganda or what might be politically advantageous at a particular time.

The Chairman is trying to hurry me and I am not in a condition to be hurried at this time of the night.</p> <p>  Option 4, the repeal or replacement on specific grounds, could be a possibility, but I am not so sure.  Repeal or replace on specified grounds and-or explicit rebalancing, the fifth option, has possibilities.  It is something that might meet the requirements of all sides.  Option 6 is to replace the provision conferring exclusive power on the Oireachtas to regulate.  I am concerned about that one, and have expressed that concern previously.  The separation of powers allows for the courts to operate alongside the legislature.  To have a referendum which places a particular piece of legislation outside the reach of the courts, to be entrenched in the Constitution is something I have doubts about.  I do not think that the public would be happy about that either.  Those are the points that I would make at this stage.  I will have more than five minutes to speak in the future, although my five minutes have not been fully used yet, the Chairman will be delighted to know.</p></speech>

We had a very frank discussion in private session on how we should proceed and everyone who expressed a view was respected and listened to, regardless of their position.  It is very unfortunate that some people chose not to express any opinion in private, as is their right.</p><p>The reason I put the proposal forward was because I felt that in order to deal with the options available to us - the very varying options which range from straight-up repeal to putting in a replacement on specific or broad grounds or legislation to be entrenched in the Constitution - it needed further, detailed discussion by this committee in public.  I believe the only way we could have that public discussion on the options was to make a decision not to retain Article 40.3.3&deg; in full.  I am very glad that the committee has done that.  I recognise that does not tie the hands of anyone on the committee to any particular option which is being discussed.  If we can have that discussion in the same comradely and open manner in which we have had all our discussions to date, in which we have been very respectful of each others views, then this committee will be going in the right direction.</p><p>Whatever the outcome at the end of this process, people can say that this committee was not a farce and we listened to all the opinions.  Even today, we had an opinion from Professor Peter Boylan when he discussed the issue of rape and how we could address that.  I made a note of what he said which was that there was a straightforward way of legislating for cases involving rape which was the legal prescription of the abortion pill.  Other witnesses who have told the committee that it would be very difficult to legislate on the grounds of rape.  It is important that we continue to hear the testimony from our witnesses which will frame any decision that we will make on the options.  In order to get there, we had to have that vote earlier this evening.  Senator Mullen knows my position on this.  He talks about democracy but what he tried to do tonight was deny democracy to the Irish people to make a decision on this.  If someone wants to vote in a referendum to retain the <i>status quo</i>, that is their right.  We are giving them that opportunity by making a decision not to retain it in full and to look at the options.  </p><p>I look forward to the committee continuing its work in the same manner as it has done to date.  It is important that we try to reach a decision as quickly as possible now that we have decided that we are not going to retain Article 40.3.3&deg; in the Constitution.  We have the different options before us, my view being that option 1, of straight-up repeal, is the best.  Options 2, 4 and 5 include some form of replacement to be inserted into the Constitution; I do not believe that is where we should deal with women's health issues so for that reason I do not support them.</p><p>Option 6, to insert a provision that the legislature would have to legislate for it, taking it outside the scope of the Judiciary which I feel would be a mistake.  We need to retain that separation of power between the Legislature and the Judiciary.  Option 6 would not be a good option.</p><p>Option 3 is to have published legislation in tandem.  The difficulty with that is there is no guarantee that the published legislation would be passed by the Oireachtas and I would not like to put any published legislation as part of the referendum when there is no guarantee that it would pass through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The best option is straight-up repeal, it is the one that I favour.  I respect that others have not come to that conclusion and they may never come to that conclusion; they may favour another option and that is their right but it is was important to make that decision this evening.  </p></speech>

I think it is a great moment for Ireland, for all the people of Ireland.  One of the members spoke of the denial of dignity for a whole section of the community, I believe they were referring to unborn children.  Women in Ireland have been denied dignity for years now.  I spoke earlier about abstract women, but these are our neighbours, the person serving us in a shop, they are colleagues, nieces, aunts and daughters.  From the outset, in the Citizens' Assembly, there were sections which spoke of it being a predetermined process.  When the result of the assembly came out, they said its recommendations were said to be far broader than anyone could accept, the process was wrong, the way its members were chosen was wrong.  There were arguments put forward, with people asking why there were no people from certain counties when, if one read the process, it was very clear why the process of picking the 99 citizens did not operate on the basis of county boundaries.  Then their arguments moved on to accusations that the committee is biased when things are not going right, and then the witnesses are biased.  Here we are now, we have come to this moment and I commend Deputy Jonathan O'Brien for putting the proposal forward.  Now that we are over that, which is a good thing, we can move on to where we need to be.</p> <p>  Where do we need to be?  The lack of certainty is the issue.  One thing the committee has learned is that there is no such thing as certainty in any of the options put before us; none of them are iron-clad.  Then we must ask which of the uncertainties that may emerge is most readily rectified so that we could ask how we might fix it.</p><p>There are six options and I do not want to repeat everything that has been said already but three, that is options two, four and five, are off the table.  This is because they have legislation entrenched in the Constitution, meaning if there ever was a change there would have to be another referendum.  This is a fluid process and I felt one way last week but another way today but I rule those three options out.  Option three involves legislation and I do not know if we will publish the legal advice but this is a political solution.  We might never put legislation before the people which details what we will do if the amendment is repealed.  Any such legislation could be amended so we have to ask if we would be acting honestly with the people and we would have to be very careful about it.  People could ask if we pulled the wool over the eyes of the people of Ireland in such a context so there remain two options for me, numbers one and six.  I dealt with number one last week but I have thought about it a lot since and I believe option six is still an option.  I have to consider where it came from and we have to tease it out a bit more.  There is a high degree of flexibility with this option and it will come down to whether the people of Ireland trust the Oireachtas to do their will during the legislative process.  In the next couple of months, the importance of who the people put in these Houses will be highlighted.  It is not just about the lad who fixed the road - this is about fundamental human rights, women's rights in Ireland.  It is so important that a person who puts his or her X in the box for their No. 1 choice knows who they are getting if that person is elected.</p></speech>

I have always had my suspicions about bias in this committee.  The overwhelming vote in favour of removing Article 40.3.3&deg; means the genie is out of the bottle.  It is an insult to some of the eminent people who are due to come in and make a presentation to us that we have already decided to do this.  We have dismissed some of the reports of the Citizens' Assembly.  There was a huge geographical area of 11 counties, of which mine was one, which were not represented.  If that is fair you can call me Davy.</p> <p>  The recent Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis brought a new low in cynicism.  The ink is not dry on the motion to retain the eighth amendment but two of that party's Deputies have voted to remove it tonight, or abstained.  The public, however, can see what is going on in the committee and that it is not a question of Senator Mullen and me whingeing.  I wish to defend Senator Mullen's reputation.  He is not in any way trying to subvert democracy.  Many members called for us to go into public session while we were in private session.  We kept our counsel until the public session but why bother?  We knew the outcome.  Deputy O'Connell mentioned the bias and the numbers show this, with 20 out of 26 witnesses to the committee being on one side of the argument.  Up to 16 have come in so far and given their views.  I respect their professional advice but they were all in favour of legalising abortion and removing the eighth amendment.</p> <p>  The question of human rights was raised.  I have just come from the D&aacute;il, where I spoke on the pensions issue.  The Fine Gael Government talks about an Ireland of equal opportunities but mothers who were forced to give up work when they got married and raised their families are being punished.  The Minister for Finance says it is bonkers but he has just delivered the budget, which was supported by Fianna F&aacute;il.</p></speech>

Just because somebody dispenses tablets, or something else, to people it does not mean they have a better right to be here.  The people decide and they will decide in a referendum, if it comes.  As far as I am concerned, the sooner it comes the better and I look forward to it.</p> <p>  The genie is out of the bottle as regards this committee because it is clearly biased.  It shuts out women who have been hurt by abortion and it has shut out advocates whom we wanted to come before the committee.  People have been bullied and harassed to prevent them from speaking on the subject at events in hotels.  I came in here with a three-minute animated video of what an abortion entailed but the committee did not want it.  It is all one-way traffic and our future participation will be limited because there is no point in being part of the committee.  The committee was to be fair and have representatives from all sides and this was its badge of honour but, as I said, the genie is out of the bottle now.</p> <p>  I do not have much interest in the six options that have been put forward but I want to defend Senator Mullen.  He did not want to stop democracy.  We can decide if we do not want to meet in private session.  I appealed for the meeting to be public but the media were locked out.  The media contribute to transparency and openness so why should we do business behind closed doors?</p> <p>  The denial of human dignity to unborn children is anathema to what I stand for.  I am proud of what I stand for and I have plenty of support for it.  We have deadlines and we have said we must finish by Christmas but what is the indecent haste?  We should listen to all the experts.  The Chair said other people could come in but why would they?  We have made the decision to repeal Article 40.3.3&deg; so it is a charade.  There was hostility towards us - it has been a better today - just because we were asking questions to which we needed answers.  When it did not suit certain people in this committee, we were treated like pariahs.  That is no way to run a committee in this House.  I sit on several committees and this does not happen on any of them.  I would love to know why this has to be so different.  Human rights for the unborn have to be protected and I believe they will be protected.  </p></speech>

She has been very fair and it is not easy.</p><p>This is a very complex and divisive issue, we have a large body of work to do by mid-December and there are differing views among the members of this committee.  I will take this opportunity to say there is great value in holding private session meetings.  Some may dispute this, but I think there has been good value in them because there has been consensus and respect for those who spoke on motions to be put forward, for example, to repeal the eighth amendment.  I am not in favour of that at this point because we have a process in which we need to engage and more witnesses to meet.  The vote we took allows us to debate the substantive issues surrounding the eighth amendment, which is crucial.  That is the work we need to do over the next few weeks and the witnesses who will come before us will help us.  It was very interesting to hear members who had views already formed coming into this committee saying they had changed their minds on different issues.  That is very healthy and just shows the importance of this process.  Members feel they might understand a particular area and then they hear from witnesses and, through questioning them, open themselves up and learn more about that area.  That is what is important about this process.  We all have something to learn, and that is the importance of being here and engaging.</p><p> We have received legal advice in private session on the six options we have, and members have outlined a number of issues in this regard.  Regarding the sixth option, when Ms Justice Laffoy was before the committee, she said her view was that the eighth amendment should be repealed and replaced with a provision conferring exclusive power on the Oireachtas to regulate the law in this area.  In layman's language, this would involve repeal of the eighth amendment and the insertion of text into the Constitution stating that the Oireachtas shall have exclusive power to legislate in this area.  As has been highlighted here - and it is very important to say this - members of the Citizens' Assembly looking at these proceedings will ask why we are not taking their views on board.  The removal of judicial oversight would have many implications, and the only other precedent for it would be in times of war or armed rebellion.  We need to look at our three branches of government: the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary.  The intention is that they are all interdependent and that there is a balance of power.  I do not know whether we need to write to Ms Justice Laffoy asking her whether that is her intention.  I think she was seeking some kind of legal clarity whereby the law could not be challenged but I do not think there can be a situation whereby there will not be a challenge-----</p></speech>

These are all issues we need to discuss over the next few weeks.  Is that what people want when the eighth amendment is repealed?  We have much work to do, we have the substantive issues to debate and it is very important we work as we did this evening.  That mixture of private sessions before going into public session has worked.  I thank the Chairman for her work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.668" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1231" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017101800002#SS00400"><p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to speak.  I will not rehash everything everyone has already said.  I am one of the two members who abstained earlier.  I thank all the members who came to the table in private session to discuss the options we have.  They tried to be flexible, to engage with everyone and to listen to everyone's viewpoint.  All the various private sessions have been very helpful to me.  In fairness to Senator Ruane, when she put down her first motion and all that followed, Deputy Kelleher then put down his counter-motion but a compromise was reached this evening to allow the process to move along.  That is thanks to Deputy Jonathan O'Brien for coming forward.  The matter was teased out at length in order to move it forward.  What I will say to the dissenting voices in the room is that it was such a pity they did not engage because there was an opportunity there for their voices to be heard, as opposed to their sitting on their hands and not engaging.  The whole reason of having a private session was that we could have heard all the voices present.  That is what happened during the private session and for that I thank members.</p> <p>  I will be open and honest.  I would have preferred not to have had a vote until the end of module 2 for the simple reason that I wanted as many people to come before me as possible.  I was playing a listening exercise while participating.  Some people have very well-formed opinions, whereas my opinion was not the most well-formed.  At the same time, I have learned an awful lot as the committee's work has come along.  This is why I would have preferred us not to have had a vote this evening.  In fairness to all the 22 members here, we want to see progress.  I want to be part of that progress and feed into it because we need to move forward and know what we are about.  A lot of hard work goes on at this committee.  Many people come with an awful lot of work done in advance, which needs to be acknowledged.  It is unfair to say it is a skewed process and that people have very determined views.  Everyone has a determined view.  Let us be under no illusion.  We all have a well-formed opinion but we must engage in our well-formed opinion and tease it out in order that we have a good result at the end.  Ultimately, the people of Ireland will make a decision as to what option to take, and I look forward to that.</p></speech>

I have full faith in Senator Noone as Chairman.  She is doing a very good job in what is probably the most difficult committee, in terms of topic at least, to be established in a long time.  We will have a referendum next year, and that is right and proper.  We now have pretty much three generations of people who have not had a say on this matter.  The last time there was a fundamental decision on it was in 1983, and it is only right that people have a say.  We need to remind ourselves that we are not changing the law here.  We are going through the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly and we will make a recommendation to the D&aacute;il, which in turn will ultimately make a decision on the question that will go before the people, and the people will make the final decision.  All we are doing is making a recommendation as to the question that should be put.  I abstained because there is still evidence to be given that will help to inform my decision.  The proposal put by Deputy Jonathan O'Brien was timely.  It was not divisive in any way, and this was proven by the fact that 18 out of 20 people were able to take a position on it.  I have not been able to do so yet but I reserve my right effectively to change my vote as time moves on if I so decide.</p><p>I will make a few points about my position.  The criminalisation of someone who has an abortion is fundamentally wrong.  I know this is not part of the referendum <i>per se</i>but I think it is wrong.  I will answer the question put earlier: no one should be imprisoned for having an abortion.  Decriminalisation is different from legalisation, and that is an important point.  I will make an observation on the evidence surrounding use of the abortion pill.  It is effectively freely available.  The safety of it is questionable only because of how it is sourced.  It is effectively a disruptor, and people will have to consider that the evidence appears to show that one cannot enforce regulation to prevent an abortion at ten weeks' gestation or earlier.  Everyone, no matter what side he or she is on, will have to take that into consideration because a law that is unenforceable needs to be very seriously considered.</p><p>I will make just one other observation.  It concerns the second option, which is repeal based on published legislation entrenched in the Constitution.  I practised law in the courts for 11 years.  I have sat in on debates and legal argument that has lasted over an hour on the meaning of a comma, semicolon or colon and how it changes the meaning of a sentence.  It is simply not practical to put detailed legislation into the Constitution.  I think the unintended consequences to come out of that would be phenomenal.  For this reason it is simply not practical.  As I said, I reserve my position in respect of the actual question but that is where I am at present.</p></speech>

My preference is for the motion that we had tabled but which we did not discuss.  It calls for a straightforward repeal of Article 40.3.3&deg;.  Accusations of bias have been levelled at the level of this committee.</p><p>That is what people say when democracy is exercised but they do not get the result they want.  Those interested in getting the most out of the committee should make themselves available and vocalise their opinions for the benefit not just of the cameras and the media but to help other members to learn, to share opinions and come to a collective decision.  The opportunity for people to thrash out any issues they had was in private session this afternoon and most did so.  Those that did do so not chose to air their opinions and I think the word used was "shenanigans".  I would definitely use that word to describe what went on.</p><p> The committee has a job to do.  It made some progress today and made a bold statement that the status quo cannot continue.  During every moment I sit on the committee I become more proud of my parents for campaigning against the insertion of the eighth amendment into the Constitution.  I am resolved to thank them for the work they did, albeit it was unsuccessful but they knew that at the time.  We need to take our steer not from cartoons but from people such as Dr. Peter Boylan who are eminent in their profession and have given their entire careers and most of their adult lives to caring for women.  When Dr. Peter Boylan, as a professional, says the eighth amendment needs to be repealed, we need to listen and start working with those responsible for delivering care to women and trying to make it a bit easier for them.  It is regrettable that those who say they favour repeal were not in a position to support repeal.  However, it is also important that we get an opportunity to ask all the questions that need to be asked.  We will do as much of that as possible in public session and that is important because people are watching what the committee does.  We made a good statement this evening and decided the status quo cannot pertain.  The only way now is forward.</p></speech>

We have received apologies from Deputy Cullinane.  Other members have made it known that they have other obligations.  I appreciate that people are trying to go between this and other committees.  I would like to remind members and others to ensure that their mobile phones are switched off.  This is important as they cause serious problems for broadcasting, editorial and sound staff.</p><p>On behalf of all committee members, I would like to welcome Dr. Peter Rigney, industrial officer with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, to our committee meeting today as we continue our engagement on the future of Europe.  What type of European Union we have in the future is important to all of our citizens and those who live here.  ICTU is very active on European issues and the consequences of EU issues in Ireland.  It is also very active in working with European counterparts within the European Trade Union Congress, ETUC, structure and beyond.  I am sure it has many insights to offer us.  We are all looking forward to the contributions.</p><p>Before Dr. Rigney begins his opening statement, I have to remind everyone of the rules on privilege in the Parliament.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to particular matter and you continue to do so you are entitled thereafter to only qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I ask Dr. Rigney to make his opening statement.  After that, we will open the floor to members.  I welcome the students and others in the Gallery.</p></speech>

Why do we have a European Union?  If we look back to the twentieth century when Europe was laid waste to twice in 30 years we will find that is why/.  One hundred years ago this week, armies were grinding each other down in the muddy fields of Passchendaele, among them many people from Ireland.  As the number of veterans of these wars dwindles -  in the case of the First World War all have died - the collective memory of the founding purpose of the European Union has dimmed.</p> <p>  The founding fathers of the European Union, such as Konrad Adenauer and Robert Schuman, experienced two world wars as adults, with two decades of peace in the 1920s and 1930s like the half time between two halves of a match.  Many people think that the Union, particularly under the Barroso Commission, has been its own worst enemy.  We welcome the attempt by the Juncker Commission to relaunch Europe and social dialogue at a European level. </p> <p>  ICTU has participated in the debate on the future of Europe through the European economic and social committee, which recently held a seminar in the Mansion House in Dublin to discuss the issue.  We also have an input at European level through our affiliation to the ETUC.  We launched an international affiliation in 1973 when we joined the European Union because at that time trade union international politics was tied down in Cold War issues.  When we joined the EU we took the decision to join ETUC because that was where many decisions were being made at an Irish level.  It is often forgotten that one of the first fruits of EU membership for Irish citizens was the decision to do away with the marriage bar on women and introduce equal pay.</p> <p>  There are five options being explored at a European level.  When I was young my very first job was in the Civil Service, and I was advised by a cynical principal officer as to how to get stuff through Government.  He was tongue in cheek to a certain extent, and said normally one lays out three options, one of which is plainly daft, the other of which has superficial attractions but has a flaw and a third which is what the Department wants.  </p> <p>  A number of the five Juncker options are not going to happen such as, for example, carrying on.  There will be change.  It is politically impossible that there will be nothing but the Single Market.  Doing less more efficiently is attractive on the surface, but is probably a flawed policy.  What will probably emerge is some amalgam of options three or four or three and four.  Scenario three, that is, those who want to do more, is code for a two-speed Europe.  There is a debate to be had about that.  </p> <p>  I do not want to talk about how those five choices will be sieved through, rather about our two strategic objectives.  Our objectives centre on the task of restoring the concept of a social Europe and reversing or mitigating some of the policies and European Court of Justice judgments which privilege freedom to conduct business over labour rights.  I refer to the actions of the Troika in some countries and to the European Court of Justice judgments in cases such as Viking and Laval, which were cases taken against Scandinavian trade unions in respect of workers from the Baltic states working there.</p><p>There is a whole body of case law there, but the core of it was that the European Courts of Justice found that the freedom to carry out business had precedence over freedom to protect labour rights.<br/><br/>It would appear to us that President Juncker&rsquo;s proposed European pillar of social rights constitutes a recognition by Brussels that the Union will not survive if it does not re-establish some social credentials with its citizens.  Since 2008 the EU has been seen, for better or for worse, as the bearer of harsh tidings to its citizens.  Much of the pillar of social rights is at present aspirational, but it will evolve as time goes on, and will form a reference point for the development of European social policy in the future.  The two concrete proposals of the pillar are a written statement directive, which will update the previous written statement directive which goes back to 1972.  It will deal with issues around the so-called gig economy and bogus self-employment, and with social security rights for self-employed people, focusing again on aspects of the gig economy and work platforms such as Uber.  It is planned that the pillar will be proclaimed at a summit in Gothenburg next month, and we expect the full support of the Irish Government for this process.  <br/><br/>The other important point for Congress - this may seem a technical point but it is extremely important - is modification of the mandate of the European Central Bank, ECB, beyond combatting inflation. The ECB website informs us that its mandate is: </p><blockquote>&quot;To maintain price stability is the primary objective of the Eurosystem and of the single monetary policy for which it is responsible. This is laid down in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Article 127 (1)&quot;.</blockquote><p>If we step back and look at the mandate of the Federal Reserve bank in the US, we see that it is governed by the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978, also known as the Humphrey Hawkins Act.  This Act specifically instructs the nation to strive toward four ultimate goals: full employment; growth in production; price stability; and balance of trade and budget.  Fulfilling in full all of these four goals all of the time is a tall order, but the debate must start somewhere.  We cannot blame the ECB for carrying out its mandate.  Our attitude is that we have to have a debate on the mandate, and a balanced mandate for the ECB, between combating inflation and the preservation of full employment.  This would provide a balance between the economic and the social.<br/><br/>There is a third aspect, and in illustrating my point I would like to draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to a recent spat between France and Germany on the one hand and the Eastern member states on the other.  France and Germany decided to apply their minimum wage laws to trucks passing through their territory, for example from Hungary to Spain.  The Commission launched infringement procedures against France and Germany.  So far this is a fairly mundane subject.  However, according to a Polish radio website, Ireland joined with the Eastern countries, Spain and Portugal in supporting the Commission&rsquo;s action.  My point is not the subject matter.  I do not automatically say that France and Germany are right.  In industrial relations one must listen to balanced arguments on the other side.  If someone decided that his or her driver would not set foot in France or Germany, would they be expected to be paying higher wages?  The issue for legislators is that decisions are being made in committee in Brussels to modify European legislation.  Do Irish legislators have an input in the process?  In this set-piece case, we have France and Germany versus the eastern countries on the other side.  France and Germany are big players.  Who took the decision that we should pitch in against them?  What were the arguments for and against that?  This is not a matter for me, for unions or employers.  It is a matter for legislators to look and see if there is a gap, to find out who makes the decisions and where the mandate comes from.  <br/><br/>It is difficult to know what to expect, reading the newspapers, but it would seem prudent to prepare for the worst case scenario after Brexit.  In the world after Brexit, Ireland's foreign policy in Europe will have to undergo a reappraisal.  Up to now, if myself or my colleagues were arguing with the Irish authorities over a piece of socially progressive legislation, we would often get the answer, &quot;That is fine, but the British would never favour that&quot;.  Now that the British are gone we are going to have to invent another bogeyman.  We are going to have to form our own foreign policy.</p></speech>

On a practical level, we have to make other allies.  We have tended to work along with Britain at European level.  That will be gone and the balance of power will be changed.  What other blocks will build up in the EU?  There is the Franco-German alliance and the Visegr&aacute;d group, which is the group of new member states.  Where does Ireland fit in all of that?  These are matters that concern legislators, and I welcome the opportunity to put forward the view of Congress.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.702" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1310" speakername="Colm Brophy" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017101800002#B00400"><p>I thank the witness for coming to the committee today and for outlining some very interesting points.  I agree with the witness on certain matters.  The departure of the United Kingdom from the EU will create a challenging environment for us in terms of repositioning ourselves within the member states and the alliances that are formed therein.</p> <p>  The witness raised two points in his contribution which I would take a particular viewpoint on.  He asked the question of where we reposition ourselves and mentioned that Ireland supported some of the eastern European countries on the opposition to the French-German decision in the truck drivers case.  While I am very much pro-European and support the EU and the development of stronger links, we always have to remember that at the end of the day countries are sovereign states within a confederation of sovereign states.  What France and Germany are doing, in my opinion and in the opinion of all other Governments apart from their own, is adopting a protectionist position.  It is not designed to protect workers' rights but to protect their own businesses and transport companies by effectively putting companies which operate from a lower cost base out of business.  Unfortunately, sometimes in this country our media and some commentators are inclined to take a viewpoint which is very much to the detriment of Ireland in terms of advocating support for policy positions being advocated by bigger EU member states who effectively, under the guise of appearing to be benevolent, are actually trying to re-tilt the playing pitch to suit their own very high cost economies in some ways.  </p> <p>  One of the more central points is how the European Central Bank behaves in its key core policy.  We have to remember that it comes from the original German Central Bank.  The original position - still fresh in Mr. Rigney's contribution - which drove Germany into a war was hyper-inflation and the collapse of a currency.  For Germany to come into the new European currency it needed those reassurances.  Regardless of German reassurance, the American Federal Reserve, in dealing with the world's strongest currency, has much more latitude in how it develops policy than the ECB has.  Central to all economic growth within the euro region is the ability to show that the currency is stable, particularly against the risks of inflation.  That is why I would be very cautious about moves to weaken the position of the ECB and its charter in terms of how it would tackle inflation.  </p> <p>  I fully agree with the view of Congress that other factors need to be taken into account to aid job creation, to create a buoyant economy and to fund the types of social services that people want to see, but for me that is a role for national governments working co-operatively with the commission to develop the correct economic policies, some of which are not in play.  I would caution against dragging the ECB into that area, because fundamentally, if we undermine the strength of the currency, everything else we do will have little or no impact.  </p></speech>

The deadline is March 2019.  That is the date when the British MEPs will physically leave Brussels according to the arrangement that has been entered into.  That will be a major change because there are between 75 and 80 British MEPs in the European Parliament.  It will also be a major change from our point of view because as a former Minister of State with responsibility for trade I was involved in the Single European Act and our allies were the United Kingdom, as we were theirs in terms of derogations because at that time we were not ready, for example, to have an open economy in trade but such things have developed.  It is most regrettable to say the least that the British are leaving.  I am just back from the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly in Liverpool where we had deliberations and we brought forward a paper on the preferred option on the Border post-Brexit as far as the UK and Ireland are concerned.  All those issues have been well thrashed out already.<br/><br/>Ireland's position on Europe has changed since the troika and the European Central Bank were involved in very dubious activities during the 2007 to 2008 period when we were given enormous loans and we carried the can.  The question was whether we should have burned the bondholders and just walked away from the situation but we did not.  The standing of Europe, as such, has been reduced since that.  What happened at that particular time heralded a major change in Ireland.  Many good things were achieved by our membership of the European Union, including the removal of the marriage bar and equal pay, which strangely enough did not seem to filter through to RTE.  RTE has operated a regime of unequal pay between men and women for so many years.  It is unacceptable to say the least that of two people presenting the news at 6 p.m. on television one is paid perhaps &euro;60,000 less than the other.  RTE must not have realised that equal pay applies to it.<br/><br/>There is no appetite here for a federal Europe.  Mr. Juncker and others are pushing towards a federal approach whereby there would be one Minister for Finance and other issues would also be dealt with centrally.  I am happy with the <i>status quo</i>.  We developed the Single European Act and we worked together in harmony but if there is any move to try to undermine in any way our 12.5% corporation tax we could not and would not accept that Europe would have any responsibility for setting the level of tax throughout Europe.  That is something successive Governments have been adamant about.<br/><br/>As far as the present situation is concerned we accept that it is more than likely, but it is not guaranteed yet, that the United Kingdom will be gone if various changes occur.  We are not sure yet but there is no doubt we are moving in that direction.  The European Union should proceed with the expansion of Europe in relation to Montenegro, Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina.  That region could do with the stability of being a member of the European Union and would replace one with three.  From an Irish point of view we should be at the forefront of supporting the applications of those countries because, as was mentioned, they will be the allies we will require in the new Europe after Britain leaves.<br/><br/>The future of Europe is bound up by Brexit and it will be a different Europe.  It will be a less inclusive Europe if the United Kingdom eventually leaves because the UK has played a very important role.  We joined together in 1973 and we have been together for that period.  It is leaving and we are staying with the 26 member states and we are negotiating with the United Kingdom although we are conscious that a bad deal for the United Kingdom is a bad deal for Ireland.  We are in danger of being affected by collateral damage.  I was in Brussels recently and there seemed to be an attitude towards the United Kingdom that it must pay for its treachery and disloyalty to the European Union but we could be affected by collateral damage.  Most of the other 26 countries are not that worried about us.  We are worried about ourselves but I do not see much concern in Estonia, Latvia or other countries about our unique position whereby there is &euro;1.2 billion in trade per week between both countries.  We are big customers of each other.  It is a major step forward.<br/><br/>I am encouraging British companies to relocate some of their plants to the Republic of Ireland, in particular in the west in order that they would have access to Ireland West Airport Knock, ready access to the markets and a guaranteed access post-Brexit to Europe.  If tariffs are applied then the United Kingdom can prepare in advance.  The same will apply to some Irish companies who will have a continued foothold in the United Kingdom by arrangement and agreement and by virtue of making investments there.  It is a reciprocal process.  We must ensure that we look after our interests.  Our interest lies in staying with the major European countries but that we can attract enterprise from the United Kingdom in terms of parts of their companies to the west.  We are and will be the gateway to mainland Europe.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Rigney here this afternoon.  I will follow on from the final point made by my colleague, Senator Leyden, namely, Brexit and encouraging enterprise and new companies into Ireland.  A critical part of that is investment in infrastructure.  We have raised it time and time again and it was raised last week during the budget speeches and will emerge again as the various Bills pass through the House.  Senator Leyden is correct that we must aim to relocate business into the midlands and into the west and north west but in order to do that we must have a road infrastructure, proper broadband and access to rail services, roll-on-roll-off facilities and airports.  It is hugely important in that context that we should see this as an opportunity to invest in what is required to attract foreign direct investment into our country and have companies set up here.</p> <p>  When we talk about the future of Europe does that create some level of uncertainty and instability because we are aware of what has happened with Brexit?  Senator Leyden has outlined that the United Kingdom is standing back a little now and has changed its timeline as it has become more aware of the significance of the change to it as well as to everybody else, not to mention the direct relationship between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Who knows what will eventually happen?  Does continued talk about the future of Europe increase instability and uncertainty for those who are anti-Europe, who probably started the entire conversation on day one in the United Kingdom?  Those who led the campaign are no longer to be seen after all the promises were made with no substance behind it.  Does that give oxygen to people in other countries with similar agendas to try to push the anti-European agenda from which we and other countries have benefitted?  I would like to hear Mr. Bergin's thoughts in that regard.</p> <p>  A point was made earlier about the financial crisis, which was an international one.  The views of Irish people changed somewhat on Europe because of the lack of support that came through and the hard lines that were taken.  We know what created the problem and how international factors contributed to it but help and support to deal with the issue were not forthcoming and as a result we were left to carry the can on our own.</p> <p>  Does Mr. Bergin believe that the discussion on Europe is driven by the media, which cherry-pick the stories to suit their agenda?  Have they given rise to a vacuum which has resulted in a discussion on whether parts of Europe are bad rather than taking a holistic view and a balanced approach?</p></speech>

I am just going through the written submission he made.  I was in Brussels last week where we spoke about the future of Europe.</p><p>I was mindful of the fact that a youth group had appeared before the committee some weeks earlier.  Their focus was on social rights, a European Union that would move slightly away from an over-concentration on funds, banking and the like towards protecting citizens' rights.  Bearing this in mind, the European Union was not kind to Ireland or Greece during the recent banking crisis.  We could argue all sides of what did and did not go wrong.  Recklessness on all sides led to the collapse of banks all around Europe.  However, I believe the European Union was not very helpful to Ireland.  Ultimately, we have pulled ourselves up by our bootstraps and, with due respect to the Government, it has done a good job.  We are coming back towards full employment, which is to be cherished.</p><p> We talk about price stability.  One of the issues that concerns me greatly about the European Union is that we appear to be able to arrange a single market for items such as beef or milk, but we cannot do so for the drugs industry.  There is a marked difference in what I pay for my tablets in Dublin and what I would pay for them is Spain.  I know people who take what they call their drugs holiday.  They bring their prescription to, say, the Canary Islands and bring back a year's supply of the drugs they use.  The Single Market is failing in that regard as we have not brought all industries within it.  We must work towards achieving that objective.  Given the size of the European market, the European Union should negotiate with the major pharmaceutical companies, rather than Ireland, Portugal, Spain and the other member states doing so individually.</p><p> As we approach Brexit there is much talk about hard and soft borders and whether Britain will leave with or without an agreement.  There are approximately 1.5 million people living in the northern part of this island who are entitled to dual citizenship, Irish citizenship or British citizenship.  They can choose which of them they want to have.  There is the Good Friday Agreement, every aspect of which protects all of the things that concern us.  It protects trade, North and South; the movement of people, rights and access to the European Court of Justice.  When we talk about negotiating with Mrs. May through the European Union, we should hold firm to the Good Friday Agreement as being the bottom line, with anything outside it being considered unacceptable to Ireland.  Anything outside it will simply mean that the European Union cannot facilitate an agreement in that regard.  There is a major vacuum in the political system in Northern Ireland.  The politicians need to get their act together and represent their communities.  In recent days I have seen articles in the newspapers speculating to the effect that perhaps we might park the Northern Ireland issue, move on to dealing with the trade talks and address the Northern Ireland issue somewhere in them.  My view is that unless we solve the Northern Ireland problem before we enter the trade talks, there should not be a deal with the United Kingdom.  It is as simple as that.</p><p> My next point relates to workers' rights.  I am glad that the European Union is taking a position in moving towards the protection of workers' rights.  Perhaps there should not be a single hourly rate for the same job in different countries, but if one is working in Ireland, irrespective of one's geographical point of origin, one should be paid the same rate for the job in Ireland as an Irish citizen would be paid.</p><p> My final point relates to those us involved in politics.  When we negotiate something in Brussels with the European Union that we do not particularly like to pass on to the public, we bring it home and say Brussels has told us that we have to do it.  We must get away from that approach.  We must start to take responsibility for the negotiations we enter into and the agreements we bring home.  Irrespective of which party is in power, it must be a case of saying, "We went to the European Union; we had meetings and negotiated; and this is the outcome which we have accepted."  In that way the body politic in Ireland would be taking responsibility for it.  We should stop trying to push everything towards the Commission which need not necessarily dictate to us.</p><p> I thank Dr. Rigney for his time and again apologise for being late.</p></speech>

I will start with those made by Deputy Colm Brophy.  </p> <p>  On the mandate of the European Central Bank, I accept that it is built into the DNA of the Germans that their great-grandparents or grandparents lost their savings in the big Deutsche Mark inflation of 1923 or 1924 when one virtually needed a wheelbarrow of money to buy a loaf of bread.  However, that does not mean that we cannot have a debate on having a balanced mandate for the ECB between inflation and full employment.  That is the reason I am glad to have this debate with members.</p> <p>  With regard to German and French truck drivers - I note that as the French ambassador is due to appear before the committee, its members might ask him about it - as a negotiator, I find that it is always great to be reasonably consistent.  I presume this issue was discussed at the transport committee.  It does not apply to us in respect of foreign truck drivers crossing Ireland.  We have said at the transport committee, with regard to the rail package, that this is an island nation and that as our track gauge is different from that in the rest of Europe, it does not apply to us and that we have no view.  It does not do our image any good if suddenly, with regard to road transport, we say we support the Visegr&aacute;d Group.  Again, it is a matter for debate.</p></speech>

He talked about forming alliances and the necessity for Ireland to have its voice heard in a number of alliances.  In terms of the changing position we will have to adopt, we should not sit out simply because things do not impact on us directly at the time.  The logical end of that argument is that by the time member states do things that will impact on us, there will be no one left to help us in our argument.  Therefore, I cannot agree with what Mr. Rigney said in that regard.</p></speech>

My point was not related to truck drivers' wages but to the positions taken by Irish representatives in Brussels.  Where does the Oireachtas have an input?  Truck drivers' wages was an example as much as anything else.</p></speech>

First, I agree that this is increasingly becoming a yawning issue in Brussels.  The view among some members states is, "The UK is gone; Godspeed to it and we will get on with our business."  I was at a meeting of the executive of the European Trade Union Confederation, ETUC, approximately three months before the vote took place in Britain.  A motion was brought forward to try to be helpful to the pro-Remain position of the Trades Union Congress, TUC.  Certain large member states which shall remain nameless were not exactly helpful and I had to row in and point out that we needed support for the motion, word for word.  Incidentally, I subsequently regretted the wording as almost every use of the phrases "Great Britain" and "United Kingdom" was incorrect.  In any case, let us not underestimate the number of people on the European mainland who are utterly indifferent to the departure of the other island.  However - this is important - bad things can happen, can happen very quickly and have unintended consequences.  </p> <p>  In Senator Terry Leyden's county of Roscommon there were coalmines that were thriving in the period from 1940 to 1945.  Suddenly, against all the odds and the written assurances of the Secretary of the Department of Supplies who was also named Leyden, the British decided to cut off exports of quality coal.  We had an existential crisis.  Some 82% of our natural gas comes down a pipeline through Scotland.  We have a common electricity market with Northern Ireland.  We assume and hope no bad things will happen, but assumptions and hope are not enough to guard the well-being of citizens.</p></speech>

However, there are several problems.  First, what does the southern-most ex-republic call itself without provoking the Greeks into a fit?  Second, how do we deal with Kosovo?</p></speech>

How do we deal with that?  Then, how do we deal with the Kosovo issue?  The Serbs feel badly done by and feel they were set up.  These are political issues.  By and large, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions does not take a view on accession matters &ndash; these are political matters.  At a broad level of principle it is difficult to make an argument that if a country of the former Yugoslavia fulfils membership requirements, it should not enter into some sort of dialogue with the Union.</p></speech>

Arguably, Greece should never have been let in to the euro.  People knew at the time that it would not be prudent to wager a month's salary on some of the figures being put up.  I remember being in Greece at the time on union business.  I was a member of the board of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training in Thessaloniki.  I remember landing in Thessaloniki Airport during the Balkan wars.  Planes were dispersed.  There were fighter planes on the ground, because a live war was under way up the road.  There was a political reason that Greece was admitted to the euro.  It was to show the western Balkans that there was a beacon of stability in the area, that is, the EU and the euro.  There were probably some dutiful civil servants in the EU who said that the Union should not allow it because of the sums, but the politicians decided that was the way they would go.  Politics trumps that.</p> <p>  Senator Leyden and Deputy O'Rourke referred to another point.  I met a man from Ireland who met a man from Germany who was party to a meeting in Frankfurt with Bundesanstalt f&uuml;r Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht or BaFin, the German banking regulator.  BaFin representatives were meeting some people who were keen to flee the City of London.  The BaFin representatives said to them that they wished them luck going to Dublin, because Dublin did not have the necessary housing, infrastructure or people.</p></speech>

Committee members should bear in mind that we operate in Northern Ireland as well.  There will be companies that will move to the South, and some already have.  Some Irish companies will move operations to the North or to Britain.  Other companies will close.  Let us consider the mushroom industry.  It was decimated almost the week after Brexit because of the adverse effect of sterling changes.  There are big issues at play.</p> <p>  Let us consider it from a regional point of view.  One of the things we should be doing as a counterweight to Brexit is to sell twin towns with a cross-border element.  Examples include Newry and Dundalk as well as Letterkenny and Derry.  We should say to people that they could have a base in the EU here and, only a bicycle ride up the road, they could have a base in the UK as well.  That may be a useful way of doing it.</p></speech>

From 1940 to 1952 no one from any part of Ireland could enter any part of Great Britain without an identity card.  People did not fly in those days.  On the routes from Rosslare to Fishguard, D&uacute;n Laoghaire to Holyhead and Larne to Stranraer, there was a man on each side &ndash; they were all men &ndash; and people had to produce a little card with a photograph on it.

I welcome His Excellency to the committee.  Ambassador Crouzat presented his credentials only last month so, on behalf of the committee, I am delighted to welcome him to Ireland.  I had the privilege of meeting him a number of weeks ago and I enjoyed our engagement that day very much.  It was very practical, sensible and informative, and we got to know each other very well.  I thank him and his secretariat for their time that day.  All EU member states are equal.  While we all need an equal voice in this debate, President Macron has made some interesting interventions recently, so we are very interested to hear Mr. Crouzat's presentation.  Before we proceed with the ambassador's opening statement, I wish to remind everyone briefly again of the rules on privilege in this Parliament.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I welcome the ambassador again and invite him to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

First, I would like to express on behalf of the French Government and the people of France my deepest condolences to the families of the victims of Storm Ophelia.</p><p>Our sympathy goes to all those who have suffered because of this storm.  France stands ready to help with the recovery efforts.</p><p> Thank you very much, Chair, for your invitation to discuss the future of Europe.  I congratulate you and your committee for putting this crucial topic on the agenda.  I am very  honoured to be given the opportunity to present to you my authorities' contribution to this debate.</p><p> I will start with Brexit, which is a very pervasive issue, particularly in Ireland.  That is understandable, because Ireland is on the front line.  The British people have made their choice.  We regret it, but we respect it.  The 27 member states are negotiating in a unified manner and with clear principles.  The conditions for the withdrawal of the UK from the EU have to be well drawn out before we can agree to discuss the terms of our future relationship.  France will stand firm to maintain this unity and solidarity of the 27, in particular regarding the Irish Border.</p><p> Brexit however, must not deplete our energy.  As my President has said, "The Union with 27 member states must be stronger than an EU with 28 member states minus one".  The EU needs to go forward.  President Macron has put a new European ambition high on his agenda.  He expressed it with vigour, first in Athens, then in his speech at the Sorbonne on 26 September.  He affirmed two convictions that have guided his actions since the beginning of his presidency.  The first is that in an unstable world, only Europe will allow us to exercise our sovereignty and be fully in control of our destiny.  The second is that the European project can only succeed if we bridge the gap that has grown over the years between peoples and European institutions, to the extent that nationalism and populism may threaten our democracy.  We cannot afford to keep the same policies, the same habits, the same procedures and the same budget.  Neither can we choose to turn inwards within national borders.  The only way to ensure our future, is the rebuilding of a sovereign, united and democratic Europe.</p><p> The proposals that the French President has made are set out in a specific period of time.  First, 2019, when the European elections will take place and, second, 2024, which will be the timeframe given to the next Commission.  This is the timeframe for rebuilding Europe.  I will try to sum up in a few words some of President Macron's proposals which he set out in an hour and a half.  I promise I will be shorter.  The first is a sovereign Europe.  The French President has set out six keys to European sovereignty.  The first is a Europe that guarantees every aspect of security: be it in the area of defence, with the swift implementation of the European Defence Fund and permanent structured co-operation, and a European intervention initiative enabling us to better integrate our armed forces at every stage, be it in the fight against terrorism, where Europe needs a European intelligence academy to ensure closer ties between our intelligence services, and a European public prosecutor's office for organised crime and terrorism; be it in civil protection, where Europe needs a common civil protection force, pooling our resources for rescue and intervention, thus enabling us to respond to disasters.</p><p> The second key to European sovereignty is a Europe that addresses the migration challenge.  We need to create a common area for border management, asylum and migration, in order to effectively control our borders and receive refugees in decent conditions.  We need to create a European asylum office that will speed up and harmonise our procedures.  We need to gradually establish a European border police force that ensures rigorous management of borders.</p><p> The third key that the French President has set out is a Europe looking to Africa and the Mediterranean.  Official development aid needs to be increased.  My President has announced that France will commit to increase it to 0.55% of GDP by 2022.  What we propose at a European level is to relaunch the project for a new European tax on financial transactions to finance this policy.  All of its receipts would go to official development aid.</p><p> Fourth, is a Europe exemplary in sustainable development.  We need to fix a fair price for carbon, one that is high enough to ensure the energy transition, at least &euro;25 to &euro;30 per tonne.  We need to develop electric interconnections to make the European energy market function more efficiently.  Our bilateral project - the Celtic interconnector - makes complete sense in this respect.  We also need a European border carbon tax, to make sure that our manufacturers that are most exposed to globalisation are on an equal footing with competing companies from other regions that do not have the same environmental requirements.  Europe needs to establish an industrial programme to support clean vehicles and the required infrastructure such as charging stations in particular.  It needs to ensure its food sovereignty by reforming the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, with two important objectives, namely, protecting us from volatile global markets that could threaten Europe's food sovereignty and promoting the major European agricultural transition and giving countries more flexibility in organising their regions and sectors.  Our recent debates on glyphosate and endocrine disruptors have proven the need for European scientific assessment that is more transparent and more independent, with better-funded research so that risks can be identified and alternatives proposed.  We must also establish a common inspection force to guarantee food safety for Europeans, tackle fraud, and ensure compliance with quality standards throughout Europe.</p><p> The fifth key is a Europe of innovation and regulation adapted to the digital world.  Europe needs to establish an agency for breakthrough innovation, jointly funding new fields of research, such as artificial intelligence, or those that have yet to be explored.  It needs to ensure equity and confidence in the digital transformation, by rethinking its taxation of digital companies, and regulating the major platforms.  We propose to tax the value created, where it is produced, which will allow us to overhaul our tax systems and to stringently tax companies which relocate outside of Europe for the specific purpose of avoiding tax.</p><p> The sixth key is a Europe standing as an economic and monetary power.  We need to make the eurozone the heart of Europe's global economic power.  In addition to national reforms, Europe needs the instruments to make it an area of growth and stability, including a budget allowing it to fund common investments and ensure stabilisation in the event of economic shocks.  This budget must be placed under the strong political guidance of a common Minister and be subject to strict parliamentary control at European level.</p><p> The second issue put forward by my President was a united Europe.  First, there would be concrete solidarity through social and tax convergence.  We need to encourage convergence across the whole EU, setting criteria that gradually bring our social and tax models closer together.  Where tax is concerned, we need to define a "corridor" for corporation tax rates.  We cannot have such disparate corporation tax rates in the European Union.  This is why we would like to see a binding rate range that member states must commit to ahead of the next European budget in 2020.  Compliance with this corridor would determine access to the European Cohesion Fund.</p><p> In social affairs, we need to develop true social convergence and gradually bring our social models closer together.  We need to guarantee a minimum wage for all, adapted to the economic realities of each country, and regulate social contribution competition.</p><p> The second key for a united Europe is culture and knowledge.  Creating a sense of belonging will be the strongest cement for Europe.</p><p>We need to step up exchanges, so that all young Europeans spend at least six months in another European country, 50% of each age group by 2024, and that all students speak two European languages by 2024.  We need to create European universities.  Networks of universities that enable students to study abroad and attend classes in at least two languages.  In high schools, we need to establish a process of harmonisation or mutual recognition of secondary education diplomas, as in higher education.</p><p> The third point my President pointed out related to a democratic Europe.  There is a need for debate and this is why we propose democratic conventions.  For six months, national and local debates will be organised in 2018 in all EU countries that volunteer, on the basis of common questions, in the run-up to the 2019 European elections.  The Irish experience in this regard will be sought, and will be very helpful.  </p><p> I refer to strengthening the European Parliament with transnational lists.  We propose, starting in 2019, to use the quota of seats of departing British MPs to create transnational lists where people vote for the same MEPs throughout Europe.  At the following election, as many as half of the European Parliament could thus be elected on such transnational lists.</p><p> What does the French President envision for Europe by 2024?  He envisions a European Union founded on common democratic values that are non-negotiable, values where there can be no two-speed Europe; and a European Union founded on a simpler and more protective single market, along with an overhauled trade policy.  This EU, if it enables ambitious differentiations, could gradually expand to include the western Balkan countries.  That will require reform of EU institutions, with a smaller Commission, downsized to around 15 members and in a few years&rsquo; time the UK will be able to find its place, if it wishes, in this EU refocused on uncompromising values and an effective market.  Within this EU, those who want to go further and faster need to be able to do so unhindered.  Co-operation will always be open to all, based on the sole criterion of the level of shared ambition, with no predefined format.</p><p> All states which share this ambition can take part in the launch of a group for overhauling Europe.  This group will include representatives of each participating member state and will involve European institutions.  Until summer 2018, it will work to clarify and propose measures that will implement this ambition, drawing on the debates held in the democratic conventions.  Theme by theme, the tools required for the overhaul will be examined.  We hope Ireland will join in this reflection process.</p><p> I thank the Chairman and the distinguished members of the committee very much for their attention.  I look forward to our discussion.</p></speech>

We appreciate that.  We have discussed some of the items the ambassador brought up.  The committee has the opportunity to give its views on some of the issues the ambassador raised.  I call Senator Neale Richmond.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.743" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1399" speakername="Neale Richmond" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017101800002#K00300"><p>I am delighted to welcome the ambassador, not just as a proud member of the committee but also as the convenor of the French-Irish parliamentary friendship group, something I hope will develop even further in the coming weeks and months.  The reason I hope that develops further and I hope we have more of these engagements is that closer Franco-Irish relations are absolutely vital in the post-Brexit era.  For so long we were that friendly country behind the UK.  We are no longer that country.  We need to work more closely with all our continental partners, but particularly France, a country which we have such a lengthy history with both culturally and socially.  There are many key areas where there are opportunities for co-operation between France and Ireland in the next few years.  First among those has to be the Brexit negotiations.  It is absolutely vital that the European side, behind former French Minister Michel Barnier, remains united.  I absolutely reject suggestions made by certain political leaders over the weekend that the Irish Government should circumvent that process and go directly to Whitehall, or 10 Downing Street.  That goes against the good faith of the Brexit negotiations that was agreed by all 27 remaining member states.  Ultimately, if the Irish Government were to proceed with that, it would only create more bad faith among the remaining member states.  That would be highly detrimental to us going forward, so I hope that we can continue with this united approach.</p> <p>  However, there are other key areas that we can remove from the Brexit debate and I want to move on from that.  First and foremost, a key area of co-operation is energy security.  The Celtic interconnector between France and Ireland is vital.  I am really hopeful that the foreshore licence for the landing in Cork can be granted quite soon.  Both EirGrid and R&eacute;seau de transport d'&eacute;lectricit&eacute;, Rte, are working very closely on that.  The Irish Government cannot stress enough how important we believe that is and how much the continued support of the French Government, although there is  competition with sites in the UK, would mean to us and how much it would allow us to continue to stay committed within Europe, knowing that we have that level of energy security coming from the Continent.</p> <p>  I will go into some of the points His Excellency raised on behalf of President Macron in a second.  The reform of the CAP is of vital interest.  Ireland and France have a continued close relationship in this area since Ireland joined in the 1970s.  It is something the great Irish taoisigh who embraced the European project, both Garret FitzGerald and Charles Haughey, were very keen to push during the 1980s and it stood to Ireland, Europe and France.  I hope reform can be continued, making sure that food security, food safety and food quality is maintained as well as ensuring that our producers get the prices they deserve and that we look cautiously toward the Mercosur region when that trade deal is agreed.</p> <p>  I have mentioned the cultural ties, the depth of which do not need to be repeated, especially the historical ones.  One aspect tying into what President Macron said in regard to the youth of Europe and developing the linguistic abilities and the educational abilities is promoting programmes that exist like ERASMUS+.  I have very few regrets in life but one I have is that I turned down the opportunity to do ERASMUS in Toulouse in 2003.  I would like to think that I made up for it by travelling ridiculously extensively during my student years and doing a stage in Brussels but it is something that still gnaws away at me.  My friends who did it are the ERASMUS generation.  Some of them met their wives or husbands and some of them have a level of fluency in the language of the country they visited.  It is that immersion and exposure that will allow that linguistic skill to be developed.  France is the country that Irish students go to the most.  It is something that needs to be maintained.  However, Ireland is underperforming.  Our third level institutions need to be a lot more proactive with their French counterparts, looking at the various institutions where projects' work can be combined.  In my previous life on the Committee of the Regions I visited Le Mans and the university there to look at a really in-depth project in relation to energy supply when it comes to heating and the use of sound.  That was a Horizon 2020 funded project.  The Government has welcomed the fact that we have drawn down &euro;475 million but I honestly believe we are still underperforming in that regard.  Our third level institutions really need to look beyond the UK going beyond past 2020 when this programme expires and France is the obvious next step.  The Irish College in Paris is there for a reason.  It is a really obvious example.</p> <p>  I refer to the remarks of President Macron.  I do not know if I should say this but I read the section in The Economist over and over.  The intervention by President Macron, as a committed europhile, was really welcome.  We saw a leader of a government in Europe speak about the European project, the European dream.  For me it is very much an emotional thing as well as a fiscal and boring bureaucratic thing.  To see someone speak for over an hour and a half was amazing.  That was badly needed, it was really heartening and there was much to agree with in terms of the overall sentiment and the boost of enthusiasm.  I cannot underline how timely that intervention was when we see the rise of petty nationalism in this country, be on the left or the right, in the ambassador's own country and across Europe.  I mention the Austrian election results at the weekend.  To see the electoral mandate given to the French President on a avidly pro-European platform is something that can only be of benefit to the Union as an entirety.</p> <p>  However, and there is always an however when it comes to these things, the vision of federalism portrayed by Emmanuel Macron, while worthy, is very much a French vision of federalism.  Perhaps by its nature it is, therefore, more beneficial to some of the larger states.  There are key areas of this federalist vision that I agree with.  As I mentioned, education, linguistics and overseas development aid elements are areas where we need to see greater co-operation.</p><p>I was in Uganda a couple of weeks ago visiting Irish Aid projects.  The list of EU member states donating to every project dwarfs anything else in the world.  The retrograde decision by President Trump to cut US aid will only put the responsibility on the collective European Union projects, but also the projects of the individual countries.  We need that overseas development aid for selfish and selfless reasons.  The selfless reasons are pretty obvious; it is the right thing to do.  The selfish reasons are that these will be our trading partners.  This is how we stem the flow of refugee and excess migration by addressing the key economic and military issues, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p> However, there are areas which I am going to flag before I hand over to a colleague.  I refer to the idea of transnational MEPs.  I understand it, appreciate it and I quite like it.  I am a proud member of the European People's Party, and when I sat on the Committee of the Regions I did not necessarily sit on it first of all as a member of D&uacute;n Laoghaire&ndash;Rathdown County Council.  I sat as a member of the delegation of the European People's Party.  It works to an extent.  There is, however, this base level of nationalism that we cannot throw away from our inner being.  If we look at the way President Jean-Claude Juncker was elected in the Spitzenkandidat method, it makes sense to those who have the list system in their elections.  It went completely under the radar in Ireland.  I remember Martin Schultz, the socialist candidate, came to Dublin and he might as well just have been a tourist from Germany.  No one knew who he was and what he was doing.  Try explain that process to countries like Ireland and Malta that have very different electoral systems and try throw transnational MEPs into it.  Ultimately, when the people elect our MEPs from the island of Ireland they look at the person.  We elect a lot more independents than any other member state because of our electoral system.  People look at the party and where people are from.  I remember a slogan used by one of my own party members demanding that Cork had an MEP.  We are a long way from transnational MEPs if the good people of Cork think they merit an MEP over anyone else in the 27 member states.</p><p> The idea of bringing down the College of Commissioners from 28 to 15 has been tried before.  We - I say "we" because I was part of the referendum campaign - lost a referendum campaign in this country and that, more or less, was the key issue.  Can one imagine a College of Commissioners without a French or German Commissioner?  It cannot happen.  However, one can imagine one without an Irish Commissioner, a Luxembourger Commissioner or a Slovenian Commissioner who come from the smaller member states.  Even though the portfolios are diluted, the College of Commissioners, like the Cabinet in this country, agrees and acts as one.  They abandon their national identities when they become Commissioners and they take their brief, as has been seen with our current Commissioner, but the key thing is that they bring that individual choice.  The opinion of an Austrian Commissioner is just as valid as the opinion of a Danish one and it bring a very different mindset.  I know where that is coming from but it will not work.</p><p> I refer to the citizens' conventions.  I worked on the citizens' dialogues during the EU Presidency we hosted in 2013.  They were a good idea, and I said that when the Commission started this debate on the future of Europe, but ultimately Europe is brilliant at telling people how they can give out about Europe.  Europe paid eurosceptics for 20 or 30 years in order to allow them destabilise the project in the European Parliament, be it the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy group or the European Conservatives and Reformists group.  One thing Europe is absolutely terrible at doing is selling itself.  It is about getting signage on roads, plastering a massive European flag on it and saying something was funded by EU funds.  One should not get into the specifics as to whether it was INTERREG funding, structural funds or Horizon 2020 research into biomass and pond life.  One should just stick a flag on the signage, claim it and make sure people know that we have something to thank those bureaucrats, who come up with 75% of our indigenous legislation, for.</p><p> Senator Craughwell mentioned in our previous session that we have a great tendency as politicians just to blame Brussels for everything.  Even today &euro;475 million was announced in Horizon 2020 funding.  One would swear that the Minister of State responsible had delivered it himself.  There was no acknowledgement that this was a European project.  That is far more important than discussing Europe and appealing to the intellectual abilities of a very small sector that will have the time, the ability and possibly the wherewithal to contribute to such conventions.  Let us go on a European roadshow and let us get a few decent sales representatives out there.  The diplomatic corps is brilliant but sometimes there can be too many draughtspeople and not enough sales people.  That is something that Europe needs if it is to really engage people and remind people of my generation, who have no recollection of the Second World War, what it was like to travel pre-Schengen or use pesetas rather than euros in Spain.  We must remind people and sell them on EU projects.</p><p> I have left the controversial issue on which we are going to disagree to the end.  I refer to transnational taxation and say "No thanks".  It is not in the interests of the smaller member states.  I can see why the ambassador's country would want it, but that competitive edge would be removed from a small island in the Atlantic with 4.6 million people and with an economy that is still in the incubator after the worse economic crash since 1929.  To say that a company can come to Europe but that it will pay the same corporate tax, whether in a country with a population and workforce the size of Germany or in Ireland, kneecaps the smaller member states.  Although the focus is on Ireland, some of the Baltic states and eastern and central European states have adopted flat tax models and so on.  It affects many more people.  We have to repeat it time and again that the Franco-German obsession with Ireland's corporation tax is not helping the European project.  If France wants Ireland not to follow its near neighbour and archaic ancestral tie out of the European Union, the last thing it should do is attack our corporate tax rate.  It gives the eurosceptics an excuse they do not have, namely, to say that maybe Ireland would be better off outside of the European project.</p><p> Chairman, I have gone on way too long and I apologise.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.748" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1390" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017101800002#L00500"><p>I agree, Chairman.  How does one follow that?  As always on European affairs, my colleague, Senator Richmond, is very much on the nail.  I fully agree with his point on the need for Europe to find a good public relations company and to stop allowing people to knock Europe constantly.  I refer to the eurosceptics or the clowns that brought about Brexit, and I make no apology for calling them clowns.  During one of the great announcements they had they said they had succeeded in getting a Brexit vote.  As the camera pulled away from the spokesperson, it focused on a little sign on the wall, which said this building had been funded through the European Union or whatever.</p> <p>  We need to understand that decisions made in Europe are made by a collective.  They are made by the Councils of Ministers and the European Parliament.  We have representation on the ground and we need to support it with a far better public relations machine than we have at the moment.  I agreed with Senator Richmond on that.</p> <p>  My vision of a Europe of the future is very much is in line with the youth of Ireland.  That is a Europe that is more socially aware and a Europe that is more in touch with the citizen on the ground and less concerned with the economics, although I appreciate that if one does not keep an eye on the pounds, shillings and pence, to just keep our British friends in the equation for the moment, the European project will fail.</p> <p>  We are now moving into a very dangerous time because we are losing one of the major contributors to the European project.  Everywhere one looks there is demand for more funding.  Everybody wants more funding and we are going to be working with a much tighter budget.  We have some serious challenges ahead.</p> <p>  I very much appreciate the ambassador's views on Brexit and the support that is indicated in his document.  However, there has been some discussion recently, because of deadlock and the inability to get the British to move on, that maybe we should park the Northern Ireland issue and bring it back during trade talks.  I would hope that the French Government would say "No" and that the Northern Ireland issue must be solved before we engage in any trade talks.  That has been the position of Europe until now and I sincerely hope that is its position going forward.</p> <p>  The European Union has an obligation to protect 1.5 million people who are entitled to Irish citizenship and who will be geography separated from the European Union following Brexit.  That is the 1.5 million people living in Northern Ireland.  We have met small business people in Northern Ireland.  One particular haulage company comes to mind that has 100 trucks on the Continent and six people working in a tiny village in the very north west of Ireland.</p><p>He has had one of his main contracts for many years.  He was called over to Holland to meet with the contract company and he was told that from March 2019, it will no longer be able to use his company because of Brexit.  This is the truth behind Brexit and this is what it will bring to the people in the North of Ireland.  This man is going to relocate his business to the Republic of Ireland and there will be a loss of six jobs.  Six jobs is not a whole lot but in a tiny village, the loss of six jobs possibly affects 30 people and has a detrimental impact on the local economy.  That is something we have got to watch. </p><p> I agree with the witness said that Europe must be stronger going forward with 27 than it currently is with 28.  It must be stronger, not as strong as it is currently.  That is really important.  I am a little concerned that some of the big brothers, Germany and France, are inclined to be a little blas&eacute; about the future of Europe.  The attitude seems to be, "Everything will be fine, as long as you do it our way".  We have to move away from the notion of trying to centralise Europe.  My colleague, Senator Richmond, mentioned the word "tax".  If one wants to see the Irish scurry from Brussels, keep talking about tax.  France does not exactly tell it as it is where corporation tax is concerned.  It has various different rates and outs.  Let us just leave the tax issue where it is, and let us not scare the horses in this part of the country. </p><p> The ambassador mentioned defence and the phrase "integrate our armed forces".  Ireland has long claimed to be a country with neutral status and there is no way on God's earth that the Irish people would agree to any form of European army.  However, the second part of that paragraph of the ambassador's speech deals with European intelligence and closer ties between intelligence services.  I have been calling for some time here in Ireland for the appointment of a director of national security because I believe that throughout the European Union, as is true in the UK and USA, if we are to defeat terrorism, we must do it through intelligence and good policing.  </p><p> One of the things that baffles me is that there is a great move towards a European army.  Having been a soldier myself, we all have a lot in common.  We wear green uniforms and we drive big, heavy vehicles; one's right arm will always have a rifle or machine gun at the end of it.  Policing is different and I cannot understand why there is not a greater emphasis on policing and the establishment of a proper European intelligence service.  That organisation should be integrated with the United States intelligence services.  The days of land wars or terrestrial wars are gone.  We now fight wars through information technology.  Cyberspace is probably the most dangerous place in the world to be right now.  Some 40 companies a day are attacked in Ireland.  If one wants to build European defence based on what we in Ireland would call security, I think we would get full co-operation in Ireland.  If one wants to build a European army, however, with all of us wearing boots and green uniforms, driving tanks and armoured personnel carriers, one simply will not get that past the Irish people.  If Europe is going to have some sort of security service, then all 27 must be members.  It cannot be opt-in or opt-out, so we have to find a security system that does not involve the appointment of an army.  </p><p> The ambassador spoke about the migration challenge.  I have visited Pozzallo in Italy and I have been involved in the migration issue for some time.  We are not going to stop the migration issue by putting up borders.  All they will do is find other ways around and keep coming.  At the end of the day, people are desperate.  They are living in the most horrendous circumstances in North Africa or parts of Bangladesh, India, the Middle East or the Far East.  They all have TV sets.  They sit down to watch the television and they see what appears to be a very luxurious lifestyle in the West.  Who can blame them for wanting to come?  The Irish have made an entire history of people travelling to other parts of the world for a better life, so who can blame them?  However, Europe must take a stand. </p><p> Europe has stood idly by where corporations are concerned.  In this country, we had a major t-shirt manufacturer in Donegal and a sportswear manufacturer in County Meath.  The firms relocated, in the first instance to Morocco and in the second instance to China.  They went there because labour was cheap.  They could pay 20% of the cost of labour in Ireland.  The products have not become cheaper at the shop-front in the high street, so we must assume that these companies are making super-normal profits.  If one wants to talk about tax, that is where we should be going after them.  Instead of forcing unfortunate people to take this horrendous trip across the Mediterranean, we should be investing in North Africa.  I do not mean through some of the cowboy regimes there.  We should have non-governmental organisations, NGOs, on the ground who will build schools and develop infrastructure.  We should be encouraging our companies to locate in Africa, but we must distribute the profits they are making.  The ambassador made a point about the information technology business, and how firms can locate off-shore and avoid taxation.  We need to look at that very carefully.  </p><p> The ambassador mentioned that every country should have two languages at least.  I was quite taken aback some time ago in Helsinki when I was being brought around a school by a 12 year old boy.  He stopped, looked at me and, in perfect English, said: "I am terribly sorry, Senator, I forgot to ask you.  How is Ireland coping with the crisis?"  I looked at him and asked him, "Which crisis is that?", and he replied, "the economic crisis".  I said "Well, we are recovering slowly", and he said: "I thought that, I heard that".  I told him his English was extremely good and he thanked me.  I asked him whether English and Finnish were his only languages but he said, no, that he also spoke Russian and Swedish.  He said he had a little German, but his German was poor.  If ever I felt an absolute idiot standing beside a 12 year old, I felt it that day.</p><p> We have a problem in this country with the teaching of languages.  French has been taught for many years in a textbook style, similar to what one will find in the teaching of Irish at second level.  I disagree with my colleague, Senator Richmond, on third level.  I am very proud of our third level institutions and the efforts they put into delivering language-based programmes.  However I would encourage the ambassador to take a leaf out of the German Embassy's book and start promoting the language directly in schools.  It had a roadshow going around the country, encouraging teachers and bringing them into the family, as it were, by organising exchange programmes for them.  It is still going on, if I am not mistaken.  I have called for teachers in training in Ireland to spend time abroad.  If I was training to be a teacher of French, then I would go to France for the second part of my training, while trainee teachers in France, who are hoping to teach English, would come to Ireland.  The European Union is about sharing that sort of resource.  I would really like to see something like that done. </p><p> I know that I am pushing my luck here, Chairman, but there are one or two other things that I wanted to mention.  I agree with my colleague with respect to transnational elections.  What is the French government at?  The ambassador knows well that with the French and German populations, others would be squeezed out of the parliament in no time at all.  If something like that were to be done, it would require some sort of weighting system.  Being honest about it, as Senator Richmond said, the people of Cork would have a huge problem with not being able to elect their own Munster-based MEP.  Let us leave well enough alone, and that also applies to changing the structure of the Commission.  We really cannot play with that.  It really spooks the horses in this country and feeds the anti-Europe attitude.</p><p> The final issue that I want to mention is the Single Market.  I have been watching the Single Market since we entered the European Union, and we seem to have been very good at putting pricing structures in place for many things.  One of the places we have failed miserably is in the pharma industry.  I mentioned earlier that quite a lot of our older citizens now go to the Canary Islands once a year to fill their prescription for the entire year.  I was talking to a man recently who told me he buys his entire year's supply of blood pressure tablets for &euro;11.90 in Spain, in the Canary Islands.  The same drugs cost him &euro;120 in Ireland.  Where is the Single Market?</p><p>The pharmaceutical companies are being offered a population of how many millions of people in Europe but we force Ireland to negotiate on its own.  We need to take a position in every single part of the market where we are talking about delivering to an entire community; we do it for beef and milk, so why not do it for drugs?  The big pharmaceutical companies have all of us scared.</p><p> I apologise for throwing so much at the ambassador but I really appreciate him coming here.  It is great to have our friends from France here.  I look upon them as big brothers or sisters who are here to help us go forward.  My big brother used to make me polish his shoes, so I hope they do not end up with similar ideas.  Let us be equals.</p></speech>

There are already very close ties between France and Ireland in a traditional and historic sense.  We will continue that relationship.  I also appreciate the sympathy expressed for Ireland because of Storm Ophelia, which caused devastation and three deaths.  There was enormous damage and tragedy, and it is certainly very unusual for us to have such weather conditions.  It was the worst storm for 50 years and we are grateful that France is prepared to help in any way it can to restore energy and power in the south in particular.  We extend our sympathies to France on the atrocities caused by ISIS in France, which have been dreadful.  I have been to Paris numerous times and I suppose it has changed life in a sense.  Paris is a beautiful city and the atrocities committed there and elsewhere are totally unacceptable.</p> <p>  President Macron's speeches have been radical.  He is young, enthusiastic and new to the job.  I agree with most of what my colleagues have said in that regard.  President Macron has said the Union with 27 member states must be stronger than the Union with 28 member states.  That is fine and the European Union, EU, must go forward, even in the difficulties post-Brexit.  The United Kingdom has played a very important role in Europe since 1973.  I was a Minister of State involved with the Single European Act and the British played a very important role with all the other members.  Wherever it raised concerns about the future, it was given complete support.  A vote was never taken in the negotiations for the Single European Act and Britain was not isolated or made to feel other than 100% welcome in the European Union.  We all realised that but the message was never conveyed to the people in the United Kingdom about what exactly it contributed to the Union and had achieved while in the Union over the past 40 years.  There was a breakdown in communication but we are where we are and we must move on.</p> <p>  Neutrality is very special to Ireland.  We were neutral in the Second World War.  If our people wished to participate, and it was mainly on the allied side, they did and they played a very important role.  From the State's perspective, we were neutral and this neutrality was the biggest issue for us with the Lisbon and other treaties.  We got the guarantees and the treaties were approved eventually.  Any question of a European army will not wear here.</p> <p>  There are more practical matters, such as the Celtic interconnector, which is very important.  I know the ambassador will work to ensure it comes about.  It will be a guaranteed supply for Ireland on the periphery of Europe, an island off an island.  There is a major project from the Caspian sea, a pipeline to Europe that is progressing very well.  It is a $45 billion project led by Azerbaijan, with the pipeline coming straight through Greece to Italy and into Europe.  It will mean Europe will not be dependent on Russia for natural gas in future, which is very important.  One cannot rely on one particular state with certain political considerations, such as those with Ukraine, especially if the pipeline goes through unstable regions.  It is a move in the right direction and the Celtic interconnector is very important.</p> <p>  A common finance Minister is definitely not on and we must protect our 12.5% corporation tax.  We are the most peripheral of all parts of Europe, an island beyond an island.  The state of the island between us and mainland Europe means we must look to get the best possible link to our major markets in the European Union.  It is a very serious matter from our perspective.  The attractive tax code has brought about great economic development in Ireland.  There is the idea of reducing the number of Commissioners from 28, or 27 in a while, to 15 but it is an example of matters that would not really go down very well here at all.  It would be rejected.  Any proposals would have to be implemented only by agreement and treaty change.  Treaty change is taken very seriously.  The next time, there will be no second treaty vote when the people speak.  I believe the Lisbon treaty allowed states to leave but I am not sure what would have happened if the UK was not allowed to leave.</p> <p>  The ambassador is welcome in Ireland and we wish to keep very close to France.  The French President has made radical suggestions and he is very pro-European.  Other people have different views and we must respect all of them.  We seek French support in the negotiations, particularly with regard to our position, the Good Friday Agreement and the possibility of a customs border between the North and South of Ireland.  These are our current concerns.  I made it clear at the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly in Liverpool on Monday and Tuesday that we are with the 27 remaining states.  We are very anxious for the UK to get a good deal, as a good deal for it will be a good deal for Ireland.  I made it clear that we are with the 27 as far as the negotiations go.  It is vital that the deal will be good and not damage Ireland, even in a collateral way.  The danger is if there is hostility in the negotiations with the United Kingdom, we will suffer the fallout.  We want a good deal that will bring freedom of movement North and South and into the United Kingdom.  There is goodwill in that regard.  We also want good access to markets through better investment from the European Union.  We want more support and not less from the European Union after Brexit.  If the Union wants to keep countries that will be affected, as we will be, it must provide more support for the development of our ports and airports, as well as access to the mainland European market.</p></speech>

Some members were missing today.  It would be helpful to all of us, as I am sure members would agree.  I do not wish to be rude but I ask the ambassador to keep his concluding remarks as condensed as possible because some members are under pressure this evening, as I am sure the ambassador is as well.</p></speech>

There could be much to discuss but I will try to make these comments very short.</p><p> I heard the Deputies' comments on Brexit.  They can rest assured that France considers the Northern Ireland issue to be of key importance and will not proceed to the next phase if it is not satisfied that the issue has been addressed fully.  We need the views of the Deputies on this matter and are very keen to hear what they consider to be the right time to move forward.  France is very committed to the unity of the 27 member states.  It gives its full support to Michel Barnier and understands Ireland does likewise.  In this respect, our countries are completely in line. </p><p> I hear the views of the Deputies on defence issues.  France is very willing to push ahead with Permanent Structured Co-operation, PESCO, and European defence fund.  It hears the concern that there should be no European army, but that is not the issue at stake.  We have to make the most of what is already contained in the treaties in order that the European Union is able to move forward.  We know that Ireland has been very active on Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, issues.  It is represented in Mali, for which France thanks it again.  It has been very helpful.  We also know that Ireland has much experience in international peacekeeping, with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, and on the Golan Heights.  Our countries have good reasons to talk bilaterally because France is also very involved in these issues.  There is much to discuss and to agree to on the issue of defence.  </p><p> Dealing with the challenge presented by migration is very important to France.  It is why it is so interested in developing European aid for Africa.  Senator Neale Richmond was quite forceful about the fact that we should invest in Africa.  France completely agrees and supports many development projects.  I will mention one, in particular, the African renewable energy initiative, AREI, which is so important for the development of the African energy sector.  France is investing &euro;2 billion in the project on a bilateral basis.  </p><p> On language issues and the exchange, we share a belief in having a multilingual Europe.  I am very happy that there are so many French students participating in Erasmus programmes in Ireland.  There are 2,000 French students in Ireland at any given moment, which fosters the many links between our two countries.</p></speech>

It is a huge project, costing &euro;1 billion.  It is hoped the European Union will participate financially in it.  It has already contributed to the development phase - the European Commission provided &euro;8 million - and there is hope this &euro;1 billion project will be carried out with European Union funding.  It is very important strategically for Europe and bilateral relations.  It is important for Ireland and France because it will help Brittany which seeks a source of energy.  If it can be assured that it can get energy supplies through Europe, from Irish renewable energy supplies, that would be wonderful.  It will also incite Ireland to develop its renewable energy sector which is very important for implementation of the Paris climate change agreement.  At 700 megawatts and with a 500 km long undersea connection, it is a major project.  In my time in Ireland I will work to make sure it is at the top of France's agenda.</p></speech>

France and Ireland have a difference of opinion on the issue.  France believes we should discuss it.  Its Government has announced that the current corporation tax rate, 33.3%, will go down within the next five years to 25%.  Convergence with Germany's corporation tax rates is the aim.  France believes we should reflect on the issue of convergence.  It is not talking about a unified tax code.  It understands fully that the tax issue is decided on the basis of unanimity and that nothing will be imposed on member states, but it wants to put the issue on the table within the EU framework.  It believes that if there is not a level playing field, there should at least be a system under which countries can compete.  The issue will be on the table.  I can assure the committee that the French authorities are quite keen to push this forward.  France understands the specificity of every country.  It is not a question of having a flat tax but rather of convergence.</p> <p>  I again thank the Chairman and the distinguished members of the committee.  I am grateful to have had the opportunity to make this presentation.</p></speech>

We have a difficulty in that the Minister has to go to a Cabinet meeting at 9.45 a.m.  We will allow the Minister and Mr. Tony O'Brien to make their opening statements and then take some questions from party spokespersons initially to allow the Minister to respond before he has to go.

The reality is that there is an additional Cabinet meeting today.  In an effort to get straight into the meeting, I do not propose to go through my opening statement.  We can take it as read.  This is my first opportunity to acknowledge in the Official Report the incredible work of our health service staff and management in the HSE in recent days in terms of dealing Storm Ophelia, and managing to keep our hospitals and community health services staff during an extraordinarily difficult time.  I wish to acknowledge the heroic efforts of people working in and planning for our health service in recent days.  I am very happy to take questions.</p></speech>

How much of the winter initiative planning will be based around the fact that the HSE will have additional resources from 1 January onwards?  Will there be the ability to increase capacity for the number of weeks which are very pressurised in our emergency departments?  One can almost predict that the first Tuesday of the new year is chaotic in every emergency department across the country.  Will the additional resources allow the HSE to enhance capacity and plan more efficiently for emergency departments in early January than heretofore?  The Chairman asked us to be brief.</p></speech>

One relates to the 1,800 additional staff announced in the budget.  Given the failure thus far to reach any of the targets which were set - the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, said recently there were only 13 additional staff - do the Minister and HSE have another plan?  It is to be hoped that if so it is not just a restatement of whatever is currently being done because clearly that is not working.  I would like to know where the staff are coming from and what the recruitment plans are.</p> <p>  My second question concerns children with scoliosis.  There are 68 children with complex medical needs, whom we have discussed.  Can the Minister and HSE confirm that agreements have been signed with the two additional hospitals in Germany and England and that there is a plan?  I do not believe any of the 68 children have been assessed as yet by the hospitals with which the agreements have been signed.  I do not think they will be treated by Christmas, although I hope they will.  Perhaps the Minister and HSE could comment.</p></speech>

It appears that the capital programme will be eaten up by the children's hospital.  Will there be provision to progress the maternity strategy, which I have spoken about numerous times?  The mid-west is waiting for a couple of million euro just to keep things ticking over and cannot seem to get funding.</p> <p>  I note the internal letter on opening up the new accident and emergency department in the mid-west.  However, by the looks of it the HSE is very upset by performance levels there.  The hospital population ratio in terms of those ages over 65 and 70 is very high compared to other areas, which might explain the situation.  Things are still at crisis point given the fact that Ennis and Nenagh were closed and the proper process was not put in place over many years to ensure Limerick could deal with the number of patients coming into it.  The Minister and HSE might reflect on that.</p> <p>  I refer to the process for the alignment of CHOs with hospital groups.  I would like to hear comments on the court case between the HSE and HIQA regarding Ennis.  My question on the winter initiative was taken up by Deputy Kelleher.  Is there any progress to date on the GP contract?</p> <p>  I presume the Minister is going to honour the dates he has spoken about it regard to orphan drugs, about which we have and many debates.  That should kick in next month. </p></speech>

There will be additional capacity.  There are a number of new units referenced, including the opening of step-down beds for Beaumont, the development of Our Lady of Lourdes in Drogheda and additional beds in Galway, to name but a few.  There is also a significant emphasis on home care packages, social care and transitional care beds.  In terms of funding for the winter initiative, while there is an allocation for 2018 there is also an allocation for now.  As Deputy Kelleher knows, we received an additional &euro;40 million for this year, of which &euro;30 million will be spent on winter pressures and access issues.  The remaining &euro;10 million will be spent on waiting list initiatives.  Next week the HSE will meet all CHOs and hospital group chiefs to hear about their plans.</p> <p>  I will ask the HSE to comment.  Rather than Dublin telling hospitals what they must do, this year it was very much a bottom-up approach.  CHOs and hospital groups were asked what they planned on doing and what they would take accountability and responsibility for delivering this winter.  We will provide the committee with more details when Mr. O'Brien comments.  </p> <p>  Deputy O'Reilly is correct.  Recruitment and retention continues to be a major challenge in the health service.  That does not come as a surprise to any of us in this room, regardless of our political persuasion.  </p> <p>  Yesterday the Cabinet took a very important decision in terms of phase 2 of the Public Sector Pay Commission.  As the Deputy will recall, all health sector unions and representative bodies who balloted their members on the new public sector pay agreement voted in favour of it, many by an overwhelming majority.  They did so on the understanding that, in addition to the public sector pay agreement, there would also be a phase 2 which would examine the specific recruitment and retention challenges in respect of certain sectors. </p> <p>  The Public Sector Pay Commission did not accept that there was, in general, a recruitment and retention issue across the public service, but said there was one in regard to elements of the health service.  I am very pleased that the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and the Government moved very quickly on this yesterday.  The deal was only ratified in recent weeks, and phase 2 of the commission can now commence.  Health will be a particular focus, and rightly so.  Ms Mannion might comment on the HSE perspective in terms of the current position regarding recruitment and retention.</p> <p>  The figure of 13 is somewhat of an outlier for a variety of reasons.  There has been an increase in the number of nurses in the system.  The Deputy is correct in that recruitment continues to be a challenge.  Phase 2 of the Public Sector Pay Commission is part of the additional response.  The Deputy said she did not want to hear me saying the same thing.  Phase 2, which will examine the recruitment and retention challenges in the health sector, is very welcome.  It will have an objective look at what we need to do to make sure we keep our workforce here in this country. </p></speech>

That has come after years of our nursing graduates having to go abroad because there were no jobs in this country.  Measures are being taken now.</p> <p>  Nursing organisations and I would agree that there is a need to do more.  In order to do more, we need to do things on an evidence basis and with an objective examination of the recruitment and retention challenges.  That is why the Government decided yesterday to progress with phase 2 of the Public Sector Pay Commission which puts a particular emphasis on the recruitment and retention challenges in the health sector.  </p> <p>  I refer to the opening of the new emergency department in Limerick.</p><p>Consider how we have recruited nurses to open and staff the new emergency department in Limerick.  The picture is not all doom and gloom.  More nurses are working in the health service this year than last year and there will be significantly more working by the end of the year.  Ms Mannion will take the committee through how she sees that developing.</p><p> I will ask Mr. O'Brien to comment on the scoliosis matter and the signing of the contracts, but my understanding is that there is still a commitment to try to achieve the target of no one waiting for longer than four months.  Yesterday's figures showed further progress in this regard.  There will be 164 children, including the group to which Deputy O'Reilly referred, in need of procedures by the end of the year, which reaches the target of four months.  The HSE has already identified capacity within the system for 131 and is trying to find more capacity for the remainder.  The HSE-----</p></speech>

As he knows, we received a significant increased capital allocation - the best part of &euro;500 million - in the health budget.  He is right, in that the national children's hospital consumes the bulk of our available capital, but more so in the early years.  The HSE will conduct a reprofiling exercise and there will be scope to progress a number of projects.  As the Deputy well knows, a variety of projects must go through a number of phases in terms of planning, design and tendering.  When we reach the service planning stage, I expect to be able to show progress.</p> <p>  I also expect to be able to show progress on the national maternity strategy.  Tomorrow, we will launch the implementation plan for the women and infants programme, which is the strategy's delivery vehicle.</p> <p>  Regarding the mid-west, I do not want to get this wrong.  As the Deputy did when he was a Minister, I communicate with my officials several dozen times a day.  Sometimes, intelligent and astute journalists make freedom of information requests for those communications and publish them, as is their right.  When I see high trolley numbers for a consistent period of time in any hospital, I will ask why.  That is my job.  There are particular capacity challenges in the mid-west.  Is that the email that the Deputy has?</p></speech>

For example, weekend discharges had nothing to do with bed capacity but were not happening at the rate they should have been.  A number of other things should have been happening but were not.  It is not me saying this, but management.</p></speech>

The Minister is right about discharges, but how and to where would people be discharged?  Intermediate vehicles and ambulances are not present to do the job.  Of course Ennis and Nenagh hospitals have bed capacity, but they do not have the necessary transport capacity.  I have been raising this issue for a considerable time.  There are no community facilities either.  To where would some people be discharged?</p></speech>

The emphasis that I am placing is shared by the hospital group's CEO, who is providing excellent leadership contrary to how people have been trying to spin my comments.</p></speech>

She is providing very good leadership and has put in place an action plan for the hospital.  Since putting it in place, and as the Deputy will have noticed in the trolley figures for recent weeks, there has been a significant improvement.  She needs to be supported by everyone working in the hospital and the clinical community.  I did not think that opening a new emergency department would make all of the trolleys go away, but I did believe that putting additional nursing staff into the hospital and increasing its budget would create a benefit.</p></speech>

The leadership in the hospital and the hospital group is well up for this challenge.  It and I have a role to play and we are working collaboratively.</p> <p>  Regarding the GP contract, and as I mentioned on the recent budget day, there was no budget day funding allocation in the year that the free GP care for under sixes was introduced, which Deputy Kelly will remember, given that he was a member of the Cabinet at the time.  When the then Minister of State, Ms Kathleen Lynch, and the Taoiseach, who was the then Minister, announced on budget day their intention to expand free GP care to children under six years of age, no one in this room would have been able to find where the funding for that was in the budget.  It was not there.  When the expansion was agreed, the Ministers reverted to the Government to seek specific funding.  I am pleased that the current Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, gave significant prominence to this issue in his Budget Statement on the record of the D&aacute;il and mentioned that there would be a need to provide multi-annual resourcing to deliver a new GP contract.</p> <p>  This is an issue on which the Chairman regularly quizzes me.  My message to GP organisations is that, although we have a primary care fund of &euro;25 million in the budget, of course we will not deliver a new GP contract for &euro;25 million.  We can do something in this regard in 2018.  If we reach agreement with GPs on a number of other measures that are ambitious and will make a real difference, I will be willing to revert to the Government and consider a multi-annual approach.</p> <p>  On the issue of orphan drugs, the timelines that I outlined and committed to Deputy Kelly in the D&aacute;il still stand.</p></speech>

I would like to raise many points, but I understand the Minister's predicament and will be as brief as I can.</p> <p>  The Minister visited Bandon Community Hospital at roughly this time last year with good news that we appreciated it.  Unfortunately, and although the extension is ready to go, there is a staffing issue.  As well as the new area not being open, no respite is being provided because it was agreed that there would be none until everything was up and running.  Has the Minister a date for when it will open?</p> <p>  The Skibbereen Community and Family Resource Centre has moved buildings twice lately and is short on funding.  Are there plans to guarantee this service a building and enough funding to stay open?</p> <p>  There are many issues relating to contracts at Bantry General Hospital, but I will discuss that matter with the Minister in private.  Much is happening.  There has been no progress on the rehab and endoscopy units that were announced a while back.  What is the hold-up and when does the Minister envisage these services being up and running?</p></speech>

My understanding is that 42% of all patients waiting in the country are waiting in Cork.  Where are we in that regard?  When are we likely to make serious inroads into the waiting list?</p> <p>  My next question is on the fair deal scheme and how private providers find it difficult to provide high-dependency patients with the level of service that they require.  Will there be further engagement with private providers with a view to providing more beds for high-dependency patients in the private sector as opposed to depending entirely on community hospital facilities?  What is the timeline for this?  As the Minister is aware, people are living for longer.  Therefore, additional services in this regard are needed.</p></speech>

Joke over.  Back to work.  There is always the morning after.</p> <p>  The Minister referred to budget 2018, additional front-line staff for the health service, disability and other areas.  He included disability services when discussing better access to health services and mentioned that budget funding would be targeted on, for example, supporting disability services.  How will we verify that that is happening?  Maybe the HSE service plan sets it out.  How do we get from those statements of intent to what they mean on the ground?</p><p>I will be very blunt.  People with disabilities or with mental health needs in this country do not actually believe that things are getting better.  I am not talking about whether things are getting better.  I am just saying that people do not see it, believe it or feel it.  It is all about giving reassurance.  I have a number of questions but we are not going to be able to deal with them in detail this morning.  There are 1,200 young people in nursing homes, but the great majority of them could and should be supported in community settings.  I am also concerned about the issue of personal assistants, as well as section 38 and section 39 bodies.  These are only some of the relevant issues.  There are others in the area of mental health, such as the neurological strategy and so on.  There is no need to rehearse all of that now.</p><p> I am concerned about whether the extra funding that is being provided for health is enough to meet the additional demands.  Are we pumping water out faster than it is going in?  That is a real issue and people do not feel that we have turned the corner and are moving in the right direction.  It is important that assurances are given and that we can verify that through the work plans for next year and the following years.</p><p> The way we are dealing with matters this morning is less than ideal.  I ask that the Minister and his officials would come back for a coherent session.  The budget has just been announced and this is an important time in the year for getting ourselves organised for next year.</p></speech>

That said, I alerted the committee as soon as I knew that there was a Cabinet meeting at 10 a.m.  I was here three weeks ago and will be back again in November.  I am happy to come back this afternoon, tomorrow, or whenever the committee wants me to be here.  I am always available to this committee and these Houses.  There is no issue in that regard.  We obviously also have our colleagues from the HSE, including the director general, who can continue this meeting in the interregnum and deal with a lot of the questions being raised.</p> <p>  I visited Bandon Community Hospital last year with Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony and was very impressed with the facility and the extension.  I will ask the HSE to respond to the Deputy this morning or by way of correspondence on when that facility will be open.  I was struck by the dedication of everybody there and the energy in the place.  We are eager to get that happening and I will get a date for the Deputy.</p> <p>  On the issue of family resource centres, while there could be a health element, I do not know the details.  I know that generally such centres are funded by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  I also know that the Minister, Deputy Zappone, announced in her budget day speech some additional funding for family resource centres, so perhaps that might be an avenue worth exploring further.  I will ask the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly regarding the rehabilitation and endoscopy unit.</p> <p>  I thank Senator Colm Burke for raising the issue of Cork University Maternity Hospital, CUMH, as it provides me with an opportunity to acknowledge the incredible clinical leadership that is being shown by the community in CUMH, by Dr. Cathy Burke, Dr. Keelin O'Donoghue and their colleagues.  They came to see me last year, with the HSE and the hospital group, on the new women and infants programme.  They highlighted the fact that women in the Cork region were waiting longer for procedures than was the average around the country.  In some cases, they were waiting significantly longer.  They told me that they were putting together a plan to address this issue, asked me to resource that plan and to support them.  They assured me that they would deliver results and they have been true to their word.  They have made significant progress this year which is why, when it came to the budget day announcement, I committed to moving on to the next phase of that plan.  We will be engaging with the women and infants health programme and the South/South West hospital group in this regard as we move forward with the service planning.  There will be additional resources and funding available, but obviously that is a matter for the service plan and our dialogue with the HSE in that regard.  When people in the health service put up their hand, make a proposal, ask for support and then achieve what they said they would, it is very important that we continue to support them.  I believe we will see significant further progress on this in 2018.  Again, I thank Senator Burke for highlighting the issue.</p> <p>  Regarding the fair deal scheme, as the Senator will be aware, a review of pricing mechanisms is ongoing and these are issues that can be considered in that context by our colleagues in the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.  The point the Senator makes is an important one in terms of the profile of patients in our nursing homes.  That profile has changed quite significantly in recent years and is only likely to continue in that direction.  Thankfully, as the Senator points out, people are living longer but often have complex conditions and a greater degree of dependency by the time they enter a nursing home.  Thankfully, statistics show that people are largely staying out of nursing homes until later in life and are then spending less time there, largely.  That discussion is ongoing through the pricing review mechanism and I do not wish to comment much further on it.</p></speech>

It should be finalised by 2018.  I do not want to be too specific.  I have a job to do for the taxpayer as well and I do not want to tie the State's hands in these discussions.  That said, I expect the process to come to a conclusion in the next couple of months.</p> <p>  I thank Senator Dolan for his questions.  I know that the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, will be here later to engage on some of these matters.  The Senator has hit the nail on the head in terms of verification being such an important part of what we do.  As Minister for Health, when I announce on budget day an allocation of so many billion euro, I must be very conscious of what that means to the man, woman or child at home in terms of services and access to services and supports for the year ahead.  Frankly, such large global figures mean very little to any of us as citizens.  People want to see the granular detail of what it will mean.  Will it improve access to speech and language therapy this year?  Will there be an increase in respite places?  What will it mean for home care packages?  People have a variety of questions like that.  I can assure the Senator that this is something the HSE takes very seriously in terms of the service planning piece, on which we will engage shortly with a view to coming to a conclusion by the end of the year and the drawing up of service level agreements.  In return for receiving taxpayer funding, the HSE will outline what it expects will be delivered in 2018.  Making that as concrete and real as possible for people is very important.</p> <p>  Senator Dolan regularly poses the question, and he is right to do so, whether we are making headway in disability services.  We are increasing the budgets and the Senator will acknowledge that funding has increased again.  Funding was also provided for the decision support service and &euro;3 million was provided for the Department of Justice and Equality to enable it finally to get on and ratify the UN convention.  The budget for disability services will increase by about &euro;75 million in 2018.  What does that mean?  Will that mean better services?  Will it mean that we get ahead?  Truthfully, the answer is that there continue to be demographic pressures in this area.  These are good problems in a way, in the sense that people are living longer and are demanding, requiring and receiving better care.  That obviously has an impact on the budget.  I do expect that when we deliver the service plan we will see concrete commitments to improvements in a number of target areas for people with disabilities in 2018.  I know that the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, has prioritised and will continue to prioritise, through the service planning process, issues such as respite and emergency placements because there was a particular and growing challenge with that this year.  We saw many cases of parents with a child - often an adult child - at home reaching breaking point.  They then have to make that extraordinarily difficult decision to put their child into residential care.  Often, the needs of the child are so complex, however, that finding an emergency place can be a very big challenge.  The Minister of State has highlighted that as a priority.  He has also highlighted the issue of speech and language therapy along with the flagship issue, which he is taking very seriously, of ratifying the UN convention.  When we get down to the level of the service plan, the Minister of State will be able to engage further with the committee.  The HSE may also wish to comment at that point.</p></speech>

What plans does the HSE have to recruit GPs?  GPs are contractors and therefore fall outside the normal employment structures.  As they come to retire, there is very little engagement with them on how their practice will continue after they retire.  I ask the Minister to address those two issues.</p></speech>

The Minister knows that I am a fan of the district hospital network and that I believe that it has a vital role to play in modern-day health service delivery.  District hospitals should not be seen as a relic of a bygone era because, with adequate investment, they can prevent or reduce admissions to acute hospitals and facilitate discharges from same.</p><p>Specifically with regard to the hospital in Belmullet, with the recent storm the director of nursing was forced to evacuate the patients to the physiotherapy department for fear that the windows might blow in.  We recently had a HIQA inspection there, which I welcome, because while the level of nursing care is excellent the building is crumbling.  Could the Minister provide some information on the investment planned for the hospital in Belmullet, the building works due to be carried out there and, if possible, a timeline for that?</p><p> Manyt of my young GP colleagues are emigrating.  The Minister is aware of that.  We must look at reversing the FEMPI cuts to attract GPs and keep them in rural areas in particular.  There is a surgery close to me where a GP leaves more or less every two years because there is no future for them there.  I would welcome clarification on that if possible.</p></speech>

As far as I am concerned the big challenge currently is the budget.  The current budgetary allocation is the first in recent years where extra money is available and it is being spent.  We welcome that.  The question is whether it will suffice.  Given that we are in the higher cohort of spending among OECD countries, what measures will we put in place to try to address the issues that have caused problems such as waiting lists, overcrowding in accident and emergency departments, bed shortages and all the issues that arise from time to time?  The question is also one for the HSE.  What mechanism can we put in place to identify and address the problems that seem to obstruct the system?  There is always a cause to which we can attribute a blockage at some stage.  A system should flow freely.  I know that is not the case in every country but in some countries it flows a lot more freely than here, including in countries where less is spent on the health service.  There are issues we need to identify and address.  Do we have a mechanism in place to do that currently?  That is the crunch issue for everybody - the HSE and the health services in this country.  The people are watching and they will come to a conclusion.  If the system cannot deliver effectively and efficiently in a way that it has not done before then we have a problem.</p></speech>

Does the Minister know the impact of the recent campaign on the promotion of the HPV vaccine?  Are there any preliminary data to show whether we have addressed the decline from 87% to 50%?  I know the campaign was recent but are there any data to show the plan is working?</p> <p>  With regard to primary care centres I heard the Minister speak recently about the amount of centres that have been opened.  I think we have gone from 43 primary care centres to 105.  In light of that and of the Sl&aacute;intecare report where we focused on the reorientation of the health service into primary care, perhaps Mr. O'Brien could indicate what plans there are for the expansion of primary care centres.  I hate anecdotal evidence but I constantly hear that when people are on their way home from work the primary care centres are closed.  One cannot run primary care centres without GPs.  What are we doing to expand the services and the opening hours of primary care centres in order to line up with the purpose of the Sl&aacute;intecare plan, namely, to effectively reorientate people into the primary care setting?  I know you are looking at me with intent Chairman, that you want me to stay quiet.</p></speech>

Of course it has had an impact on general practice, just like it has had an impact on so many contractors and public servants across the country.  We all know the rationale and the reasoning behind its introduction.  There was a national financial emergency.  We know the economy is in a much better place now, thank God, and we know we are trying to move to higher ground in that regard.  We are obviously engaged in contractual discussions with GPs.  I have made it very clear - I will make it very clear again - that the totality of those discussions should not be seen to merely relate to the &euro;25 million primary care fund in the budget.  GPs have issues they want to discuss as part of the contract negotiations.  I have issues that I want to discuss and that is the mechanism whereby we should discuss them.  Let me be very clear though; the Government wishes to invest significantly in general practice on a multi-annual basis starting in 2018.  There is an opportunity for GPs now to reach agreement with the State in that regard that will see more funding spent on general practice and more funding going into general practice, which will help address the issue of sustainability.</p> <p>  There would not be a need for negotiation in any situation if it was not the case that there are two sides often with different asks and different sets of priorities.  There is a lot of overlap in some of the things GPs want to do if they are resourced and some of the things we want GPs to do and in primary care generally.  There are also some issues on which we do not agree.  That is the purpose of negotiation.  I hope members hear me clearly this morning send out a message, as the Minister for Finance did in his budget day speech, that the Government is willing to look at this in a multi-annual sense.  The Minister for Finance is willing to see significant additional resources in general practice, starting in 2018 and for every year after that.  We have a busy agenda of things to discuss.  I do not want to say any more than that publicly but that is quite a significant and important message to send to GPs, namely, that we are deadly serious about wanting to deliver a contract that works for them and wanting to see them adequately resourced to do their job in a sustainable fashion.</p> <p>  On the issue of GP recruitment in general, I see the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, is now running a very vigorous and visible campaign in terms of recruitment in advance of the next intake of GP trainees.  I have met the ICGP in that regard and I met with it at a careers day recently in Dublin Castle.  I am very grateful for the ownership it is taking of the issue.  The Irish College of GPs is speaking directly to GPs and GPs are encouraging new young medics to become GPs as that is quite impactful as well.</p> <p>  I agree with what Senator Swanick said about district hospitals and, more important, Sl&aacute;intecare agrees with him as well.  We need to find the right role for every part of our infrastructure across the health service and that includes a greater and enhanced role for district hospitals and doing what is appropriate to do in a district hospital.  We agree with him on Belmullet.  That sounds like it was a very difficult and challenging time for people there.  I will ask the HSE to provide Senator Swanick with an update on plans for Belmullet.  We will come back to him directly.</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan asked whether the budget will suffice.  This is the age old question.  I have a very clear view on this.  One can have an old and fuel inefficient car and one can spend a lot of money on the car but the car is still old and fuel inefficient.  It is the same with the health service.  That is not in any way a disparaging comment; quite the contrary.  It is a fact that we need to put in place a more efficient vehicle for the delivery of our health service.  I heard the director general talk about that as well.  It is not just a health service responsibility, politicians have a responsibility in that regard.  Reform has been stop-start, confusing and at times incoherent.  I assure Deputy Durkan that I see Sl&aacute;intecare as the journey to getting that new vehicle.  I really do.  When we had the all-day Cabinet meeting in Cork last Friday we took a number of additional steps beyond the resourcing issues that took place on budget day in terms of the impact study Sl&aacute;intecare asked me to do on public versus private, and appointing Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir to carry that out and report by next summer.  That will include asking the public and those working in the health service how one aligns community healthcare organisations, CHOs, and hospital groups, because that needs to happen, and how to do it effectively, and also bring back a performance and accountability type structure in relation to a board for the HSE.  I heard the director general talk about how the governance structures in the health service currently are not fit for purpose.  They were only ever meant to be temporary or stop-gap structures.  We cannot have a situation where we do not have a board to which the HSE is accountable.  It is very important that we get the right skill set in relation to that.  It will require primary legislation.  It is a recommendation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  I hope with the agreement and co-operation of members that we could progress that very quickly through both Houses of the Oireachtas as well.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Durkan, Ministers for Health long after me could sit here and talk about the health budget increasing, and that will result in benefits - I do not dismiss the need for resources.  We need to see benefit in particular in areas like waiting lists.  Huge resources will be spent in 2018.  We have seen figures fall for two months in a row now and we need them to keep falling but increasing the budget is not going to be enough in and of itself, it must include the reform piece as well.</p><p>To address Deputy O'Connell's question on the HPV vaccine campaign, in recent days I asked the same question which she asked.  I am told that it is too early to see the data.  I do not know whether Mr. O'Brien has any data on it, but I have not seen any yet.  There has certainly been a very effective campaign and I appreciate the support of everybody in this room in promoting that.  I hope we will see a benefit from it but I have not seen the figures yet.</p><p> On primary care centres, the Deputy is right.  We have invested a lot in the infrastructure, but if the lights are off at 5 p.m. people will still find themselves having to go to the acute hospital setting.  Part of the discussions with the GPs - and I am not putting it all on their shoulders - is about how to keep these centres open longer, but there are also things we can do through the primary care fund such as community nursing, advanced nurse practitioners and helping with chronic disease management in the community.  We can see progress on a number of those fronts as a result of the budget day announcement.</p></speech>

There will be &euro;1 million in the first year for a Sl&aacute;intecare implementation office or a Sl&aacute;intecare programme office.  Issues in respect of the recruitment of the lead executive are being worked on and will be progressed very shortly.  It is really important that we get the right skill set.

Obviously HIQA has a role as an independent regulator.  I do not wish to say anything which involves me in a space in which I should not be involved, but at the last meeting Deputy Kelly alerted the committee that the potential impact of this situation may be broader than any one facility.  I will ask the director general of the HSE to give his view on that situation.</p> <p>  Members of the committee raised a number of important issues which the HSE might pick up on, including the issue of recruitment, which Deputy O'Reilly raised.  Ms Mannion might be able to comment on that.  The issues of scoliosis, HPV and the storm damage which may have been done to our facilities were also raised.  I believe they were the main points but obviously members can direct any other issues they wish to raise to the director general.</p></speech>

We are completing our assessment of the impact and cost of any storm damage, although the damage to our infrastructure has thankfully not been as significant as we at first feared it might have been.  In respect of the issues raised about recruitment, I will give Ms Mannion notice that I will be asking her to speak on those issues.  I will ask Mr. Woods to give us the latest position in respect of scoliosis.</p> <p>  With regard to the question on drug approvals, nine drugs were subject to an approval process earlier this year.  They were Erivedge, which is used to treat basal cell carcinoma; Brintellix, which is for depression; Entresto, which is used for heart failure; Lynparza for ovarian cancer; Gazyvaro for follicular lymphoma; Entyvio for Crohn's and ulcerative colitis; Opdivo for renal cell carcinoma and, separately, Opdivo for Hodgkin's lymphoma; and Otezla for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.  All of these are either already available and listed for reimbursement or will be by the beginning of November in line with the announcements made during the summer. </p> <p>  On the HPV vaccine campaign, while it is too early to be quoting any data or statistics, the school-based teams administering and engaging with students who will be offered the first dose from September or October of this year and their parents are reporting a much better atmosphere and much more positive feedback.  While we do not have hard data, we would say that we are now cautiously optimistic that we will see an uptick in the levels of uptake of the HPV vaccine, although it is no time for complacency in that regard.</p></speech>

I am not trying to be difficult but I know that when a pharmacist gives the flu vaccine, he or she enters the person's PPS number so that the doctor will know whether it has been given.  It is there in a system.  I can understand that we need a period of time to collect a data set, but once a period of time has elapsed I cannot see how it would be any more complicated than pressing a button or highlighting a column.</p></speech>

At the end of August our whole-time figures showed an increase of 3,453 across the system.  That is an additional headcount of more than 3,000 in comparison to this time last year.  Of that figure, more than 400 are nurses.  Health care is delivered by fully-staffed, multidisciplinary teams.  No one grade is more important than another.  We are very focused on recruiting all grades of staff where they are required including nurses, doctors, GPs, psychologists and staff for the mental health programme.   We are doing very well on the recruitment of assistant psychologists.  We had approval for 150 of them.  That panel will go live in December and will be a significant help in respect of programmes and developments in mental health next year.</p> <p>  With regard to nursing specifically, members will be aware that we have been very focused.  We are trying to grow the nursing workforce by 1,208 this year.  We are doing well.  We are very focused on retention measures.  One such measure is a push on flexible working.  I am really pleased to see that, across the nursing workforce, in excess of 60% of nurses are availing of flexible working of some description.  That is a very good thing and we are actively promoting that.  It presents a challenge in the reporting of our nursing figures because variation, increases and decreases will show up month on month.</p><p>I was slightly disappointed to see the figures in August but that was attributed to the numbers of more than 60% of nurses on flexible working.  Between now and year end, we are focused on agency conversion.  As the Minister outlined, we have permanent contracts for all our graduates.  We are hoping the uptake will be very good.  Feedback on the ground is that it will be.  Part of the 1,200 nurses in question was a conversion of 736 agency posts.  On any day in the health sector, we have in excess of 1,000 nurses working on agency contracts.  We are very focused on achieving that conversion between now and year-end.  Between agency conversion, permanent contracts for our graduate and other nurses in the churn, we are making our best and honest effort to achieve that recruitment.</p><p> If it is successful and we meet our targets, we will be happy.  If it is not, we need to go back to the drawing board to see what else we need to do.  There is no doubt that there are constant retention challenges across the health sector.  It is a challenging area in which to work.  There is competition out there.  Many staff we recruit, both nurses and doctors in many specialties, are interested in travelling.  We want them doing that by choice, not because there are no posts available.</p><p> Overall, that is the situation with recruitment.  Suffice to say, we are doing everything possible and will continue to do so.  Progress is good but we would like it to be better.  Year on year, we have in excess of 3,000 additional staff providing services.</p></speech>

It does not matter to the patient what is written on the payslip of the nurse standing by their bedside.  While it matters to the nurse and to the HSE figures, conversion from agency does not actually add additional hours to the system.  When the budget was announced, the INMO stated that, on balance, the actual increase was 13 nurses.  I fully appreciate there is more to health care delivery than nursing staff.</p></speech>

I understand Ms Mannion is hopeful and working hard.  I would not dispute that for a moment.  However, in truth, the HSE will not hit those targets by the end of the year.  It is missing them by a mile as it is and, more than likely, it will miss them by several miles by the end of the year.  Instead of hoping, it would be more helpful if the HSE were honest.  I do not actually believe Ms Mannion is hopeful the HSE will hit those targets.</p></speech>

That did not factor in the student nurses in the system or take into consideration the 1,500 graduates offered posts between now and year end.  The actual headcount increase, the additional nurses, was in excess of 443.  On any one day, there are 1,000 nurses in an agency who are not within that figure.</p> <p>  Will we get there by December?  I do not know.  Suffice to say, we will be making our best efforts.  As I said, it was agreed 736 of the figure would be through agency conversion.  Why has that not happened year-to-date?  The final quarter is always the one where one sees conversion taking effect and being visible in headcount and on payroll.  That is why I am optimistic. </p></speech>

It would be strange for the Government to make those funding decisions in advance of having made the fundamental policy decision.</p> <p>  The question of section 39 staff is a matter of public pay policy.  Persons employed in section 39 agencies are not regarded as public employees but there is a process, some of which the Deputy will be aware of, under way on those.  I do not know what ultimate decision will be made on that.  This year the HSE was not funded to provide funding to section 39 agencies to facilitate them in making similar pay awards to those which were made available to section 38 employees.</p></speech>

The fact we find ourselves from time to time on different sides of those discussions does not amount to a criticism of HIQA from the HSE.  We respect the role of HIQA.  Sometimes, however, the exercise of its regulatory functions and the exercise of our care provision or care funding functions bring us to different sides of licensing questions, as is the case with St. Joseph's Hospital in Ennis.  The law governing this provides for a court process to resolve those differences.  As this matter is before the courts, I want to be cautious in what I say about it.  I am fully prepared to provide a more detailed written answer because it is far easier to be careful with them than it is with verbal answers.</p> <p>  The Deputy is correct the issues that arise are important, not just for those who receive their care in St. Joseph's Hospital.  Potentially, it could have wider implications for the provision of care through public facilities in the State.  That is why, through the community health care organisation in that area, the HSE has taken a stance which necessitates the involvement of the courts to mediate in this process.  I do not want to ventilate the issues.</p></speech>

The issue for me really is that this is a very important test case.  The Department has issued regulations in regard to multi-occupancy rooms covering the period to 2021.  There are many other regulations also.  We discussed this matter here and we did so at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts for different reasons, concerning the spending of money.

The funding this year for the National Treatment Purchase Fund is &euro;20 million.  From what I can gather, that will increase to &euro;55 million next year.  In the context of the assessment of who should be treated through the fund and the contracts that will be entered into with the private health care providers providing treatment, what size contracts will be awarded financially, procedurally or otherwise?  What is the cost of providing the same treatment in a public facility by comparison with that of providing it in a private facility?  We are trying to compare how much it costs to provide certain surgeries or procedures publicly and privately.  There are varying views, including that the private sector can provide treatment more efficiently.  Others argue that the public system can do so more efficiently.  If we do not have any detail on it, how can we adjudicate on which is more efficient?  Ultimately, public money is being spent.  Where unused capacity in public hospitals funded by the National Treatment Purchase Fund is concerned, is what is occurring not just shifting money by way of an accounting exercise as opposed to increasing genuine capacity in the public health system?</p> <p>  On the section 39s, which have been referred to already, a considerable issue arises in terms of pay awards to employees across the broader health system.  They are also awarded to section 39s.  No provision is being made, however, in the bloc grants from the HSE to the organisations concerned.  I refer to very large ones of which I have reasonable knowledge, such as COPE in Cork and St. Joseph's Foundation in Charleville.  There are many across the country that do amazing work for the amount of money they are being given.  There was a cost-benefit analysis of the varying section 39s.  They were asked to find savings and they did.  Many made substantial savings but there seems to be no acceptance that they cannot keep cutting services to fund public pay increases.  What the HSE is effectively asking people to do is to cut services to fund public sector pay increases that they are not party to, as such.  HIQA is now investigating these same organisations saying that they are providing substandard care in some cases, yet there is no provision by the HSE to fund the increased number of staff required to comply with HIQA regulations.  Could I have Mr. O'Brien's observations on those issues?</p></speech>

The first is overcrowding in accident and emergency units.  Can the HSE put in place troubling-shooting systems that will find out precisely the cause in each case, as it arises?  There are not so many that they are beyond enumeration, but they are of sufficient importance to require an immediate response such that the public and patients can see something happening.  The question that comes to mind is why there is so much overcrowding at accident and emergency units.  Is it because people bypass their general practitioner?  Is it because they have been on a waiting list for general hospital services or elective services for a long period?  I am just asking these questions off the top of my head.  I have dealt with such cases myself.  What are the issues?  How can one put in place a system that would identify the cause or causes, isolate them, set them aside and deal with them?  This is a major issue for the health services this year.  Without doubt, the public in the health services will become depressed as a result of implied criticisms.  There is actually no criticism but the fact of the mater is that the system is not flowing smoothly, which is a problem.</p> <p>  Another issue is waiting lists for various procedures in general hospitals or public hospitals.  Again, there is a need for an urgent appraisal of the causes of the stoppages and slow-downs.  Is it a lack of personnel, consultants, hospital doctors, theatre staff or theatre availability?  A criticism I hear from consultants is that, in terms of procedures, there could be a 15% difference in the amount that could be done in a public hospital by comparison with a private hospital in the same day.  The questions that arise in this regard are why this is the case, why we cannot identify the problems and why we cannot address those issues.  Let us not forget that there are theatres, including clean-air theatres, that have never been used and that are idle all the time.  They have the most sophisticated technology in the land, or in Europe, in fact.  To restore public confidence in the system - this is not a criticism of the HSE or any personnel anywhere - we simply have to address this.  If we do not do so, we will have failed and I will have failed as a member of this committee.  The health services will have failed if we cannot address these issues.</p> <p>  What is the most effective use of consultants throughout the public health system?  Are they effectively engaged?  Are we diverting towards them a steady flow of patients that they can deal with daily without having a hiccup and having to wait for two or three days for the next patient to come along?  What are the causes?  Can we address them?  How soon can we address them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.875" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1409" speakername="Colm Burke" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017101800002#J00100"><p>I thank the deputations for appearing before the committee this morning.  I have tabled question 5, which is a specific question on orthopaedic services in Cork, in particular those in the South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital.  I note from the reply that there are 456 people waiting for a first appointment for more than 24 months.  I am raising the question because of the case of one patient who is on the urgent waiting list.  I was advised in March this year that the patient would be seen by June.  Then in June I learned that the patient was eighth on the waiting list but would not be seen before the end of September.  At the end of September I was told that it would be at least another three or four months before the patient is seen.  This patient is on the urgent waiting list.  I am concerned about how the list is managed and why the goalposts are constantly keep being changed.  Will any action be taken to deal with the 456 people who are waiting more than 24 months for an appointment?</p> <p>  My second issue relates to orthopaedic services in Cork.  I was advised that six people were referred for hip replacements under the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  This was some time ago, not recently.  The HSE paid for the procedures to be carried out.  A total of four of the patients had private health insurance, but yet the HSE paid for the treatment.  What cheques and balances are in place for the NTPF?  How does that arise?</p> <p>  Another issue relates to retention of management in our hospital structure.  If we have a system whereby managers keep changing, then we do not have continuity of management within individual hospitals.  I know of one hospital where there have been ten managers in 18 years.  Therefore, there is a problem with either the payscale or how the position is created.  Will there be a review in respect of the whole issue of continuity of people in particular roles?  This is fundamental.  There are doctors and nurses in place for 15 or 20 years and that brings continuity.  However, if we do not have continuity in management, there is a problem.  Will that issue be reviewed?  Is there a need to review the case of smaller hospitals and the status of managerial positions?  If the positions are being under-graded, do we need to look at that rather than having constant rotation of managers and lack of continuity?  Is there any review of that area at the moment?</p> <p>  The final issue I wish to raise relates to the recruitment of non-consultant hospital doctors.  Of the 6,000 NCHDs currently employed how many are under agency contracts?  What do we need to do to make those positions more attractive and to try to move away from agency contracts?  If we can move away from agency contracts then it would cost less.  What do we need to do?  Do we need to improve training grants or additional resources for the educational process they are going through?  Is that being reviewed as well?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.876" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Breslin" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017101800002#J00200"><p>Deputy Kelleher asked about the process under the National Treatment Purchase Fund for securing value.  There are two aspects to it.  The first relates to the arrangements whereby private hospitals are procured.  Private hospitals are invited to express interest in the work.  They submit the basis on which they carry out the work.  The submission is then assessed by the NTPF and drawdown contracts are put in place.  The reason for the drawdown approach is that where the patient goes is determined by the specialty of procedure required and, to some extent, by the location of the patient.  Depending on where the patient is to be dealt with and the condition that needs to be addressed, the patient will be funnelled to relevant private hospitals.  This happens against a properly procured price arrangement.</p> <p>  As the Minister has said before, we can determine the precise amount of activity delivered by the NTPF in return for the funding.  The reason is that the funding flows on a per-patient basis.  Private hospitals only get paid if they treat the patient in line with the arrangements in place.  The Minister has said that between 17,000 and 18,000 additional procedures will be performed as a result of the funding put in place for the NTPF next year - that is why we can say that.</p> <p>  The activity taking place funded by the NTPF in any public hospital is additional activity and it has to sit firmly additional and above what is already in place.  Particularly relevant arrangements are those for the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital and Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital.  The funding made available has allowed these hospitals to increase their capacity.  Had they not got the funding, they would have been unable to carry out the additional activity.</p> <p>  The question of whether this complicates funding flows was asked.  It does complicate funding flows somewhat.  Again, it gives transparency to the fact that those hospitals have to carry out additional activity.  If they do not carry out the additional activity, then they will not get the funding.</p> <p>  Overall, we are moving towards a place within the total acute hospital system where the budgets for hospitals will be far more related to the activity they undertake.  However, that is a gradual process and we do not have full activity-based funding in our public hospital system.  This is a means of incentivising hospitals to undertake additional activity.</p> <p>  One recommendation in the Sl&aacute;intecare report related to trying to look at greater separation of elective and emergency workloads.  It is quite possible that a hospital will come under pressure from emergency demand and will see its elective activity reduce.  This is one way in which we can try to maintain a separation of elective activity, especially in hospitals such at Cappagh, the Eye and Ear and Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, which are unaffected by emergency pressures to the same extent, and reward them for doing more emergency activity.</p> <p>  It is more difficult in the large general hospitals, where the two pressures feed in to each other.  That will be one of the things to address in the implementation of the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  The question is whether we can get capacity within our public system that is firmly dedicated to elective activity and waiting lists and does not get buffeted by seasonal and other pressures to do with emergency workloads.  Some of the experience in the NTPF is of use to us in doing that and developing our total system of hospital funding.</p></speech>

It is certainly the case that when public pay was being cut, high-level reductions were made to the gross funding of section 39 agencies as a corollary.  In many instances, though not necessarily all, they would have dealt with this by imposing equivalent pay cuts on their staff.  As pay has been restored, however, the HSE has not had funding restored in respect of the likely cost of equivalent pay awards in section 39 agencies.</p> <p>  It is not the case that the HSE has made a decision to treat the section 39 agencies differently from others.  It is the case that the HSE is the recipient of funding that does not allow it to provide that level of funding to section 39 agencies.  Clearly, that is a challenge for those section 39 agencies and for the staff who work in them.  Several of those agencies and their staff are engaged with the Workplace Relations Commission and similar processes in an attempt to get decisions.  In turn, they will discuss those with us and we, in turn, will discuss them with our funders.  We are not unsympathetic to the situation, but, at the same time, there is an equivalent public policy issue.  In other words, section 39 agencies are not public bodies and their employees are not public sector employees.  The way these things progress could have an impact on the application of that policy.</p><p>It is above the HSE's pay grade.  I think I would put it that way.</p></speech>

I took several cases to the Labour Court in relation to that and the feeling at the time was that they were following HSE and Department of Health advice.</p></speech>

That is not to say that they are obliged to follow public pay policy.</p></speech>

That does present the issue then in terms of restoration unlike the public service where there have been agreements with everybody around the table and they get either partially or fully restored based on a particular day and a particular percentage.  I think the sector will have approached this in somewhat different ways in different circumstances and the resolution to it is probably likely not to be as uniform as in the public service.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Breslin not accept that some of the section 39 organisations are quite large employers, very large employers in some cases, providing significant services in areas, in particular intellectual and physical disability, and there seems to be no appreciation either from the Department or the HSE of what they have to do on a daily basis to try and comply with HIQA's enforcement and to provide safe services to people.  When one meets some of the people who are volunteers in many cases on the boards, they are in breach of their fiduciary duties, they are not far off trading recklessly and their auditors are at their wits end trying to address their accounts.  Pension provision is being funded out of current expenditure.  Is there anybody looking at this strategically to see whether something could be done either to rationalise the services and force them to co-operate more or to do something to help them?  If we allow the situation to continue people will have diminished services.  We are talking about very vulnerable people whose families are under huge pressure.  I am beginning to think there is no system in place to assess the services and examine the broader supports that are required in the areas of physical and intellectual disability.</p></speech>

The point about the NTPF hip replacement operations and four patients having private cover, as the Senator is aware, it is every citizen's entitlement to access hospital services so that is entirely within the legislation.</p> <p>  On the point about the retention of managers, I took the question to refer to small to mid-size hospitals where there may be a lot of flow.  It is an observation well made that managing a small hospital is a complex management task.  There has been a history of staff grading levels that attract people to move based on the fact that they can be promoted at a higher grade elsewhere.  That is something we have to look at in terms of career structure.  There has been some experience recently of upgrading those posts to provide better longer term career opportunities.  The Senator's point about stable leadership is well made and understood in management theory and practice and in fact is reflected in health literature.</p> <p>  On the question about non-consultant hospital doctor, NCHD, recruitment, from a hospitals' perspective we are up 178 NCHDs since the start of the year.  Our medical agency number, which is the point to which Senator Burke referred, is still relatively static.  There has been a small drop and it is very close to the change-over so we will have to assess our own data.</p></speech>

It cannot be allowed to continue that there is a lack of continuity.</p> <p>  On orthopaedic surgery and the treatment purchase fund, it is a huge waste in that if someone is on private health insurance and someone else who is waiting on the public health system who is waiting then they are being pushed even further back.

The director general is correct in that our requirement under law is to deliver public services to public patients and once people declare themselves a public patient we cannot take that away from them.  There might be a case to be made for the information being made available to people in a fuller way but, fundamentally, that is the choice of the patient if he or she wants to be treated as a public patient.</p></speech>

One of the fundamental recommendations of the Sl&aacute;intecare report is that there be a reorientation of our health service away from hospital-based services towards primary care ones.  However, there is a difficulty in how GP-led primary care is delivered, given the GP manpower crisis.  We have difficulties recruiting new GPs.  Despite the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, advertising and promoting entry into general practice to new graduates, they are patently not doing so because of the GP contract and the financial model of GP care.  How does the HSE or the Department propose to address the manpower crisis in general practice?  It is growing more acute month on month.  Jobs are not being taken up except by <i>locums</i>and people are not getting the same level of service and continuity of care that they would if they had established GPs.  There is a difficulty in recruiting for general practice, but because GPs are contract holders and, as such, fall outside the employment relationship, how do the HSE and Department propose to develop the primary care service and attract GPs into it?</p><p>Some 33% of GPs are over 55 years of age, so there will be retirements, but there is no active component within the Department or the HSE to engage with those GPs and determine how they will organise their retirements.  Can mechanisms be put in place to help them to transition from their principalship to the next generation of GPs?  Is there thinking within the Department or the HSE on how this can be done?</p></speech>

We will return to the committee in November, but it is fair to say at this stage that there is a view that the Department of Health always sees money as the answer to every problem.  In this ten-year review, however, the critical success factor will be the workforce and our ability to create conditions in which people want to take up the opportunities that we will make available over that period.  This applies to GPs and right across the workforce.  Some of it relates to remuneration, but it is also about trying to create conditions in which people can see that the types of career we have in Ireland are those that they are interested in and that are at least as good as, if not better than, those available elsewhere around the world.  Much of this goes beyond simple remuneration issues into the workplace climate, how we evolve our health service, the types of arrangement that we put in place for people to structure their working weeks and careers, and trying to work with and listen to people who are currently facing the question of whether to continue their careers in this country or abroad.  The Chairman is well aware of how many of our GP trainees face that decision at the moment.</p> <p>  A critical piece of work to be done as part of the implementation structure for Sl&aacute;intecare will be workforce planning and addressing the issues that are causing us difficulty in recruiting and retaining our workforce, particularly graduates, so that when we put people through publicly funded educational programmes to turn them into health professionals, we get the benefit of that.  I do not have all of the answers today, but this will be one of the chief components of a successful implementation of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare's report.  It not only applies to GPs, but to so much else as well.</p></speech>

In terms of workforce planning, does the Department have a vision of how it will approach recruiting?  We all know that we need to recruit.  Mr. Breslin referred to a satisfactory working arrangement.  It is not all about money, but about career satisfaction and progression as well.</p> <p>  This issue has a knock-on effect on our waiting lists.  If we have a functioning GP-led primary care service, the number of patients who need to be referred and are on waiting lists will drop according to the level of care that they get within the community.  That is the purpose of and thinking in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  If we reorientate our services towards primary care, fund it properly and create proper structures within it, we will reduce the number of outpatient referrals and accident and emergency admissions and the pressure on our health service.</p> <p>  The key recommendation of the Sl&aacute;intecare report is to reorientate the service towards primary care, but what is the thinking in the Department and the HSE on how that can be done?  Everything else flows from this core issue in the report.</p></speech>

We have researched how other countries have done this.  We will embed the framework in the HSE and the Department.  It will have elements of a demand analysis, that is, how many staff of a certain type are needed, a supply analysis, or how many are being trained in the education system, and how to address on a systematic basis those workplace issues that we need to work on to try to create the type of opportunities to which people will respond.</p> <p>  We have started working on general practice in that regard, but we will have to apply the full framework to primary care and GP practice and work on that over the full ten-year period.  It will be a rate-limiting step in terms of how quickly and how far we progress.  There is no point in discussing this matter as needing hundreds of millions, or even billions, of euro if we cannot get staff.  The fundamental piece of implementation will relate to the workforce and the key components of same, particularly given that we are trying to shift the model of care.  Continuing with programmes based in certain settings is no good when one is trying to shift out of those settings.  We need to develop new programmes for the type of work that we want to do.  In particular, we should train people to work in a multidisciplinary way as well as in their traditional unidisciplinary way.</p> <p>  We will publish that framework shortly.  We also have a global workforce conference in Dublin next week.  We would be happy to forward the framework to the committee and have officials discuss it.  Ms Mannion and colleagues in the HSE had a great deal of input into the framework and are working to try to progress the agenda of improving our planning and implementation of workforce plans.</p></speech>

As the Chairman is aware, I believe that all of the key clues as to how we move from our current health system to the health system that we need are contained within that report.  The report is clear, in that this will not be a case of being free with just one bound.  A series of steps need to be taken sequentially over an extended period in order to make that transition.

What has happened to GP services that have made them so unattractive recently compared with 25 years ago?  Everyone wanted to be a GP and became successful ones.  We are spending far more money on the health services now than we were then.</p><p>For some unknown reason, we can, if we are lucky, get only one applicant for most advertised positions in general practice.  I ask Mr. O'Brien to respond on that issue and to my three other questions. </p></speech>

As I stated, much of the diagnosis and prescription is contained in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.</p> <p>  On the functioning of the hospital system, as the Secretary General correctly pointed out, we have a relatively undifferentiated hospital system which has two channels seeking to be serviced within one set of architecture.  The elective or scheduled care programme is competing directly and head to head with the unscheduled or emergency pathway in hospitals that are often operating at 115% bed capacity versus an international norm of 85%.  This year, for example, we are seeing a 7% increase in attendance at emergency departments, with a higher percentage among the over 65 years cohort who typically have a greater requirement for admission and stay.  Until we do some of the things that are specified in the Sl&aacute;intecare report and have the benefit of the capacity review the Department is progressing and which is in near conclusion and begin to implement it and, consequently, bring a degree of rationality - not rationalisation - to the way we provide elective care, on the one hand, and emergent or urgent care, on the other hand, with differently organised application of resources, we will not have a truly efficient hospital system. </p> <p>  In addition, we need to shift to more effective delivery of primary care and greater utilisation of primary care hubs - I prefer to think of them as diagnostic facilities, rather than primary care centres, in which allied health professionals can deliver therapies and so on - and remove much of the burden that is being inappropriately assumed by the acute hospital system, typically at greater expense than could be delivered elsewhere.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report talks about the transitional funding needed to achieve this and I do not believe we will get to the type of health care system we need until we do this.  The Committee on the Future of Health Care does not believe this either.  We and the committee are, therefore, saying we agree with each other. </p> <p>  As the Minister indicated, interim steps can be taken.  We have the discussion about appropriate levels of discharge at weekends.  The vast majority of patients who are discharged from hospitals are discharged to their homes, not another care facility.  We need to make sure in every case that this flow is optimised.  This is a constant battle in which hospital managers and clinical directors are engaged to ensure patient flow is constantly attended to, day in and day out. </p> <p>  General practitioners, in common with all heath professionals, have experienced a change in the nature of demand and expectation from patients and the health system.  They see particular demand and, as the Chairman indicated, we have a particular age profile that is against us.  There is no doubt that a degree of disenchantment arises.  Let us accept that there is a strong perception of unfairness in the way the burden of the financial emergency measures in the public interest were aligned.  I hope all of these matters can be addressed through the ongoing talks and dialogue.  All of the issues I outlined play against us, however.</p> <p>  The general practitioner has probably the most important and difficult job in health care and the term "general practitioner" downplays the importance of the role.  The generalist, as the gatekeeper, is the most important person in the entire health care system.  I occasionally use health care services and I have relationships with some specialists as well as a general practitioner and I have always said my most important health care relationship is with my general practitioner.  That is true of the entire country.  Strategically and tactically, we need to go through the process that the Secretary General has described, bring that process to a conclusion and create an optimism about the future of general practice that will need more general practitioners to stay and fewer of them to go.  This will not be an easy or quick process, however. </p></speech>

I am not new to this game and I have been at this a long time.  My question remains.  If I were to attend an overcrowded accident and emergency department tomorrow morning, could I find out why it is overcrowded?  I guarantee I would find out whether patients are bypassing their general practitioners, there is a lack of services or there are either no GPs or not enough of them.  Are these the reasons?  I will give an example of a case I dealt with in recent weeks involving a patient who had been referred again and again to an emergency department while awaiting a major orthopaedic procedure.  The person was repeatedly referred to the hospital and discharged again, which is crazy.  We will never solve our problems if continue to act like this.  I have reason to believe that this is not the only such case.  While I do not want to be critical, we need to do something to address the issues.</p> <p>  As regards age profile, Ireland does not have the worst age profile in Europe by a long shot.  This argument is trotted out regularly.  Romania probably has a better age profile than Ireland but we have far more young people than many other countries in Europe. </p> <p>  On bed capacity, I remember being in the health system when bed occupancy exceeded 100% and some wise guy asked whether there were two people in one bed.  That was not the case but turnover was faster, more effective and more efficient. </p></speech>

What I am saying is that 25 years ago, we were able to deal with these issues effectively and we are no longer able to do so.  We appear to be muscle-bound in the sense that we are spending more money per capita on health than many other countries in Europe and globally but we are not delivering.  As a result, the quality of service is declining, public confidence in the system is waning and those at the coalface in the health service are being abused daily by virtue of the criticism directed at them for issues that are not their fault.</p> <p>  I do not intend to listen to the same story over and over again at meetings as I could be better occupied elsewhere.  I ask that my questions be dealt with as a matter of urgency. </p></speech>

I very much appreciate the response provided, which focused on employment, the national disability strategy and housing.  Other areas could have been referenced but I asked for three areas to be highlighted.  I will watch to see how the health service, namely, the Department and Health Service Executive, advocates and follows up on these three areas because real value can be secured in health when people are able to operate outside the health system.</p> <p>  I also asked about the 1,200 young people with disabilities who are in nursing homes, the section 38 and 39 organisations and personal assistance services.  On the 1,200 young people in nursing homes, I appreciate the HSE engagement in this area in recent times, including the work it is doing with the Disability Federation of Ireland and others.  Referring to this group, the response states that while a substantial level of this vulnerable group falls into the above category, it is critically important to note that this intervention can also be an appropriate care option where persons concerned have clinically assessed complex medical and social care needs requiring this form of support.  I am not comfortable with this response.  I fully accept, however, that many of the individuals concerned have complex and critical clinical and medical needs.</p><p> We are putting people aged 30, 40, 50 and 60 into nursing homes where the average length of stay for a resident, who is typically in his or her 80s and beyond, before death occurs is some two years.  Such settings are absolutely inappropriate for younger people who have an expectation of many years of life ahead of them.  I asked about the necessity of ensuring there is a programme of decongregation from nursing homes for such patients, the response to which took off in the direction of discussing the decongregation process in respect of patients with intellectual disabilities.  That is not what I was asking about, although, in fairness, the response does refer to the identification in the report of the number of people inappropriately placed in nursing homes.  There seems to be a fixation on the notion that decongregation relates only to intellectual disability services.  The latter is undoubtedly an issue and progress in that regard has been slower that any of us would have anticipated, although I understand some 200 people are being moved.  However, we have an utterly ironic situation where somebody working in one HSE office is doing his or her damnedest to get a person out of a congregated setting while, at the same time, a staff member in the next office is offering a congregated setting placement to somebody who has never lived in one before.  This problem must be progressed more stridently and I am interested in any observations the Minister or his officials might have in that regard.</p><p> In regard to sections 38 and 39 organisations, many of the relevant issues have already been ventilated this morning.  Last June, I asked whether the Department would adequately, and in a timely fashion, deal with the negative impact of pay increases on the delivery of services by organisations funded under section 39.  I am amazed to read in the response I received today that under the provisions of the section 39 grant, there is no stipulation as to what proportion is to be allocated to pay and what proportion to the funding of other aspects of the service provision.  This avoids the fact, which was acknowledged in the answer given the last day, that it is up to section 39 organisations to negotiate salaries with their staff as part of their employment relationships and within the overall funding available for the delivery of agreed services.  A service level agreement, SLA, is not about handing over some money and asking that an organisation does the best it can with it, and rightly so.  Rather, it is a case of allocating X funding and setting out the outputs and outcomes that are required in return.  Whether or not we are talking about a public service organisation in the sense of its coming under the FEMPI legislation, those organisations are funded under the section 39 provisions because they provide a public service.</p><p> The crunch issue is the impact on the delivery of quality services, and that has been acknowledged by the Director General and the Secretary General.  Mr. O'Brien noted earlier that while there were concurrent cuts to the section 39 organisations going back to the early days of the recession, as pay levels have been restored, the HSE has not had its funding increased to reflect that reality.  The Secretary General made the same point today that was made the last day, namely, that the resolution is not likely to be a unified or one-size-fits-all model, which is how, traditionally, the matter was dealt with on the other side.  I see no evidence, even though it was invited, of any engagement having taken place with these organisations.  I do not contradict who the employer is, but there is a contract between the State and those employers to deliver a quantum of service.  That arrangement is in jeopardy, to a greater or lesser extent, because of the migration of staff and, in certain organisations, the churning of staff.  In some cases, the organisation is effectively a training place for people who will go on to work elsewhere.  That is fine for the individuals involved but not for the delivery of services.  We must grab this issue by the scruff of the neck and make sure it is addressed in a practical way.  We can no longer tolerate this type of roundabout process where the organisations are saying they do not have the money and the unions know that is the case, but still they all trot down to engage in discussions.  The one person who is not in the room in that scenario is the person who can give account for the making available or not making available of the funding.  The whole process is becoming a circus that does not lead to anything.  The Department must take a strong hand in the matter if the problem is to be resolved.</p><p> The other issue I raised was in regard to personal assistance, PA, provision.  I see now that some of the detailed information I sought in this regard was available all along within the HSE.  According to the executive's key performance indicators for service planning, there are just under 1,000 people in receipt of one to five PA hours per week; just over 500 availing of six to ten hours per week; 400 getting 11 to 20 hours; 240 receiving between 21 and 40 hours; and 67 persons in receipt of 60 plus PA hours per week.  It seems there is an absolute reticence on the part of the HSE and the Department to set that situation out clearly.  The figures show that only a handful of people are getting what amounts to one whole-time equivalent worth of PA hours.  If we average the whole lot, only a tiny number are receiving seven hours of care per day.  What is the problem with saying clearly that the service is providing five or six hours per week to X number of people?  Of course, such a provision is not within the spirit or meaning of what a personal assistance service should be.</p><p> Mr. O'Brien noted that the Sl&aacute;inte Care report provides the diagnosis and the prescription for the delivery of health care, but that does not really solve our problem.  Will the resources and the steel necessary to dispense the prescription be in place?  Saying we know what the problem is and what the answer should be does not mean we actually have a solution.  The answer is that, as a State, we must front up to the problems we face in the delivery of health care by acknowledging the resources that are needed and the commitment and steel that are required to deliver those resources in a context where hard decisions must be made.</p><p> Mr. O'Brien spoke very well about general practice, which should rightly be regarded as a critical specialism in its own right.  We often think of the GP as the handyman or handywoman, offering patients a bit of everything before sending them on somewhere else.  In fact, general practice functions as the linchpin of care for people.</p><p>It is important to talk it up as a core specialty in the health service.</p></speech>

I am seeking a breakdown of the funding in the mental health division that will be used to cover the cost of agency staff and external placements - people who are not being looked after in the service but for whom care costs are being paid.</p> <p>  Key performance indicators have been set for the cancer programme, as have targets for early detection, but already, according to the mid-term review figures, the HSE is falling short.  In the light of the fact that the fund is not quite &euro;7 million next year, will it be sufficient to hit the key performance indicators and catch up next year on those missed this year?  In my estimation, it will not and I sincerely hope I will not hear that the targets have been revised downwards.  We will only want to hear how the HSE has been able to meet its targets.</p> <p>  We have discussed at length the GP contract.  I have some knowledge of negotiating in a multi-union environment and understand how challenging it can be.  I can see wry smiles on the faces of the representatives from the HSE who will be more than familiar with this issue.  Can they give us an idea of how many hours have been spent in the meetings that have taken place to date and do they have a work plan?  I fully appreciate that negotiations can be extended, but it seems that the Minister and the Government have hung a great deal on the conclusion of the talks on the GP contract which might, if one were cynical, lead someone to think they have just established who to blame if the targets set for next year are not met.  I sincerely hope, however, that is not the case.  I would also like to know the grades of the staff involved in the negotiations.  I have had experience of turning up at negotiations with people who did not necessarily have the authority to negotiate, which was not very helpful.  </p> <p>   In the light of the committee's report, the compassionate access programme to medicinal cannabis will be considered next week.  When will the programme be available and will legislation be required to give it effect?  If so, is preparation of the legislation near completion?  </p> <p>  The average cost of home care is &euro;23.20 per hour, the figure provided by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Clearly, a home help and a home care worker are not paid anything near that rate, in either the private or the public sector.  Will the officials explain the reason for having an hourly rate of &euro;23.20 because, as I remember from a few years ago, the rate ranged from &euro;13.95 and &euro;16.35 per hour.  The figure provided is a considerable percentage above that rate.  My feeling is that this rate of pay is in the for-profit sector and that the headroom is, in fact, their profit because we know that they have big cars and offices and all the rest.  There is an emphasis on home care and treating people at home, but it strikes me that we will not be able to afford to fund many hours of home care if we keep increasing the average spend.</p></speech>

My colleague, Deputy Bernard J. Durkan asked about the reasons for overcrowding.  I know that it seems obvious, but is there evidence that the delay in discharging patients due to be discharged to a nursing home, as in normal circumstances they would not be able to return home, is due to families delaying the start of the fair deal scheme arrangement?  It is my understanding the fair deal scheme arrangement only kicks in once a person enters the nursing home system.  I have heard that families do not expedite the move to a nursing home because the family assets have not been transferred to a place where the HSE cannot access them.  I have also heard stories on how to work the five-year clawback period to move assets out of the State's reach.  A person is left in hospital for a year and then something is cobbled together to meet requirements.  If there is evidence that this practice is widespread, has there been a move to extend the clawback period to seven years?  Seven years would be a long time to cobble something together to try to avoid the clawback.  Is this just a couple of instances of which I have heard and is it the case that the practice is not widespread?</p> <p>  I spoke to the Minister earlier about the expansion of the number of primary care centres from 43 to more than 100.  He mentioned that there was no point in providing facilities that closed at 5 p.m.  Senator John Dolan quoted Mr. O'Brien as saying, "As I stated, much of the diagnosis and prescription is contained in the Sl&aacute;intecare report."  One of the key aspects of the report is a reorientation to provide health services in a primary care setting.  One can have all of the diagnoses and prescriptions one wants, but unless one does what one is told to do and swallows the tablets, one will not get better.  We can have the prescription, but we need to implement it.  A key part is the expansion of the number of primary care centres, to which Mr. O'Brien referred as primary care hubs.  That is the direction taken in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  We discussed diagnostic centres in the community being aligned with primary care centres in order that people would be able to find out what was wrong with them.  As we are six months into the 20-month Sl&aacute;intecare process, what progress has been made?  Does the HSE have specific actions to expand the number of primary care centres in light of the Sl&aacute;intecare report which recommends expanded opening hours and access to diagnostics to assess the impact on the level of hospital overcrowding?</p> <p>  With regard to the Meath Hospital community care unit, the process has been delayed by more than 18 months in the move to Mount Carmel hospital because, as I understand it, Belvilla nursing home had to be refurbished and the residents moved to the Mount Carmel hospital step-down unit.  They were told they would be there for nine months, but they are still there two years later.  Deputy Bernard J. Durkan spoke about blockages in the system.  This is a prime example, unless, again, I am reading it incorrectly.  I would be happy to receive a comprehensive response after the meeting, if the information is not to hand.</p><p> There appears to be a fee being applied to venesections by hospital management in certain hospitals.  As many know, this is used as a treatment for haemochromatosis.  We have quite a heavy disease burden of haemochromatosis in Ireland.  I understand medical card patients are exempt from the &euro;80 fee and people with private health insurance have their fees covered by health insurance.  There is a cohort in between who do not qualify for a medical card and do not have private health insurance. </p><p> Venesection is an important part of people's treatment.  I have heard from the Irish Haemochromatosis Association and various patients that people are spreading out the distance between their venesections because they cannot afford the &euro;80 fee.  Obviously, there are negative health impacts following a failure to attend for venesection when due.  </p><p> Why is this policy being implemented?  Is it on a hospital by hospital basis?  Is it something the HSE is doing?  If it is being implemented by the HSE, are there any figures on the net financial gain?  I would imagine that the processing of an &euro;80 fee costs the HSE a lot of money, based on information I have seen.  Are we imposing a fee on people who require treatment?  Does that have any other effect, aside from poor patient outcomes?  Is there any financial benefit?  Is the HSE doing anything about it?</p></speech>

I will not commit to resolving it.  Mr. O'Brien could talk to the GP contract process and the compassionate access scheme for cannabis.</p> <p>  There are two issues in respect of section 39 agencies.  We could concentrate on one or the other.  One is the question of public service and parity with the public service.  As Mr. O'Brien said, that has quite wide implications.  Although section 39 agencies are a very significant component of the health service, there are other sectors across government whereby voluntary agencies are funded from the public purse.  It is not possible to unilaterally to take a view on that.  The matter will have to be addressed centrally.</p> <p>  The second issue the Senator flagged concerned whether cost increases within a section 39 agency affect funding.  Without answering the first question, Mr. O'Brien said the HSE and Department of Health had not received funding for restoration.  The mechanism for the funding relationship is the service level agreement which involves individual discussions rather than sector wide discussions.  That is very much predicated on individual discussions not being able to set public service wide pay policy.  They can only deal with the realities of costs as they present themselves. </p> <p>  On compassionate access-----</p></speech>

This will play its way through the industrial relations mechanisms.  Some employers are already involved with the WRC.  The consequence of that will have to be one which is the subject of discussion.  People will have to establish whether they had pay taken from them.  Not all employees in section 39 agencies had pay  taken from them.  The implications of that for their current relationship with their employer will have to be determined.</p></speech>

Rather, I have focused solely on where this impacts on service provision.  I have avoided talking about pay restoration.  There is a plethora of legislation to support staff and employees, including trade unions and other bodies.  I am considering this solely in terms of the impact of the delivery of the service.  We had section 38 and 39 agencies before the recession.  Some staff working in them were not public servants and this was not an issue.</p></speech>

Pensions, holiday leave and other issues have been regularly ventilated over the years.  Some progress has been made.</p></speech>

The default is to talk exclusively about employees.  I am not unsympathetic, but we have to treat people fairly.  My bottom line is that this is having an impact on organisations which are delivering services which they are contracted to deliver through SLAs.  That is where we need the focus to be kept on.</p></speech>

It also provides for mechanisms to enable discussion about the consequences of any mediated judgments which might be made about this pay issue.  The Senator's question is, fundamentally, about pay, which is to be addressed within the established machinery of the State.  The service level arrangement provides mechanisms which enable us to engage in those discussions with section 39 bodies, a number of which are exercising those mechanisms.</p> <p>  Obviously, we are concerned, in general terms, if, for any reason, the financial viability of a key service provider becomes jeopardised.  That would be true not just of this but any other situation.  From time to time this does happen.  Where necessary, we engage with our colleagues in the Department of Health and otherwise.  </p> <p>  We cannot make decisions which have the effect of turning voluntary bodies into State bodies.  We do not have the authority to do so and I am not sure it would be a good idea.  </p></speech>

I have set this out as an issue where it impacts on the delivery of services.  The impact would be different in agencies where there is easier mobility or whatever.  The impact will be more intense across certain grades of staff.  I have only framed this issue in the context of the difficulty in recruiting and retaining staff to provide the service.</p></speech>

We are not talking about two different problems; rather, we are focusing on different components of the consequence of that problem.  We have a shared understanding of the underlying concern of the section 39 bodies and their staff and service users.  The only way to fundamentally change that dynamic to one which creates greater mobility or the greater desire for mobility is if we can resolve the causation factor which is a differential in pay which has now emerged.</p></speech>

I could try to draw up an estimate based on the hours.  I have a sense of how much diligent engagement is taking place in this regard.  On the HSE side, the engagement is led by an assistant national director who has years of experience in contract negotiations.  On the Department of Health side, it is being led by a senior official.  There have been weekly meetings over the relevant period.  At one stage, I had a running total of the number of meetings.  I can get that for the Deputy and share it.  There is extensive engagement and further extensive engagement is planned across the coming weeks.  There are regular contacts as part of the working process that is under way.</p> <p>  After the Health Products Regulatory Authority published its report on compassionate access to cannabis in February, the Minister established an expert group chaired by Dr. M&aacute;ir&iacute;n Ryan of the Health Information and Quality Authority.  There is significant clinical involvement in the group, which has been developing operational, clinical and practice guidelines to guide access to the programme.  The group has conducted a targeted consultation on its draft guidelines and is due to finalise those guidelines shortly.  In parallel with that, officials from the Department of Health are working on secondary legislation to underpin the programme.  We do not believe primary legislation will be required.  We are also working on the logistics of sorting suitable supplies of cannabis-based products.  If the programme is to work, we will need to have a proper supply chain for cannabis-based products.  All of those initiatives are under way at the moment.</p></speech>

She will get those answers in writing, if that is okay.</p> <p>  Senator Dolan raised the specific issue of the current way in which highly intensive clinical care needs are being addressed.  It is evident that there is a difficulty in providing for such needs in environments which are designed around the needs of older people.  The Senator described eloquently the nature of the establishments in question.  The answer that was given to the Senator sought to make it clear that certain patients, or people who need care, have clinically assessed complex medical and social care needs which mean they cannot be cared for in their own homes and require care in other settings.  The answer in question referred to such cases.  The numbers involved are relatively small.  The challenge we face is to determine how we can provide care in settings that are more specific to the needs of this particular subset of patients.  Factors like geographic distribution have to be considered in this context.  By and large, this is currently done on an undifferentiated basis in mixed use facilities, the primary purpose of which is to provide for the care of the elderly.  Clearly, we need to find a different solution.  The particular needs of these people unfortunately mean that the solution in question cannot involve providing care to individuals located in their own homes.  The nature of the resources that are required means that a number of patients need to be in receipt of this care.  I acknowledge that we do not yet have the right answer.  Our social care division is focusing on this issue.</p> <p>  I do not doubt that in a small number of cases, decisions on participation in and co-operation with the fair deal application process are influenced by particular family dynamics and issues of long-term economic interest.  No evidence is currently available to us to suggest that this is a widespread issue.  It is reported in very few cases that those experiencing delayed discharges are not co-operating with the fair deal application process.  I do not suggest that such cases are not important because any case in which a hospital bed is delayed or inappropriately used for a number of days denies more appropriate care to a patient who is probably on a trolley in the accident and emergency department of the hospital in question.  I do not think this is a very widespread issue.  The number of cases is quite small, but it often seems that it is much greater because these stories grow legs in the telling.  The evidence does not appear to exist to support the idea that there are many such cases.</p></speech>

Rather than kicking in when the person walks out the door, maybe it should kick in when he or she is fit to go elsewhere.  I wonder whether that is a possible way of trying to address this issue.  Mr. O'Brien has said that it probably accounts for a small number of cases, but I would say there are varying degrees of it as well.</p></speech>

They want to know why they cannot get an equivalent amount of financial support in cash.  Such financial supports are available in other countries.  We cannot have both schemes running together.  The fair deal exclusively covers the cost of nursing home support.  As the Deputy will be aware, it is set out in legislation and so on.  It does not address the question of keeping people well in the community.  We cannot risk tearing down the existing scheme or starting to interfere with it.  We are going to create a separate independent scheme that will mirror the fair deal scheme.  The exclusive intention of this scheme will be to support people to live well in their own homes.  To answer the Deputy's question, at present there is no facility for the fair deal to kick in when a person is assessed as being in need of nursing home care - it can only kick in when the person avails of nursing home care.</p></speech>

I understand that it would seem ridiculous to start tearing down the legislative underpinning of the existing fair deal scheme.  Now that a new scheme is being proposed, which I think is a great idea, the Government has an opportunity to provide for it to kick in at the point of discharge.  If the family home is going to be used to fund it, perhaps that money could start being used up at the point of discharge from hospital.  This would avoid delays.  The only purpose of this is to expedite people getting into the appropriate setting.</p></speech>

It is in its infancy.  We have just completed the public consultation process and we are starting to design the scheme.  All of those issues will be considered.  We cannot pre-empt that consideration by jumping ahead and saying we will discourage people from trying to avoid being discharged by providing a financial incentive to stay at home rather than gong to a nursing home.  We cannot do that under the current arrangement.</p></speech>

I assure the Deputy that it will be considered very closely in the design of the new scheme.  I would like to respond to a couple of other questions while I have the floor.  I do not have an answer to Deputy O'Reilly's very specific question about the &euro;23.20 average cost of home care.  Mr. O'Brien has already said that the Deputy will get a detailed answer to that question in writing.  Obviously, the hourly payment is one part of the cost of a home care hour.  Travel, management and associated costs are also paid out.  I will let Mr. O'Brien follow up on that with a more detailed breakdown of the costs.  I do not have that information to hand.  Deputy O'Connell asked about other anomalies within the fair deal scheme.  I want to confirm that there are no plans to extend the current five-year arrangement to seven years.  I agree with Mr. O'Brien that because there are over 23,000 people availing of the scheme, of course there will be isolated incidents.  We are not aware of any pattern emerging in this sphere.</p></speech>

I do not have the information she is seeking to hand.  I will ask my colleague, Mr. Woods, to address the question of hospital-based venesection charges in a moment.  The Deputy also asked about movement in the direction of the recommendations in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  Budget day was last week.  The Department will shortly issue us with a letter of determination - I think that is the correct terminology - which will allow us to bring to a conclusion our service planning process, which we submit for ministerial approval.  It is through that vehicle that we will be able to express what we will do in 2018 to move us in the direction of some of the Sl&aacute;intecare recommendations.  Until that process has been completed, I will be unable to say exactly what we will be doing.  We have not yet reached the point at which we can know that.</p><p>Clearly, increased utilisation of primary care would have been a priority, even without the Sl&aacute;intecare report, but the report adds greater focus to that.</p></speech>

First, it is an interesting area to consider because it is something that could be carried out in a primary care setting.  The review of the model of care for haemochromatosis clearly points that out and there has been some interaction on it.  The charge of &euro;80 that the Deputy mentioned would be the public charge for a day case or overnight case.  It would not be charged to, or paid by, a medical card holder and may be covered by insurance.  I do not have data with me on the practice on venesection across all hospitals but I will get it and refer back to the Deputy on the practice.</p></speech>

I was first informed about it in June or July.  It appears to be something that is emerging in certain hospitals and is driven by the management of those hospitals.  I agree that venesection can be carried out in the primary care setting.  That will be great in the future but currently patients are being charged for it in certain hospitals and they were not charged for it in the past.  I hear that the patients are lengthening the time between their treatments and, as a result, will potentially cost the health service more in the long run because of complications.  It is something that should be urgently addressed.  It is a little late if it results in admissions.</p></speech>

I know that the information I sought is available in the HSE.  It relates to the HSE's key performance indicators for service planning for 2017.  I will not go through the litany again, but it concludes with a figure of more than 2,000 for people receiving personal assistance.  However, almost 1,000 of them are receiving between one and five hours per week.  A small number, 67, are in receipt of more than 60 hours per week.  I asked how many people have one whole-time equivalent or more.  It is curious that I was not given that precise information in the reply.  Is there a reticence to say what is happening with that PA budget?  It is hard to believe that 1,000 of the just over 2,000 people who receive support are getting less than six hours per week.  That is clearly not, by any measure, a personal assistance service that would seek to do what is set out in the reply with regard to self determination and the ability to be out and about.  That is an issue.</p></speech>

To give the broader picture, in 2017 some 1.4 million personal assistant hours were provided for 2,400 people.  With regard to the data question on the assignment of PAs, which is important, it is collated on an aggregate basis at present.  The HSE can provide gross figures for the number of PA hours and the number of persons in receipt of personal assistance.  The HSE is currently developing a national system that will facilitate better management information reporting in the disability sector, which will then resolve the question posed.  In the context of the agreed 2017 national service plan, the HSE expects there will be a total of 1.4 million PA hours provided for more than 2,000 people with disability, representing an increase of 100,000 hours over the 2016 target of 1.3 million hours.</p> <p>  Second, in respect of the expected delivery of service for 2018, service planning processes are currently under way given that the budget for 2018 has just been presented to the Oireachtas.  It is not possible, therefore, to give the number of PA hours that will be provided at present.  However, PA supports will continue to be a core aspect of the service provision funded and provided by the HSE.  It is important to clarify that a key principle underpinning the provision of PA services relates to service user self-direction, in terms of the locus of control being with the person accessing the support.  I feel strongly about this.  The overarching aim of the PA service is to facilitate individuals to maximise their capacity to live full and independent lives.  The service aims to provide for this by way of supporting people to live in community based settings and to access facilities and services, including engagement with community based education, training and employment service providers.</p> <p>  The HSE and I accept the value of further developing the role so there is a consistency of approach and to ensure that the principle of self-direction is universally understood and applied.  The social care disability operations team at national level will lead a process to achieve this in consultation with the service users and service providers.</p></speech>

I asked supplementary questions on the basis of that response.  As I said, there is information from the management information system in the HSE that answers the first part of my question, but it was not provided here.  With regard to self-direction, the service aims to facilitate individuals to maximise their capacity to live full and independent lives and to achieve this by supporting people to live in community based settings and access facilities and services, including engagement with community based education, training and employment.  Will somebody tell me how a person getting between one and five hours of support a week can do that?  There are 996 such people, almost half the cohort concerned.  How can five hours per week provide something that ambitious?  It cannot.</p></speech>

However, I understand that the fundamental requirement to answer the question as fully as possible is the implementation of the new management information reporting tool.  Notwithstanding that, I will ask the division to take another look at the question.</p></speech>

There are ten approved posts in obstetrics-gynaecology which are occupied on a temporary basis.  A report produced in 2003 set a target of 180 consultants in this area by 2012.  I understand the number was 130 at the last count.  At that time we spoke about increasing the number by ten per year thereafter.  I am aware that four vacancies were advertised recently.  There were three applicants for the four vacancies.  I understand that one of the applicants was already in an existing permanent post so in real terms there were only two applicants for the four vacancies.  Are we facing difficulty in obstetrics-gynaecology with sourcing people for permanent posts?</p><p>Are we looking at how we can deal with this issue?  It is an area that will face major challenges in the next few years.  Is there a long-term plan to deal with it?</p></speech>

The model of care for obstetrics, undertaken by the obstetrics programme and now in the possession of the women and infants programme to implement the national maternity strategy, identifies the need for increased consultant numbers of up to 100 over a period of time.  That is clear.  Some recruitment took place this year and a small number of posts were filled.  The service plan for 2018 makes some provision in the area of the maternity office and maternity services.  As the director general has said, we will assess this piece of work further when we see it.  In response to the question on workforce planning, the women and infants programme itself is examining workforce planning across all grades for the provision of these specific services.  This office was founded relatively recently, at the beginning of this year.  There is also a wider agenda for workforce planning which Ms Mannion may perhaps discuss later.</p></speech>

This will pose a major challenge.  When four posts were advertised only two new people in real terms came in to apply for them.  That is a difficulty for us this year.</p></speech>

We have certainly had problems with the numbers of applicants, and not just in obstetrics.  In recent months, however, the numbers of applicants across the system has improved somewhat.  This is clearly something that we are going to have to work on.  As the Secretary General mentioned, part of the central challenge here is to create attractive posts in care settings.  Getting and retaining staff in that area is critical for us. and our workforce planning, both on the women and infants programme and on a wider level, will have to focus on that.  Our number of consultants has gone up by 88 overall since the start of this year so we are making some headway in recruitment.</p></speech>

One concerns the funding mechanisms for primary care centres as  I understand that there are several different mechanisms to bring these centres into being.  Could the witnesses address how these mechanisms function and which is the most successful or commonly used to bring a primary care centre to completion?</p> <p>  My second question concerns private care in public hospitals.  We had a discussion about how patients have the right to decide whether or not to trigger their private health insurance upon arriving in a public hospital.  I would also like to hear the witnesses' views on the Sl&aacute;intecare report, which proposes that there should be a separation of private care from public hospitals.  How do they see this proposal panning out?  This feeds into the issue of elective-only hospitals, another proposal in the Sl&aacute;intecare report, which could serve to take the pressure off acute hospitals trying to supply both acute and elective services with the former encroaching on the elective beds.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.982" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Breslin" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017101800002#S01000"><p>There are three main funding mechanisms for primary care centres.  The traditional pattern for both primary care centres and health centres was that the HSE would build the centre and then, on occasions in the past, invite GPs in.  The HSE stilll retains this model and it is an important string to the bow of the executive, particularly in areas where the private sector may not want to get involved.  In poorer or in rural areas, then, it remains an option for the HSE to deliver a primary care centre through its capital programme.  The second mechanism is to lease primary care centres, which involves the HSE going to the market with requirements for specific square footage in a specific town or urban area and seeking a rental agreement from the private sector to make that primary care centre available over 20 or 25 years.  This generally also includes a specification for what other components might also be provided in the building, particularly GP participation.  This approach has been broadly successful and there has been much interest in it in many areas.  There have also been parts of the country, however, where the HSE has sought to move ahead with this but has not got the kind of response from the private sector that it might have hoped for.  The final mechanism has not yet come on stream but will do so shortly.  This involves developing primary care centres as public private partnerships, PPPs.  Instead of a lease, the HSE pays back the cost of capital to the developer over an extended period.</p> <p>  The distinctions between the three mechanisms are probably of more interest as financial instruments.  In every case we get a building built for purpose which we have to pay back over an extended period of time.  All three options have to pass the same tests.  They have to pass a cost-benefit analysis, for example, establishing that it is an economic way to deliver the infrastructure, and they all do so.  Having a combination of mechanisms is helpful because if we were to put all of our eggs into one basket we might find that it might not deliver in the certain parts of the country where we need it to.  While we have not yet had any delivery of primary care centres through the PPPs, we feel that using a range of mechanisms is a good way to proceed.</p> <p>  In response to the Chairman's question on private and public practice, I am aware that my own boss has just arrived and he sets policy in this particular area.  From a personal point of view all I can say is that this is an issue I have had to grapple with right across my career.  When I sit down with colleagues from other jurisdictions I find that they do not face the same complexities as those facing the Department of Health in Ireland, particularly with regard to the presence of private practice in public hospitals and to the differential incentives for different actors in our system.  In an ideal world, then, we would not start from here.  Everybody's life, my own included, would be a little simpler if we had a more straightforward system.  Private practice is embedded in our heath service: 50% of our population has health insurance and we have about 20% private practice in our public facilities, which is the limit.  Private health care is a significant feature of the healthcare landscape in Ireland and we cannot wish that away.  We have to find the means of moving from where we currently are to the kind of vision set out in the Sl&aacute;intecare report of single-tier universal access.  The Minister's initiative last Friday to set up an independent group to examine this is, I think, the right way forward.  Even if we can agree on the destination there are many different ways of getting there, some of which might have more unintended consequences than others.  It is an important first step, then, that we undertake this piece of work between now and next summer so that we can fully understand this matter before starting to change anything.  </p> <p>  The Department broadly agrees with the principle of elective-only hospitals and it is something that we would like to see brought forward in terms of our bed capacity assessment and our ten-year capital planning.  On the question as to how this might work when it comes to new builds, the experience internationally seems to be that while one can certainly build an elective-only hospital on a stand-alone site, others have been established on the site of an existing hospital.  In these cases, however, they have been opened as dedicated, completely self-sufficient buildings that are in no way dependent on the rest of the hospital for diagnostics or beds.  They can be run very well on that basis.  This also allows for the possibility of cross-cover, meaning that if a patient deteriorates, for example, they could be brought over into an ICU.  Broadly, then, that would be the preferable model.  This is not a wholly new idea, of course.  We have single-speciality hospitals that have operated on an elective-only model over the years - I mentioned Cappagh and the Eye and Ear hospital earlier.  This has brought a predictability and productivity to their work.</p><p>If we were able to develop that more widely, it could give us a very strong basis on which to tackle waiting lists.  I, too, am broadly supportive of that and hope to see progress made on it in the planning work one will see over the next few months on capital, bed capacity and the implementation plan for Sl&aacute;intecare.</p></speech>

I fundamentally agree with everything the Secretary General said regarding elective hospitals.  In fact, I would perhaps go a touch further and say we will not meet our current challenges without them.  The answer on primary care centres and their funding models is absolutely complete.  We do need to retain all three tracks if we are to achieve our objectives.  I have to declare an interest in that, as a child of the NHS, I bring a certain philosophical approach to the nature of public-private health care that colours my opinions to some extent.  I have no hesitation in fully grasping and attaching myself to the notion that public hospitals should exist for public patients.  The challenge is that the journey from where we are, which is not a great place, to where we need to be is quite a crunchy one that will require the making of a number of difficult choices, not least of which is on the extent to which the funding of the current public health system is intertwined with &euro;600 million or &euro;700 million in income from privately insured patients.  It could not withstand the simple loss of that income.  The reality is that the income comes at a price of considerable subsidy in many instances to private health insurers.  The <i>per diem</i>rates paid to a public hospital, by comparison with the rates that would be paid to a private hospital on a fully absorbed cost basis for the same treatment, leave a big delta in the sense of the public system picking up the price of the private health care in many instances.<br/><br/>The third reality is that the private health care system is simply not big enough to absorb or capable enough right now of absorbing all the private work in the public system.  One must ask whether it would be desirable to create conditions in which the private system would grow to the required extent and how that might act as a competitive magnet for the key staff we need to provide for the large acute hospital system.  These are just some of the questions that need to be thought through as we decide which route we take to get from here to there.</p></speech>

He was not indispensable in that we kept going but I thank him for coming back.  He probably picked up on the question I was asking on primary care centres.  To be parochial, over several years there have been several runs at trying to develop primary care centres in Ennis, and each has failed to date.  Perhaps Mr. Breslin could give me an update on that whenever he gets a chance.</p> <p>  I now call on the Minister to comment.</p></speech>

I see, however, that the health service is very ably represented by the director general, the Secretary General, the two Ministers of State - Deputies Jim Daly and Finian McGrath - and the other officials from the HSE.</p> <p>  I wish to comment on the conversation on public and private services.  From a policy direction point of view, I fully support the direction of travel that Sl&aacute;intecare wishes to take in this regard.  I have heard the Taoiseach talk publicly about wishing to see public and private care decoupled.  For all the reasons the director general outlined, however, there is an obvious reason Sl&aacute;intecare is a ten-year plan.  It is because there is a significant amount of disentanglement that would need to be considered.</p> <p>  The second point, on which the director general is again entirely correct, is that the proportion of Irish people who have private health insurance is extraordinary large, amounting to nearly half our population.  One should compare the figure with those for other jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom.  There is a very different culture.  I am very conscious that there are very many people in this country who take out private health insurance not because they can comfortably afford to do so - far from it - but because of their genuine concern over being able to gain access, in a time-efficient manner, to the public health service.  One would hope that as we move on the Sl&aacute;intecare journey and towards investing in driving down waiting times and improving access, as we are now, the knock-on effect will be that the private market will shrink in size.  That is ultimately where Sl&aacute;intecare wants us to get to, and it is where I want to get to.  In that sense, there are a number of different tracks on which we have to move.</p> <p>  Dr. Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir, the new chairman of the group examining the public-private relationship, brings experience in terms of the development of public sector policy and experience of the health service here, which will be very important.  That his work will not go on and on but, rather, conclude around next summer, should provide us with a very evidence-based analysis of the situation that will help inform the next steps.</p></speech>

From an equity point of view, that is an issue all of us wish to grapple with but there is recognition, including in the comments of the Chairman, that this is a very complex issue.  That is why it should be seen through the prism of a ten-year plan rather than a knee-jerk ideological response.  We have got to get this right.  To get from start to finish is a journey of years rather than an overnight journey.</p></speech>

At the request of the broadcasting and recording services, members are reminded to ensure their mobile telephones are turned off or switched to aeroplane, safe or flight mode, depending on their device, for the duration of the meeting.  It is not sufficient to put telephones on silent mode, as that would maintain a level of interference with the broadcasting system.</p><p>I remind members that the committee will conduct the public session first and then at 11 a.m. we will go into private session for an hour to work on our report as a committee.  Is that agreed? Agreed.  The purpose of today's meeting is to consider the national planning framework.  I welcome the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and his officials to today's meeting.  </p><p> Each member will have five minutes to engage with the Minister.  After five minutes we will move to the next member and I would ask members where possible to stick to that and to respect the time so that each member has an opportunity to speak.  I will call members again at the end.  We will have another round of questions, if there is time.  Before we begin, members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I now call on the Minister to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am joined today by officials Mr. David Walsh, Mr. Paul Hogan and Mr. Niall Cussen.  I welcome the opportunity to meet with the committee today on the draft national planning framework, entitled Ireland 2040: Our Plan.  The Government has been working on this plan since the end of 2014 and there have been public consultations, regional events and debates, including by this committee and other joint committees, feedback from an expert advisory group and over 700 detailed submissions from a whole range of stakeholders.</p><p>The draft national planning framework has now been published for one final period of public consultation. As part of this consultation, a further series of regional seminars are being organised by each of the three regional assemblies, with the first one happening in Waterford this Friday.  The conclusions of this committee will be very valuable in finalising the framework by the end of this year and in tandem with a new ten-year national investment plan.</p><p>The national planning framework is primarily about planning properly for what will be one of the fastest growing economies in Europe over the next couple of decades, focusing development in existing villages, towns and cities and realising the potential of our regions and our rural areas.  There will be at least an extra 1 million people living in the Republic by 2040, taking the population to 5.75 million.  This is a 20% increase.  The all-island population will be roughly 8 million people by 2040.  There will be an extra 600,000 jobs, mainly in the knowledge economy and in services.  We will need at least 500,000 new homes for our growing population, and to meet the different housing needs of future generations.  The population aged over 65 will double to 1.3 million people, or almost 25% of the total population over the next 20 years.</p><p>There are political, economic and environmental challenges to be aware of too.  Brexit is the most obvious one, but also the future of the European Union and how it might evolve and how that might challenge us; the current risks to free trade being posed by the policies of certain countries and how this might impact on areas like foreign direct investment; technology and the changes it will bring, for how we work and where we live, planning for things like remote working, the shared economy, automation and artificial intelligence; communities, and protecting communities as we grow, providing better opportunities as we adapt, regenerating parts of our country that exhibit the signs of disadvantage and unrealised opportunities where we can, and because we must; and climate change.  As recent events remind us, our climate is changing and we need to take both the immediate steps to adapt to those changes and put in train changes to address the drivers of climate change, by de-carbonising our way of life and taking advantage of the many opportunities that come from that.</p><p>The population of Ireland grew by 53,000 people in the year to April 2017.  This is the largest increase since 2008.  It is 1.1% year-on-year growth when the rest of the euro area was essentially static.  Half the daytime population of Ireland&rsquo;s three largest cities travel from outside the cities.  One quarter of Leinster&rsquo;s working population travel into Dublin each day.  In 2016, 230,000 people commuted at least an hour a day each way, a 30% increase in long commutes in just five years.  Just think about what that means for families in terms of quality of life.  If we learnt anything from the so-called Celtic Tiger era, it was that our future does not lie in our people living in one location, and commuting up to 100 km away to work, juggling work and family lives and losing the battle to strike a reasonable balance.  If Ireland continues to develop in the way it always has, with our cities and towns growing fastest at their edges, not in their centres, with our regions and regional cities underperforming, we face a lose-lose strategy for both our urban and rural areas and the people who live and work in them.  Therefore, our national planning framework has to have a vision that will navigate us through these challenges, both the existing ones we know of like revitalising our communities, creating better opportunities, improving quality of life and protecting the environment as well as the challenges that may face us in the future due to developments external to us.</p><p>Building on our strengths, we are in the top ten when it comes to human development, GDP <i>per capita</i>, foreign direct investment and democracy.  However, in tackling the challenges, we fall into the top 20 when it comes to quality of life and environmental performance, particularly the relative carbon footprint <i>per capita</i>compared to our EU neighbours, and we fall into the top 30 when we talk about liveable cities.</p><p>We have undertaken extensive economic and demographic analysis with the help of the ESRI to plot out different scenarios and see which ones make the best use of our resources, our existing communities, our economic, social and environmental opportunities.  We have come up with an approach, outlined in the draft framework, that sets out the most sustainable and balanced vision.  When we look at the growth of 1 million people and where they might live, we have to try to manage that growth between our five big cities, as well as between our three regions.  That means that 25% of national growth should be happening within Dublin, and half of that within the M50.  We will need joined-up planning across the local authorities involved, as well as new long-term land plans, for example the redevelopment of the Long Mile and Naas roads.  It means another 25% of our forecast growth happening in the cities of Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway.  Each will have to effectively double in population size at least.  Much of Limerick&rsquo;s growth should be within the Georgian core, while Waterford has significant potential along the North Quays.</p><p>Half of the total population growth, almost half a million extra people, will happen everywhere else, spread across our villages, towns and wider rural areas.  Another way to look at it is that half of the total anticipated growth will take place on the eastern seaboard and in the midlands, and the other half will take place in the southern, western and northern regions.  This all has significant implications for how we develop our urban and rural places.</p><p>If we think back to that quality of life challenge, we must ensure we are creating lasting communities where people can avail of greater opportunities as well as benefit from better standards of living, including access to high quality education and excellence in healthcare, which are specifically addressed in chapters five and nine.  Recognising that by 2040, a quarter of our population will be over the age of 65 this in turn means planning for a greater level of people with disability or other health needs and their quality of life, within communities.  This includes affordability, being able to live close to work, at an affordable price, so that people can live their lives the way they choose to.  The draft strategy included in this framework addresses all communities and consequently and its implementation is designed to benefit all people, without exception.</p><p>We have had spatial strategies before.  They failed to deliver on their potential, so how will the national planning framework be different?  First, it is going to be aligned across Government Departments and agencies, so there will be coherence between what the framework envisions and what others are planning, be it in regard to schools, hospitals or roads.  For the first time, the national planning framework will align with a ten-year national investment plan.  We are putting our money where our mouth is.  Second, our capital investment will underpin our planning framework so that these plans are real and realisable.  Third, the national framework will be the bedrock or foundation for a new tier of plans at regional and local levels which will provide a coherent and joined-up vision between the different levels of planning, implementation and monitoring.  The framework will be completed this year.</p><p>Next year, our three regions will be tasked with coming up with more specific regional, spatial and economic strategies.  These will be based upon the framework and will set out in more detail what is needed and will be prioritised to deliver on the vision.  Thereafter, city and county plans and local area plans will be based upon those regional plans.  This will be the new hierarchy, and it will be set down in law, through the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2016 that is currently progressing through the D&aacute;il.</p><p>We intend to put in place a smart growth fund to enable regions and local authorities to target growth and development for key areas by competing for additional funding based on the merits of the project and as long as it is in line with the ten-year national investment plan and the national planning framework.  There will also be a more streamlined approach to the strategic management of a very considerable landbank of publicly owned lands in and around our key cities and towns.  In too many cases they are currently lying idle and are not making the contribution they should be to our economic and social development in many areas, including housing and job creation.</p><p>I expect this morning&rsquo;s session to be very fruitful in terms of gaining valued input and feedback from all present in the room today, as well as from the many submissions that are likely to be made on the draft framework by the 3 November deadline.  We would especially value the input of members in areas specific, but not limited, to elements of implementation such as alignment with the capital investment plan, land management and more innovative forms of implementation.</p><p>I thank the committee for its time.  I am happy to answer any questions or address any issues that members may have.</p></speech>

At the outset, I want to acknowledge the high quality and standard of this production.  It is exceptional.  I have been around a number of local authorities and spoken on this, and encouraged people.  I would renew a call again today for the Minister, conscious that the public consultation process ends on 3 November, to continue the excellent promotion and the public relations efforts that marked the beginning of the process.  It needs another push.  It is critical to this process that local authority members feel fully engaged.  That will lead me into another issue in a moment and a question in regard to the hierarchy of the plans.  That is very important in terms of democracy and representation.</p><p>It is important that local authority members feel fully included in this process.  I know that they are included but that must be emphasised to the elected members and the executives of the 31 local authorities because if this plan is to work and bring us to 2040, it must be embraced and supported by the various sectors but particularly by local government.  </p><p> I want to acknowledge that this is an outstanding production.  It is very easy to digest and understand.  We will have an opportunity to contribute to it.  I know that I will, as a citizen, be making a submission and that is important.  The plan sets down certain standards and has a vision.  It is a very good vision and it is very impressive.  </p><p> In terms of the hierarchy of plans, clearly we would have county development plans and they are very important in the local process.  Such plans are relatively short, covering only five or six years.  There is a case to be made for pushing out the length of county development plans but perhaps this plan will take over in that regard.  In terms of the hierarchy, it is important that people feel that their local process is feeding in and that the county development plans are feeding into the national planning framework.  This is, effectively, the national planning framework which affects regional and local government as well as local economic bodies.  It is an economic plan that will, hopefully, be sustainable into the future.  </p><p> I also want to acknowledge that it recognises that there is a continued need for housing provision for people living and working in rural parts of Ireland.  People seem to think that this is about centralising in the regions in places like Waterford, Limerick, Galway, Drogheda and Dublin.  That must be dealt with, as the Minister has said, in terms of infrastructure and so forth but there is a very special place for rural villages and towns in this country.  While there must be a different way of doing business, it is important that this message is made clear.  This is not just about the big cities but also about sustainable living in small communities around the country.</p><p> I would like the Minister and his Department to focus resources on galvanising and encouraging more input into this process in the coming weeks so that we have a plan that has been widely discussed and on which there has been wide engagement.  Well done, it is a great piece of work.</p></speech>

A lot of work has been put into this.  A Government decision was made at the end of 2014 to move to this new national planning framework and officials in the Department have been doing a huge amount of work on it since then.  I am particularly proud of the logo because I picked it but that is about the extent of my involvement in terms of the production of the plan.</p> <p>  The Senator is absolutely right about engaging local authority members and the regional assemblies.  I have written to each local authority.  Three regional meetings will be held in due course.  I intend to be at two of them, with the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, attending the third, for this final phase of consultation.  The Senator is right that it is very important that the people who are going to be implementing this plan at a regional level buy into it.  This is not about central Government saying "You must do this".  It is a foundation stone that speaks to principles, a vision and a strategy.  It is for each regional assembly to come up with regional spatial and economic strategies which will be the next tier and from that will flow the county, city and local area plans.  That is how we make sure that the vision is consistent throughout the country in terms of what we want to achieve and so it does need to have local government on board.  </p> <p>  In terms of the timelines, we will adopt the plan this year and next year we will have the regional spatial and economic strategies.  Those strategies will have a 12 year time horizon.  As new county and city development plans are developed, they will work off the back of the regional spatial and economic strategies to a six year time horizon.  It is very important, as we look to 2040 and what Ireland could and should look like, that we are not doing it based on what we understand the world to be today.  There is no point in arriving at 2040 in an Ireland that was very well designed for 2020 or 2021.  When we look to the potential and the opportunity, particularly for areas outside of our five main cities, we must consider automation, remote working, drone technology, driverless car technology, artificial intelligence and so forth.  There are huge opportunities in changes to work practices and in new technologies to actually regenerate and revitalise large parts of our country that have been in decline for too long now.  We need to make sure that we have that vision as part of the plan when we look ahead.</p></speech>

I am afraid I cannot be as glowing in my comments as my colleague, Senator Boyhan.  It is a very fine production with nice photographs.  However, from my point of view and specifically in the context of Drogheda, my political enemies had smiles on their faces when they read this document and indeed, they have attacked it in the press.  Some of the issues raised cause me concern.</p> <p>  In an effort to be constructive, I would say that the last spatial strategy was a joke.  It did not work and was a disaster in terms of development all over the country.  I welcome this attempt to have proper spatial and regional planning.  The first issue I have is with the absence of maps.  I would like to see maps because they go to the heart of what I want to say.  I live in a place called Drogheda which is bounded on the south by County Meath.  There is a huge amount of development in Drogheda and it is the core town, if not city, for a lot of activity including shopping, education, transport and so forth.  It is a huge hub for everybody but it is not even mentioned as a town in the plan.  The Department maintains that the plan is dealing with the cities.  However, the population of Drogheda is in excess of 43,000 based on the historic boundaries used by the Department and we believe that the real population is of city size.  Even at this moment in time Drogheda is larger than Galway city was when it was designated as a city.  The key issue for us in Drogheda is that we are not considered to be a city but we ought to be.  We have all of the infrastructural needs of a city but do not even have a proper town council.   I know the Minister is addressing that and it has nothing to do with the current Administration, whatever about the last one.</p> <p>  We need to have greater clarity about what is happening in places like Drogheda.  Some of Drogheda falls within the north west region, while the southern part of it falls within the Greater Dublin Area, GDA.  The GDA runs to the river Boyne so theoretically one half of our town is in the GDA while the other half is not.  Drogheda needs special status within this planning process.  I have had a quick word with the Minister and I understand that the process is fixed in terms of time.  It is important that the Department would look at this again.  I know that submissions can be made up until 3 November.  I ask that the Department think again about the future of Drogheda and east Meath, which are separate political entities in terms of local government.  There is a lack of adequate and proper planning for future development.  I do not expect the Minister to give me an answer on this today but we will make strong submissions on this issue.</p> <p>  I welcome the part of the plan which refers to the Dublin-Belfast economic corridor, which is hugely important.  It is also important that we are thinking in North-South terms as well about the 26 counties.  I also note and welcome the references to developing the critical mass of the Newry, Dundalk area to compete with other larger cities.  However, I would like Drogheda to be included in that, either as a linear city with Dundalk and Newry or, alternatively, within a redefined GDA.  We must look at the relationship between Drogheda, east Meath and Balbriggan, for example.  We need to think outside the box for that area because the development of Dublin has led to phenomenal growth in Drogheda.  It is now the largest town in Ireland and needs to be looked at in its totality in the context of the final stage of this plan.  I do not expect the Minister to give me answers today but wish to make him aware of those problems.  I also ask that his officials would take these issues on board.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.1003" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2017101800002#C00400"><p>I thank Deputy O'Dowd.  The Deputy referred to the national spatial strategy that we had in previous times as a joke and I can only agree.  That strategy did not have any alignment with national spending priorities and was thus undermined from the outset because the money was not being directed to the areas that were meant to be developed.</p><p>It was not a good plan, unfortunately.  Politics got involved in what was good planning, and the political priorities led to the designation of parts of the country as hubs and gateways which probably should not have been designated as such.  There was no joined-up thinking and it was not coherent as a planning document.  </p><p> It also fell foul of decentralisation.  This was a silo decision taken by a Government which had no regard to the spatial strategy that had come before it.  With the national planning framework we are trying to ensure we have a system where the possibility of making those mistakes again is eliminated.  One of the key differences is that the national planning framework is going to become law.  There will now be a planning regulator, which we have never had before.  The Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy English, is taking that legislation through Report Stage at the moment on behalf of the Department.  It is going to be aligned with the national investment plan for the next ten years.  It is also being aligned across departmental priorities, so that when different Departments look to the future of, for example, a city such as Waterford, they understand what the plans are for the north quays, where a bridge is to be built.  The north quays, which is now almost entirely in public ownership, need to be redeveloped.  That kind of joined-up thinking did not exist before.  This plan should be seen as a foundation or bedrock for everything to come.  The national spatial strategy was never seen as the bedrock for any other type of planning.  </p><p> A number of other things are not mentioned.  The cities are mentioned, but they make up only 50% of this plan.  We want to see the population grow in cities, but they are also important in terms of how we want people to live.  This is not a plan about cities.  The cities are named because they are where 50% of the growth is going to be.  Other places are not named in the plan because we are not going to try to dictate to other parts of the country what their priorities should be in this document.  That is why the regional spatial and economic strategies are the next very important layer in terms of planning in the three regions and where development will grow.  Aligned with that is a smart growth fund.  A region can nominate or designate a particular part to compete for additional funding to ensure that it can achieve the ambition that the region has for that area.  That is another important part of the plan that makes it different from the national spatial strategy.  </p><p> The plan is not finalised.  It is going out for final public consultation at the moment, which will continue until 3 November.  This engagement is crucial, and it is not just the engagement that we will have in public session today but also the engagements that members of this committee will have privately and the recommendations on the report that they will finalise.  A key part of this plan is the input from the Oireachtas, and we will listen to it very closely.  Remembering that we think North-South in the economic corridor, it is crucially important that we keep that in mind as we think about the potential future growth of the country up until 2040.</p></speech>

Two towns are designated in this plan, which are Newry and Dundalk, one of which is in the northern administration.  Dundalk is in my county, and I have no issue with that.  However, Drogheda, which is bigger than Dundalk, is not mentioned in that context.  This Oireachtas committee could recommend that this plan would incorporate Newry, Dundalk and Drogheda as linear cities.  How do we make sure that this happens?  I accept the points that the Minister is making.</p></speech>

I have some questions on public transport, and will focus on that because I have limited time.</p> <p>  There were some very interesting facts in the Minister's presentation.  Half the daytime population of Ireland's three largest cities travel from outside the cities.  In 2016, 230,000 people commuted for at least one hour a day each way, which is a 30% increase in long commutes in just five years.  I picked up a newspaper recently and read an article which said that there are only eight other countries in the world where one is likely to be spending longer per week backed up in traffic.  Ireland is ninth in the world for gridlock.  In the average European city public transport can get 80% of the people travelling to work in the city into the city each morning.  Even if all of our public transport services were working at 100% capacity, the figure for Dublin is 50%.  We lag way behind.  Conor Faughnan said that in the long run, the only way to resolve this is through serious investment in public transport.  He is 100% correct. </p> <p>  I am going to make the case for public transport even more strongly and talk about climate change.  The Minister's speech and the document highlight the issue.  They contrast with the actions of Government representatives in Luxembourg during the week when the 2030 targets were being discussed.  They, along with eastern European governments, sought that the targets be set on the minimal side of the 2013 climate change and carbon emission targets.  It is an open secret that the Government and the State are going to fall way short of meeting the 2020 targets, that fines are going to be levied on the State as a result of that - probably in excess of &euro;500 million - and that on current trends we stand to be fined billions for falling short on the 2030 targets.  There is much work to be done.  I say that in the week we were hit by a hurricane.  </p> <p>  Who are the main offenders in terms of carbon emissions?  Agriculture is number one.  Number two is transport.  This strengthens the case for public transport.  We can fill the country with electric cars, but there is no substitute for investment in public transport as a way of cutting down on carbon emissions from the transport sector.  Where do things stand there, and what is to be done?  Dublin Bus, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Bus &Eacute;ireann all currently receive less State funding than they did in 2008.  The cuts that were made during the austerity years have been partially reversed, but even at this stage, four years after the turn in the economy, they have not been fully reversed.  Those cuts should be completely reversed.  There is a powerful argument to be made, from the point of view of gridlock and climate change, to double the invest in public transportation and investment in those three companies.  There is also a powerful argument for a cheap fares policy to be introduced.  In 1981 the Greater London Council slashed fares on public transport, including the London Underground, by 30%.  There was a big increase in public transportation usage.  London Transport said that the benefits outweighed the costs on a two to one basis.</p><p>The Government and the Department may say the State cannot afford investment on that scale.  I would argue, however, that the State cannot afford not to have investment on that scale.  One only has to consider the looming carbon emission fines of billions of euro coming down the tracks.</p><p> The document is aspirational and woolly on these issues.  Will the Minister give more concrete proposals as to how we can reverse the trend of cuts in public transport and seriously invest in it as a key part of a national planning framework?</p></speech>

Through the shared economy, it may well be that private property will be a thing of the past in 20 years and everything will be in co-ownership or public ownership.</p> <p>  What we know today is that business as usual is not working.  If we continue to develop as we have, it will not work for any of us in the future.  That is why in this document we set out a vision for a different approach to spatial development than we have had in the past.  I spoke about this recently at a conference with planners about changing the way we think about growth in cities.  Rather than sprawling out, we need to consider concentrating our growth in urban cores.  That applies to villages, towns and city centres.  One of the driving principles behind this plan is that at least 40% of development over the next 20 years will happen in existing physical built-up areas in infill sites and in infill development.</p> <p>  Deputy Barry gave statistics about gridlock.  When it comes to human development or democracy, Ireland is one of the top ten countries in the world.  However, we fall right down when it comes to liveable areas and cities for those very reasons.  We can achieve a significant amount in climate mitigation, in increasing investment in public transport and in protecting our communities, if we focus our growth where infrastructure and people already are.  That is a big part of the principle behind this plan.  Part of the vision is to focus on infill development, focus on existing landbanks which are not used properly and take advantage of the existing investments made there from a social and economic point of view.  For example, 25% of growth over the next 20 years will happen in Dublin.  Half of that, however, will have to happen within the M50.  That means investment put into infrastructure there can be capitalised upon.</p> <p>  Take the Naas Road, for example, where one already has the M50, the canal and the Luas.  There are huge pieces of land on the Naas Road, however, which are essentially just used for selling either furniture, trucks or cars.  That is not an efficient use of land right in the city centre of the capital.</p> <p>  Part of the vision from this is to use new co-operative measures between local authorities and the new sustainable growth fund to make sure we can redevelop those parts of the city.  Not only will we find efficiencies and savings for the economy, but when we talk about building and protecting communities, it will mean fewer journey times, less use of cars, more use of public transport, healthier living, less demand on our public health services, as well as greater ability to plan for the growth of schools.  This will lead to significant benefits for our people, as well as for our environment.  The key principle of compact growth which runs through the document is important not just for climate change but ensuring we have efficient public transport.</p> <p>  We have to think about 2040.  I agree we will only get there in steps.  We will put in place the national planning framework up to 2040 now.  Next year, the regions will develop the regional spatial and economic strategies for the next 12 years.  After that, every city and county council will row in with its six-year development plan and every local area plan from that again.  That is how we are going to get where we need to be in 2040.  There is a cross-departmental approach.  When we have discussed the national planning framework for the past three years, it has been with every Department.  When we had the Cabinet away day in July, half of it was given over to the national planning framework where every Department and Minister gave their input as to how it aligned with their own vision and what they wanted to achieve.  There is that joined-up thinking, which means we can obviously deliver greater public transport efficiency, greater bang for the taxpayer's buck and, in doing so, make great gains with climate mitigation and the other challenges we have.</p></speech>

In fairness, we have all lost any faith or hope in them that they would deliver.  The public are beginning to not engage in them anymore because they are tired of public meetings about plans which do not deliver anything to them directly in the long term.  The national planning framework is a high-level aspirational plan with no specifics.  The Minister claimed he is aligning the national investment plan with it.  However, without the specifics, it is hard to align it if one does not know where the shortfalls in critical infrastructure are.  For example, the Wicklow county plan gave Arklow and other places population growths of 15,000 but they have no wastewater or water infrastructure in place.  How can we align an investment plan without knowing the detail required and the weaknesses that exist?</p> <p>  There is a huge drive towards knowledge-based industries.  With the housing crisis, we have identified a significant skills shortage in trades.  We need to refocus on that part of the education system.</p> <p>  I spoke to Mr. Niall Cussen on rural areas at the last informal meeting we had.  We can keep talking about rural areas and keep on giving out about one-off rural housing.  However, if we cannot offer a rural dweller an alternative to live in towns and villages, we are actually wasting our time.  Every one of our towns and villages has no capacity and they are not on Irish Water's radar because there is no economic return on them within that famous window of economic return.  Where does this plan address the critical infrastructure required to develop our towns and villages?</p> <p>  I will probably be killed for raising the issue of the locals-only rule from Europe and its impact on one-off dwellings and houses in the countryside.  This document keeps referring to an economic need to live in the countryside.  I also believe there is a social part to that which needs to be acknowledged but it is not in this plan.  Wicklow suffers from the impact of urbanisation on the demand for one-off rural housing.  A person who genuinely needs to live in a rural area is the same as one who is not under urban influence.  Why are we differentiating in that regard?  In Wicklow, many people are ruled out for one-off rural housing because they do not have an economic need but might have a social need.</p> <p>  Public transport was mentioned earlier.  I left home at 6:30 a.m. to get here for 9 a.m.  Even though it is only 45 km away, we have a serious problem in Wicklow, especially on the N11 and the M50.  The problem equally relates to job creation.  If we can create further jobs in neighbouring counties around Dublin, it could eliminate that blockage.</p><p>Will the Minister of State give us an update on the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, and specifically on the objectives of the statutory requirements for spatial and transport planning?  We in Fianna F&aacute;il have submitted an amendment that ties the transport issue into planning matters.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.1024" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2017101800002#F00200"><p>I will try to catch up with where we are on most of these issues.  Deputy Casey is of course speaking from a County Wicklow perspective.  We have had a similar situation in County Meath so I can understand the logic behind his questions.  Following on from last night's debate, I believe that the plan we are discussing here provides the answer to most of the Deputy's questions if we can only stick to it.  The Deputy is right to say that many people in this country have bought into plans over the years without ever seeing them happen.  This is why we need follow-through and why this is a 20 to 25 year plan.  All of the State agencies, working groups and Departments have been feeding into this plan over recent years and everybody has been asked to play their part.  As we have seen, we get more action and delivery when everybody buys in.  We have seen this with the housing plan, the jobs plan and the rural action plan.  This is how we are now doing business across Government and it is an approach that works and delivers more.  It is also a matter of backing up this plan.</p> <p>  A 20 to 25 year plan like this one cannot provide all the tiny details that we might want it to.  It has to set out the overall strategy, the overall vision, and the long-term approach as to where we want to go as a country.  We have to get acceptance of and buy-in to this.  We will then build out regional, local and even town and village plans.  If we do not agree on the overall concept to begin with, however, we cannot put the rest of the plans in place.  We will also be looking at this as we develop the ten-year capital strategy in the weeks and months ahead, and our departmental officials will be working together with other Departments to examine the vision in this.  The ten-year plan will then of course match up some of the infrastructural requirements and direct our investment.</p> <p>  A question was asked about Irish Water.  The section in this plan on rural towns and villages, pages 66, 67 and 68,  states that we want to give people the choice of living in a rural area.  This means that they have the choice to build in the small town or village servicing that rural area.  It does not mean that everybody has to have a one-off house out on the open fields.  We have to give people the option of living in the village or town a mile up the road, complete with services and with sites delivered at an affordable price.  It is not always possible to service all of the one-off houses.  It is true that certain people have to live there out of economic need.  Being a rural person myself, I also understand that some people also have a social need to live there and this has to be catered for.  It is more important, however, that people have the option to be able to live in the local town or village.  This needs direct investment from Irish Water and this is exactly what this plan is about.</p> <p>  I see Ireland 2040 as setting out our business case and our plan for investment.  Coming back to Deputy Barry's comments about investing in public infrastructure, we will not get investment in public transport if we do not have a business plan for having more people living in the cities to make investment in public infrastructure more economical and worthwhile.  This plan is all about directing and filling up our cities, moving into brownfield sites and putting in the critical mass needed for really top-class public transport.  This in turn will make it easier to win investment and to make a business case.  I see some people here from Galway.  We had a discussion with the local authorities in Galway on the fact that we need to invest hundreds of millions of euro in infrastructure if we really want to make Galway a successful city that can compete internationally in the future.  This will also generate an increased population that will use and pay for that infrastructure.  This plan is about trying to drive this kind of thinking.</p> <p>  Another member mentioned the skills shortage in education.  Much of this plan has been drawn up in consultation with the Department of Education and Skills with particular focus on questions such as where the choice is in education, where we are going with education, and where is the access to education.  People in the regions feel that they have suffered over the years because they have not had the same access to education as others.  This comes down to the cost of living in the city.  Through the national skills strategy and the local skills fora, we have come to recognise that any move to address the shortage in skills and in education has to be at regional and local level.  Our local authorities and local enterprise offices, LEOs, have to engage with the education players through the skills fora at a county level.  The national skills strategy goes out to 2020 and we have factored into it the need for at least 60,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships.  This has been reflected in the recent budget, thankfully, which put increased money into apprenticeships, traineeships, on-the-job training and working with education and training boards and institutes of technology.  Given what was going on with the storm, the announcement on Monday of an extra &euro;200 million investment for the IT sector and infrastructure may have been missed.  This recognises the role played by the ITs in servicing the regions.</p> <p>  This comes back again to driving an economic purpose for all towns, villages and counties outside of the cities.  We are very conscious of the fact that we will only drive this economic purpose if we have the education to match.  The question is absolutely on the ball.  We need to match our skills around the country, and this is what we are doing though the national skills strategy.  This, again, is a long-term strategy that needs to be both followed and backed up.  This is exactly what the Government has been doing and announcing the money for that recently.  We need to make sure that we are producing the skills that we need, not just at university level, but at all different levels: apprenticeships, traineeships and on-the-job-training.  We have an obsession with universities in this country but they are just one part of the combination.  We often hear conversations about certain individuals taking on apprenticeships because they could not go the route of higher education, but this is not the way to talk about this.  It is a matter of what is best for the career, not the person.  Individuals might be better qualified for certain jobs if they follow the route of on-the-job training.  In many cases one may be better off going through an apprenticeship because one will acquire better skills and be left more ready for a job compared with someone else who went straight on to university.  We have to change the conversation on this and this particularly applies to parents and grandparents because they direct where their children end up going.  We have to refocus our thinking in this regard and that is one of the objective of the national skills strategy.  All these various strategies again feed into the Ireland 2040 plan and into the logic of what we are trying to do with it.</p> <p>  In response to a further question, it is certainly envisaged that we try to grow our towns and villages.  It is right to say that about 30% to 40% of our population lives in one-off houses in rural Ireland.  This is not sustainable.  These people do not want to move 20 miles away, however.  They want to stay in their communities.  Ideally, we will build up towns and villages while at the same time clearly recognising, even under EU law, that there is still a need for some people to live in rural areas.  That need is accepted and recognised in this plan.  It is stated here in black and white that we will allow for it.</p> <p>  The regional and county development plans running until 2018 will back up the thinking behind Ireland 2040 and ensure follow-through.  We have seen good plans in the past, of course, but we have never followed through on them.  Under the new planning Bill coming through the D&aacute;il, this plan will now take the form of a statutory document that will have to be renewed every few years.  The D&aacute;il has a role in this, as does the joint committee here today.   There were no such roles in the previous spatial strategy in 2002.  That is nobody's fault, but we have now moved on in our thinking.   Ireland 2040 also sees us trying to bring sustainability and environmental measures into the planning process and closer to our thinking.  This is what we are trying to achieve with this.</p> <p> I return to the planning requirement raised by Deputy Casey.  As the Deputy knows, the planning Bill is going through the D&aacute;il and it covers the role of the OPR and the transport pillar.  We will have the chance to discuss that at this committee in the future.  We recognise that there has to be a greater link between transport and infrastructural plans and planning and that is why we are here.  Transport will be a key part of the three-year strategy and the ten-year capital plan.  We want to connect the cities outside of Dublin together and we also need to invest in transport within Cork, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and so on.  If we do not do so, developing these cities will not be sustainable and people will not want to live there.  If we only develop the infrastructural links between cities, there is the danger that we fail in our target to develop the cities themselves.  There is a need for parallel development here both inside and between these cities.</p> <p>  I think I have covered all of the questions raised.</p></speech>

As the Taoiseach comments on the front page of the plan, half of the jobs that people will be working in by 2040 may not even exist today.  This the reality and there will be major concerns.  The Minister of State mentioned education.  I am a firm believer that education can open up many doors for people.  Whether it is do with apprentices or engineers, many of our engineers have emigrated, and we need to get them, and indeed anyone who has emigrated, back.  We have the finest third level education in this country.  Representatives from the south east met the IDA recently, and we spoke about university status for the Carlow and Waterford Institutes of Technology.  This is crucial.  With 700 staff, Carlow IT is one of Carlow's biggest employers. A proper framework needs to be put in place.  We have been talking about this for years but we need to make sure that we deliver on it.  We talk about rural Ireland.  We have put out plans, and that is welcome, and I know 3 November is the deadline for submissions.</p><p>The Government must listen to people regarding the rural post offices.  It must listen to what these people in our rural communities are saying.  These are the lifeblood of our community, and yet there is talk that we are going to close 200 to 300 of them.  We need to make sure through this planning framework that we keep rural Ireland and our post offices alive.  I firmly believe there should be little tourist facilities there, where one can get information on the local area and tourist attractions, because that is needed.  Rural Ireland is forgotten, and I think it is important that that is part of it.</p><p> I also mention the health services.  As the Minister of State knows, people are living longer, and quality of life is going to be crucial in this plan.  However, I often wonder what sort of plan the Government is putting in place.  I will give an example.  As part of our local health services, we have the Holy Angels day care centre, which has been looking for a new building for 12 years.  Five years ago we were told it was a priority.  I am still fighting with the relevant Minister.  Is the Minister of State putting a plan in place that will prioritise the building that health service needs?  There was an announcement in our local newspaper last week about overnight respite care services.  Our service has been closed for two years.  They are saying it will be ready in another year, or a year and a half.  That is unacceptable.  Services have been taken away or, like Holy Angels, they have never been built properly or need a new building.  How is the Minister of State going to make sure that they are part of this plan?  How will he make sure that parts of the country are not denied their fair share, or forgotten about because not enough Ministers come from those places?  I feel that Carlow is not getting its fair share.</p><p> Another bugbear I have is Government funding.  I know that the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, met our CEOs and a few of our directors of services recently on this issue.  It is all about local authorities.  They and all the different agencies will play a massive part in this planning framework.  However, if the Government does not listen to those from the local authorities, then it is not listening to the people.  I welcome the Minister of State saying he is going to listen to the people.  However, when local authority representatives say to him that their budgetary needs are not being met and they are told to meet their targets anyway, it just can not happen.  If he does not listen to the local authorities and the others making submissions, it will defeat the whole purpose of this plan.</p><p> As the Minister of State is aware, we recently had a revaluation of properties and the rates for many properties went up.  Although I know some did go down, this is a massive concern.  These are all issues that are not being addressed.  If they are not in this plan, and I cannot see them in it, the plan is not going to work.  There is also the issue of property tax.  There are certain areas in the country that will make a lot of money in local and property taxes, and there are other areas, like Carlow, that just are not making the same income.  The Government needs to address this.  I was a member of the local authority for 18 years, and I would see these issues.  Infrastructure needs to be developed.  There are train stations where there is no wheelchair accessibility.  There are also staffing issues in most local authorities.  These are issues that can be sorted, but if we do not start from the ground up, then this whole plan will be compromised, and I firmly believe that.</p><p> I will give an example.  Health services have been mentioned.  We have one ambulance service at night-time in Carlow, which has two staff.  We have the ambulances, but we are short two staff.  We need two ambulances out at night-time.  If I go to the HSE about this, I am told they will look at it and come back.  These are the everyday things that the Government is not addressing, and I cannot understand that.  When a programme in place, we need to address the simple things.  I firmly believe accountability and responsibility are the two main things here.  If we cannot get accountability and responsibility, this plan for 2040 is not going to work.</p></speech>

There are great initiatives in this and there are great plans.  However, we should start with local authorities and local people who are on the ground.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.1029" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2017101800002#G00900"><p>The Senator raised a range of issues, and while this is a chance to raise them, this is not the budget.  Nonetheless, it is a document that will help us shape budgets, and that is what this is about.  The Senator is right.  We have not always planned, not just for land use management, but for activities or investment.  We have seen this take effect in Wicklow, Meath, Kildare, Louth and the greater Dublin region, where people sometimes moved to the area in an unplanned  or haphazard way, sometimes as a result of bad zoning.  People ended up living there with no services and it took years for the resources to catch up.  That is what we are trying to avoid here.  If we can plan our land use, we can plan the management of people, their movement, where they are going to live, whether it is going to be in Wicklow, Cavan, Mayo or Cork, why they would be there, and so on.  We can then plan the resources to match that.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned post offices.  Part of the reason post offices are closing is that people are not using them.  We have to call a spade a spade here.  If they were being used more, they would not be closing.  We need to find ways to guarantee their usage.  That means building villages, towns and cities back up in order that people have an economic reason to be there.  They will then use the local services, which will help save health services, post offices, shops, and so on.  People point to a town or village and say that years ago it had seven or eight shops.  That is because more people were there and had a reason to be there.  What we are trying to do with Ireland 2040 is plan in order that people have a reason to live in a certain place and do not spend an hour and a half driving to work.  The target is that the majority would have a maximum commute of 30 minutes, and we want to go better than that.  Even that is too high.  Senator Murnane O'Connor comes from Carlow and I come from County Meath, so I know what it is like to spend two hours in traffic in the morning.  That is not a way to live, and we are trying to avoid it by having this plan.  However, that will only be achieved that if we set out ambitions for the country over the next 20 to 25 years and then get buy-in from all the State players and local authorities.</p> <p>  We have consulted.  We have been at this stage now for two or three years. We have had at least 12 months of formal consultation with anybody who wanted to talk to us about this.  We went around the country, including to Carlow,  speaking to people of all ages to hear their thoughts about their towns, villages, cities and country.  We are trying to join that together and put in place a number of objectives which will be teased down to regional and local level.  We have to follow through.  We will not be able to target investment, however, without a plan like this with long-term thinking and long-term sustainable goals.  Then we win the resources.</p> <p>  I cannot stress this enough.  I was involved in the science strategy, Innovation 2020, and the skills strategy.  The reason we put strategies in place is to win the money to back them up.  People do not always see that connection because we have not always followed through.  It is not just because of this Government, or the Government before it , but in general the thinking in this country has moved on.  There is a new emphasis throughout all Departments on joined-up thinking, working together department to department and long-term strategies that we stick to.  Governments will come and go, so we have to put in place long-term plans.  That is the reason that this document reflects the desire that there be cross-party involvement in this in order that there is that long-term agreement on where we are going as a country.</p> <p>  It was mentioned that people do not see the effects of different plans. I often cite Westport as the best example.  Westport was a plan over 15 or 20 years that invested more than &euro;150 million into that area.  We see the success of it.  It did not take a week, however.  It took place over 20 years and involved long-term thinking and decision-making that included everybody.  It was led by the local authority and driven by local enterprise, with everyone coming together and playing their part.  Success will not be achieved in any of these towns and villages unless all the agencies step up and play their part, including the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills, under the overview of the working groups.  A key part of this is urban regeneration and renewal, going back into these towns and villages where there are brownfield sites and empty spaces that are not utilised.  It is a case of having a conversation with all the State agencies, including the Department of Health, asking them what they need in the future, whether they will want the buildings that are available, and what services they want to plan for each town and village, following which we can allow for it in our building usage and our land usage.</p> <p>  Development plans need to go into that level of detail, actually going street by street and asking what is needed.  McAuley Place in Naas is a perfect example.  It is an old convent that has been reutilised to provide an option for elderly people to come and live in the centre of a town.  It is perfect for an older person who does not want to live on his or her own in a rural house, or a large house at the edge of a town or estate, but wants to be near company and services.  Living at McAuley Place, elderly people can walk the streets, avail of all the services and engage with the community.  It is a perfect example of this thinking, cited in the published strategy, and there are other centres working just as well.  That is the kind of thinking we have.  The question is how to achieve that in all the towns and villages.  It has to be put down on paper or we will not get there.</p> <p>  Carlow Institute of Technology and Waterford Institute of Technology were mentioned.  It is a pity that communications broke down between those two ITs in recent years.  Had it not happened, we would probably be further on in our development of a technical university in that area.  In this plan, however, we recognise the desire to see technical universities rolled out.  The passage of legislation through the D&aacute;il that will give options to ITs in Carlow, Waterford, Athlone, Blanchardstown, Tallaght and Dublin to come together is being prioritised at the moment.</p><p>There is a logic to that.  We recognise the necessity of developing our skills and talent.  The Senator is absolutely right.  Job creation and winning investment come down to talent.  It is not down to having a Minister or Minister of State.  We might like to claim that is the case but it is not the way it works.  It is about investing in talent and having access to that talent.  That is why the greater Dublin region might win more jobs in some cases at the moment.  There are nearly 2 million people living in the area, so investors have access to people with the education they need.  If we had proper regional development, those skills would be available throughout the country.  There would be access to those skills so investment could also be dispersed around the country.  As I said last night, more than 70% of the jobs created in the past year were created outside of Dublin.  They are in the regions.  All those regional action plans for jobs, which people sniffed at while sitting in here three or four years ago, are working and are delivering jobs to all the regions.  That is the key.  I have no doubt that with the same logic and long-term thinking, this plan can deliver the same success to our regions.  That is what we are trying to achieve and we will do that.  The Senator is right, however.  It is about the skills.</p><p> When the Taoiseach says that half the jobs which will be created do not exist today, he is right.  In the past five years, more than half the jobs created have been in new companies with new ideas and new thinking and providing new products and services.  That is why we must drive on with our thinking, our innovation, our science and our research and development.  As a country, we invest a lot of taxpayers' money in thinking ahead because if we do not innovate, we will fall behind and lose jobs.  If we are constantly innovating and driving ahead, we will secure jobs for the future.  We are also making sure that we upskill our people to fill the jobs of the future.  There is a fear of innovation in most countries because it can cost jobs, and it will cost jobs if we are not on top of it, with it and driving it.  As a country we are in the space of long-term thinking.  I do not have a fear for jobs because, providing we continually invest in our people and talent, we will also be okay on that front.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.1031" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1385" speakername="Grace O'Sullivan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2017101800002#H00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State very much for his responses thus far.  With regard to his comments on innovation and losing people, as a nation we should have ambition and should not be fed by fear.  We should be fed by opportunity.  I would like to start with my reaction to the draft plan as it stands.  In terms of our climate obligations. we are an island nation, we have an abundance of wind and waves and we have solar potential.  We are not giving enough attention to our potential to secure our country in terms of energy.  We have the potential and we have to write what we are going to do to secure our energy into the plan.  It must be in there hard and fast and with a timeline.  We must stop importing fossil fuels.  We need timelines.  I want to see timelines.  I want to know when I will be able to say to my children that the day of fossil fuels is over in Ireland because, in 2040, we will be energy secure because we will have wind energy, solar energy, wave energy and all the innovation which the Minister of State has spoken about.  We can do it but we have to have the ambition and we have to lay down timelines as to when we will deliver this.  I would like to see that written into our plan so that not just ourselves, the middle-aged, but also the youth will look at this plan and get excited because they will see job opportunities, they will see where their money, as taxpayers, will go, and they will see that this plan will lead to a country which is energy secure.</p> <p>  We talked about transport earlier.  I, too, believe that we, as a country, should be investing - hard, fast and fully - in public transport systems.  There should be public transport systems which roll out from my home town, Tramore, into Waterford and then allow people to transfer onto a train or bus up to Dublin.  The current system does not demonstrate joined-up thinking.  If one jumps on a bus from Galway after university on a Friday, when one arrives in Limerick one will have missed the bus to Waterford by five minutes.  We are not thinking strategically about how we operate our transport systems.  We need our systems to link up as they do in countries such as the Netherlands.  We need good, efficient, effective systems which are joined up all the way from a city, to the towns and onto the villages.  We need much more integrated transport systems which will deliver public service to people and communities in the towns, the cities and the capital.  It must be price effective.  At the moment a bus journey for a student costs too much.  We have to look at how we can achieve efficiencies of scale in terms of getting more people onto the transport systems while making such systems affordable?  We need to serve not only the people who have jobs but also the people who want to travel but are curbed by the cost.  We need to bring down costs for the users of the public transport systems.</p> <p>  On housing, we must be much more ambitious in respect of retrofitting.  I know the Minister of State was working with the former Minister, Deputy Coveney, on these issues some time ago.  We need to be much more ambitious in rolling out solar power to all houses.  We must retrofit houses in order that they are warm and people on low incomes are not suffering from fuel poverty as we come into the winter.  We must ensure that they have multiple means of warming their houses, such as through solar power or other renewable energy sources.  This is all about innovation and creating jobs.  We must ensure that every house, hub or whatever kind of housing we build for the people and for families is absolutely 100% energy rated and that we deliver the best for the people.  On renovation and such issues, it is all about innovation.  The more we scale up and the more we develop, the better the design systems will become.</p> <p>  That also goes for wind energy.  I believe that in 2040 we will not be seeing the kind of wind turbines we see today.  It will be a totally new model.  There will be little wind turbines on the edges of buildings and there will be solar windows.  It is all there and it is happening, but Ireland needs to jump on board the renewable energy revolution and we are not doing so.  We are still stuck looking into the documents rather than looking out at the world and pulling the systems in.  The environment includes the issue of healthy air.  We need to have good, healthy, quality air.  We need to make sure that the environment is wrapped into everything we do and wrapped into the economy.</p> <p>  I must talk about Waterford for one second.  I am delighted to see that it was mentioned twice in the Minister of State's presentation.  It is the oldest city in Ireland.  We need a south-eastern technical university, as the Minister of State says, but Limerick Institute of Technology could be included as part of the university of the south east.  University Hospital Waterford also needs 24-7 cardiac care and we need better services in that hospital to serve the whole of the south east.</p></speech>

If the Chair allows, I may call on some of my colleagues to contribute as I am not an expert in all of these areas.  I will bring them in if that is okay.  I believe it is a good way to do business.</p> <p>  The Senator is right, this is about ambition.  That is what we are trying to set out here.  What is our ambition for this country?  Do we believe in it and can we achieve it?  This ambition must be marked out in different plans and there must be connectivity in Government.  The regions must also be connected.  That is what we are trying to do in this framework.  I agree with the Senator about being fed by opportunity.  When it comes to climate change, this is about trying to bring climate change initiatives, environmental issues and sustainability more into planning and bringing integrated climate consideration into the statutory plans and the guidelines.  This planning document will reflect, and takes on board, the national climate mitigation plan on which the Minister, Deputy Naughten, is leading.  It is part of the thinking here and part of our strategy.  The Minister is also developing a national clean air strategy which will feed into this.  This plan is also about bringing some of the strategies together and setting out those targets and ambitions.</p> <p>  I agree with the Senator about our housing stock.  We need to be more ambitious in adapting and enhancing the houses we have at the moment.  We have made great inroads with the social housing stock.  There will be catch-up with some of the private housing stock.</p><p> The building guidelines and regulations reflect where we are trying to go in the future.  This is the case with the plans for domestic houses which are to be near zero energy buildings, NZEB, by 2020 or 2018.  We are making progress but I agree we need to push that further.  We also had the competition recently for using technology for old people and accommodation.  The Senator is correct that technology is changing so quickly that things will change in the distribution of energy as well as its creation, such as wind and wave.  Everything in this area is adapting quickly.  Scientists in this country are at the forefront of developing these technologies which we hope can be brought to market very soon.</p><p> Irish people need to buy into believing in science, understanding it and agreeing with it.  This week people have been complementing the work of Met &Eacute;ireann but that was the application of science.  We believed the science and we trusted Met &Eacute;ireann.  Through our different plans, we will move with technology and people need to understand that as a country, we rely on evidence-based decision making.  It involves research, and the scientists bringing their expertise together.  We need to build trust in the system back up and belief that we know what we are doing.  That is something that the Senator understands more than others.  We need to build around energy development and energy solutions as much as we can.  </p><p> The Oireachtas often debates the situation in rural areas.  They have much to contribute to energy solutions.  Many years ago I spent time in a place where I saw a great deal of local energy production and it was more acceptable to the community there.  That is allowed for in this plan.  We are often obsessed with big energy production which causes a lot of hassle but we must look at all the different types out there and embrace them as best we can.</p><p> Many members have mentioned investment in transport systems.  We must create a critical mass of people in order to make transport more affordable.  One wants to invest in it and make it more affordable and that can only happen where there are cities where the population has been increased.  The target is that over half of the population increase in the next 20 or 25 years will happen within the cities rather than outside them, which would continue the urban sprawl.  If we achieve that we can invest more in public transport, because it will be more affordable to do so and it will be more sustainable.  It will also contribute to climate, air quality and proper land use.  It makes sense.  We are trying to do more of that but one thing cannot happen without the other.  If people are disbursed all over the place in an unplanned way, one cannot service that population in an economic way.  In that case, services will not be up to scratch, it is just not possible.  That is what we are trying to do and I think it can be achieved.  We are on the right path.  The committee has a private meeting after this and there will be further discussion in weeks ahead.  The plan can be added to because we are trying to make this more ambitious.  We are on the right page.  The Senator wants to achieve a step change in some of our approaches and I agree with that.  As the country recovers, we should have the resources to do that and make bold decisions.  </p><p> The Senator is right about joined-up thinking.  I remember in my first months as a councillor in 1999, sitting down with the NRA which was planning a great big motorway which was to come through our county.  When one would asked about the railway line, it was like referring to a different planet.  The NRA would respond it was not its concern.</p></speech>

Those planning the motorway were two or three years ahead in their research than the others were with their railway line and they could not come together.  Thankfully, that has all changed.  That conversation has been had and we now plan our infrastructure and using resources together, but it was disgraceful that we could not do it ten or 15 years ago.  We have moved on.  We need this joined-up thinking across the system and across all the Departments, which is what we are trying to do here with Ireland 2040.</p> <p>  Does Mr. Walsh wish to add anything?</p></speech>

Chapter 9 includes targets up to 2030 and 2040.  On page 138, it refers to the transition to sustainable energy, green energy, strengthening our energy networks, our smart grid and then looks at the sustainable management of water and environmental resources.  Equality issues are addressed but this is a framework document and we do not want to repeat things.  We want to align ourselves with the national policies which other Ministers are driving and ensuring that there is coherence.</p> <p>  Also on environmental issues, this document has had a strategic environmental assignment, SEA, associated with it.  In all the approaches taken we have had to look at alternatives, including the "do nothing" scenarios.  The report is out for consultation with this draft.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.1043" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1315" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2017101800002#J01000"><p>I thank the Minister, the Minister of State and their officials for being here.  I agree that this plan is the opportunity of a generation.  It is important that we get it right and set out of vision.  I welcome the comprehensive consultations that have taken place across the country which must continue until 3 November.</p> <p>  As someone who is from a city, I recognise and agree with the Minister that this is not only about cities but about moving out to the regions.  When one looks at the population of Dublin it is 166% greater than it was at the foundation of the State.  Compare that to the population of Connaught, which is less than it was in 1926.  We need to look at the counter-balance to Dublin and the greater Leinster area.  Sometimes when this is discussed, people in the capital can see it as a threat to them but it is not, it is about rebalancing economic development across the country for everyone's benefit.  </p> <p>  I looked at the key future growth enablers for Galway, which are very positive.  I have a number of comments.  I read the submission by Galway chamber, which consulted widely with a large range of stakeholders.  Everyone will have heard of Galway's traffic problems and transport issues and the need for an outer city bypass, known as the Galway city ring road although it has had a number of different names over the years.  We acknowledge that but it will take around 10 years to come into effect and we need to look at public transport, as is stated in the document, which looks at improving access and sustainable transport links and integration with existing employment areas to the east of the city.  It mentions Parkmore.  The Minister and his officials are, and the previous Minister, Deputy Simon Coveny had been, very active in trying to tackle the considerable traffic congestion in Galway.  Many people who work in the city do not live there, they travel in from places such as east Galway and south Mayo.  Park and ride facilities would provide an important solution and ought to be included in this plan as part of the overall solution.  </p> <p>  Not everyone wants to bypass the city.  We must also look at an integrated public transport system for people going to work.  There is NUIG, GMIT and the centre of excellence in the hospital in the city centre, so a two-pronged approach is needed.  The Galway chamber report refers to the need for a conference, exhibition and performance centre for Galway.  Again, this is not only for the city but for the region, as a cultural centre for business, the arts and culture.  It suggests the expansion of Galway harbour, which is not only about accommodating cruise ships and freight but also could make it a business and enterprise district for the region. </p> <p>  Traffic and congestion has been mentioned.  Any Member of the Oireachtas could come here and discuss matters of traffic and commuting times.  I do not see any reference to high speed trains.  Starting with the Galway-Dublin route, this would help to open access to the regions.  </p> <p>  I referred to the centre of excellence at Galway University Hospital.  It received that designation many years ago and serves not only Galway but people as far away as Donegal all the way down to south Clare and as far east as Athlone, yet it has not received adequate infrastructural investment to support that.  Some 200 consultants and medical clinicians have written to the Minister for Health acknowledging that Galway and the west and north west needs a proper new acute hospital.  That needs to be included and is part of the Galway chamber's submission.  It is about the regions, not about one area or it being a local issue.  It is a regional issue and is about planning now.  We know this will not happen in the next two or three years but it has to be part of the 2040 plan.  </p> <p>  Recently, I met with the presidents of GMIT, Sligo IT and Letterkenny IT.</p><p>This is about opening access to education.  They raised the issue of the need for a Connacht-Ulster alliance.  They would like to see more of an emphasis on that in this plan in terms of developing a technological university.  The Minister correctly made reference to developing skill sets and apprenticeships.  They are well placed to serve that need.</p><p> The plan makes provision for the projections for the over 65 population which is coming down the track.  I go back to our centre of excellence, University Hospital Galway, which is not equipped to deal with that in its current infrastructure capacity.  It needs to be expanded.  We also have Merlin Park, a sister hospital which has a leaking roof and has cancelled all its orthopaedic surgeries.  This is a 1950s TB hospital that has never been renovated.  All surgeries have been cancelled.  This is supposed to be our centre of excellence.  With our population increase, we will need these facilities and it needs to be included in the plan.</p><p> I thank the Minister.  I acknowledge this is the start of the process but it is important that we set out these infrastructure projects that need to be included in the plan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.1045" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2017101800002#K00200"><p>I will try to shorten my answers.  I might bring in Mr. Niall Cussen on the planning and transport around Galway because he is familiar with and is working closely with it, and has been corresponding with the Deputy on it as well.  We have visited Galway on this plan as well and we have held local consultation there.  We met the local authorities, both city and county.  I have not met the chamber of commerce directly but I have read its submission.</p> <p>  We made reference in this plan to the importance of investing in the outer ring-road in Galway.  I acknowledge the complications around that from a planning point of view.  It has taken a long time merely to plan but we need to push on and achieve that as well.  Also, we talk about improving access and the sustainable transport links.  There is a very good plan on paper for Galway and if we invested in that plan, it would solve it.  It makes the case to win that investment for the city.</p> <p>  We would recognise that Galway city is crucial to the development of the western region.  One will grow the surrounding regions if one has a top-class city, like Galway, competing at an international level, which it does for med-tech.  It is a major hub for med-tech.  That it putting the city on the map but it is also bringing investment into the region and giving people a reason to live close by.  That is what we are trying to achieve here.  We envisage investment in our cities to grow them and increase their population.  There are major housing issues in Galway which we have to work on as well.  We must have some real long-term thinking there which we are trying to drive.</p> <p>  Deputy Hildegarde Naughton mentioned the hospitals.  The Department of Health, under the Minister, Deputy Harris, has commissioned a study looking at the use of its hospitals and their capacity, and recognising that there is a requirement for more beds and more investment in hospitals.  It is making those choice as to where the investment will be made.  We want to be able to track that and allow for their thinking in this plan.  That is why all the agencies are around the table.</p> <p>  It is also about looking 20 to 25 years ahead and seeing where we need hospitals.  Of course, Galway is a regional centre, but it is about making choices around what health services are in other towns to support Galway and it comes down to encouraging this regional thinking and support as well.  We will do that.</p> <p>  We recognise that in the years ahead there will be over 1.3 million people over 65 living in the country.  Those will include some of us here.  We must plan for and recognise that, and not only pay lip-service to it but put in place proper long-term planning to give people the choice of where they will be able to access services and of where they want to live, but also to develop life-long communities so that one has a choice to live within the one community.  At present, sometimes one's only choice is to move out of one's community if one needs accommodation for an older person.  That is not sustainable and it is not what we are trying to achieve.  We want to be able to plan for that in this as well.  The community support health care needs are all being talked about within the plan but the delivery of that involves bringing the agencies together under this plan through the other local plans as well.  We are trying to achieve that.</p> <p>  Mr. Cussen will speak on land use.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.1046" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Cussen" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2017101800002#K00300"><p>As had been flagged in Deputy Hildegarde Naughton's contribution, some of the issues around Parkmore have been the focus of the Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in terms of working with the local authorities.  The recent opening of the new motorway has probably tipped the balance again away from free-flow traffic and more towards congestion, but there have been some positive developments in the last few days in regard to agreement about land transfers and clearing the way for additional capacity in that area.  We will get back to the Deputy on that.</p> <p>  I suppose Parkmore in its own way is a great example of where the State agencies, such as IDA Ireland, working with the local authorities, the transport provides, etc., have created a world-class cluster of med-tech and other enterprises that are thriving in the west, in Connacht, providing high-tech employment for over 8,000 people who are drawn from a wide regional catchment, including the city and right through south Roscommon, east Galway, etc.  It is a classic example of where the critical mass, the infrastructure, the enterprise and the economic development conditions, the knowledge, the skills, etc., all come together.  Even in the western seaboard and more peripheral parts of the country, we can succeed and drive regional growth.  There are some short to medium-term issues that have arisen in regard to transportation access and connectivity and from a departmental and cross-departmental point of view, we are absolutely committed to resolving those in the fastest time possible.  Of course, the long-term answer is the ring-road.</p></speech>

The Deputy will have heard a reference in conversation.  Both the former Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, have repeatedly talked about those options.  In our sustainable mobility section, we talk about investing in rail, and that connection, and public transport.  That is what we mean there.  It is not written in as high-speed rail but that is what we are talking about.  It also goes back to having a concentration of people in certain areas to make that viable and worthwhile.  That can happen.  This country can afford it but only in a planned way.  The Deputy is correct to highlight that.  Galway is one of those regional centres where if we can grow the city enough, it will make it sustainable to have that option as well.</p></speech>

The reason Galway developed as a med-tech sector of the world is because of that connection between our education system and our enterprise system.  I saw that collaboration in my time as Minister of State with responsibility for research.  We have done a lot in Galway, both in the university and in GMIT, around that connection and collaboration across all the stakeholders.  It has been driven by top-class people in the education system working with enterprise and constantly expanding those companies with new products.  Also, the link with the university hospital is key to the development of top-class health services, as well developing services and products that can be used all over the world too.  We need to build on that too and we recognise it in the plan as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.1050" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1294" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2017101800002#K00700"><p>I am not a member of the committee but I very much appreciate the chance to speak.  As the former Minister, Deputy Coveney, stated, this plan is probably the most important we have in this D&aacute;il.  I was hugely supportive of the approach to a national planning framework on the understanding that it was promoting a stopping of the sprawl and a reduction in the long and ever-lengthening commuting distances in this country, that we would genuinely set ourselves on a low-carbon pathway, and that it would evolve in a way that would not be top-down and would encourage bottom-up engagement in the long-term planning process.</p> <p>  I heard some of the speakers earlier.  While all the rhetoric is right, the substance is not there.  In all three objectives, what I hear and see is all waffle, all spin and no substance, and I will explain why.  First, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, stated the lesson we have to learn from the original national spatial plan is to align what we are actually doing with the plan.  I do not see any alignment occurring, for instance, in the transport issue.  If the issue is to stop the sprawl, there was nothing in the latest budget supporting that initiative.  There is nothing in our transport plans which is about developing public transport and urban sustainable living systems.  There was &euro;3 million for cycling - wow - and there is how many billion euro for more roads.</p> <p>  This plan is the same.  I looked in detail, asking where is the transport substance.  It is all motorways.  It is all more ring-roads.  It is all about roads.  Even in my own constituency, Dublin Bay South, the Minister wants to get another motorway under Dublin Bay connecting to the port.  It is another &euro;3 billion or &euro;4 billion added to the jigsaw of the M50, a road network that is broken.  It is not working because it is not sustainable.</p> <p>  I am sorry but nothing this Government is doing tells me it is interested in sustainable transport.  I looked at it again in the context of my own city.  Look at the mess they have made of the city centre with the Luas cross-city.  One can no longer cycle around College Green.  It is too dangerous given what they have created.</p><p>It is not as if they were not told to do it the other way - we were arguing to put urban planning into it and include the pedestrian and the cyclist - but nothing has changed.  What has changed in the transport budget?  When I look at it, all I see is roads &ndash; that is all we are doing.  We do not have a single rail-based public transport plan.  How is the Department going to reduce sprawl?  How is the Department going to cater for all these people coming into the cities?  The only plan is more ring roads.  That is going to hit the M50 and it is not going to work.  That is my first criticism.</p><p> My second criticism is that the same problem arises with climate issues.  We all talk about decarbonisation, but there was nothing in the budget about it.  I listened to the Taoiseach yesterday.  He was asked questions after the storm on Monday.  He said we were all doing great and that we have all sorts of ambitions.  There is no ambition in this Government for climate action.  There is no scale of investment.  We are going to have electric vehicles but a public relations campaign is the best the Government has in mind - that is not good enough.  I could go through every other sector.  It is the same in energy, land use and farming.  There was nothing on forestry in the budget.  If we are serious about climate change, how in God's name could we have a budget that did not mention forestry?</p></speech>

We are talking about the national planning framework.  We are discussing whether it is under-funded by the capital investment plan.  We are not talking about the budget recently passed.

It is all just spin and talk.  It is not real.</p> <p>  I wish to make a third point about going back to the people and doing it from the bottom up.  Where is the bottom up?  There are three regional assemblies.  If the Department projections are true, my regional assembly will be an assembly of 3 million people.  I do not see it working.  If we were serious about a bottom-up approach in Dublin, we would say we want a mayor for Dublin.  That would enable us to stop planning the chaos that has been created by the lack of proper planning in this city.  Instead, we could start thinking about where we put housing.</p> <p>  Similarly, we need to look at the key missing ingredient, which is how to lift our smallest towns.  I would look for us to be putting back in district councils.  They were taken out by Phil Hogan because it was popular at the time.  The view was that politics was back and getting rid of politicians was a good idea.  I think that was a fatal mistake.  Where is the plan for strengthening regional government that would allow towns to indicate how they believe they are going to meet the objectives of reducing sprawl and cutting out carbon?  I do not see any empowerment of the political process.  I do not believe that the current regional assembly system is sufficiently robust, strong or relevant.  The only area where it is relevant is the national land use plan.  There is a plan to divide the country between the north and west and between the south and east.  It does not relate to Dublin or the east midlands, but in the area of land use, farming and forestry, perhaps that makes sense.  In any case, there is nothing about it in this plan.  There is nothing about a national land use plan that might back up a spatial plan.</p> <p>  I am positive and supportive of the idea, but the reason I brought back in the budget is because if we were serious about this we would have seen something in the budget.  I see nothing in the budget to back this up and, therefore, I do not believe it is real.  That is a valid criticism.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.1060" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2017101800002#L01000"><p>I understand the frustration that Deputy Eamon Ryan is bringing to the table, but he is probably slightly wrong in what he is saying.  We had a conversation about this plan but Deputy Ryan was out of the room for most of the discussion we have had thus far.</p> <p>  This plan is about setting out the plan, ambition and business case.  If we do not do that, we will not win any investment.  It is not a matter for the budget or to change to the political system.  It is about setting out where all of us collectively have come together in recent years with the plan.  Deputy Ryan bought into that process at an earlier stage.  If he believes in it, I appeal to him to stick with it and finish it out, because the plan is not finished yet.  Only then will we see the direction in budgets and the direction with resources from the State.  The ten-year capital investment plan is not published yet.  It will be published in conjunction with this; when this is finished, it will be finished.  I appeal to Deputy Ryan to reserve his judgment until that stage.</p> <p>  I understand Deputy Ryan's frustration and I accept all of that because I know he genuinely believes in what we are trying to achieve, but I would not call this waffle.  If we do not go through this process, then we cannot achieve what Deputy Ryan wants to achieve.  He should bear that in mind.  We will have the publication of this and the ten-year plan, hopefully, in December this year.  Then we will be able to see what we think of it.  This is about trying to win investment in sustainable planning and investment in transport.  Such investment might not have been in place in the past at the level Deputy Ryan sought &ndash; I understand that.  However, this is trying to change the direction.  It will not happen in one budget.  It will take a number of budgets.  That is why this is a 25-year plan to set the course and direction of the country.  We have had a conversation with Deputy Ryan's colleagues about trying to re-invest in towns and villages, urban renewal and invest in transport and energy.  That is what we are trying to do.  It involves a climate mitigation plan as well.  It is about bringing it all together to make it happen.</p> <p>  Deputy Ryan referred to the political system making this happen.  We all accept that plans in the past were not always followed up.  However, I believe Deputy Ryan has seen a demonstration in recent years of how Governments do follow-up on plans and implement then.  It does not matter whether we are discussing housing, jobs or rural action plans.  At times they are box-ticking exercises, but it is important to go through that.  We need to be able to say we have done a specific action and then move to the next one.  The idea is to stick to the plan and follow through.  We have a proven track record of doing that.  I have more belief than Deputy Ryan in the future of this plan.  We will see the first step in the weeks ahead.</p> <p>  Deputy Ryan referred to particular issues.  I gather he does not disagree with our targets, but he is not hopeful that we will implement them.  We can go back to the specific targets if Deputy Ryan wishes and my colleagues may come in at that point.</p> <p>  Deputy Ryan referred to the consultation process.  All the regions and local authorities and anyone else interested have had a role in feeding in to this plan.  There has been any amount of consultation, and it has happened in a more formal way in the past year.  Again, we are not finished.  There are some more weeks of consultation &ndash; the period runs to 3 November.  There is still time for anyone else to have talks.  That is why we are here today - we are here to listen.  Senator Grace O'Sullivan referred to ambition.  We can look at whether we are driving it enough and we can talk about that again.</p> <p>  Deputy Ryan referred to the political system.  Again, this plan does not dictate the political system.  The Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy John Paul Phelan, is bringing a document to Cabinet shortly around the future of local government, a review of the changes we have made and any recommended changes for the future.  I disagree with Deputy Ryan.  I believe the municipal areas are working well.  I have been a councillor and I have worked in a town where there was a cross-over of local authority boundaries and town council boundaries.  It did not always lead to quality or effective decision-making &ndash; there were delays.  Some town councils have done great work and the involvement of councillors is still needed, but there is duplication.  Often, councillors cover different boundaries and as a result we get slower decision making.  The system can play parties off against each other and that does not work either.  The plan refers to areas where there are boundaries and bringing together integrated plans that cover various council boundaries.  That is clever thinking and that is the way it should be done.  The political system has to match that.</p> <p>  I disagree with Deputy Ryan's view that the regional and local authorities are not in a position to deal with this &ndash; they are.  They have been consulted.  After this national ambition is put out, we will have regional and local development strategies which will bring on the implementation.  I believe the system can work and will work.  We will review it, though, because I recognise that some of the municipal areas are large and in some cases it is difficult for councils to cover a great deal of ground.  It depends on the location of a council.  If a council is in Mayo, it can be difficult.  Kerry is a wide area to cover.  The councils have a great deal of work to do.  We will make changes to that if necessary.  However, that does not mean the whole system is wrong.  I believe municipal areas can work well too.</p></speech>

The budget is important because what we spend now on infrastructure is what happens in ten, 15 or 20 years time.  The next three years is when the tap on infrastructure will be turned on.  My reading of the three-year plan is that it is all about roads.  That is the only area of transport we are investing in.  Transport is important.  Transport, land use and housing go together.  If we are going to reduce sprawl, how can the Department justify an 80% or 90% spend on roads versus public transport?  That is what we are doing.  How does that match the strategy?  How does it match the strategy if Dublin decides we are going to have to build a port tunnel?  Where is the sustainability or the lack of sprawl in that?  Page 134 refers to ports and how we have to improve southern port access.  That is all IBEC talk about new roads and more roads.  How can the Department be serious about the plan if investment in the future on transport is the same as it has been for the past three decades?  It is all roads.  How do we stop the sprawl if that is the plan?</p></speech>

However, we are not going to see the step-change Deputy Ryan requires in one budget &ndash; I have made that clear.  That is why the ten-year investment strategy will be the backup to this.  We will not achieve the investment in public transport and in what Deputy Ryan wants to achieve in one budget.</p><p>This thinking will enable all of the Departments to come together with their investment plans for the next ten or 15 years.  Our strategy seeks to shape the thinking and then win investment thereafter.  That is exactly what we are trying to so.   Do my officials wish to comment on any matter?  </p></speech>

The options for the latter will vary depending on the part of the country whether it is tourism, heritage, culture, foreign direct investments, FDIs, or indigenous businesses.</p> <p>  Just like many members in this room who have been involved in many local area plans and development plans, I completely welcome the NPF plan because it gives us a roadmap and framework for where we are going as a country.  The framework means I can plan for my family and for my children's futures.  The plan will create opportunity and choice for them, which was not available before even in my time.  I do not think the plan is waffle or spin.  I think it is quite an ambitious plan.  I presume it will be a moveable document over the next five, ten and 20 years.  For the first time ever we will have a statutory document that all Departments will have to work towards when we invest in the country as a whole, and when we are re-balancing and not being Dublin-centric.  I should be Dublin-centric because that is one of my constituents.  However, I recognise that for the country to grow and be sustainable the country must be viewed in its entirety and not just Dublin as the capital.</p> <p>  I fully welcome this ambitious document and its bottom-up approach.  Many of us in this room have attended numerous pubic consultation meetings throughout the process.  As individual public representatives, we have all been given assistance.  We have had ample opportunity to contribute to the plan and the final date for submissions is 3 November.  I welcome how the public has been included like never before in the formulation of this national planning framework plan.  It is important that we recognise such inclusivity. </p> <p>  The Minister does not have any questions to answer because I only commented on the plan.  I thank him for the engagement that his Department is having with the committee here this morning on this matter.  Members will now ask a couple of questions and I call on the Senator Murnane O'Connor to commence. </p></speech>

The Minister is correct that everything is based on budgets and getting as much money as one can into one's local authority, tourism and all of the different areas.  Under this plan, I want the weaker counties in rural Ireland to get their fair share of development and not be forgotten.</p> <p>  The Minister when he outlined the programme said that there are five key messages, which I welcome.  I have read them all but I have queries about two of them.  He has said that the Government will legislate for an independent office for planning regulation.  What is the timescale for this?  He has also said that there will be a new national ten-year investment plan called smart growth.  A few people have asked me about the plan.  Can he clarify the matter?  </p> <p>  In 2040, we will undertake to consider the merits of developing new structures such as a national land development agency to work with local authorities, which is crucial.  I ask the Minister to clarify the few points that I have made because these are probably the key messages for every rural community and county in Ireland.  We need a framework plan but we must ensure areas like Carlow are not forgotten.  I would hate if the Minister of State forgot Carlow when he left this room.  </p></speech>

I accept and acknowledge that we have a plan that will reform local government administrations.  I do not personally agree that the district councils are working well.  In Drogheda they do not work at all because we do not have a town mayor or town council.  We do not have officials who are responsible for decisions in the town because all of the decisions are made in Dundalk.  It is a joke in terms of local control and accountability, which is regrettable because Drogheda is the largest town in Ireland.</p> <p>  I welcome the plans to change local government that the Department will bring forward.  The plan must work side by side with the new strategic development plan and, therefore, we should have joint documents.  I agree that one without the other does not make sense and one should not leave the other.  We must have proper accountability and growth.  Senator Murnane O'Connor is right about Carlow and there are similar places.  I also agree that we must have joined-up thinking.  </p> <p>  I agree with the comments on transport made by Deputy Eamon Ryan.  I welcome the plan but it is a work in progress.  I hope that the Minister will rethink excluding towns like Drogheda, which is the largest town in Ireland, from the list of towns mentioned in the report.  Due recognition of Drogheda is hugely important to my community.  People want a proper council where decisions are made locally by a county manager. </p></speech>

Will it outline specific projects?  Will it only be an aspirational plan?  Deputy Naughten has raised nearly all of the critical infrastructure needed for the west so I am beginning to wonder if I should have gotten my speak in.</p> <p>  Equally, I wish to comment on the impact that the huge growth of Dublin has had and will have on surrounding counties.  Deputy Eamon Ryan mentioned the development of Dublin Port.  There are ports outside of Dublin that could be developed.  If they were developed they would take pressure off Dublin Port.</p></speech>

Not everything must go into Dublin.  There are areas outside of Dublin.  There are two or three ports in Wicklow that could be developed.</p> <p>  I would like to know the timeframe for the national planning framework, the regional plans and the county development plans.  It would be a step too far for me to include the local area plans.  What is the timeframe to get county development plans in line with the national planning framework?  When will a complete review take place?      </p></speech>

Can the Minister tell us what the process will be from then onwards?</p> <p>  To reiterate what my colleague, Deputy Eamon Ryan, said, he raised the important point that the budget is linked and must be linked to every single thing that we do every day going forward.  The current budget for the draft plan is lacking.  I ask the Government to consider the weak budget that has been provided for the national planning framework.  We need to take an eco-system approach to the whole thing.  I agree with the Minister that everything must be interconnected.  This year's budget is significant and funding must be rigorously examined in terms of the draft national planning framework and the final plan.  I would like him to answer my first query about the timeline for the plan. </p></speech>

We will have the regional strategies from that in 2018 and they will be published.  Also, local area plans will be adopted by 2019 and we will take account of the strategy in those.  The earlier we can align all of our thinking and processes the better success we will have in delivering the strategy.</p> <p>  As will be stated in the planning Bill coming through, the strategy will be reviewed every five years.  The strategy will be have a lot of reviews.  We will formally track and monitor the strategy every five years.  If we want the strategy to work and achieve all of our different ambitions then have ongoing monitoring.  Monthly and quarterly monitoring and analysis of progress has led to success in the other action plans that I have been involved in.</p> <p>  Members were correct to say that the budget is important.</p><p>The recent budget was limited in what it could achieve in terms of the capacity it had, but there is far more potential in the years ahead.  However, as I have learned in politics and in the last few years as a Minister of State in different Departments, if one does not put forward one's argument and the case for investment no budget can save one on the day.  This is about doing one's homework.  If one wishes to target investment in a certain direction, and all of us buy into that here, one must make one's plan and put forward the logic behind it.  It is the business case.  I urge people to see these plans as the business cases to win investment and to drive the direction of the country.  This plan will have a much stronger influence on budgets in the future because we are setting down and agreeing the ambition and direction of where we are trying to go.  That is what we must achieve if all goes well, and there will be scope in future budgets to achieve it.</p><p> With regard to not forgetting Carlow, Wicklow or any other place, this plan is about ensuring there is equal opportunity for all the regions and that everybody's voice is heard, not just Senator Murnane O'Connor's whose voice is very strong.  Again, one is giving these places a sense of purpose, but there must be an economic reason for locating and living in a certain place.  It is not viable for people to continue driving in a car for two hours.  If that was the case, we would have been born with wheels, not legs.  We are trying to give people the option to live and work in their local area, be it Drogheda, Navan or Carlow.  For the information of Deputy O'Dowd, Navan is in a similar situation to Drogheda.  This plan does not limit the ambition or the growth plans of any town or village.  Drogheda and Navan are two of the largest towns in the country and the Deputy lives in one while I live in the other.</p></speech>

I will not name all of them.  The idea of the plan is not to limit ambition but to plan it in a co-ordinated way.  There is great potential for towns.  The larger towns, in particular, have massive potential to grow in a more sustainable way with more job creation and through winning investment.  That is not limited in the plan.  It is encouraged in a planned and co-ordinated way.  However, the discussion around the political decision making process and whether there are municipal areas or town councils is not a matter for this plan.  It is our job in a different format, but not in this strategy.  I agree that they are linked-----</p></speech>

That is not its function.

Drogheda is a town of 41,000 people but there is no council or mayor for the town.  There is no administrative structure, no county manager and no decision making locally.  That is wrong.  There might be the same situation in Navan, but I will not accept it.  My constituents are saying that we cannot allow that to continue.</p></speech>

In the debate last night in the House which was started by Deputy Mattie McGrath we discussed this and its importance.  In that case I cited my town as different.  In my case we have a municipal area that covers the town and it is in a very strong position.  That is something I would encourage people to examine, but it is not a matter for today's discussion.  It is important that all the local councillors and decision makers are involved in implementing these plans.  Its success requires that they buy into it and make it happen.</p> <p>  There were other questions and I am anxious to answer them.  Niall Cussen will talk about the smart growth fund.  Again, it is about trying to target investment into neglected areas of cities, towns and villages where one can invest cleverly to rejuvenate and re-energise them and bring investment back into them.</p> <p>  On the land development agency, if we are going to achieve what we seek here many of us strongly believe that to be in charge one must be in control of some of the land and certainly have a direct link to it.  A land development agency would be key to being able to achieve the ambition here.  Local authorities are only in control when they have assets and land and when they have a say about the land.  It is too late if one leaves it to somebody else outside the local government decision making process.</p></speech>

That is the reason for bringing State agencies and Departments around the table.  We have not had that joined-up thinking among our agencies over the years but we must have it, in one way or another, or we will not achieve our ambitions here.  There is more than one way to skin a cat but we have to find ways to do this joint decision making for the benefit of the country, not just for the benefit of one agency or town over another.  We must come together on this and that is what we are trying to achieve here.  It comes back to the earlier point that one should set out one's thinking and ambition.  It is easier to knock on various people's doors and have the conversation when one has a plan that we all buy into and on which we all agree.  That is what we are trying to do here as best we can.</p> <p>  Chairman, I welcome your understanding of and belief in the process and your involvement in it over the last year by bringing your colleagues with you on the journey with the national planning framework, Ireland 2040, around the country and having a consultation.  We are trying to get people to buy into this.  While there have been more than 800 submissions I would prefer if there had been thousands more.  Planning is exactly what you say - it is about looking at our children and their future and where we are going over the next 20 to 25 years.  For me, planning is about bringing the future into the present, and that one does something about it.  That is what we are trying to do here.  We need to build on that and keep doing as much of that as we can.</p> <p>  I believe I have dealt with most of the questions.  Niall Cussen might wish to comment further on the smart growth fund and David Walsh could also comment if he wishes to add something.</p></speech>

To return to what the Minister and Minister of State have said, particularly around the implications of sprawl and the missed opportunities for developing in our city, town and village cores, it appears to us that there is an opportunity, through land management and prior investment in enabling infrastructure and the public realm, to put in place a mechanism that advantages renewal as opposed to just the continual edge development which we have seen in many urban areas across the country.  This is something we will be working on with our colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the context of the ten year capital plan or the national investment plan.  Some of the mechanics have yet to be worked out but we will embark on that process.</p></speech>

However, it is housing focused.  One could see the smart initiative as being more broadly based with regard to economic, community and social development as well, although obviously having the focus on the built environment and the proper planning outcome.  We will be developing that with our colleagues in the Departments in the months ahead.</p></speech>

It will be both.  However, the final decision will be for the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform so the Deputy can bring his evidence based arguments to them.  It will all be evidence-based decision making.  The idea of having this plan is to influence their thinking and our Department is part of that conversation.  We will not make the final decision because that is for a higher authority but the evidence, ambition and targets in the roadmap for the country marked out here will dictate the thinking there.  That is what this is about.  If the Deputy can link his desires and concerns into this and show that they match up, that will help the cause.</p></speech>

The Senator has read it and I welcome that.  I encourage the members to read it and if they wish to add to it they can in the weeks ahead.  I agree that there is major potential in the marine.  There are particular strategies for that as well.  In addition, people need to know that we invest a great deal of taxpayers' money in that sector and its future.  There is a large amount of top class research and development work ongoing in that area, which will future-proof the sector and encourage more job creation in the years to come.  Again, it will also win investment.  Only a small portion of the investment in research and development is by the State, but the State's involvement and its role in making it happen win extra investment from all over the world from people who recognise the talent and potential in the Irish system.  That is what we are trying to do.</p> <p>  Deputy Casey referred to the ports.  They are mentioned here too.  There is great potential to develop other ports outside the cities.

I welcome the commencement of the Committee Stage debate on this important piece of legislation, the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017.  Let me emphasise that this major piece of legislation arises from public consultations in 2014 on the widespread appreciation of the necessity to reform the system for the appointment of members of the Judiciary.</p> <p>  The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board has served the country well.  I acknowledge the excellence of the Judiciary, which enjoys a very high degree of public confidence.  The programme for Government commits to a new Judicial Appointments Commission, with an independent Chairman and a non-legal majority.</p><p>That is what is delivered in the Bill.  I will be in listening mode today.  I will table no amendments on behalf of the Government on this Stage.  I will not agree any amendment that cuts across the basic tenets of the commitment in the programme for Government.  However, I have not come here with a closed mind.  I certainly do not have a closed mind as regards a number of the issues covered by the amendments.  I express my appreciation for the work that the Deputies have done in recent weeks and their diligent and significant efforts in arriving at a programme of almost 200 amendments.  The matters covered by the amendments show a diversity in thinking and highlight a number of policy differences that we no doubt will debate in some detail today.  I thank the Chairman for convening the meeting and I look forward to debating the amendments with members.</p></speech>

For the notation of members, the first of those is amendment No. 25 in the names of Deputies O'Callaghan and Chambers.  The note from the Bills Office is that this amendment seeks to add the Presidents of the Circuit Court and District Court to the list of members of the commission.  Section 4 of the Bill provides that the expenses incurred in the administration of the Act should be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  Section 14 provides for the payment to members of remuneration and allowances for expenses.  The Bills Office advices that the amendment must, therefore, be considered to be out of order on the grounds that it causes a charge on revenue in accordance with Standing Order 179(3).</p> <p>  Before taking any comment from either of the two proposers, I advise that amendment No. 34 in the name of Deputy Daly has the same ruling.  That amendment seeks to add a person nominated by the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, to the list of members of the commission.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.1132" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017101800002#B01700"><p>I thank the Chairman.  He communicated that to me by way of a letter and has just stated the ruling again.  In fairness to him, it is an instruction that he has received from the Bills Office, so I do not hold him in any way responsible for ruling amendment No. 25 out of order.</p> <p>  The basis for it being ruled out of order is that it incurs a potential charge on revenue, but I find that difficult to accept.  My amendment proposes that the presidents of the Circuit Court and District Court be added to the judicial appointments commission.  No charge is involved in that.  There is no claim for remuneration that a judge is entitled to as a result of being a member of the commission.  We know that the expenses of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, on which sit the presidents of the Circuit Court and District Court, were in the region of less than &euro;5,000 last year, so I do not see how it can be suggested that, by adding them, I am putting a charge on revenue.</p> <p>  What makes it even more surprising is my amendment No. 49, which seeks the appointment of six individuals to the commission.  They would be persons nominated by the Citizens Information Board, an t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s um Ard-Oideachas, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, FLAC and the Top Level Appointments Committee, TLAC.  Some of these are included in Deputy Daly's amendment, which is being ruled out of order, so I do not see how amendment No. 49 stands when amendment No. 25 is ruled out of order.</p> <p>  I am conscious that the Chairman cannot change this, but I want to record my objection.  It is appropriate that this body contain the presidents of the District Court and the Circuit Court.  They are members of the JAAB.  The majority of appointments are to the District and Circuit courts.  By excluding the presidents of those courts from membership of the commission, we are doing a disservice to the public and losing out on important expertise.  The Chairman cannot do anything about it this morning, but I will seek to table amendments to that effect on the next Stage when the Bill returns to the D&aacute;il so as to ensure that those two officeholders are members of the commission.</p></speech>

The Deputy has already indicated that he will resubmit the amendments for Report Stage, which is his entitlement.  Perhaps we will not conclude Committee Stage today, in which instance he will have a period of time in which he may have the matter satisfactorily addressed.  In any event, and as the Deputy rightly said, we will not be able to address the matter further at this meeting, but I will allow the other Deputies affected to make a brief remark before proceeding to each of the individual amendments.</p></speech>

My amendment relates to the two lay people who are nominated by FLAC and the ICCL, which has nothing to do with incurring a charge on the Exchequer.  When we rang the Bills Office yesterday after seeing the rulings and because we could not figure out why in God's name this amendment would be ruled out when those organisations were mentioned elsewhere, the office came up with a completely different technical reason.  We were told that it would have been grand had we included this provision in amendment No. 33 and that we could do that on the next Stage.  The ruling seems rudderless and without basic reasoning.</p> <p>  Although there was a storm, the lateness of the groupings list was not helpful.  It is difficult to prepare if we are only getting the groupings the evening beforehand.</p></speech>

The ruling is inconsistent, contradictory and without rationale.  Two bodies are mentioned in Deputy Daly's amendment and six in Deputy O'Callaghan's, but one amendment is allowed and the other is not.  We have seen examples of this happening in other Bills, when it is asserted that there is an apparent charge on the Exchequer where there is none.  This is not good enough.  Under the Standing Orders, the matter is beyond this committee.  The Chairman is given an instruction that he must underwrite, but whoever is accountable for such a decision should appear before the committee and the ruling should be debated beforehand.</p><p>I think it has to be rectified.</p></speech>

The purpose behind all of these grouped amendments is to try to change the proposed legislation, which has within it a proposed mechanism which will have an office of the judicial appointments commission and, within that office, a director and with the office able to retain staff, hire people and, in effect, become a large, expensive quango.  The reason I say it is going to become large expensive quango is that, in the Explanatory Memorandum prepared by the Minister and given to the D&aacute;il on Second Stage, the last paragraph stated that the estimated costs of the office of the judicial appointments commission would be &euro;1 million <i>per annum</i>.  When that is compared to the current costs for the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, which does the same work, the costs of the JAAB last year were less than &euro;5,000 - a journalist put down a question and got an answer of a figure something over &euro;4,000.</p><p>The work that is going to be performed by this new commission is, in substance, no different from the work that has to date been performed by the JAAB and the workload is not considerable.  The function of this new body is to recommend persons it believes are suitable for appointment to judicial office.  I went back and had a look at the reports of the JAAB for the last number of years.  The job of the board in 2016 was to consider people for eight positions on the Judiciary - one on the Court of Appeal, two on the High Court, one on the Circuit Court and four on the District Court.  That is the job it had - to recommend to the Government persons for eight positions.  It is not something for which we need to set up an office that is going to cost us &euro;1 million a year.  It is not a job that requires us to have a director in place who is going to be paid a big salary and who will appear on Sunday morning radio programmes as the director of the office of the judicial appointments commission.</p><p>We do not need to go through the tortuous process of setting up this quango.  Therefore, the proposal I have in amendment No. 1 is that we will get rid of this office of director because we do not need it.  At present, the JAAB does its job perfectly well with a secretary - a Mr. Ryan - who performs the function and convenes the meetings.  The board meets three or four times a year to consider applications and make its recommendations.  In 2015 the JAAB report revealed there were 11 appointments in that year and, on average, we are talking about ten, 11 or 12 appointments each year that need to be advised upon by this new body.  I think it an excessive waste of money and waste of time to set up this large structure which will have an office, a director and staff.  The purpose of amendment No. 1 is to remove &quot;Director&quot; from the definitions.</p><p>Amendment No. 7 seeks to remove the definition of &quot;Office&quot; from section 2.  Amendment No. 10 seeks to insert a new position into the definitions section, where, instead of having a director, let us do what we have under the JAAB and have a secretary to the commission.  Amendment No. 96 is a similar amendment, which proposes to change the reference to &quot;Director&quot; to &quot;Secretary&quot;, and amendment No. 97 seeks the same.  In amendment No. 100, I seek to delete &ldquo;Director, a member of staff of the Office&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;, and I seek the same in amendment No. 103.  Amendment No. 109 again seeks to refer to the secretary of the commission as opposed to the director, and the same applies to amendments Nos. 110 to 112, inclusive.  Amendment No. 113 seeks to insert, &quot;The Secretary shall be responsible to the Commission for the performance of his or her functions&quot;.  </p><p>Amendment No. 180 seeks to delete lines 25 and 26 of page 39 which refer to the review of a procedures committee.  One of the things it is required to do is monitor &quot;the effectiveness of the administrative support provided by the Office to the Commission&quot;.  We do not need administrative support provided by an office of a commission whose job is to make recommendations in respect of ten to 15 positions each year.  Amendment No. 184 refers to lines 8 to 10 of page 40.  Again, similar to the previous amendment, this seeks to remove the requirement to ensure the effectiveness of the administrative support provided by the office of the commission.  The final amendment, amendment No. 191, has the effect of seeking to remove from the Long Title to the Bill the reference to it setting up an office of a judicial appointments commission.</p><p>Irrespective of the differences people may have about how this body should be constituted, the last thing anyone wants to do is set up an unnecessary statutory body that is going to be staffed by more people than it is recommending for positions each year.  We do not need a huge office, we do not need a director, we do not need glossy publications and we do not need anyone appearing in the media with the introduction, &quot;Here we are joined today by the director of the office of the judicial appointments commission&quot;, and giving his or her views on the Sunday newspapers.  We are just creating an unnecessary mini-empire.  The JAAB does the job for less than &euro;5,000 a year.  Why set up this body that is going to cost &euro;1 million?  We should give it to trained judges.  I am sorry for going on but there are a lot of amendments.</p></speech>

The Deputy also intends to delete sections 32 and 34 in their entirety.  Section 32 provides for the legislative basis and funding arrangements for the administrative support office headed by a director attached to the commission.  The office will be under the control and management of the commission and, subject to the consent of the Minister and approval of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, it may have staff members who would be Civil Service employees.  Section 34 sets out the functions of the director.</p><p> Amendments Nos. 109 to 113, inclusive, would alter section 33 by the substitution of the director with a secretary who, on his or her own without any staff resources or administrative back-up, would be responsible for the workings of the commission.  The amendments would change the term "Director" wherever it appears throughout the rest of the Bill with the term "Secretary".  This would mean that in place of the director, a secretary would instead, under section 24, be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts.  The same would apply in respect of section 29 which protects against disclosure of confidential information obtained in the course of performing functions as director or members of staff of the judicial appointments commission office and, likewise, in respect of section 30 which safeguards the confidentiality of the proceedings of the commission and its communications.</p><p> The amendments would also remove from the Bill the role the Committee on Procedures has under section 58 in monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the administrative support provided by the office to the commission and the obligation the committee has, following that review, to report to the commission and make recommendations, as necessary, with a view to ensuring the effectiveness of the administrative support.</p><p> Amendment No. 191 would change the Long Title in so far as it relates to the establishment of the judicial appointments commission office.</p><p> The Schedule sets out further necessary detail regarding the status of the commission as a body corporate; administrative arrangements in respect of the official seal; and what circumstances might cause the director or the Civil Service staff of the director to cease to attach to the office.  We should bear in mind that amendment No. 35 concerns the Schedule which the select committee will discuss later.</p><p> I am at somewhat of a loss to understand the logic of the amendments and the proposed deletion of all reference to the office of the new commission and its new director.</p><p> The need to ensure value for money in respect of all Exchequer spending goes without saying and no one is in a position to dispute that.  Deputies will know, however, that the issue of inadequate resources was highlighted as part of the review of the current system.  A key element of the submissions made by various stakeholders when the draft Bill was in its early stages and subject to public consultation concerned the provision of a dedicated resource to the new commission.  For example, I examined a submission made in 2014 by the judicial appointments review committee in which the committee stressed the importance of adequate resources to enable the new appointments body to carry out its functions.  The committee, like my office, frequently receives correspondence from various stakeholders in this area commenting on the need to ensure there are proper and adequate resources in place.  More often than not, we are subjected to criticism for a dearth of a resources.</p><p> I draw members' attention to the Dublin declaration issued by the European Network of Councils for the Judiciary in May 2012 in which the network underlined the importance of resources in the following statement: "The body in charge of the selection and appointment of judges must be provided with adequate resources to a level commensurate with the programme of work it is expected to undertake each year and must have independent control over its own budget, subject to the usual requirements as to audit."</p><p> I understand the GRECO evaluation team has been in contact with the committee.  In its fourth round evaluation report on Ireland in 2014, the team stressed that the new, more profound, selection procedure for the recruitment and promotion of judges needed to be provided with what it described as appropriate resources.</p><p> I listened carefully to Deputy O'Callaghan's comments on this matter.  The programme of work to be undertaken by the new commission under the Bill is significant when compared with the current arrangements under the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, system.  These arrangements are resourced from within the Courts Service, with attendant and related costs subsumed in the courts Vote.  It is important that a budget and adequate resources are provided to the commission, that it is independent and that the director and other members of the new body do not feel in any way restricted or compromised in the manner in which they undertake their business.</p><p> As I pointed out in response to remarks made during Second Stage, the replacement of the JAAB with a new commission will represent a modest but much needed investment to bring the system into the 21st century.  While I accept Deputy O'Callaghan's point that there may not be a large number of appointments annually, each appointment is of vital importance and could attract scores of applications.  Furthermore, the making of appointments is not the only business the commission will undertake.  The Bill also tasks it with a significant research, development and consultative role to ensure the State has in place and maintains a model of best practice for the selection of members of the Judiciary.  The commission must be kept up to date with and abreast of national and international best practice.  A specialist body of this nature will generate a small staffing requirement and needs adequate resources to function effectively.</p><p> For the reasons outlined, I am not in a position to accept the amendments, which would have the effect of deleting all references to the office of the new commission and its proposed director.  This would create a fundamental flaw in the legislation before the office had an opportunity to function.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.1150" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1255" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017101800002#D00200"><p>I thank the Minister for his response.  Is this change worth a 200-fold increase in the current funding arrangement?  The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, has a budget of only &euro;5,000, whereas the proposed commission will have a budget of &euro;1 million.  Is a 200-fold increase in funding for the work the Minister describes proportionate?  No one would argue it is proportionate.</p> <p>  The commission will appoint a small number of judges.  The funding and other arrangements the Minister proposes amount to a complete bureaucratisation of the Civil Service.  Why can existing resources, for example, staff of the Courts Service or Department, not be transferred to the new office?  The proposal to create such a layered structure is excessive.  The Minister's party expressed pride in abolishing quangos, yet it proposes to create another large quango.  It is proposed is to increase the current budgetary allocation for judicial appointments by a multiple of 200.  Other areas of government and the public service require an increase in funding.  This proposal is excessive and does not correspond with the logical funding arrangements the Minister set out a moment ago.</p><p>Research and development will not cost 200 times the cost of &euro;5,000.  I am worried by the funding changes proposed by the Minister in terms of this Civil Service change in the context of other changes within his Department.  For example, the Gambling Control Bill requires significant funding but it has been kicked to touch by his Government.  To propose increasing a cost by 200 times the existing amount for the appointment of ten or 11 judges, on average, is completely excessive.  In my view, the proposal cannot be accepted.  That is why the amendments put forward by Deputy O'Callaghan for a secretary and utilising, for example, the Courts Service or the Department to administer the scheme would be far more appropriate and a better use of State resources.  It is well and good to mention the need for effective research and development but that is the classic speak around the bureaucracy of quangos.  The funding arrangement for the office would only continually grow beyond the proposal of 200 times the cost.  That is why I think the amendments proposed by Deputy O'Callaghan are proportionate to the work that the commission will actually do.  The proposal by the Minister is completely excessive and illogical and that is why it is more prudent to take on the amendments that we have proposed.  I do not think anyone can justify in any area of the Civil Service increasing a cost by 200.  </p></speech>

It is a fairly straightforward body.  If we were talking about a judicial council body then there would be staffing implications and a big volume of work to be done that is not being done now.  I do not see such implications for the present proposal.  Since 2002, there have been 90 appointments to the three superior courts or an average of just over six appointments per year.  Such a workload does not require a permanent office, a director or that type of resource.  As the Minister has said, the office would have a significantly bigger workload than the present arrangement.  I would like his view explained as I do not see any basis for his claim.  I do not know where the hundreds of applications will come from if they do not exist now because all we are changing is the method of appointment.</p> <p>  There will not be research into the whole structure of the Judiciary.  The research element is just for judicial appointments, which is not rocket science.  There are examples available from other jurisdictions.  One analyses the nearest peer reviewed study and say, "Sure maybe we can make that a bit better."  The work does not require a permanent office.  I had not noted the points in our amendments and it is something that we bypassed.  The arguments that have been made are pretty strong.  As things stand, I support the amendments.  </p></speech>

We all want a better system for the appointment of judges and one that is clean, transparent and accountable.  Sometimes people confuse bureaucracy with good regulation.  One does not need more bureaucracy to have good regulation and practice.  Members confuse the two dimensions a lot of the time in the D&aacute;il.</p> <p>  In the normal run of things if a Deputy made the same proposal it would not reach Committee Stage because it would be ruled out of order by a money message before it even got here.  I am conscious of the fact that I have heard the now Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, speak a lot about this matter over the past couple of years.  I am very much in agreement with him that we probably have too much bureaucracy and too many quangos, which should be tackled.  We need to do things efficiently and cleanly but that does not mean more bureaucracy and quangos.     </p></speech>

I take the point that Deputy Wallace made about a money message.  It is a ridiculous procedural rule that Deputies outside of the Government cannot bring amendments that bring a charge on the Exchequer.</p> <p>  I am always suspicious of the arguments made for quangos and public policy because, very often, the attitude that people take to a quango depends on the work done by the quango.  To be honest, a lot of the debate comes from a very right wing view of the State and public-funded bodies.  Sometimes some of the rhetoric can be unhelpful and not directed at the purpose that a particular body can do.  That said, an argument has been made that the difference in the cost of the existing process and the proposed one is fairly considerable.  Is it possible to estimate how much the work costs the Courts Service specifically at this moment in time?  Obviously the sum of &euro;5,000 does not cover the work that is being done and the cost is subsumed within the budget for the Courts Service.  Has the Minister a rough idea of how much the work costs the Courts Service?    </p></speech>

The question has been posed already.  I have no doubt that the Minister will reply when he is in a position to do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.1166" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017101800002#E01600"><p>The Deputies have said that the entire cost of the current process is &euro;5,000.  I find that very difficult to accept and, in fact, I do not believe that is the case.  The cost is considerably more than the sum of &euro;5,000.</p> <p>  In any event, this is a completely different structure.  It is a completely different body.  It is a body that is empowered in a way that the current Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, is not.  For example, the body will have to engage in the setting out of models of recruitment.  It will have to embark upon selection testing.</p> <p>  One of the criticisms of the current judicial appointments procedure is the fact that over the years, since the operation of JAAB, not one interview has taken place even though it is catered for in the legislation.  I would be confident that the situation will change under the new structures, that there will be an interview process and models of selection testing designs.  I am confident that there will be an office albeit modest in form.  The indicative spend is something in the region of &euro;1 million.  That may not well be the case but I would expect that it would be in or about that sum, and probably less.  </p> <p>  I have to stress yet again the importance of adequately resourcing a body that will be charged with new responsibilities, new powers, new functions and a new role.  We will be changing, in a fundamental way, the method of appointing members of the Judiciary.  It is not unreasonable that the new commission should be adequately resourced.  In fact, we can look back on a number of pieces of legislation that have passed through this committee in recent times, and in more distant times, where members on all sides repeatedly castigated the Minister for setting up new structures with new authorities, roles, functions and powers but then said they are no good without the resources.</p><p>Now an estimate has been given on the matter of resources to ensure that the new office would not be hamstrung in terms of its remit.  At the first hurdle, we are faced with amendments that will completely change the structure of the new body, which to my mind will do it a fundamental disservice.  </p><p> Of course, there will be an arrangement to ensure that any moneys or resources are audited.  It is important at this stage that we would be in a position to estimate the level of funding that such a new body might require.  </p><p> On the current cost, it is the Courts Service that offers the support services that in effect discharges funding in respect of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB.  I believe it is unfair to say that the entire cost associated with that body is the sum that has been put forward by the Deputies.  To suggest that we will exceed current funding by 200 times that amount is not a fair and adequate reflection of reality.</p></speech>

The reason that I put out the figure of &euro;5,000 is that it was my recollection of a report in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i>a number of months ago which reported that the expenses of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board last year was in the region of &euro;5,000.  I could be wrong - it was just a report in a newspaper.  I ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to inform members of the current cost of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  If the Minister does not have the information to hand, I ask that it be provided to the committee secretariat subsequently.</p><p>How many people will be employed in the judicial appointments commission?  How many people should be employed?  The Minister said he was at a loss to understand the logic of the amendments tabled.  The reason I tabled amendments is that I have a vision of what will happen three years from now in the justice committee.  The Minister for Justice and Equality will have probably a higher job than his current role as Minister.  The judicial appointments commission will be making a presentation to the committee, at which the director and staff will be present.  They will have glossy publications.  That quango will cost &euro;1 million a year.  As we know quangos only get more expensive.  Unless we structure it properly on Committee Stage, it will get out of control.</p><p>The Minister stated that the current Judicial Appointments Advisory Board performs its function very well.  If it does this work for a figure in the region of what I believe it to be, then the proposal to increase that spending up to &euro;1 million per annum is not justified.</p></speech>

It is not effectively expenditure that is accountable in the Justice and Equality Vote.  I am sure I will be in a position at an early date to provide the Select Committee with a breakdown of costings from the Courts Service.  I would be very surprised if it is within an envelope of &euro;5,000.  I will come back to the committee on that.</p> <p>  In respect of staffing of the judicial appointments commission, we are dealing with the office of a director, which will be a director and a handful of staff, approximately three support staff, and with related expenditure one is looking at a figure in the region of &euro;700,000.</p></speech>

The amendment seeks to remove from the definition of &quot;lay person&quot; a person who previously held juridical office.  At present the Bill states:</p><blockquote>&ldquo;lay person&rdquo; means a person who&mdash;<br /><br />(a) does not hold, and has never held, judicial office,</blockquote> <p>The amendment would remove &ldquo;, and has never held,&rdquo;.  From the way the legislation is drafted, members will be aware that individuals who are perceived as being non-lay are not eligible for it.  When it comes to the recruitment and appointment of lay people, ex-judges are expressly excluded.  That means peoples such as Ms Justice Mary Laffoy, Mrs. Justice Susan Denham, Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness and Mr. Justice John Murray, who would be very good on advising the commission as to who would be suitable persons for appointment to the Judiciary are expressly excluded from it.  I think it is unfair that they are expressly excluded from it.</p><p>Amendment No. 5 is in a similar vein.  It seeks to delete certain wording in subsection (<i>c</i>) of the definition of lay person.  It seeks to remove the wording &ldquo;, and in the relevant period specified by subsection (2) for the purposes of this paragraph, was not [a practising barrister or solicitor],&rdquo;.  It should simply state that practising barristers and solicitors are not eligible because they will not be regarded as lay people.  However, to go further and maintain that somebody who previously was a barrister or solicitor is excluded is nonsensical.</p><p>In response to the earlier amendment the Minister said he was at a loss to understand the logic of my amendment.  Similarly, I am at a loss to understand the logic of excluding people who have expertise from this commission.  The Bill specifically excludes retired judges and people who formerly were lawyers.  Just because they were formally lawyers does not mean they are currently lawyers.  As I mentioned in the D&aacute;il, nobody would call the Minister, Deputy Ross, a stockbroker.  The fact that he was a stockbroker does not mean that he is a stockbroker.  There is no reason to exclude somebody who previously practised or worked as a barrister or solicitor.</p><p>Amendment No. 6 is in the name of Deputy Clare Daly.  Was that the one that was ruled out of order?</p></speech>

Again I believe that is unnecessary.  If we are trying to include lay people, the legislation should simply state they cannot be a judge, barrister or solicitor.

There is a certain amount of wanting to create "Lanigan's Ball" out of this, with "I stepped out and she stepped in again".  It is not feasible or reasonable that someone could step down from a post only to be reclassified immediately as a lay person and return in a different role.</p> <p>  To pick up on Deputy O'Callaghan's opening point, no one would call the Minister, Deputy Ross, a stockbroker.  However, if he applied for a job the day after he left his current one, people would say that.  The spirit of the proposal is to have a real lay involvement - not just Judiciary and ex-Judiciary cosily and collectively examining something, but to broaden the base far beyond that.  There is an underlying idea in many of the objections to this proposal that the only people who have the expertise to do this job can only come from one section.  For that reason, I disagree with Deputy O'Callaghan's amendments.</p></speech>

I am not inclined to accept that there is any need for this refinement of the definition.  I am satisfied that the definition is sufficiently wide to encapsulate any person irrespective of whether he or she is a member of the forces mentioned in Deputy Sherlock's unmoved amendment or a member of the Civil Service, and that any such person will not be considered to be a lay person in the context of the Bill and to be in a position to be appointed as a lay member of the commission.</p><p>Amendment No. 4 in the names of Deputies O'Callaghan and Chambers seeks to delete the provision that a lay person shall not have held any judicial office.  I thank the Deputies for their amendment.  Its purpose seems to support a later amendment on behalf of the Deputies relating to the designation of the chairperson of the commission.  We are not discussing the substantive matter of lay chairing or, indeed, lay composition of the commission <i>per se</i>in this grouping, but I cannot accept an amendment that has as its objective the inclusion in the definition of &quot;lay member&quot; a person who has formerly been a judge.</p><p>Amendment No. 5 seeks to amend the definition of &quot;lay person&quot; and would have the effect of allowing, in conjunction with amendment No. 11, that a lay person shall not be a practising barrister or solicitor.  I cannot accept this amendment.  A reading of the section will show that it has been carefully structured to allow a lay person who was practising as a barrister or solicitor in a period of 15 years or more prior to the appointment to be considered to be a lay person.  On balance, this is a proportionate provision and appropriately reflects what I believe to be an accepted sense of what we mean by &quot;lay person&quot;.  I would have thought that one of the requirements for someone to fulfil the definition of a lay person would be for him or her to be a non-legal person.  That is the import of the legislation.  A lay person cannot just have been a practising solicitor or barrister.  That would not be in keeping with the careful balance around which the commission is structured.</p><p>It is my belief that, when we refer to lay people, we are discussing people who are separate and distinct from the legal profession.  Some people could regard section 2(2) - &quot;The relevant period for the purposes of <i>paragraph (c) </i>of the definition of &quot;lay person&quot; in <i>subsection (1) </i>is the period of 15 years immediately preceding the latest date on which a person may apply to participate in the selection process&quot; - as unduly harsh.  In the circumstances, it represents a balance on the basis of what we might consider to be a lay, or non-legal, person.</p><p>I would rather not respond to amendment No. 6 in the name of Deputy Daly until after I have heard from her unless the committee desires otherwise.</p></speech>

Its purpose seems to be to insert into section 2, which deals with definitions, a modification of the definition of "lay person" to allow for nominees to the commission from FLAC and the ICCL to be considered as lay persons.  This relates to amendments Nos. 33 and 34 in the name of Deputy Daly.  They seek to modify the membership of the commission in section 12 by replacing two of the six lay members with nominees of the ICCL and FLAC instead of having the members recruited through the Public Appointments Service, PAS.</p> <p>  I have a difficulty with amendment No. 6 in so far as the strategy for selection of the lay members in the Bill is to have them selected independently and professionally by the PAS in accordance with their experience and expertise, which are criteria set out in section 12.  The reasonable intention is to get as wide as possible a mix and coverage of the desired skills and experience among the cohort of lay members who might be appointed.  The PAS will be selecting from a wide pool of potential applicants, including people who have experience in the organisations referred to by Deputy Daly.  It is open to them to apply should they deem it appropriate or desirable.  The application process would not just be open to the organisations named in the amendment, but also to similar organisations working in like fields.</p> <p>  The PAS will use the selection process to screen the suitability and experience of candidates in a way that would probably not be done in a nomination process.</p><p>We have sufficient experience, either at Government level or at Houses of the Oireachtas level, for us to be assured that when it comes to the appointment of persons who are recommended by the Public Appointments Service, PAS, they will have been carefully and independently selected.  Having said that, I do not wish to deny the relevance of the expertise or the experience that people from the organisations referred to by Deputy Daly would bring to the table in the new commission.  On balance, I believe that categories of expertise and experiences as set out in section 15 of the Bill, as requisites for what we describe as lay members, adequately covers these areas.  I appreciate what Deputy Daly is doing here and I acknowledge the well-intended nature of the amendment, but it may well be too narrow.</p></speech>

I will not go into all the arguments on that now, but the Minister is correct that we have a huge problem in the way in which the overall lay person representation is being administered by the PAS.  The sort of criteria that is laid down is very much destined to pack the commission with senior civil servant types.  They do not have the necessary diversity or skill sets.  Particular types of skills such as commerce and finance have been mentioned.  We have a number of amendments to change these criteria.</p> <p>  One of the ideas we have, upon which we are not too fixed as it was a little bit of a rush job to get the amendments in at the end, is for a mix of lay people to be considered.  A change of criteria could be made around the lay people and some of the commission members could come from representative bodies, such as the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  A split like this could be made.  We will park that argument for now, even though it is linked, but we will make the argument strongly later on.</p> <p>  In the event that it was agreed that FLAC and the ICCL would be a representative or nominating body for a lay person, this amendment provides that those appointees would not be precluded from being deemed to be a lay person if they had a legal background, given that it is very likely that someone working in FLAC or the ICCL, for example, may have some type of a legal background.  The amendment was a way for NGO nominations not to be prohibited because they had a legal background.  It is open to change.</p> <p>  I had a certain sympathy for a number of the broader points made by the Minister in replying to Deputy O'Callaghan's amendments on barristers, solicitors and so on.</p></speech>

The point was well made by Deputy Brophy.  Whatever about the 15 year bar, with the amendment as currently drafted it would be possible for a person to leave the legal profession on Monday and be deemed a lay member on Tuesday.  I believe this is problematic.  While I am not necessarily convinced, I am open to the idea of revising the 15 year limit downwards.  I would consider that, if such an amendment was tabled.  The possibility that a person could immediately be deemed a lay person is wrong and I do not think it works.</p> <p>  I very much support the principle and the ideas behind Deputy Daly's amendment.  I have tabled similar amendments such as amendment No. 50.  Even though I have not named them specifically, FLAC, the ICCL and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission are the type of organisations I have in mind.  It is important that we strive to have organisations with their perspective and expertise reflected and represented among the lay people on the commission.</p></speech>

In section 15 of the Bill, which deals with the selection categories, there is specific reference in subsection (7) to the categories of people having experience in human rights, equality or issues concerning diversity among members of society; commerce, finance or administration, including public administration; board membership and corporate governance; and professional dispute resolution or mediation activities.</p><p>We will undertake to give the matter further consideration but I do not want to form the view that we are immediately or implacably opposed to the points raised.  I do not want to act in any way that might be exclusive of certain or other organisations.</p><p>This brings me to Deputy Wallace's amendment No. 69, to section 15, which requires PAS, when recommending persons for appointment as lay people on the commission, to have regard to matters of gender equality and population diversity.  I agree with Deputy Wallace that some consideration needs to be given in this regard.  I am anxious to look at other legislation.  For example, the Act providing for the setting up the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has a specific reference to gender equality.  Let us look at that legislation to see if we can agree something for Report Stage.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 states:</p><blockquote>In making recommendations for appointment of persons to the Commission under this section, the Service, and the Government shall have regard to the need to ensure that the members of the Commission broadly reflect the nature of Irish society and that such persons possess knowledge of, or experience in... matters connected with human rights...</blockquote> <p>If we agree to look at a similar provision for Report Stage, which I believe would meet the import of Deputy Wallace's amendment, it would also address many of the issues referred to by Deputy Daly in this group of amendments and later on in the Bill.  If Members consider that the 15 year bar is unduly restrictive or draconian, we could look at it also.</p><p>With regard to amendment No. 4 in the names of Deputies Jim O' Callaghan and Jack Chambers, it is very difficult to sustain publicly a popular view as to how a former judge who has practiced as a judge in the courts for many decades could be regarded as a non-legal person consequent to their retirement or leaving the Bench.  I believe there is a challenge around how they could be immediately described as a lay person.</p><p>It is equally difficult to sustain a position that a person who is not currently a practising barrister or solicitor but who was recently engaged full-time in either of those professions could suddenly be regarded as a non-legal person and therefore regarded as a lay person.  There is a difficulty there and we need to meet it in a way that ensures public confidence in what we are doing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.1209" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1355" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017101800002#K00200"><p>I am inclined to agree with the Minister's last point.  For example, at the moment if we avail of a former judge to chair a commission - and we are running out of them for commissions of investigation currently - we still regard them as being legal.  If they are a former judge, we assume and we see them more on the legal side than on the lay side.  I would agree with the Minister's point in that respect.</p><p>On amendment No. 69, I was a bit surprised that my amendment was put in this group of amendments, although there is a link with Deputy Daly's amendment.  From my point of view they are actually linked to other amendments that I have tabled.  Amendment No. 69 provides that the Public Appointments Service, PAS, should have regard to &quot;... the objective that the membership should comprise equal numbers of men and women&quot;.  That may be a consideration in the overall commission, including lay and legal members.  This part of the amendment is pretty self-explanatory and it ensures that we try to have equal numbers of men and women as lay members.  The second part of the amendment says that consideration should also include &quot;the objective that the membership should reflect the diversity within the population as a whole&rdquo;.  That is very broad and I have dealt with it more specifically when dealing with other parts of the legislation.  I thought those amendments might have gone together.</p><p>For example, in section 15(5) there is a provision that when selecting the six lay members for the judicial appointments commission, the PAS will have regard to whether the candidates have knowledge or experience of the matters set out in section 15(7)<i>(a)</i>to <i>(g</i>).  Subsection <i>(d</i>) refers to the processes and procedures for making appointments to public office or to senior positions in public or private sector organisations.  Subsection (<i>f</i>) refers to board membership and corporate governance.  The amendment to propose the removal of subsections (<i>d</i>) and (<i>f</i>) was drafted to remove any requirement or desire by PAS for candidates to have experience in public sector appointments, board membership and corporate governance, with a view to broadening the potential for the PAS to pick outside of the usual career civil servants or retired civil servants who would be likely to have experience in these areas.  This would encourage as broad and diverse an approach as possible by the PAS rather than restricting the PAS only to candidates who have such experience, and it would minimise the potential for public sector groupthink within the commission.</p><p>We do not want the commission to be stacked with civil servants.  The Minister, Deputy Ross was at pains to tell Deputies that one of the driving desires behind this Bill was to depoliticise the selection of judges but I am afraid that it could make it even more politicised.  If the lay members of the commission are going to be creatures of government, and we would argue civil servants tend to be such creatures, then the paws of government may be strengthen in how judges are to be selected.</p><p>The judicial appointments commission is unique and would be best served by a diverse membership with a dynamic and innovative approach to decision making.  The inclusion of lay members with little or no experience of public sector appointments processes or board memberships would be preferable.  This is also the reasoning behind the amendment affecting <i>(e</i>), which is amendment No. 67, to remove reference to public administration and to include civil society and trade union activity.  I understand that we will deal with this amendment later on.  This would encourage the PAS to cast the net wider for lay members from these backgrounds rather than seeking lay members from the finance, commerce and public administration sectors as is currently proposed in subsection (<i>e</i>) drafted by the Government.  I argue that this would avoid and move away from the amount of political influence in how judges are appointed.  I believe that taking this approach will be positive.</p></speech>

I am aware that the programme for Government has said there would be a lay majority and a lay chairman of the commission but perhaps the Minister will give his own personal and political opinion.  Does he think it is a good idea that retired judges are excluded from membership of this commission? Consider the fact that we go to retired judged to chair commissions of investigation - as Deputy Wallace has said - and we go to retired judges to ask them to chair tribunals of inquiry.  One would think that they would be qualified for this role and would be good at assessing who would make a good judge.  I would appreciate if the Minister did not say what is in the programme for Government.  I am asking him for his own political and personal view; does he think it is a good idea that his legislation expressly excludes retired judges from membership of a judicial appointments commission?</p></speech>

I will respond to Deputy O'Callaghan first.  My political views are entirely in accordance with the programme for Government, as a Member of the Government that agreed the programme.  This legislation is an important component of the programme for Government.  It is challenging to sustain a position that a member of the Judiciary who for one reason or another steps down from that role can suddenly be categorised as a non-legal person.  This is a challenge for public perception.  I take the point made by Deputy O'Callaghan about retired judges serving the public well after their retirement.  It is fair to say that if one looks across the current panel of retired judges in Irish society most of them are actively engaged in some form of commission of investigation or other.  The matter of their appointment is associated with their careers as judges.  From time to time they are described as a retired, eminent, legal figure or a retired, eminent member of the Judiciary.  There is a difficulty in regarding these retired judges as lay persons or non-legal persons.  Where Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment is concerned, this perception presents us with a difficulty.  I believe that it is hard to sustain a view that having served the State well for decades a retired, eminent judge can suddenly be regarded as a lay person or a non-legal person.  It is hard to sustain that view and I would have a difficulty in that.</p> <p>  With regard to Deputy Wallace's amendment, I will look at it again.  The Deputy made references to other matters in the latter part of his contribution that I will address later.  I will not detain the committee now as we will come back to those issues later in the debate.  We are currently discussing amendment No. 69 and I do not disagree at all with the intention of the Deputy.  I will look at a similar type of construct in other legislation such as the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 which I have already mentioned.</p><p>In fairness to the Bill as drafted, we have made specific reference to ensuring that the Public Appointments Service considers certain matters, which I believe are robust and meet most of the concerns of Deputy Wallace.  In regard to the concerns that are not met, I will consider them between now and Report Stage.</p><p> I do not disagree with the intention behind his amendment.  I do not want to be unduly restrictive either.  Deputy Clare Daly's amendment No. 6 is still under consideration.  I am trying to be helpful.  I came to this meeting with an open mind and I am listening to the views of members with a view to improving the legislation.  If I were to accept the import of Deputy Daly's amendment, we could be faced with a proposition that if the nominees of a number of organisations that are mentioned happened to be lawyers, I do not believe we can therefore automatically regard these people as being lay members of the commission.  In terms of the objective, what we want to do is the same but we need to do that without being unduly restrictive or without having consequences that are not intended by the amendment.</p><p> I will not accept the amendment but I will look at the issues raised by Deputies Daly and Wallace in the context of Report Stage, having regard to the points they made with which I do not disagree. </p></speech>

Under the legislation as drafted there will be a series of committees.  Amendment No. 8 seeks the deletion of the definition of &quot;Procedures Committee&quot;.  Subsequent amendments, to which we will come to consider presently, seek the deletion of other committees that are referred to in the Bill.  The purpose of the amendment is to try to make the statutory process much simpler.  As I mentioned in respect of the first amendment, there is only a series of limited appointments upon which the commission will be asked to advise each year.  As I mentioned earlier, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB in its 2016 report advised of its work on eight positions.  In the 2015 report there were 11 appointments arising from the work of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.</p><p>The Bill proposes a structure of a &quot;Procedures Committee&quot; and separate committees for each individual court.  There will be a District Court committee, a Circuit Court committee, a High Court committee and committees for the other courts.  My view is this will make the process unnecessarily complicated.  It is important to have one group of people who are assessing the applications that come in.  I do not think it is necessary to have separate committees to consider separate applications.  The committee may think that a candidate who has applied for a Circuit Court position may not be suitable for that position but would be suitable for a position in the District Court, for which he or she also may have applied.  In the circumstances, putting in this architecture of different committees is making the process much more complicated.  </p><p>Amendment No. 8 seeks the deletion of the definition of &quot;Procedures Committee&quot;.  The next amendment in the group, No. 84, is in the name of Deputy Wallace but I do not know if Deputy Wallace wants to deal with it now or if he prefers, I can continue with my next amendment.</p></speech>

We are seeking the removal of the words "the Procedures Committee" and the substitution of "Commission".  The commission will be doing this work as opposed to the procedures committee and that is the purpose of amendments Nos. 162 to 172, inclusive, in my name.  Deputy Jack Chambers and I also seek to delete the references to committees and just have the commission fulfilling one function.  In amendments Nos. 175 to 179, inclusive, to section 55, we are seeking to delete the references to committees and just have the commission fulfilling one function.  In the further amendments Nos. 181 to 183, inclusive, to section 58, we seek to do the same thing, namely, to get rid of the procedures committee and just have the responsibility in the legislation as a responsibility of the commission, rather than the procedures committee.  I think it will be easier that way.  I do not think a body of this size, which has a limited amount of work needs to break itself into different committees.  It will make the process more complicated and bureaucratic.  It will make the function more difficult for the commission to perform and for that reason, I think we should get rid of the architecture which has the procedures committee.  The commission should be responsible for all the functions in the legislation.</p><p>In substance, it will not change the thrust of the legislation because all the functions that are specified in the Bill as being functions to be performed by the procedures committee will be functions that will remain but they will be functions that will have to be performed by the commission itself rather than by a separate committee.</p></speech>

Their purpose is to remove the notion that the chair has to be a lay person.  We are proposing a situation in which the chair will be picked by the committee.  There is too much focus in the Bill on always having a lay majority.  For example, the proposed amendments to sections 18(5), 19(2) and 19(5) propose to remove the requirement that the quorum be made up of a lay majority and that the procedures committee and any other sub-committee have a lay majority.  There may well end up being a quorum with a lay majority and a procedures committee and a subcommittee with a lay majority but I do not see the need to require this in advance in legislation.</p> <p>  The Bar Council submission refers to the committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe and its statement that the procedure for the appointment of judges should be transparent and independent in practice.  The authority taking the decision on the selection and career of judges should be independent of the Government and the Administration.  In order to safeguard its independence, rules should ensure that its members are selected by the Judiciary and that the authority decides itself on its procedural rules.  There is deliberately too much focus in the Government's approach, both publicly and in these kind of legislative amendments, on promoting a populist lay-versus-law tension which serves the Government well in distracting the media and public from the fact that Government control of judicial appointments may be strengthened by this Bill.  The lay-versus-law focus in these sections also seems to have the aim of polarising membership of the commission.</p></speech>

The purpose of amendment No. 8 is to delete the definition of the procedures committee in section 2 of the Bill.  Several amendments are directly related.  Many of these are drafting amendments in the group.  I note that section 19 of the Bill is opposed, which is the section of the Bill that sets up the procedures committee.  The main effect of these changes, if they are to be favourably considered, is to remove from the Bill the process relating to the procedures committee but to retain the functions the Bill envisages the procedures committee would have and to assign these features or functions to the commission.</p> <p>  Related amendments have the effect of removing sections 53(1), 55(1) and 55(2) which are the requirements of the procedures committee to consult with court presidents in respect of specified matters which are the subject of Part 8 of the Bill.  It is assumed the changes sought relate to amendments that separately have the effect of conferring membership of the commission on all court presidents, including the Chief Justice.  Amendments Nos. 168 and 178 also seek to remove particular interactions between the commission and the procedures committee in sections 55 and 57(4) which would not arise as a result of the removal from the Bill of the general provisions relating to the procedures committee.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 179 and 180 would remove from the review and recommendations functions set out in Part 8 matters relating to the administrative support provided by the office of the commission as envisaged in section 58(1)(a)(iv) and section 58(4)(d) respectively.  These amendments relate to further amendments that separately remove from the Bill the provisions relating to the office of the judicial commission and the director as provided under Part 5, and which we will be discussing separately.</p> <p>  Section 56 is opposed by Deputies O&rsquo;Callaghan and Chambers.  This section provides for the approval by the commission of statements prepared by the procedures committee and this is consequential on amendments sought to Part 8 of the Bill which substitute the commission for the procedures committee in the discharge of functions under that part of the Bill.  I am not inclined to accept these amendments.</p> <p>  I will clearly state for the benefit of the committee the central purpose of the procedures committee.  This arises from a core provision of the Bill in section 12(2).  Section 12(2) provides that the two key general functions of the Commission will be to select and recommend persons to the Minister for appointment to judicial office and for that purpose, to approve a statement of selection procedures and a statement of requisite skills and attributes for inclusion in a published statement.</p> <p>  In the case of the first function, the task of selecting and recommending persons to the Minister for appointment to judicial office is to be performed by the relevant committees under section 10.  This aspect of the Bill is not the subject of the amendments that we are currently discussing.  The second function is to be performed by the procedures committee established under section 19 to carry out the detail of that function as provided for under Part 8.   The immediate impact of the amendments we are now discussing is to remove from the Bill any role for the procedures committee and to provide that the commission fulfils those functions.  The commission, as is apparently envisaged by the Deputies under separate amendments, is structured differently from that provided for by the Bill.  It is useful to note that the Deputies see the need for the work that is planned under Part 8 and which is part of the dual function nature of the commission.  Clearly we disagree on the most effective and appropriate manner of discharging that function.   </p> <p>  The second general function of the commission as provided for under section 12(2) is a vital one.  The Bill contains immediate adjustments to the appointments structure that has been operating for the past 20 years or so.  Under the function we are discussing, the Bill also sets up a new and much needed mechanism to further develop and implement improvements and reforms as the justice and social and economic environments evolve.  The process of developing and reviewing selection procedures and requisite skills and attributes is an organic one and one which will require relatively specialised and dedicated attention to ensure best practice is continually rolled out across the judicial appointments function and is regularly reviewed and updated.  We only have to go back to the previous amendments and the points raised by Deputies Daly and Wallace, all of which are valid, to see that.  It is good that Deputies appear to acknowledge the need for this ongoing development function that is envisaged.  </p> <p>  It is very significant that we have a commission working through a procedures committee as provided under section 19 that will have the function of determining in a fully consultative manner, new procedures for the selection of judges and the skills and attributes required of those being selected for recommendation to the Minister.  It is the intention that the procedures to be developed by the procedures committee will reflect best practice for professional selection methods and approaches.  Given the constantly evolving environment within which the judicial process operates and the constant development of norms and standards nationally and internationally, it is critical to see this important function as not just a one-off task.  This feeds into the earlier discussion about the resources being made available to the various components of the commission.  </p> <p>  Under Part 8, the committee will have the ongoing role of reviewing the effectiveness of the selection system as well as the effectiveness of the functions assigned to the commission under the Bill.  These include such matters as the adequacy of the support resource that the Bill assigns, specifically the commission office and director.  We will be discussing later the importance of that support in the context of amendments the Deputies have tabled with regard to those matters.</p> <p>  The policy vision underpinning the establishment of and assignment of functions to the procedures committee system are core elements of the Bill and I am not inclined to accept a change in approach here.</p><p>The Bill allows for a dedicated structure to support this necessary function and allows for real attention and focus to be given to system review and process improvement.  While the emphasis is on best practice, we need a model that can be devised and open to improvements over time.</p><p> Part 8 is about a progressive approach to reform, allowing for further development of the selection procedures and informed with reference to best international practice.  Under section 19, the procedures committee will be composed of seven members of the commission with a lay majority and a lay chairperson.  Its functions are vital.  While I accept this would appear to be acknowledged by the Deputies whose amendments seek to retain essentially the function but change the entity performing the function, I cannot agree with that change.</p><p> It may be worth looking in a little more detail at what the procedures committee will do under Part 8.  It will have two main tasks to perform.  First, under section 55, the procedures committee will be required to prepare a statement for approval by the commission, setting out the procedures for selecting persons for appointment and a statement of requisite skills and attributes that the person must possess to be suitable for selection.  The Bill requires consultation in respect of this task, including with the courts' presidents.  It sets out certain matters the committee should have regard to, including the objective that membership of the Judiciary should comprise equal numbers of men and women, and, to the extent feasible and practical, it should reflect diversity within the population as a whole, a point stressed by Deputy Wallace in his earlier amendment and with which I do not disagree.</p><p> Section 55 provides for certain essential requirements in the area of judicial competence which must be reflected in the statement.  These include an ability to conduct proceedings in a manner which ensures the public's confidence in the administration of justice and practical considerations that affect the experience of lay persons in the court system.  Before approving or refusing to approve statements prepared by the committee, the commission is required to consult with the Minister.  These statements must, under section 57, be published, if approved within 12 months, or 18 months at most, from the commencement of the provisions.</p><p> The second key task of the committee is to review the operation of the published statement, the effectiveness of the requirements for selection and the adequacy of functions assigned to the commission, among other matters.  It must also report to the commission on the outcome of its review two years after the commencement of the provisions.  Any such report may include any recommendation relating to the implementation of the Act.  The commission will be required to submit the report and its recommendations, together with any observations it may have, to the Minister.</p><p> Colleagues on the committee will acknowledge these are relatively complex tasks given the indicated timeframes.  I anticipate the procedures committee will be required to move quite early and provide what will ultimately be a substantial piece of work.  The commission working through the relevant committees, as provided under the Bill, will also need to move early after the commencement of the provisions to address any requests to fill judicial vacancies.</p><p> The smaller iteration of the commission in the form of a procedures committee would be more suited to perform the longer-term ongoing function and system development.  In terms of good governance, it is critical that a reporting line is in place to ensure the commission will have the definitive say regarding matters concerned.  A more nimble, or more relatively specialised, procedures committee reporting, as required, to the overall commission is a structure which allows for effectiveness, delivery, transparency and accountability within the overall governance structure as provided.</p><p> I acknowledge I have a different view to the proponents of these amendments as to the structure of the commission.  In many respects, it is a separate argument.  In terms of the Government's policy, the commission has a particular composition which makes it ideally placed to act at a different level to the procedures committee, to perform an approval function in respect of statements prepared by the committee, as provided for under section 56, as well as the power to modify or refuse to approve such statements.</p><p> On a separate matter, I believe the commission should be required to consult with the Minister in this regard as provided for under section 56(3).  I note that section is also opposed by several Deputies.  I fail to see why that should be the case.  The Minister is responsible for the administration of justice and has overall responsibility in the matters of law and policy relating to judicial appointment procedures.</p><p> As for the particular composition of the commission for which the Bill provides, it is critical the consultation arrangements between the procedures committee and the courts' presidents are maintained.  These would be removed by Opposition amendments Nos. 162 and 168.  Given the composition of the commission as provided for, I have a difficulty in accepting these amendments.</p><p> One of the outcomes of the amendments we are discussing is that the commission would effectively approve its own statements prepared under section 55(1).  That is a further reason it would be illogical for me to accept them.</p><p> It is a significant advance to have in place on a permanent basis a commission, part of the remit of which will be to develop fully professionalised selection processes.  In the interests of specialisation, transparency, good governance and practical common sense, this task requires the structure as provided for under the Bill.  I cannot, therefore, accept the amendments which in effect will remove from the Bill the role of the procedures committee as set out.</p><p> Amendments Nos. 84 and 85 in the name of Deputy Wallace seek to remove from section 19(2) and 19(5) the stipulation that the procedures committee of the commission, or any other committee of the commission, should contain a majority of lay members and a lay chairperson, as determined by the commission.  The effect of these amendments would mean that neither the procedures committee, which deals with the critical area of designing and setting out selection procedures and processes, nor any other committee, would have to reflect the lay majority or lay chairperson composition of the commission.  It would probably have the effect of going against the grain of the overall policy approach of the Bill.  Will Deputy Wallace reflect on those as I cannot accept them?</p></speech>

By creating such a layered structure through committees, it will become a costly overbureaucratic monster.</p><p>There are some concerning elements around committees throughout the Bill.  Section 55(4) states:</p><blockquote>In the preparation of the statements referred to in subsection (1), the procedures committee shall avail itself of the advice and expertise of any consultants or advisers appointed under section 14(7) by the commission to assist it in the performance of its functions.</blockquote> <p>These committees will have discretion to appoint outside advisers and consultants.  At what cost?  This is an excessive bureacraticastion provision.</p><p>Section 14(7) states:</p><blockquote>The Commission may as it considers necessary to assist it in the performance of its functions or the functions of any of its committees&mdash;(a) enter into contracts or arrangements with any person, and<br /><br />(b) with the consent of the Minister, appoint consultants or advisers.</blockquote> <p>We have recent history with consultants and advisers in Irish Water.  Before we authorise a quango, it is important we put proper limits and thresholds around the discretion to enter contracts with outside consultants and bodies.</p><p>This is a simple function which will appoint a limited number of judges.  The Minister is creating a massively complicated layered structure which will have the discretion to appoint outside advisers and bodies.  At what cost?  The Minister really needs to examine what is being created and its potential cost, relative to the function it is meant to be performing.  What does the Minister project will be the cost of the advisers and consultants in the performance of the committees' functions?</p><p>Why is that discretion being incorporated in the Bill?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.1242" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017101800002#O00200"><p>I thank the Minister for his response, to which I listened carefully.  It indicates how complicated the procedure will be.  Even the Minister must accept that the length of time required to provide an explanation to justify the procedures committee indicates that it is excessively complicated.  The first amendment in my name and that of Deputy Jack Chambers attempts to prevent the establishment of the committee as it would be too bureaucratic and there would be a mini empire of directors and so on appearing on radio shows and similar.  The Minister has got that.  However, he is proposing to set up separate committees within the commission.  There will be a report from the procedures committee and another from the District Court committee.  There will be a chairman of the procedures committee.  Instead of only the director of the Judicial Appointments Commission appearing on &quot;The Marian Finucane Show&quot;, he or she will be joined by the chairman of the procedures committee of the Judicial Appointments Commission.  It is unnecessarily bureaucratic.</p><p>The Minister disputed the figure I gave in regard to the expenses of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board last year being approximately &euro;5,000.  I was incorrect as the correct figure for 2016 was &euro;7,100 according to a report in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>on 2 July.  The judicial appointments process needs to be reformed and I introduced legislation on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il in that respect.  For that process to be satisfactorily performed would require it to be done for a relatively small amount of money and without having a variety of committees.  It would be done by having a board of 11 or 12 members who meet three or four times a year to make recommendations to Government.  I am concerned that the mechanism proposed in this legislation will make the process complicated beyond what is necessary for recommending eight or nine people for appointment.The amendments aim to remove the procedures committee from the legislation.  It is just one of the many committees dealt with in the legislation but there is no necessity for it.  Let the Judicial Appointments Commission be a coherent entity and one body that makes its rules.  A process involving a separate procedures committee and other committees would be far too complicated.  Even the Minister must appreciate the complexity that is being introduced.  It is not rocket science.</p></speech>

Some of the points being made, with which I agree, relate to the next batch of committees and not this one.  Perhaps I am barking up the wrong tree.  We considered Fianna F&aacute;il's amendments, which form part of the next grouping, in respect of getting rid of certain committees and having the commission as a whole do all the decision-making.  There is a certain logic in that.  We decided against it but are very much open to discussing it because the idea of members of the commission being pulled into isolated conclaves goes against the concept of having a commission in the first instance.  However, I am not so sure that argument applies to the procedures committee, which is what this group of amendments addresses.</p> <p>  Although I could be wrong, the Minister seems to be saying that the procedures committee will be set up at the start to decide on the criteria for selection.  That will be its main job and it will not have much to do apart from that.  A smaller body would probably be in a better position to get things up and running fairly quickly that than a larger one.  I have less sympathy for these amendments than those in the next grouping and I would like to hear more about them.</p> <p>  I agree with the points made by Deputy Wallace regarding an overemphasis on the issue of lay members versus legal members.  The real issue is that of political appointees and it is that with which members of the public have a problem.  I favour having a lay majority but by concentrating on these issues, we are missing the elephant in the room, namely, who will be appointed as judges rather than how they will be appointed.  Being made a judge is career progression for those in the legal profession.  Given the background from which judges are drawn, they are a class apart from the rest of society.  Having a lay majority is an attempt to break through that.  It is not just about appointment as a judge being career progression for those in the legal profession but that judges should better reflect the diverse views and backgrounds of society as a whole.  Studies show there is a better chance of getting that if there is a lay majority on the commission because it otherwise becomes self-replicating in that judges think they are doing a great job, which many of them are, but they do not see the lack of representation of wider society as a problem.  They might be great judges and make good decisions but there could also be more diversity.  Some of those issues need to be reflected upon.</p> <p>  There is more of a basis for the procedures committee to remain than other relevant committees but I am open to hearing more on the issue.</p></speech>

However, the procedures committee has the strongest case of all the committees in terms of its working to ensure that the process is representative and that there is diversity and so on.  While I accept that it may be more relevant to the next group of amendments, it would be sensible to have a commission that would be responsible for the appointment of all judges and a strong procedures committee might ensure greater consistency in the approach to appointments than might ensue from there being four different committees, each dealing with a different level of court.  I favour a commission and a procedures committee.  Whatever about the other committees, there is a logic to having a procedures committee.</p></speech>

For example, we have tried to create a bit of balance by saying it should not be obligatory to have a lay chair.  We have proposed having six legal members, six lay members and the Chief Commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, who is a hybrid of the two.  He or she is selected by the Public Appointments Service.  That may allow a certain amount of Government influence but it is probably the most independent body in the country, has a say on its own budget and cannot be removed by the Government.  The Chief Commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission would be a very strong person to have on the committee and having six lay people and six legal professionals to make up the 13-----</p></speech>

One of the issues concerning the project is that it will have a significant impact on the heritage of Cork city.  In other words, much of the existing riverside infrastructure is of major note culturally and in terms of heritage.  It dates back many centuries in some cases.  The proposed project is seeking to alter the structures or replace them with newer ones.  As a result, there is fear that much of the heritage will be lost.  The project has wider connotations in that there will be an impact on flooding in Cork city, as implied by the Deputy.  We will find from the testimony from both sides that the protection against the flooding is of key interest to all participants in this debate.  When an issue of heritage arises in the country, it would be wrong for the committee that deals with it to close its eyes to it.</p></speech>

We started in January 2017 because we were concerned about the impact of the lower Lee flood relief scheme and that the majority of people in the city know nothing about the proposals for walls as flood defences within the historic centre of Cork.  The Arterial Drainage Act has been used as a vehicle to implement the proposals, leaving many people uninformed.</p><p>We have found that, while everyone in Cork wants flood relief, most do not want the type of flood relief presented by the walls scheme.  We also found that the OPW proposal had not adequately considered the negative impact of the walls on the environment of the city.  The historic defences are an irreplaceable element of the character of the city.  The walls scheme was designed as an engineering solution only and with little consideration of other issues.<br/><br/>The OPW's economic impact assessment of the walls scheme is inadequate and the cost-benefit analysis excludes economic loss suffered by businesses during construction as well as the long-term impact on the local economy.  We found that many of those who supported the walls scheme were in fear of losing flood prevention funding.  People had often been told by the OPW that the walls scheme was the only possible solution and that a barrier would be too expensive.  The OPW's estimate of &euro;1 billion for a tidal barrier was an exaggeration of cost for an outline and impractical solution involving two barriers on either side of Great Island.  This was based on a 350 m tidal surge gate in Rotterdam from the 2014 rivers document, which also recommended a no-walls solution generally in Ireland.<br/><br/>We decided to investigate a more economical design and location for a tidal barrier for Cork.  An independent report commissioned by us from HR Wallingford, experts in tidal barriers and climate change, has found that a barrier can be built for &euro;140 million, approximately the same figure as the current walls proposal.<br/><br/>We are convinced that the walls would severely affect the local economy of the city, represent a significant waste of public funds and potentially be a dangerous flood relief solution for Cork.  We want the right flood protection for the city and the River Lee.  We want a solution that is climate change resilient and protects our valuable heritage.  We call on the Government to adopt our proposals for flood protection and to investigate this matter in the national interest.<br/><br/>The walls scheme would lead to the mass destruction of significant, antique and rare items of heritage throughout the historic core of Cork city.  Loss of heritage would affect the city's ability to attract investment and tourism as well as diminish the environment for those who live in the city and have already invested there.  The World Bank states: &quot;A city&rsquo;s conserved historic core can also differentiate that city from competing locations - branding it nationally and internationally - thus helping the city attract investment and talented people.&quot;  It also states: &quot;In addition, heritage anchors people to their roots, builds self-esteem, and restores dignity.&quot;<br/><br/>Traffic diversions, dust, noise and the closing of roads and bridges would cause serious loss to the local economy during proposed construction of the walls.  Many of our local family businesses would not survive the construction impact of the scheme.  The factors of unmapped water mains and cables and unknown underground conditions within the city centre would lead to significant delays and budget overruns.<br/><br/>A tidal barrier report was commissioned by Save Cork City to determine the suitability of Cork for a tidal barrier and provide a reasonable cost estimate.  It has been prepared by Mr. David Ramsbottom and Mr. Peter Hunter of HR Wallingford, international experts in flood management.  Both authors have vast experience in flood relief and tidal barriers, having worked on the Thames, Cardiff and St. Petersburg barriers.  The report reads:</p><blockquote>The estimated cost of the barrier at 2017 prices is &euro;140 million.... There is no doubt that a barrier could be built at the proposed location.... The alternative scheme [of the tidal barrier] has the major benefit of not requiring the construction of walls along the quays in the city ... the [tidal barrier proposal] would also avoid the scenario of overtopping or failure of flood walls in the city, which would cause a serious risk to life as well as damage to the city.&quot;</blockquote><p>The report predicts that the tidal barrier could cost more or less than the &euro;140 million figure, or between &euro;110 million and &euro;170 million.<br/><br/>HR Wallingford is a world leader in hydrology and climate change.  The authors of the report have a combined experience of 80 years.  They have studied the upstream conditions of the River Lee following the 2009 flood event that caused so much damage in the city.  It is with this knowledge that they have written their report.  The overwhelming evidence supports a tidal barrier solution at Little Island.  HR Wallingford believes that the tidal barrier would minimise environmental impact on the river and avoid failure of flood walls.<br/><br/>According to Mr. Ramsbottom, the alternative solution for flood protection in Cork is viable and would have the major benefit of minimum disruption in the city.  A tidal barrier is an effective means of preventing tidal flooding and providing storage for fluvial flooding, which would work in combination with dam management to protect the city.<br/><br/>In the OPW's walls scheme, all of the historic quay parapet walls of Cork's historic centre are proposed to be removed down to the current ground level.  The walls scheme facilitates higher flood water levels that are above the ground floors of people's homes.  This represents a new and dangerous precedent for the city and the people who know about it do not want it.<br/><br/>The walls scheme relies on extensive grouting with concrete by excavating miles of trenches and filling behind every quay wall in the city centre.  We have witnessed that flooding comes up through the ground and drains in the city.  What the OPW proposes would not be achievable and we are advised that it would dramatically affect the city's water table.  It is like trying to stop time.  This could lead to the widespread subsidence of historic buildings, alterations to the water table in the city and an increase in water levels and speeds in the river.<br/><br/>The walls scheme proposes 46 pump chambers to keep the city behind the walls from filling up like a bowl of water.  The scheme proposes more than 8 km of walls and embankments.  In the historic city, the OPW scheme includes 22 pump chambers and 5.7 km of concrete walls of varying height and width.<br/><br/>The HR Wallingford report makes a grave statement relating to the safety of the walls scheme where it outlines clearly that the tidal barrier solution would &quot;avoid the scenario of overtopping or failure of flood walls in the city, which could cause a serious risk to life&quot;.  The walls scheme has been highlighted by the HR Wallingford report as being a potentially dangerous solution.<br/><br/>The Dutch say that, when considering flood walls, it is better to choose the shortest form of defence, as it is easier to predict the outcome, more economical to construct and maintain and significantly less likely to fail.  We refer the committee to Edgecumbe in New Zealand, which flooded extensively in April due to a small breach in a walls-based flood protection system.  We also refer to New Orleans in 2017, which flooded due to its pump system not starting when required.<br/><br/>The walls scheme would cost much more than estimated based on the complexity of the proposal.  The tidal barrier would protect far more of the city's area than the walls scheme would.  If the walls scheme had to extend to cover the same area as the tidal barrier, it would cost more than &euro;500 million.<br/><br/>A tidal barrier is a predictable, defined project in a defined place.  Construction of a barrier, if managed correctly, provides certainty and predictability of outcome, including how much it would cost and how long it would take to build.  The independent HR Wallingford report confirms this.  A tidal barrier would protect vast additional areas of the city, including the docklands and vital infrastructure of roads and rail routes.  Without the protection of a tidal barrier, the development of Cork's docklands is not economically viable.<br/><br/>Litigation arising from damage to property is inevitable if the walls scheme proceeds in the historic city.  In addition, rebuilding the quay walls and cast railings that are proposed to be removed would cost hundreds of millions of euro.  It would be like throwing out the family silver.<br/><br/>A tidal barrier could be constructed in two years following site investigation and design.  It is a faster form of flood relief than the walls proposal.  A tidal barrier is environmentally a better choice for Cork.  This solution promotes slowing the absorption of rainwater into the landscape and thus slowing the flow of the river.  We promote a more biodiverse landscape and better soil quality.  The HR Wallingford report reads: &quot;A tidal barrier is the preferred choice for Cork because the present tidal regime is maintained and the impacts on navigation, drainage, morphology, saline intrusion, water quality, fish passage and the environment are minimised by the barrier.&quot;  We believe there to be a greater environmental impact from a walls-based scheme.  We note the significant number of mature trees that would be lost in the city as well as the widespread disturbance of habitats and pollution on the river.<br/><br/>The tidal barrier solution can adapt to climate change, ensuring that Cork city would be safe for generations.</p><p>The walls scheme cannot adapt to sea level rise without significant use of demountables and-or major additional spending.  The Thames Barrier has been closed 179 times since it became operational in 1982, protecting the city of London.  Of these closures, 92 were to protect from tidal flooding and 87 to protect from combined tidal and fluvial flooding.  These figures are from the UK Environment Agency.</p><p> HR Wallingford examined the upstream conditions of the River Lee following the 2009 flood event.  It is with this knowledge that it has written its report.  The Save Cork City tidal barrier location allows for the storage of water from upstream when the barrier gate is closed and thus the tidal barrier can protect against combined tidal and fluvial flooding.  A recent proposal for a new form of dam at Dromcarra by Professor Philip O'Kane would add to upstream fluvial protection.  The current upstream Carrigadrohid Dam, altered in 1991, may now be fitted with a responsive flood gate which would further increase fluvial protection for the city.  The city is already protected from fluvial flooding and the capacity can be increased in many sustainable ways.  The walls scheme actively facilitates increased water levels and increased flow rates in the river.  The walls scheme promotes a dangerous, fast-flowing river in the city and considers the north channel of the River Lee as a drainage route.  The OPW called the walls scheme "the Lower Lee (Cork City) Drainage Scheme" in its public consultation of December 2016.</p><p> We propose an economical tidal barrier for Cork in our solution document, Potential Cork, between Little Island and Horsehead on the edge of Lough Mahon.  The 60 m wide gate is based on consultation with the Port of Cork authority.  It referred us to the opening span of proposed bridges on the river at 50 m.  By way of comparison, 60 m is also the width of the access gate in the Thames Barrier.  The tidal barrier would allow for the development of the historic city centre in a manner that would give it a competitive edge and secure the well-being of residents and traders in the city.  Repair and restoration of the historic quay wall defences combined with sensitive design addition would ensure that the city is viable socially and economically.  Cork is a maritime city whose character has been influenced heavily by trading relationships with France and the Netherlands as well as the south of England.  Many people came ashore in Cork and influenced the design of the city, where Cornish and French slate hanging, Dutch brickwork and Italian plasterwork are still in evidence.</p><p> The quay walls, railings and bridges of Cork allow for connection with the river, which is part of the daily lives of the people.  The tidal barrier would allow for the maintenance of the historic quay walls in the manner of many historic European cities.  We see this as a major advantage to Cork if it is to develop as a city capable of growing and attracting investment in the future.  We believe that Cork's historic quays should be nominated for UNESCO world heritage status.  We also believe that the OPW walls scheme contravenes the obligations of the Granada Convention.  Liverpool's maritime port has UNESCO world heritage status.  Cork was trading hundreds of years before Liverpool.  The tidal barrier would mean faster flood relief for Cork and value for money for the taxpayer.  The tidal barrier would allow the city to move forward now.  Many improvements to the city and the river catchment can be achieved while a tidal barrier is being constructed.  This is not possible with a walls scheme which may establish its goal only after six to ten years of construction.</p><p> The lack of investigation of a tidal barrier solution before now has let down the people of Cork.  Years of pursuing a scheme that is not right for the city has delayed flood relief.  The OPW should be considered protectors of our national heritage, not destroyers of it.  The Save Cork City solution to flood relief works as part of an integrated flood defence system.  It is the only solution for Cork if we are to have viable and extensive flood relief.  A tidal barrier is the safest, most predictable, and most economical solution.  It represents the best value for money.  Our proposals are supported by academics and flood relief experts, flood defence agencies, environmentalists and many thousands of Cork citizens.  Support for a tidal barrier is increasing in Cork and a forced walls solution would not represent fair play or fair local democracy.  John F. Kennedy said: "An error does not become a mistake until you refuse to correct it."  We formally thank our supporters here and thank the committee again for allowing us to present to it.</p></speech>

This scheme will provide protection against tidal and river flooding to about 2,100 properties, including 900 homes, and will extend from the Inniscarra Dam to the city centre, which is a distance of approximately 19 km.  While many options were considered in the development of this scheme by the OPW, which is a body that has extensive experience and knowledge in the areas of flood risk management and conservation, in partnership with Cork City and County Councils, the scheme presented here today is the only technically viable and cost-beneficial option to provide the required standard of protection to Cork.  The current estimated life cost of the project at &euro;140 million represents the largest flood relief project proposed in Ireland.  Substantial stakeholder and public consultation has taken place on this project.  It is estimated that this will protect against significant flood damage.  It is worth pointing out that the 2009 river flood and the 2014 tidal flood amounted to &euro;90 million and &euro;40 million in damages, respectively.  Work on this project determined that the solution required optimised use of existing hydroelectric dams for flood storage and flood defences downstream.  In line with international best practice, the standard of protection to be provided by the scheme is the one-in-100-year flood from the River Lee and the one-in-200-year flood from the tide.  This is part of an overall statutory process.  The scheme is being progressed under the Arterial Drainage Acts and the statutory process is ongoing.  The formal public consultation - that is, the public exhibition - of the scheme commenced last December and is being progressed in close partnership with both Cork City Council and Cork County Council.</p> <p>  I will refer to certain images that members have in front of them.  The following key points need to be taken into consideration when looking at this scheme in more detail.  Over &euro;20 million is to be invested in the repair of the historic quay walls, many of which are at risk of collapse, as occurred with Grenville Place in the 2009 flood.  Over 400 heritage structures within the city area will be protected.  As part of the process, the detailed design staff include a grade 1 OPW conservation architect to ensure we are protecting the cultural heritage accordingly.  The proposed defence height of the majority of the quays is 2 ft or less.  I refer the committee to figure 2.  Figure 2 is another photomontage but it gives a clear perception of existing key walls, which members will see in the images of the existing walls and what we are proposing.  Do members have that image?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.1289" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Sydenham" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22017101800002#D01300"><p>Regarding the word "walls", if one looks at the relative height increases from the existing walls to those proposed, one will see they are modest, and we are reinstating a number of railings of architectural and aesthetic significance.  I now refer the committee to figure 3.</p><p>Figure 3 shows part of the city at Bachelor's Quay.  It shows both the existing situation and the proposed situation, and note that there is no substantial increase in the relative heights.  Equally, we are introducing a footpath which will allow greater amenity, greater access to the river and greater visual appreciation.  Our interventions are modest.  Figure 4 is a cross section of that area.  It shows both the existing cross section and the proposed cross section.  One of the key elements in what is proposed in the solution is reinforcing the quay walls.  In the 2009 flood, parts of the wall in Grenville Place, which is adjacent to the Bachelor's Quay area, collapsed into the river.  The walls must be strengthened.  There is significant structural damage on many of the quay walls.  I draw the members' attention to the cross section which shows that the relative height gain in terms of its visual impact is marginal.  We are raising the road area, introducing a footpath and, most importantly, as seen in the shaded green section, we will reuse the existing stone cladding.  That is hugely important in preserving the original materials where feasible and minimising the visual impact while at the same time reinforcing the quay wall and providing the level of protection required.<br/><br/>Over three quarters of the quay walls will have an element of open railing below guarding height, as shown in figure 2.  Over 1 km of new<b></b>river side walkways will be provided by the scheme, which will enhance connectivity with the river and greater public amenity.  An experienced urban public realm landscape architect is part of the detailed design team, whose remit is to ensure that the defences are integrated unobtrusively into enhanced public spaces.  Existing unattractive concrete upstands and railings will be replaced with new architecturally designed railings.  That can also be seen in figure 2.  Taking account of feedback received at exhibition stage, the proposed scheme is being changed on quays which have original historic railings.  At Sullivan&rsquo;s Quay and North Mall, demountable barriers are proposed so that existing railings can be retained in their current form, thus ensuring that there is no heritage impact.  I refer the members to figure 5.  The green railings are on the opposite side of the quay which we showed earlier on Bachelor's Quay.  We propose to retain those railings while having demountable barriers which will protect the existing trees and the railings.  The level of impact on that area is minimised.  We are working closely with the local authority to ensure that is done to maximum effect.<br/><br/>I will summarise the main elements of the scheme.  I have discussed the flood defences.  That is integrated with a flood forecasting system using forecast rainfall measures, enhanced operation of hydroelectric dam management during flood events, washlands upstream of the city, flow control on the south channel and a variety of ancillary works.  The scheme has the support of the vast majority of the elected representatives of both local authorities, Cork City Council and Cork County Council.  Key stakeholders such as the chamber of commerce and the Cork Business Association, which together represent between 900 and 1,200 businesses, are also fully supportive of the scheme.  The Irish National Flood Forum supports the scheme.  The OPW is of the firm view that the scheme has the support of the majority of residents and property owners in Cork city who wish to see a scheme implemented as quickly as possible to protect them from the devastating floods which have been experienced by the city.<br/><br/>Save Cork City has proposed an alternative solution which tries to solve Cork&rsquo;s flooding problem by dealing independently with the fluvial or river and tidal problems.  It has proposed a tidal barrier at Little Island, which would only<b></b>address the tidal flooding problems.  This barrier is not considered viable for a variety of reasons, including impacting negatively on highly sensitive EU designated environmental sites in Cork Harbour.  The location proposed by Save Cork City has limited ability to cope with the likely future impacts of climate change.  Save Cork City recently commissioned HR Wallingford to prepare a cost estimate report on its proposal.  The report is, therefore, only a high level cost estimate of the Save Cork City proposal.  The report notes that &quot;further study will be needed to develop the design for a barrier and refine the cost estimate&quot;.<br/><br/>In response to public interest at exhibition stage, the OPW instructed its consultants to examine further the costs and issues around the provision of a tidal barrier at a number of locations around Cork Harbour, including that proposed by Save Cork City.  In preparing this study, Arup has drawn on the expertise of its relevant international experts, undertaken detailed harbour modelling and liaised with key stakeholders such as the Port of Cork Company.  This study includes a detailed analysis of barrier costs for the scale of barrier likely to be required as well as analysing the cost estimate for the Save Cork City proposal.  This is currently being finalised.  We believe that the HR Wallingford cost estimate is an underestimate of the true cost of a tidal barrier.<br/><br/>In terms of upstream measures to address river flooding, Save Cork City has advocated natural flood management and-or improved use of the dams.  However, all scientific evidence confirms that natural flood management measures cannot significantly reduce peak flows in large flood events in large catchments.  Work undertaken by OPW&rsquo;s consultants has confirmed this is the case in Cork.  It is noteworthy that the HR Wallingford report arrived at a similar conclusion.<br/><br/>The OPW scheme incorporates optimised use of the dams to reduce peak flows.  In developing the scheme, new operational rules have been developed in close collaboration with the ESB, the owner of the dams, making use of state-of-the-art modelling techniques which account for the real world constraints and ensure that the rules are robust and provide a reliable solution.  The storage capacity benefits of the dams are optimised in the scheme in line with operational rules, and some low level defences will still be required.<br/><br/>With regard to the integrated approach that has been adopted on this scheme, Cork City Council will shortly launch a planning application under Part VIII of the Planning Acts for Morrison's Island public realm and flood defence scheme, the flood defence element of which is the first phase of the Cork city flood relief project.  The Morrison's Island project is representative of the approach and standard which the wider scheme will deliver.  With high quality visual aids supporting the application, the public will be able to see clearly the unobtrusive and enhanced quaysides that will be created.  Figure 6 gives an indication of the treatment of Morrison's Island.  It shows the existing situation and what is proposed.  It is important to stress that this is an evolving development and we will be consulting widely during the Part VIII consultation process on how this can be optimised to the best effect for the benefit of the city.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the OPW is fully satisfied that the planning, development and design process for the proposed Cork city flood relief scheme has been rigorous and of the highest professional standard.  We have considered all the potential alternatives and have determined that the only<b></b>technically viable and cost beneficial solution is the scheme as exhibited.  This integrated and holistic scheme will substantially free the people of Cork from the worry and stress of living with flood risk and it will remove barriers to future private investment and help to reinvigorate the city centre.  The OPW and Cork City Council would be concerned about further delays to this project amid continued exposure of Cork city residents and businesses to flood risk.  The Commissioners of Public Works intend to submit the scheme to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for approval in the shortest timeframe possible.<br/><br/>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for their attention.</p></speech>

I will start with my questions.  There is no doubt that flood prevention is the objective of both sides of the debate.  Anybody who has seen the catastrophic damage that has occurred in Cork over the last number of years would obviously be of the view that we must tackle flooding in the most efficient manner possible.  That is important.  Economic costs will be crucial in whatever solution is selected for this.  The impact on business is also very important.</p><p>It is very important to determine which proposal would have the least impact.  The area which each solution covers is obviously an important element.  I know there is disagreement over costs and we will hopefully drill down into those questions in a little while.  The cost per acre protected is also a key question.  In my view, the amount of space a solution looks after would be the yardstick by which to measure the cost of a particular project.  </p><p> I will ask a couple of questions of the Office of Public Works first.  Which of these projects does the OPW think is least invasive with respect to businesses?  I imagine that work on the walls will involve works on some of the roads and that there will be construction works in the city for a number of years.  Which roads would have to be closed and what construction would have to happen in that period of time?  How long would it take from start to finish, from when the first shovel hits the ground to when the project is finished?</p></speech>

It covers from the Inniscarra dam right into the city centre - about 19 km.  That will be done in a variety of phases.  The priority phases are within the city centre.  There is impact from construction work, there is no use pretending there is not.  It is the nature of it.  Once we are working in the city centre area there will be disruption, but we are doing everything possible to manage it as part of designing the phasing of the schemes.  We have had detailed consultations with the local authority, its traffic department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the optimum way to phase the works.  The overall projected timeline for the entire scheme from start to finish is approximately ten years.  The first two phases, which will provide the bulk of the defences within the city centre, can be accomplished in a much shorter time period.  Therefore, the impact on the city centre will vary as we move through the city.  I will ask Mr. MacManamon to speak about out planned approach in more detail.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.1294" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ezra MacManamon" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22017101800002#F00300"><p>I thank the commissioner.  On the phasing and delivery of the project, as the commissioner, Mr. Sydenham, has said, there will be disruption involved in the construction of the project.  There is no avoiding that.  This is an essential public infrastructure project.  However, the project's delivery has been broken up into phases.  One of the aspects which has driven the breaking up of the project into phases is the desire to manage, control and minimise the disruption to the city which will arise from the project's construction.  If members still have copies of the presentation, I would refer them to page 20 where there is an indication and description of the phasing of the project.  It indicates that the first three phases of the project will start off with the Morrison's Island element, which is a localised area in the city centre, to which the commissioner referred.  This element will be led by Cork City Council under the Part 8 planning process.  While that is a small area in terms of disruption, because it only has one quay side on which there are not many businesses in operation,  it will protect the vast majority of the city centre, through the Grand Parade area, Oliver Plunkett Street and Patrick Street, from tidal flooding.  In 2014, that area of the city centre was flooded and hundreds of properties were affected.  That phase will protect those hundred of properties when it is initially implemented.</p> <p>  Looking upstream, the next phase of the project will be from Inniscarra dam down to the area of the Kingsley Hotel.  That is the bulk of the 19 km which the commissioner, Mr. Sydenham, mentioned earlier in his presentation.  Construction of those works will be out in the open countryside.  The works are being constructed on agricultural lands.  Again, that will not cause any significant construction in the city area.  Following on from that there will be a phase which will cover from the Kingsley Hotel to the area of the Tyndall National Institute.  This phase moves down through parkland, Fitzgerald Park and the tennis club area of the city.  Again I emphasis that is an area in which there are not many businesses in operation or a lot of traffic.  Very little disruption to business in the city will arise from that phase.  The vast majority of the benefit and the protection will be provided between those three phases.  After that-----</p></speech>

It gives me an opportunity to mention the public consultation which has happened throughout the development of this project.  In 2014 we indicated demountable barriers at bridge locations.  The business community and the public in Cork made the point to us strongly that they wanted, insofar as possible, the bridges to remain open in times of floods.  We have changed the design since bringing it to the exhibition.  We now have gates which will close the footpaths on the bridges, but the roads on the bridges will remain open.  As I said, the traffic routes across the bridges will remain open.  There are gates, which will be permanently in place, which will be closed when a flood is expected.</p></speech>

In its understanding, what is the difference between the acreages covered by the two projects?  A key issue is that Save Cork City's project defends against tidal surges while the OPW's proposed project defends against fluvial flooding.  Is there any way that Save Cork City's project can mitigate against river flooding?  How does its project deal with that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-18a.1316" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Hegarty" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22017101800002#F02500"><p>The tidal barrier would work by separating a high tidal surge from the fluvial issue.  It also allows for any amount of fluvial water coming from upstream to be stored behind the barrier when it is closed.  It manages fluvial flood by separating it from the tidal flood.  We are also proposing that the current dams be optimised.  There are a few different ways in which that can be dealt with.  We are talking about a tidal barrier which would protect roads, the tunnel and train lines.  It would go right down to Little Island, which would mean the Docklands, Mahon, Blackrock and all of those areas of the city would be protected.  These are hugely populated areas so we are talking about protecting a lot more people.  I do not have the exact figures for that. Demountable barriers in the city might have the result of preventing people from getting to other parts of the city.  Our approach would meant that people in that area of the city would be allowed to travel unhindered in the event of a flood.  That would mean getting to schools, to hospitals, to work and to the city centre.  Our map on page 8 shows the extent of the wall's protection as opposed to the extent of the barrier's protection.</p><p> There is an interesting fact about the docklands.  It is difficult to get development going at the moment because developers cannot make money out of different schemes and the conditions of the docklands in Cork are such that they are below water level in many areas.  It is, therefore, difficult to develop in the docklands, without it being protected from flooding.  In the docklands at the moment, only retail development is allowed at ground floor level because that is allowed in an area which might flood.  Therefore, the docklands can only on ground floor level really ever develop as something that is in massive competition with our indigenous business in the city centre.  </p></speech>

If a particular part of a river is protected from flooding, the flooding is often displaced to the next opportunity the river has to find that low level.  If the city centre of Cork is protected, would it not be the case that the river in full tilt would seek to find the docks while finding an exit to flood?</p></speech>

It is what we call the CFRAM, which is done on a river catchment area.  It looks at the entire length of the river, the landmasses around it, the various courses and the topology to prevent what the Chairman has spoken about, which is that by fixing one problem one is not dislocating.  This scheme is integrated.  It is looking at all aspects of what happens in that catchment area, so it protects those areas upstream and downstream.</p></speech>

I am going on what I have read and have heard and I am not an engineer, so I have to bow to the witnesses' greater judgment.  My knowledge of the OPW down through the years is that it has been extraordinary and excellent and has made a distinctive and distinguished contribution to Ireland and its preservation.  I start from that premise and nothing that I read here makes me think otherwise.  That might be my own innocence but, on first reading, it does not make me think otherwise.  When we talk about disruption, one has to consider Dublin during the last three years of the Luas works.  There is nothing like the disruption from the flooding of people's houses.  It is the greatest disruption of all time.</p> <p>  I thank Mr. Hegarty for his presentation.  Will he tell me about his voluntary group?  Where did it originate?  Did he say that the vast majority of the people in the city knew nothing about the Lower Lee flood relief scheme?  What did he mean by that?  Who did he survey?  Who is he representing?  I am sure he is representing people, but who exactly is he representing?  Where does he come from, what is the background to what he is doing and what does he intend to do if his perspectives are not met?  Where does he intend to bring his argument or beliefs on how it should be done?  Where does he want to continue given the impasse?  There is obviously a genuine impasse from his point of view, but where does he want to see this going?</p></speech>

We started out as a group of professional people to look at this issue.  We attended the consultation of the OPW.  Looking at the figures, we found that 44 people attended their consultation process in July 2013, with only 181 attending in 2014 and 186 in 2017.  Therefore, we found that no one in Cork really knew about this proposal.  It was not advertised widely and an effort was not made to inform people in order that they would know about it and could comment on it at the early stages.  We are a group of architects, engineers, hydrologists and historians and many people from UCC and around the world have supported us with knowledge and calculations.</p> <p>  The more we looked into the scheme, the more impact we found it to have and the more the specialists who were advising us said that this is not right, that it is old-fashioned technology and an old-fashioned approach.  It is an approach that would not be carried out in the Netherlands because long miles of defences are not the right way to carry out flood relief.  A shorter flood relief solution should be chosen.  We were told that things were dangerous, and we started with the impact on heritage.  The heritage impact got people of Cork in their hearts.  We have 16th, 17th, 18th and 19th century walls in the city centre.  Up to a few weeks ago, Viking remains were being found in the city centre.  We started to look at the widespread loss of that authentic fabric in the city centre.  Businesses in the city centre are worried about having something similar to the Luas works that could run over ten years in the centre of Cork.  That is alarming to everybody.  It also was alarming that one could not alter the walls in respect of possible sea level rise.</p> <p>  A lot of money is being spent on a solution that is not manageable into the future.  Insurance companies do not like demountable flood barriers.  People want insurance in Cork.  The proposal for demountables to protect heritage is a management nightmare for the city to have to implement into the future.  </p></speech>

They were held on 17 July 2013, 29 July 2014, just before the August weekend, and over the Christmas period.  Further, even if a few people saw the advertisements in the paper, it was described as the Lower Lee drainage scheme.  I did not know what that meant and nobody really knew what it meant.  Apparently there were advertisements on the radio as well but everyone in the group has yet to meet a person who heard them.  We strongly feel that this was going to sort of roll in under the radar.  No one knew about it.  When we started publicising it, people were quite shocked at the extent of the scheme.  The OPW has spoken about how it respects heritage and the other department of the OPW strongly respects heritage and is the guardian of our heritage.  However, this concerns the OPW drainage department.</p> <p>  Replacing authentic heritage with replicas is not the same thing as preserving heritage.  Would we replace the Ardagh chalice with a modern replica?  I do not think we would.  What we have in Cork is authentic and real.  Mr. Hegarty knows a lot more about it than I do.  I am just a lay person who loves walking around the city.  I do not know the ins and outs of where these things are from but I know that they were all locally made and constructed and are utterly irreplaceable.  Replacing them with concrete is just not acceptable when there is an alternative.  One of the problems all along has been that all of the business people and residents of the city have been told, even here today, that there is no alternative and that this is the only option.  If people are told there is no alternative - to take it or leave it - that will influence people to support the scheme.  However, there is an alternative, which is an economic one, and that is what we have come up with.</p> <p>  For example, in 2014, Cork Chamber of Commerce was saying exactly what we are saying.  It was saying that concrete flood barriers could damage the city's river potential and that it could potentially damage the ability of the city to realise its obvious riverside potential and negatively impact on the attractiveness of the city as a location for inward investment and tourism.  Eventually, it was told there was no other option.  It was a case of take the walls or get nothing.  Back in 2014, we could have written that document.  That is what the chamber of commerce was telling the OPW.  It was very worried about the impact.</p> <p>  Those who visit places such as Bruges, Amsterdam, Venice will not be interested in replicas of what was there but the real thing.</p><p>That is what we are trying to preserve.</p></speech>

I am from Galway, not Cork, and will not get involved in the local element.  I am very surprised the issue is before this committee and that no local authority elected representatives or affected business people have been invited to appear.  This is a committee to discuss culture, heritage and the Gaeltacht.  The argument on a solution to flooding in Cork city concerns engineering.</p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned disruption and so on.  When I was Minister, Cork people told me there was a hell of a lot of disruption when there was flooding in the city.  A solution must be found.  A huge amount of time was given to public consultation at exhibition stage.  It was extended and I thank the Office of Public Works, OPW, for doing that.  Many submissions have come in and it is premature to have this meeting until the exhibition stage process is complete.  I am surprised that people are here while the process is ongoing.  I am not saying they are not welcome but the process should be allowed to progress to completion.  The exhibition stage is all about consultation.  Mr. Sydenham mentioned that amendments or similar have been made as a result of the public consultation process.  We need to allow that process to complete and let its findings come out.  I am concerned that we may end up in a long-drawn-out legal battle where nothing happens.  The people of Cork deserve more than that and we need to be sensible about it.</p></speech>

It looks at that and ignores it completely.  Even if every family business in the city centre were forced to close, it would not form part of the cost-benefit analysis.  That is wrong and makes no sense.  We attended a meeting many months ago with the steering committee and were told that the heritage loss, which has been acknowledged by the OPW, is part of the cost-benefit analysis.  We believe the loss of heritage has been given an inadequate weighting and forms just a small part of the cost-benefit analysis, but in reality it is an irreplaceable part of the character of the city.  As I said, one goes to Bruges to look not at concrete but at what has been there for centuries.</p></speech>

That was a bone of contention for me when I was Minister of State.  It is a double-edged sword.  No project might be undertaken if one has to take account of the disruption caused by construction.  There must be some pain to get some gain.  It is a double-edged sword if Ms Kirwan is saying there is going to be disruption and loss as a result of something being done to improve things in the long term.  If that is used in cost-benefit analysis, God help any Minister who is trying to get work done.  We have to be careful what we wish for in this regard.</p></speech>

I represent the constituency of Cork South-West, which knows plenty about flooding.  There are many very successful schemes under way and currently planned in Bandon, Clonakilty and Skibbereen.  I have heard many of the issues raised by the witnesses discussed on the airwaves.  While it does not affect my constituency, it is of interest to me because it affects Cork.  Have the witnesses tried to thrash out some or all of the issues with the OPW?  Public consultation is one thing but round-table discussions might be able to resolve some of the issues.  It might be gone beyond that stage, although I hope it has not because the biggest priority everyone must be aware of is that of saving people's homes and businesses.</p> <p>  My constituency is very prone to flooding.  Homes were destroyed by flooding in Ballylickey, which is between Bantry and Kealkill.  I have been involved in politics as a councillor and subsequently a Deputy for approximately three and a half years and I cannot convince the powers that be to put a machine into the river in Ballylickey to clean it out.  An elderly resident was one of several from that area to ring me on Sunday evening because they were terrified that the storm was going to cause a tidal surge and destroy their homes.  In fairness to the local authority, it supplied residents with sandbags.  However, it would be very simple to rectify the issue.  It is scandalous and a failure for me as a public representative to talk about that solution for three and a half years when I would rather shut up, face the fines and put the bloody machine in there myself, as I had to do elsewhere previously.  We should put the bloody machine in there, clean out the rivers and stop messing with people's lives.  We should clean out the river and save people's homes instead of talking about pearl mussels and flies and bees and this and that.</p><p> That is where they need to start.  It needs a common sense approach.  I have listened to every excuse as to why this will not happen for another year or two, and let the elderly people suffer, let their homes be flooded to 5ft or 6ft.  It is scandalous beyond belief.  I acknowledge Deputies Canney and Moran's efforts as Ministers of State in this area.  Deputy Moran visited those areas with me two months ago.  We went into people's homes at 10 p.m.  I am sure not many other Ministers would do the like.  He saw the situation at first hand along the Ballylickey line and Castletownbere where there are serious issues.</p><p> Is there any hope of the witnesses sitting down together to try to sort this out?  It is a major issue for them.  I am not the expert and I not making any judgment.  I can sympathise with what they are saying and I know they are speaking for the greater good of Cork but these experts also say it is for the greater good of Cork.  We cannot be the referee.  I would like the two parties to sit down together to try to sort it out.  As they said no decision has been made and on that basis there is time for negotiation.</p></speech>

We have seen at first hand what flooding does to people's lives and the difficulties they go through.  We have spoken to people who have had very difficult situations in Cork city centre.  We do not believe the proposal is the right one.  It may not even work.  Flood waters come up through the ground of people's buildings in Cork.  It is very difficult to build walls that will prevent that happening in the future.  There are issues of subsidence, water tables.  The city is built on timber piles, the same as Venice.  These kinds of wall solutions have been rejected in Venice and in the Netherlands.  We have the support of the senior deputy director of Netherlands Water, who gives out the money for flood relief in the Netherlands, who says this is an antique solution.  It means building walls that will very soon fail in some place.  If we allow fast flowing water through the city in that case that failure will mean a catastrophic flooding of the city so we will be setting ourselves up for something that is not a good idea fundamentally for the city.</p> <p>  It is not just a question of heritage.  I could talk all day about heritage.  Cork is an incredible resource in this country that is not recognised or exploited.  What is there in terms of heritage is as good as Venice.  Our document, which anyone can read online, has illustrations of Cork city that would make one's eyes water at what might be lost in the city centre.  Our maritime connection to the world has influenced who and what we are and the physical environment that we live in every day.  This solution is not right.</p> <p>  We are for flood relief.  We know the burden of proof is much harder for a group like ours so we have put the time and the work in and found a solution that is more economically viable and that protects more people, that keeps transport open, that will allow us to repair, restore and develop our city, that is good for developers, for money and heritage, good for hearts, minds and lives.  It will not have demountables for miles running in front of our houses and homes.  We do not want that.  It is not just me or Ms Kirwan who do not want it.  There are thousands of others like us.  They are in the business community.  They are behind us saying they will support us but they cannot say who they are.  There are people in the city centre who are literally crying at the thought that this would happen to their beautiful antique city.  This is a city of opera, of navigation, and its development was influenced by northern Europe in such a specific way that we would be mad as a society to get rid of it in this way.</p></speech>

A colleague of mine has been flooded three times.  That person had the flood barrier which held but the water came up through the toilet, the sink and the floor.  A pub owner, I do not want to name but who has a family business in the city centre, has been flooded many times and grew up with flood water.  He does not want this solution.  He loves the quays.  He wants a solution that protects the city.  He said climate change is here and we need to do something that protects the city.  He says these walls will not work.  They do not want them.  A nationally well-known restaurant, which was also flooded, does not want the walls.  It is not just us, the do-gooders but people who have been flooded.</p></speech>

It is clear there are differing views on how the flooding in Cork should be dealt with.  I do not agree with climate change.  Flooding and storms happened long before there was ever a combustible engine.  I reiterate that in spite of Monday's storm.  We have had changes and differences in the patterns of climate going back in our history.  It is hard for me to decide who is right or wrong in this matter.  If the Government is committed to providing funding to deal with the problem a decision needs to be arrived at sooner rather than later.  Everyone should get around the table.  That is why I asked whether there is any representation from elected members and there is none.  What weight will be given to what we say to the witnesses today?  We do not have engineering qualifications.  I do not anyway.  The people in the Office of Public Works, OPW, surely have and Mr. Hegarty does.  We on this side do not.</p> <p>  I have always asked when the flood water comes back up the sewers and the sinks why not have non-return valves fitted?  Met Eireann is very good now at advance warnings and we hope that will continue.  That would give people a chance to use sandbags or whatever.  It is horrible when the sewer water comes into the house.  That is worse than clear or clean water coming in.  I am sure a non-return valve could be fitted to every pipe.  I know a little bit about that through dealing with diesel engines over the years.  I am sure that could work.  </p> <p>  In the past when people had no hope they would say, "You can&rsquo;t keep out the tide".  The witnesses appear to have a proposal with this barrier.  My worry is that if the tide cannot come in, how is the water from the Lee going to get out?  That is a big question.  Will there be massive pumps pumping the water out over the tidal barrier?  How much will it cost to keep it running?  </p> <p>  I am of the same view as Deputy Collins.  I have been arguing in Kerry County Council and since coming to the D&aacute;il for cleaning out our rivers.  They need to be cleaned out.  They have not been cleaned out for the past 20 years.  Indeed the River Shannon has not been touched since the late 1800s, when the British last cleaned it out.  I am glad that Deputies Canney and Moran have finally arrived on the scene with machines.</p><p>I am delighted to hear that because we have places in Kerry affected, the Flesk river and many other rivers around the county.  They are blocked because they have not been cleaned out.  The reason is that farmers have been prohibited from going near any river for the past 20 years because they would lose their farm payments.  They have been advised they would be prosecuted and then subsequently lose their farm payments.  By and large the farmers would have done a lot of work to keep the rivers clean if they were allowed to do so.  I will continue to fight to ensure that will be allowed to happen again because that is causing a lot of trouble all over the country.</p><p> I am not able to say who is right or wrong here.  We welcome the witnesses and will listen to them.  I ask them to get around the table and sort it out quickly.  We all know what happens when funding appears to be available.  I will give just one example.  We had funding for a water scheme in Cloghane iron mills in 2008 or thereabouts.  It was granted and sanctioned, and advised to all the members of the council.  Word then came that the national finances were banjaxed.  We did not get money for that since then.  We need to be aware of that.  If there is a difference between the two groups represented here it needs to be resolved because the money will go elsewhere and it would be left behind.  I would not like to see that happening.  I go to Cork too; it is my nearest city.  We would like to see everyone happy there and not be continually flooded during bad weather.</p></speech>

When we heard about the OPW working on the river in Cork and proposing flood-relief solutions, we were delighted because we thought at last the OPW was coming and would do a really good job.  We thought there would be a big heritage involvement from the OPW on the other side, but that was not the case.  We have a lot of common ground.  Our schemes have a lot of common ground.  We are both saying that some kind of barrier has to be built to protect the citizens of Cork.  We are just proposing a far more sensible one that is manageable and costs less to manage.  Our estimates and HR Wallingford's estimates are that it would cost &euro;1 million a year to manage a tidal barrier.  If these people say it is that way, it is that way.  We wonder what the wall scheme would cost to manage every year with all those demountables and everything like that.</p> <p>  A tidal barrier works very simply.  It rarely closes.  This year it might have only closed on one day or not at all.  It is not really a barrier.  It allows free-flowing movement for traffic.  The proposed width is wider than any of the bridges proposed for the city.  The tidal barrier is a very simple object that allows fluvial flooding and tidal flooding to be separated in times of need.  It is a very simple thing.  It is how the Thames barrier works.  It protects cities all over the world with this kind of simple technology.  That is what I have to say about a tidal barrier.  It works and these people say it works.  That was the first thing they said in their report before they said they would even bother costing it.</p></speech>

The problem with Cork is that it is so ancient.  The pipes and underground rivers and waterways are so difficult to predict.  When water comes up into people's shops and businesses, it sometimes seeps through the skirting boards.  It seeps from underground and they do not know where it comes from.  It also comes through the lavatory, but it is coming from under the ground as well.  Therefore, it would not solve the problem entirely.</p></speech>

There is a perception in Cork that there is a problem with the water coming up from the ground, as the witnesses from Cork city are saying.  That is true and it is being investigated.  Our consultants are doing a lot of work on that as we move into the detailed design stage of the project.  Apart from Cork, it is a problem that is well known wherever we consider building flood defences.  Seepage of water through the ground is always a problem that we consider when we are considering building flood defences.  We deal with it through a variety of engineering means such as putting in sheet-piled cut-offs under flood defences or embankments to stop the water flowing from the river through the ground into the protected area behind or flood defence embankments which lengthen the flow-paths that are involved and things like that.</p> <p>  We are very much aware of this problem and we are addressing it through the non-return valves the Deputy asked about and also giving it wider consideration as we move into the detailed design processes.</p></speech>

I commend the OPW on its many years of good work in Cork city.  Irrespective of people's view of the particular scheme, it is a civic service to interrogate a project such as this in an intensive way.  Public consultation is a regular cause of frustration for public representatives.  At most public consultations, we are the only ones there.  Unfortunately it is the nature of it regardless of how well they are advertised.  Unfortunately it is not until a bit down the stream, for want of a better term, that one very often realises the concerns that people have.  That applies to roads, bridges and anything one can think of.</p> <p>  As my questions are brief, I will put all of them together.  I ask the witnesses from Save Cork City about the HR Wallingford report.  Did it take account of the implications for the shipping channels in Cork Harbour?  Would its proposed location at Horsehead have any implications for leisure use by people living in Monkstown and Passage West?</p> <p>  The OPW presentation indicated that the outline of the HR Wallingford report might not be sustainable in the context of global warming.  I ask for a response to that.  There are different designs at each different section along the north quays and south quays; there are railings, walls and glass and places where it is being left alone.  While I know it can be said that there are implications for the whole project where are the sections of most concern from a heritage point of view?</p> <p>  My next question is for the OPW.  The witnesses from Save Cork City have made a point relating to global warming.</p><p>I cannot remember the extent but a rise in sea levels, unfortunately, is not inconceivable and the walls are not adequate in height and would have to be increased to protect the city and achieve the same end.  Is that something that has been explored?  What is the view of the witnesses on the possibility of having to increase the current height of the walls?</p><p> Regardless of the current circumstances and the cost-benefit analysis, do the witnesses believe that in the future a flood barrier might be feasible?  What are the implications for the special protection area?  What would be the impact of either project on the Cork Harbour special protection area?</p><p> From the point of view of the OPW, a certain heritage loss has been factored in.  How significant will it be?  Is it possible to say how many metres of stone walls on the quays will be affected?</p></speech>

We spoke to the local port authority.  Opening bridges have been proposed for the city further up the river.  They have 50 m wide openings.  Our design and proposal has a 60 m wide opening, which is larger than the 50 m proposed for the rest of the city, which would allow ships of a larger format to get as far as the bridges that are proposed but not get up to the city.  The Port of Cork said that a 50 m wide opening in the tidal barrier would be correct so there is no implication for shipping.</p></speech>

We see the connection between the city, the docklands and the historic city in terms of our connection with the river as being improved and that people would use the river much more.  We have spoken to boating clubs and there are many hundreds of people using the river on a Saturday morning and the number is growing.  We also see a future for people living on house boats in the centre of the city.  We have spoken to those groups and we are supported by the boat clubs and by anybody who uses the river for leisure activities.</p> <p>  In terms of the possibility of sea level rise, we feel and HR Wallingford also say that the tidal barrier can be built to protect us for a very long time so it is a much more future-proofed solution for the city.  We feel the walls cannot rise.  Although the highest proposed wall in the city centre is 1.2 m, as the OPW has said, there are ground levels raised up in different areas as well, so the top of the walls can be 2 m higher than current ground levels and people's front door can end up being 2 m below the current walls.  There are subtleties about the OPW's scheme that everybody would need to understand and that is what we are trying to help people to understand.</p> <p>  The loss to heritage in the city centre would be extensive.  There are rubble stone walls by St. Finbarr's, which are the precursors to the cut stone walls that are further down.  There are walls with medieval and renaissance fabric and stonework that were built in the 16th and 17th centuries.</p></speech>

There are waterways that are untouched for a very long time.  The bridges along Wandesford Quay are absolutely exquisite.  I have seen a quay in Verona that is comparable to the bridge by Wandesford Quay.  We have got incredible pieces of antiquity in Cork that people are just not aware of and that are not being looked after either nationally or locally.  We know that the OPW could look after them.  They are flood defences.  We just do not want water levels that are so high that they would create such a change that we end up living under water.  The scheme is designed to have faster flowing higher levels of water in the city, in particular in the North Channel, so the people on the north side of the city have to have this in their river.</p> <p>  We face the issue of rotting foundations, water tables and the possibility that we have to be protected given that we have 22 pump chambers with pumps that could fail at any moment.  That has happened in other cities.  People have been flooded just because the pumps have failed.  We must look at what the maintenance burden is for the future as sea levels rise, and if they do how many more demountables will be in the city with no insurance for people.  I have family living on the quays.  The question is whether we will be looking out at a 2 m high wall, if the city will be unsafe because of that and if, eventually, the river will just turn into a drainage channel.</p> <p>  I ask committee members to cast their minds to Amsterdam, Bruges or any city that looks after its waterways and allows people to engage with them and see what the possibilities for Cork could be.  We are here because we are afraid for the future viability of our city and the people living there, not just in terms of heritage but in terms of how people want to live and could live there.</p></speech>

What we are saying is that the tidal barrier should be built now.  In the words of Roy Keane, fail to prepare, prepare to fail.  We are saying why wait until after the catastrophic flood to build the tidal barrier that we were told by the OPW would be cost-neutral in the future?  It would be a complete no-brainer to build a tidal barrier in the future in an unspecified number of years.  We are saying, build it now, lads.  What is the point in wasting public money on building walls that will not be needed in future because the tidal barrier will be built?</p></speech>

The estimates and the outline design that were referenced in relation to cost estimates was for a tidal barrier in Rotterdam that is wider than the Eiffel Tower is high and that has no bearing on any type of solution for Cork.  That is where the estimates came from in terms of costs.  It also came from a document, Rivers 2040, where the diagram of the barrier is back to front and would not be able to open onto the hillside landscape of Passage West.  That is the very simple outline basis of something that is not thought through.  The figures are enormous figures but we do not believe a tidal barrier would cost that amount.  We have a tidal barrier costed by HR Wallingford and if anyone wants to talk to them they can ring them up and talk to them or meet them.  They know what they are talking about.  A tidal barrier would work for Cork and it is cost-effective.</p></speech>

Our tidal barrier protects all of that whereas the wall scheme cannot adapt to that.  We are talking about a scheme that any time there is a major flood event would shut the city down, and as time goes on, it would shut the city down even more.</p> <p>  We are also talking about the cleanliness of the water in the river.  We are talking about good soil quality.  We are talking about a scheme that looks at the best practices in flood relief management and uses them on our river to create a completely integrated and managed river that is safe and clean and works into the future.  The wall scheme is an old-fashioned scheme and if it is built, it is so engineering heavy that it will move problems to places that have never ever had problems.</p></speech>

When I was going to the train station this morning, I noticed that the water at Horgan's Quay was quite high and it occurred to me that in the future, the quay would not be protected by the OPW walls scheme, but it would be protected by the Save Cork City tidal barrier, which has been recommended by people who have significant experience with tidal barriers.  I do not mean to insult any of the OPW personnel when I say they have built tidal barriers, and supervised the construction of such barriers, but a sea-based tidal barrier has never previously been built in Ireland.  There is always a first time.  It should happen in this case.  It will happen in the future, so why not now?</p></speech>

Statements about 2 m high walls are not helpful to what we are trying to achieve.  Everybody is looking for the best solution for the people of Cork.  We want to protect the city.  The previous illustrations I have shown the committee have depicted what we are proposing to do.  I do not think anyone could construe that we are proposing to erect 2 m high walls anywhere.  My colleague, Mr. Leahy, will deal in much more detail with the issues the Deputy raised in his specific questions.  There has been a great deal of discussion and a vast amount of analysis on this issue.  Many detailed studies and surveys were conducted before we arrived at the solution that is being proposed.  These complex and involved engineering projects required a vast amount of analysis and study before the optimum solution, which is what we are presenting, was arrived at.  It is almost being implied that we are providing for something outdated that will not work.  That is completely misleading.  This solution is based on all the factors we studied.  We studied the possibility of a tidal barrier in tremendous detail.  Mr. Leahy will talk in more detail about the level of rigour with which we analysed the possibility of a tidal barrier.  Taking into consideration the level of protection required, the risks and the issues in the broader catchment area, we are recommending a solution that is the optimum one from the perspectives of cost and efficiency.  It will deal with the challenges presented.  My colleague, Mr. Leahy, will speak in more detail about that and respond to some of the specific questions that were asked.</p></speech>

There has been talk about outdated solutions and about what works well in other locations.  When any flood relief scheme is being considered, the most important thing is the best solution for the location in question, bearing in mind all of the location's constraints and objectives.  It is very dangerous to try to compare the solution we are proposing with other solutions in other countries.  It is untrue to say that countries like the Netherlands do not look at walled solutions or direct defence solutions.  Direct defences make up a significant proportion of the Dutch solutions.  They are integrated with other elements.  The solution for Cork is no different from that.  It has been suggested that the design of the scheme will funnel even faster waters through the city, but that is incorrect.  A fundamental part of the design of the scheme is the optimisation of the use of the dams to reduce the flow into the city and therefore reduce the velocities and the flows through the city.  The scheme will reduce rather than increase this risk.  When factors like the flood forecasting system, the operation of the dam and the regulation of the flow between the north and south channels are taken into account, it is clear that direct defences comprise just one small part of a very integrated approach to flood risk management in the city, which deals with both fluvial and tidal flooding.</p> <p>  When we speak about the various possible solutions, including the tidal barrier, it is important to ensure everyone has clarity.  We must make sure we are comparing apples with apples.  The front page of the HR Wallingford report is of interest because it confirms what the report is and is not.  Essentially, it is a high-level cost estimate of the barrier concept being advocated by the Save Cork City group.  The HR Wallingford report notes that navigation, sedimentation and environmental issues would all warrant significant analysis and consideration in order to establish the size of the gates required.  It notes that the cost estimate is extremely sensitive to those factors.  That is very much the case.  Rather than designing or sizing those gates, those who drew up the HR Wallingford report took the Save Cork City concept and worked from there.  I am not privy to the details behind that.  As the location proposed by Save Cork City is over 1 km in width, the flow through that portion of the channel has 1 km to pass through.  The Save Cork City proposal would narrow that opening to 150 m, or one eighth of its current width.  This would fundamentally alter the dynamics and velocities in the harbour.  It is likely that it would have significant impacts on navigation, shipping, erosion, sedimentation and the environmentally designated sites - the special protection areas and the special areas of conservation - which are immediately proximate to it.  Therefore, it is not at all reasonable to assume that the barrier, as costed, would be technically viable.</p> <p>  As part of the work we are undertaking and finalising, which has involved discussions with the Port of Cork, we have engaged in detailed modelling of velocities.  It is likely that the barrier would have to be significantly wider, which would cause the cost of it to increase.  The HR Wallingford cost estimate of &euro;140 million relates to the cost of construction only.  It must be acknowledged that there would be a significant maintenance cost in addition to that.  It has been estimated that the overall cost would come to &euro;165 million when the cost of 25 years of maintenance is included.  OPW schemes provide for 50 years of maintenance.  If a barrier were constructed purely as a tidal scheme, it would deal with the issue of tidal flooding and not with the fluvial flood risk to the west of Cork city where tide is not an influence.  The cost of the damage arising from tidal-only flooding tends to be between &euro;40 million and &euro;50 million.  At a cost of &euro;165 million, the proposed barrier it would have a cost-benefit ratio of 0.3.  Clearly, it is not economically viable as a stand-alone tidal scheme.  The additional cost of dealing with the fluvial problem to the west of the city, as part of a combined fluvial scheme, would drive up the overall cost significantly.  Even allowing for the total combined damages or benefit of the scheme of &euro;185 million, it would remain non-cost-beneficial.</p> <p>  When we look at this proposal, we have to consider when a tidal barrier might become viable and consider what else is needed as part of it.  Mr. Sydenham mentioned the N25 and the railway line.  At the location proposed by the Save Cork City group, there is a bypass route to the north along the railway line and the N25.  Therefore, further ancillary works would be needed to defend those areas directly and that costing would have to be included.  At that location, there is reasonable storage for upstream waters to flow into the River Lee from the River Glashaboy in the current scenario.  In the mid-range future scenario, which is based on a 20% to 30% increase in flows and a 0.5 m sea level rise, a barrier at that location would start to run out of storage capacity.  That would not be the optimum location if a 1 m sea level rise were to occur in the context of longer-term climate change.  In addition, it would not protect Midleton, which is also is at significant tidal flood risk.  That risk will increase in the future scenario.  It is probable that in the longer-term scenario, a barrier either side of Great Island would be more viable while also being more expensive.  The question of whether a barrier will be a viable option at some point arises in this context.  It may well become a viable option if sea levels rise by between 0.5 m and 1 m, but it is not viable at present.</p> <p>  I would like to make another point about the climate change scenario.  If direct defences are not built in the city, the level at which flooding occurs will remain at approximately 2.5 m.  If a sea level rise of 1 m occurs at the point at which a barrier becomes viable, the barrier will have to be closed every day to protect the city from flooding.  This would have huge implications for navigation, the environment and the operation of the harbour.</p><p> In reality any future tidal barrier will only work in conjunction with raised defences in the east of the city and they will work together to ensure that the barrier would only need to be closed in extreme events, with the defence walls protecting against the more frequent events.  In the short term, the direct defences are cost beneficial, are the correct solution for Cork protecting against both fluvial and tidal flooding.  They are the first step and in 50 years or more it might be necessary to run a tidal barrier in conjunction with them.  It is important that we compare like with like.  A tidal barrier is not cost beneficial at the moment and is not viable.  It has been studied in detail.  All the issues that the HR Wallingford report said needed to be considered have been in our assessment, and were considered to an extent in the precursor to this work which was the Lee catchment flood risk assessment and management study, CFRAMS, by Halcrow which is another reputable international consultant. </p></speech>
