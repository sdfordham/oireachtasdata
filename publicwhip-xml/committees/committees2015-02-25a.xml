I remind members and guests to switch off their mobile telephones before we commence.  Session A this morning is a public hearing discussion with Professor Gregory Connor from NUI Maynooth on issues relating to banking policy, systems and practices which may have underpinned the banking crisis in Ireland.  I welcome everyone to the tenth public hearing of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  Later this morning, we will hear from Professor Eamonn Walsh from UCD.</p><p>I welcome Professor Gregory Connor, who is professor of finance at NUI Maynooth, having previously been part of the finance faculty at the London School of Economics and director of research at MSCI Europe.  He specialises in portfolio risk analysis, factoring modelling, financial economics and security market pricing.  Professor Connor holds a BA in Economics from Georgetown University and he received his doctorate in economics from Yale University.</p><p>Before we begin, I wish to advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  As you have been informed previously, the committee is asking witnesses to refrain from discussing named individuals in this phase of the inquiry.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite Professor Connor to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-25a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Gregory Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015022500002#A00300"><p>I thank the committee for inviting me.  I have your thoughtful list of suggested topics on bank funding and the Irish banking crisis.  Let me start with a key point.  An enormous uncontrolled flow of foreign debt capital into the Irish domestic banking system is the key cause of the Irish financial crisis.  Obviously, there are other secondary causes, but the basic and most fundamental cause of the Irish economic crisis was a poorly controlled very large inflow of foreign debt capital into the commercial banks of Ireland.</p> <p>  This foreign debt capital flow had two effects.  One, it created unstable debt levels throughout the economy but, two, it acted as a Keynesian stimulus to the economy - it raised incomes, production costs, wages and tax revenues.  That increase in tax revenues then led to an increase in Government spending.   When we think about the fiscal calamity that hit Ireland after the banking bust, it was directly and indirectly caused by this foreign debt capital inflow.  It was directly caused through the big costs of the bank bailout but also indirectly, because one had a sudden stop to the Keynesian stimulus from foreign debt funding and this fed disastrously into private and Government spending, so there was a sudden stop - basically a Keynesian effect.   </p> <p>  From a global perspective, people often say this Irish banking crisis is unprecedented but it is not really unprecedented.  Economists talk about what they call "a capital bonanza", which is a large flow of capital, equity or debt, into a national economy.  Often if there is a regulatory policy or business failure or some combination, capital bonanzas lead to financial bubbles, followed by busts.  This is what happened in Ireland.  There were policy, business and regulatory failures and there was an enormous capital bonanza, financial bubble and bust, so it is not really unprecedented.</p> <p>  Where did the capital come from?  In the early years of this century, there was a global tidal wave of liquidity across developed markets.  We were aware of this at the time and people used that phrase "global tidal wave of liquidity".  It was a period called the great moderation, which lasted about 20 years.  If one looks across countries in the developed world and through time, there was fairly stable economic growth and people said this is a new paradigm, the business cycle is solved, we have new institutions, we have new technologies and there is going to be stable growth.  It was just a tidal wave of liquidity across markets.</p> <p>  All developed markets were hit by the great recession which followed the US credit liquidity crisis of 2008 but only a handful, including the USA, Greece, Iceland and Ireland, had identifiably distinct credit bubbles and busts.  If one looks at Iceland, its credit bubble and bust has a lot of parallels to Ireland.  It too had excessive foreign debt capital into its banking system as the main cause of its credit bubble and bust.  Another parallel, which I think has been underappreciated, was the very poor prudential oversight of the Icelandic Central Bank during their credit bubble.</p> <p>  If we turn briefly to Greece, their credit bubble and bust was very different.  There, the same global tidal wave of liquidity did not go into the banking system but it went directly into Government borrowing, which was hidden in various ways, including with some complicity by the banking system and the international investment banks, in particular.  It was a different source of capital, but again a credit bubble and bust in Greece.</p> <p>  A key objective of Economic and Monetary Union was to allow free capital flows across member states.  That was considered one of the great advantages of EMU - that we were going to have funds flowing quickly into high funding cost states, like Ireland, from low funding cost states, like France and Germany.  This worked, in fact, one could say one of the big causes of the Irish crisis was that this EMU mechanism worked too well.  That was a deep clear flaw in the EMU system, and the economics profession shares some blame for that.  We underappreciated the instability which would be caused by allowing very free capital flows across member states.  That was an error in the design of EMU by the economics profession.  Partly because of the political enthusiasm, which many of us share for EMU, we overlooked the problems - both in the economics and the policy world.</p><p>JK Galbraith said that one of the advantages of being an economist is that the more one messes up, the more they need one.  There has certainly been a great deal of work to try to correct that EMU flaw but I do not think it has been fully corrected.</p><p> Let me turn to funding and capital risk at the Irish banks as the committee requested.  The source of the funding is straightforward.  During this period, German and French banks had more deposits than they could profitably use at home so they moved funds to a growing economy with high rated banks and no exchange rate risk, Ireland in particular, as well as others.  Three main vehicles were used for the funding, namely, the interbank borrowing market, bond issuance by Irish banks and direct deposits by foreign financial institutions and corporations into Irish banks.  In terms of the size of the funding, I said it was massive.  The net foreign liability of the Irish domestic banking sector in early 2003 was &euro;29 billion.  This grew over the next five and a half years by 449% to &euro;158 billion in 2008.  The net foreign borrowing ratio to GDP was 88% in the third quarter of 2008, which was massive.  That was a very large and very risky overhang of foreign debt.  In fact, if one thinks about some of the early macroeconomist discussion and talk about the Irish debt ratio, or Government debt, one has to think about the 88% that the banks owed to foreigners.  It was very unstable, hidden borrowing.  The risk from this was amplified for property development lending which grew from &euro;21 billion in early 2003 by 524% to &euro;133 billion in late 2008.  It was an enormous growth in what is one of the riskiest classes of bank borrowing.  It is much riskier than mortgages and much less diversified than SME lending.  This is a very narrow concentrated lending growing by 524% over five and a quarter years.</p><p> The Irish Central Bank and the Financial Regulator should have blocked the enormous debt capital inflow and should have blocked the too fast growth in property development lending.  If they had done either of those things, the Irish banking crisis would not have happened.  They should have done both.  There was a massive failure by the Irish Central Bank and Financial Regulator in not blocking both of these.  I do not blame the crisis entirely on them, however.  Economists were mistaken also.  Globally, there was an overly complacent attitude toward the risk of a banking crisis in developed markets.  We had not had one in 50 years in many countries and were too complacent.  There were also big errors in bank risk and liquidity regulation, in particular the level of bank equity capital was much too low.  The definition relied too much on tier 2 equity, which is only available when a bank is no longer a going concern.  It does not provide a buffer to a going concern bank.  It provides a buffer to a bank which is being restructured.  Relying on that was a big error.  That interacted with a misunderstanding of the big risk of systemic liquidity problems in the banking sector.  That was also missed.  As such, the economists share some blame.</p><p> A solvent commercial bank has a backstop in the case of a serious liquidity problem.  It can use its long-term assets as collateral.  Central banks stand ready as lenders of last resort to provide funding to banks.  In the case of the eurozone, this failed because the ECB had very strict rules.  It could only lend for good collateral to solvent banks.  This dichotomy between the lender of last resort function and the problem with insolvent bank restructuring was very problematic.  The ECB's attitude was that it was in its charter that it would only lend to solvent banks for good collateral and that what happened where a bank was distressed was someone else's problem, namely, a national problem.  That was a big issue and a major difficulty.  Another problem of course was that, along with many other European countries, Ireland did not have an effective, quick bank resolution mechanism at that point.</p><p> The committee has asked me to address how interbank competition increased risk taking.  Here I want to differentiate between blame and causes.  In terms of risk taking by Irish bank managers, they are to blame for what they knew in many cases was overly risky lending.  Many people in the industry knew that what they were doing was too risky.  However, in terms of causes, there was a rivalrous environment from the maverick banks, particularly Anglo and Irish Nationwide, which increased risk levels and then pulled in the other banks.  Irish shareholders were also leading this.  They were forcing the banks to adopt more aggressive strategies.  As such, the shareholders also contributed to this pulling of the strategies to be too risky.  That is in terms of causation.  In terms of blame, the bank managers who knew they were taking too much risk are to blame.  In terms of causation, that was deeper.  Without the control from the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank, it was very difficult in this environment to avoid the banks being pulled into this ethically wrong strategy.</p><p> I turn now to the capital outflows from Irish banks and the liability guarantee.  The problems with refunding in the banks really started in August 2007 with the early stages of the crisis.  Over the whole next year, the ability of various banks to access the three main vehicles became increasingly difficult.  A global credit liquidity freeze hit after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in mid-September 2008.  There also had developed institutional bank runs, particularly in the USA, but spreading to some of the maverick banks in Ireland during October 2008.  There were liquidity problems in the system at this point.  They played a central role in the 2008 US crisis in that month.  The US crisis is correctly termed a credit liquidity crisis.  Ireland did not have a liquidity crisis, it had a bank credit crisis.  It received &euro;136 billion in liquidity support at peak from the ECB and Irish Central Bank.  That was more than enough liquidity support.  Ireland did not suffer a liquidity crisis, it suffered a bank insolvency crisis.  The ECB began providing liquidity funding to the Irish banks in early 2008 and the funding amount rose sharply.  The ECB began to question under its charter whether it was providing liquidity support or risky capital infusion, which it felt it could not do.  In my judgment, in fact, some of the liquidity support provided under ELA was risky capital.  It did not really meet the ECB claim that it was liquidity support only.</p><p> With hindsight, the domestic banking system's aggregate balance sheet was actually insolvent in September 2008.  There was a claim at that point of &euro;43 billion tier 1 and tier 2 equity but bank accounting statements even relative to other corporate sectors greatly lagged the reality.  They presented a very lagged picture of reality as Professor Honohan noted earlier.  The Government in fact injected &euro;64 billion into these banks, after which the banks only had tier 1 equity of &euro;13 billion.  That is a minus of &euro;51 billion somewhere.  The banking system aggregate balance sheet was insolvent in September 2008.  In September 2008, the Irish Government provided a blanket liability guarantee to an insolvent banking sector.  It was a very costly error.  There are three caveats to muddy the picture.  First, the lender of last resort function of the ECB was not working properly.  The liability guarantee was partly intended to allow access to this very flawed funding function from the ECB.  Second, the guidance provided to the Government by the Irish Central Bank and Financial Regulator was poor.  Third, the information provided by some of the banks may have been embellished deliberately to disguise their real capital positions.  Those are my comments.  I thank the committee for listening.</p></speech>

Before I bring in lead questioners, I will come back to his statement to deal with two matters.  As he is aware, these hearings are broadcast to the public.  In simplified terms, could he explain to the committee what he means by funding or liquidity risk and also what is meant by capital or solvency risk?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-25a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Gregory Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015022500002#C00100"><p>The assets of banks tend to be illiquid long-term loans.  That is what banks do.  On the other side - their liabilities and the money they owe - are short-term liabilities such as, for instance, deposit savings accounts where their liability claimant often has very quick access.  If depositors come to the bank and want their cash now against long-term assets, then that is called a liquidity problem.  The bank needs to have cash for its long-term valuable assets.  An insolvency problem is when the value of the long-term assets has fallen.  For instance, many of the property loans may be failed projects and do not have real cash value.  The claims made by the savers and bondholders of the bank are larger than the value of the assets of the bank.  That is insolvency.  It is not that the bank cannot pay cash now as its central bank can always provide.  It can never pay the cash.  Someone is going to have to take a loss.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-25a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/990" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Lynch" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015022500002#C00200"><p>One of the principle terms of reference of this inquiry is to examine the solvency <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>liquidity of the banks in the lead-up to the crisis period, particularly around the time of the bank guarantee.  Will Professor Connor explain to the committee what difficulties governments face when attempting to diagnose whether a bank has a liquidity or a solvency problem?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-25a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Gregory Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015022500002#C00300"><p>The first thing is to determine solvency.  So, we need to value the assets of the bank and make sure they are larger than the non-equity liabilities.  There is an equity, which is the residual liability or the buffer of the bank.  That is just a residual claim which has to be positive.  When that is negative, the bank is insolvent.  If one takes the value of the assets and subtracts the value of the liabilities - claims from debt holders, deposits and savers - and gets a negative number, then the bank is insolvent.  That is essentially the exercise.</p> <p>  The hard part is valuing the long-term assets of the bank.  It has to look at these projects, which in the case of Ireland were mortgages and property development projects, and decide how many of these are not going to pay the bank back.  That was the problem.  It was difficult.  The banks were also in the year-long habit of overstating their solvency because they had been trying to refund themselves, roll over their funding.  They had got into a bad habit of embellishing the quality of their books.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-25a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Gregory Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015022500002#C00500"><p>They were insolvent.  I know Professor Patrick Honohan spoke on this.  In his follow-up testimony, he said two of the banks were insolvent.  Most of my work has been to simplify and provide an overview.  I use the aggregate balance sheet.  I net out the relationships between the banks and look at the overall banking sector.  Although Professor Honohan does not say it, the domestic banking sector was insolvent on an aggregate basis.  That is clear from the fact that we injected &euro;64 billion into a banking sector which was then worth only &euro;13 billion, plus a little bit of tier 2 capital.</p></speech>

From their aggregate position, all of the domestic banks were insolvent.  This was obviously due to some of the most insolvent.  I have not tried to analyse individually which banks were insolvent.  The aggregate position, I think importantly, was insolvency.</p></speech>

I think Ireland was actually a strong economy and that was partly one of the reasons it received this capital bonanza.  Ireland was a tiger economy.  That was part of the reason this enormous capital bonanza came into Ireland.  Ireland would have suffered, along with all other developed markets, from the Great Recession.  It would not have suffered as much as the French and German economies from the 2008 US credit liquidity crisis because it did not own foreign bank assets.  I think in fact the economic crisis is directly tied back to preventable actions and prudential banking regulation.  I know that is a strong statement but I will make that claim.</p></speech>

Banks think they are too big to fail or that they have an implicit guarantee from their governments.  One of the problems was that the money flowing in had an implicit guarantee from the European Union.  The German, French and British savers and pension funds knew they could freely lend to the Irish banking sector and that they were safe because of the euro.  There was an implicit belief that was part of the confidence.</p> <p>  The only bodies that had the power to stop it were the Irish Central Bank and the Financial Regulator.  They should have said, "Stop".  That is the normal function of a central bank.  One pulls away the bowl just as the party gets started.  That is what they were supposed to do.  They did not do that, however.</p></speech>

How would those rules have operated?  Are there precedents in other countries?</p></speech>

The economics profession was also in this overconfident mindset.  I do not want to overstate the error of the Central Bank.  It was in the overconfident mindset like many other bodies.  It should have had somebody, however, to say it should look at the banking system.  AIB knew there were problems.  It asked Professor John FitzGerald, as the committee has heard in testimony, to undertake a risk analysis to see if there was a problem.  The Central Bank should have said it would look at this problem and then follow on it.  Professor Honohan, in his document, goes through the many avenues and tools that the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank had.  In his document, he states that if one looks at the powers the Central Bank Governor had up to 2008, it is clear the Central Bank and Financial Regulator had plenty of power to both act on concentration ratios.  There was too much concentration on property.  They should have gone to Anglo Irish Bank and the other banks and said, "No, this is too much property lending and is not allowed.  You can lose your banking licence.  Stop.  No, this is too much liquid and very unstable funding from foreign debt capital.  Stop".  They had the power to do it.</p> <p>  In the then environment, as it has been said to me and Professor O'Kelly on this paper, there was a general overconfidence and it would not have been in the spirit of the times.  I do not want to oversell it in that sense.</p></speech>

The US had a terrible 2008 credit liquidity crisis.  Why?  It was because it was not controlling the reselling of mortgages or the leveraged packaging of mortgages.  Why?  It was because it had never that phenomenon causing a crisis before.  It was not having a savings and loans crisis like it had 20 years earlier.  It was certainly not having one of those again.  It was not having a Great Depression-type crisis because that was caused by people borrowing from the banks and using it to buy shares.  That had been ruled out.  One always tries to prevent them.  One sets in place good procedures to prevent them.  It was partly bad luck that Ireland had a collection of bad policies.</p><p>Some of them were good things.  For example, the fact that Ireland had growth contributed to the capital bonanza coming to Ireland.  However, there were also bad policies, such as light touch regulation.  The political environment also contributed.</p></speech>

I think that has been taken care of with the bank resolution and recovery directive, which came into power last month, and the single supervisory mechanism, which includes resolution controls.  The US was overconfident partly because its system, which has now been brought to Europe, works well.  Liquidity funding and bank restructuring need to be done by the same body.  Somebody needs to decide whether it is a liquidity problem or an insolvency problem and, if it is the latter, have the authority to restructure the bank.  That was missing but I do not think it is a missing piece now.</p></speech>

It was not just the banks.  The bank managers knew there was implicit insurance.  More important in Ireland's case was that the funders to the banks also relied on that insurance.

On the aggregate basis they were insolvent.  Note that this was done in hindsight and because one has a lag and these are <i>pro forma</i>.  When I say &quot;insolvency&quot; I do not mean technical insolvency or that the State accounts are insolvent.  On a <i>pro forma</i>basis, adjusted for predictable losses, they were insolvent.</p></speech>

Greece had hidden borrowing.  It had worked out ways to rewrite its national income accounts to hide borrowing and it worked with investment bankers to hide the debt issuance.  Ireland's hidden borrowing was through its domestic banking system.  When macro-economists like Professor John FitzGerald from the ESRI say they missed the problems, they did so because when they worked through the fiscal accounts there did not appear to be a lot of borrowing but they missed the 88% of GDP coming in as hidden borrowing through the banking system.  We are on the hook for that.  It was difficult politically but it was a mistake.</p></speech>

I suspect that in almost all of the domestic banks some knowledgeable person was saying "yikes, our exposure to property development is enormous and really risky".  Property development consists of nothing more than holes in the ground and half built buildings, unlike a mortgage on a residential property that has somebody living it.  It is a very risky operation to have all that concentrated risk.  I do not think we need new procedures because it is dead obvious with hindsight, and was probably obvious at the time.</p></speech>

All of the central banks made errors at that time and they all probably regret some of their actions.  Across Europe, the second worst central bank in terms of responses to the credit bubble was Ireland's.  Only the Icelandic central bank had worse prudential oversight during that period.  The Spanish, Portuguese and Italian central banks obviously did not have the same enthusiasm as Ireland in the Celtic tiger but their behaviour was more modestly risky, whereas Ireland's was excessively risky.  It was quite a bit worse than average.  This was in the spirit of the times, and more.  It took the spirit of the times and ran with it.</p></speech>

They had gotten into the habit of embellishing how good their accounts really were and how solvent they were.  That is a natural activity for the banks.  I know there are records of discussions in the banks from the capital desks.</p><p>The capital desks have to be recorded for regulatory purposes.  If one listens to the recorded discussions on the capital desks, some of the bankers knew they were insolvent and they knew they were hiding that insolvency so it is clear that they knew they were solvent.  The banks either knew they were insolvent or someone in the bank knew they were taking on too much risk or they had too much concentration in property or they were borrowing too much through very volatile funding sources.  The interbank borrowing market is quite volatile.  It is normally used just to manage short-term liquidity needs; it is not normally treated as a source of long-term funding.  It is for short-term management so they knew they were using volatile sources of funding, they had too concentrated a loan book and property prices had gone up too much.  I suspect many bankers knew what was going on in that sense.</p></speech>

Bank accounts are unusual in how long the lag is between when a bank gets into real trouble and when the trouble is reflected in its accounts.  The accounting profession had a strategy of minimising another phenomenon which was earning smoothing.  They forced the banks to only take a loss when there were observable actions which could justify it.  If you notice that you have funded a &euro;50 million shopping complex and you know that no one will shop there because the economy has turned, you cannot take a loss.  You have to wait until there is a default on loan repayments.  Even as things got bad, there was no provisioning for the losses.  You have to have a material action generating the provision.  That was one of the problems.  That is very much an accounting problem, although it touches on my area.  There were errors in the way the banks' accounts were handled in terms of the slowness of recognising loan losses in the accounts.</p></speech>

The two banks that were most obviously insolvent should have been left out and restructured and that should have been obvious.  If the information provided by the Central Bank, Financial Regulator and the banks had been appropriate, it would have been obvious to the Government that the two most insolvent banks should not have been included in a liability guarantee.  They were very costly errors.  I note &euro;35 billion just for those two.  I disagree with Donal Donovan on that point.  Obviously most of the damage had been done.  The economy was going into a long slump but it could have saved a big chunk of that money.  Obviously, you would have the problem that if you default, then you lose some access, they say, so there would have been some repercussions from that event.  The private banks would have defaulted on their liabilities but that tends to quickly dissipate.  It was not a claim by the Irish taxpayer; it was a claim by private banks and they should have defaulted on those claims.</p></speech>

They were pulling in this capital bonanza of &euro;158 billion into the economy and then they had to place it profitably so they were looking for opportunities.  SMEs were not providing opportunities.  They would have preferred SME lending if they could have found it.  Many of the banks were probably looking for SME opportunities.  They were also looking to issue mortgages.  It was very easy.  They were encouraging mortgages.  Property development was the worst lending but the most available.  Many well connected business people wanted to be billionaires and were willing to take the risk, take the money and develop property.  They found the channel that was accessible to them.</p></speech>

I think part of the problem was the success of the IFSC turned, in particular, the financial regulatory authority into a booster for light regulation.  That fed into this very light-touch approach of the Financial Regulator.  It was way overboard relative to competitors, except Iceland, and was the second worst prudential performance in the world.  It was partly induced by the flawed mandate, which has now been split.  You should not have your financial regulator simultaneously flying around the world telling people "Bring your financial services to Ireland and we will adopt a very light-touch approach".  That contributed to what was a very bad performance.</p></speech>

Is it that no bank should ever be allowed to fail or is it that, at the time, that was the mood?

It is not just the owner who suffers but also the families of those who work there, local shopkeepers and others.  Banks, by their nature, are tied into everything so when a bank fails it causes widespread economic dislocation.  There is naturally a big public externality to bank failure.  The question then is whether we should offset that with a moral hazard problem and never let them fail.  When banks start to fail, do we inject free taxpayer-based funds to keep them in business?  It is a very difficult problem.  The "too big to fail" problem is not a simple one.</p></speech>

That is something this committee will have to tease out.  We know that the advice from the Financial Regulator was poor and we know that from statements made in October to the effect that this was just a liquidity problem when that clearly was not the case.  It was obvious at that point to many analysts that it was not a liquidity problem but a deep insolvency problem.  I do not know exactly how bad the information provided to the Government was so that is why I have provided those caveats.  That said, a thoughtful Cabinet meeting at that stage should have been able to see that Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide, at least, were insolvent, even with the poor information provided by the Financial Regulator.  Maybe the information was so bad that the Government missed that but that is my opinion.  I admit that it is speculative.  I do not have the documents that the Cabinet had when it made that wrong decision.</p></speech>

That came out of some worries about the dotcom bubble of 1999-2000, the September 11 incident and low rates of inflation.  There was a bit of a new paradigm, as is happening now.  The central banks were able to create massive liquidity with low inflation and the US central bank did so.  This generated a reach-for-yield.  Rates fell and there was a lot of saving coming out of the emerging markets, in particular, from China.  There was a wave of liquidity in the markets that was not specifically Irish.</p></speech>

In connection with the National Asset Management Agency, Professor Connor co-authored with Thomas Flavin and Brian O'Kelly "The US and Irish Credit Crises: Their Distinctive Differences and Common Features in 2010".  He stated there that the Irish Government set up the National Asset Management Agency with the explicit goal of overpaying for banks' distressed assets in order to keep privately-owned equity capital in the banks from collapsing in value.  Can he discuss that in a little more detail?  What is his opinion of how the Government used NAMA to take over distressed assets in Ireland and does he consider that a more optimal approach could have been taken?</p></speech>

Overall, it is a pretty clear success at this stage.  I found as did others that the setting up of NAMA was delayed inordinately, which was a mistake.  At the time, I felt there was a political aspect to that.  It was delayed to provide an opportunity for borrowers in the property development community to rearrange their affairs in ways that were not optimal for the taxpayer.  I think there was a delay in setting up NAMA.</p> <p>  The overpayment goes back to some of the questions about insolvency.  Who knows how to value long-term assets?  That was deliberate, as was stated in the accounts, and a 30% premium was paid which went through the EU's criteria and was allowed.  The US did the same thing.  If one looks at the targeted asset relief programme, another success, it also overpaid for the assets.  The idea of overpaying to market value to allow the banking system to recover worked in the long run.  I do not think I have a problem with that.  They could have paid less, but they deliberately overpaid rather than force all the banks into insolvency and then restructure them.  It was to allow three of the banks to continue in something that looked like non-bankruptcy.  It looked like that.  Effectively, two of them are State owned.</p></speech>

It is a difficult question and I find looking globally that there are a lot of links across countries.  There might be situations where one could have a large net foreign borrowing.  It was certainly very dangerous in the Irish case and that should have been obvious to the Irish banks.  I am not sure whether 88% of GDP is the second worst in the period.  It is certainly not as bad as Iceland.  It is a good question and I will follow up.  Whether that is the second worst globally, I do not know.</p> <p>  In terms of property development lending, it was certainly excessive.  The bank managers knew.  I rely here on anecdotal discussion with banks.  Most of them had someone in a senior position, perhaps even the CEO, who knew that the concentration in property development lending was excessive.  That is anecdotal.</p></speech>

If we were to consider pillars such as the Irish Government, banks, the regulatory position and external factors such as the ECB, can Professor Connor apportion a percentage weighting of blame or cause?</p></speech>

The ECB as an institution, which I know the committee is trying to get to attend, is sometimes overly blamed.  It had a very flawed situation in that it could only provide liquidity funding and could not get involved in restructuring.  That created an intolerable situation for which it had no solution.  It did not offer much.  It broke its charter and provided funding through ELA that was, in effect, risky funding.  I put less blame on the ECB.  I certainly blame business analysts and economists on our over-enthusiasm and over-confidence around banking crises that we know we did wrong.  Our Financial Regulator, as I have already mentioned, was notably poor.  In terms of the business community, our banking community other than the maverick banks, namely, Anglo and Nationwide, was drawn into it.  While they are to blame and a lot of them knew that what they were doing involved poor business ethics, causally they were pulled in.</p></speech>

Professor Connor provided a table on page 14 of his document which sets out the share of the aggregate balance sheet of the local banks.  It is fair looking at it that the only institution that had an increase in the share of the aggregate balance sheet was Anglo.  Taking up Professor Connor's point there about the banks, is it fair to say looking at that figure that the shares of all the other banks went down?  Did that particular bank's way of doing business lead the others astray, or not?</p></speech>

They were all growing too much.  Anglo Irish Bank, as Professor Honohan has stated in several papers, was growing massively too fast, as was Irish Nationwide.  Professor Honohan gives some numbers and says this should have been obvious to any trained regulator.  They were all growing.  The figure that Professor Lane produced is the proportion of market share.  There was a growing pie but Anglo was growing so fast that it was taking a larger slice of that growing pie.</p></speech>

Let us pick on AIB for example.  AIB was saying, and this is why it went to John FitzGerald, "We are growing too fast but our shareholders and senior managers are saying we are not growing fast enough".  It is both of those.  They were being pulled but they should have known they were going too fast.  It is both of those.  They were being pulled but they should have realised.

Anecdotally, one hears this repeated in conversations with bankers.  They knew they were growing too fast.  They say they knew their property development concentration was too high and that they were growing their liability side too fast but they were being pulled by their shareholders and managers to not let their market share continue to fall.  One of the painful but necessary outcomes was that the cash value of all these shares went to zero.  That was important and had to be done because shareholders shared some blame.</p></speech>

That flaw in the system has been dealt with.  I am not sure the ECB would have responded.  We can see that it had a flawed system in the fact that it broke its own rules in providing risky capital to the Irish banks.  Some of the capital provided through ELA was not liquidity funding, given that the banks were insolvent and, therefore, any funding was risky capital injection.  Obviously, the banks had a Government guarantee, and that was how they allowed themselves to call it liquidity funding.</p></speech>

Professor Connor, you said earlier that it was dead obvious with hindsight, and probably at the time - the insolvencies in the banks.

Can you expand on that, please?</p></speech>

Keep in mind that for a blanket liability guarantee, you only need a credible risk of insolvency so they did not need to know, as I have stated and as Professor Honohan has stated.  With hindsight, it is completely clear they were insolvent but you only need a credible high risk of insolvency for a bank liability decision to be clearly wrong.  I think it was obvious to any thoughtful analyst when the blanket liability guarantee was given that, in fact, two of the banks were either insolvent or were highly probably insolvent.  There was a high probability that they were insolvent.  I think that was fairly obvious, even with the poor information provided by those banks.  Just by looking at their sets of accounts and the enormous exposure to property development lending and their need to roll-over liabilities, which are in a frozen global interbank borrowing market, they were in deep trouble.</p></speech>

I think there was a political bias.  In other words, I suspect - again, I was not at this Cabinet meeting - they thought it is politically in our interests.  I suspect that played a role, which it obviously should not in such a high-stakes, expensive decision.  They should have said, "Let's just think about this from the perspective of the public".  I suspect there was a political angle to the decision because it seems such a wrong decision.  I think Professor William Black, in earlier testimony, said the decision was insane.  That is an overstatement.  It was a wrong decision, clearly, on balance.  Despite the poor information, it was wrong and I suspect the thing that tipped it into the wrong category was probably the political benefits they saw from the policy.</p></speech>

The banks also had lobbying power but the property development community had very strong relationships with members of the D&aacute;il and they were going to hurt most if the two biggest supporters of the property development community were let go in a shock bankruptcy.  They would all be then subject to immediate restructuring.  So I suspect that played a role, but that is clearly beyond my expertise.

In your 2012 co-authored paper, The U.S. and Irish Credit Crises: Their Distinctive Differences and Common Features - I think we have given you notice that I would be asking questions in relation to this paper - the following point is made.  A key feature of an asset price bubble is that "traders are often not interested in the asset for its intended use or its earning capacity but only in its expected price appreciation."  The paper goes on to state that in Ireland this interest in expected asset appreciation and not the intended use of the asset was "reflected in a significant increase in the number of vacant properties, especially in the investment sector of the market".  Can you explain to the committee what you mean by this point?  Why was this interest in asset price appreciation reflected, as you say, in a significant increase in the number of vacant properties?</p></speech>

This worked for several years in a row.  That is common in asset pricing bubbles - that people buy a property not for its intrinsic value but the fact that they can sell it on in what is sometimes called "the greater fool problem".  You think you can buy a property, even though it is overvalued, because you can sell it to someone who will pay even more.  There was some of this.  As the debt capital inflow into the Irish banks manifested itself in excessive of mortgage lending, that pushed up prices properties.  The banks then encouraged speculative investors to buy properties in order to flip them.  It was obviously a Ponzi scheme which could not go on forever.</p></speech>

With that in mind, in that paper I mentioned, the following point is made: "Another source of regulatory imprudence in Ireland was the long and close relationship between the Fianna F&aacute;il political party (the dominant party in coalition governments during most of the pre-crisis period) and the Irish property development industry."   You touched on this in regard to Deputy Murphy's question.  Could you briefly explain to us what you meant by that statement, what you mean by regulatory imprudence and how this is linked with the long and close relationship between Fianna F&aacute;il and Irish property development industry?</p></speech>

That is a political question and that relationship requires someone who really knows the political landscape at a deep level, which I do not.  In terms of overview - that paper is a comparison of the US sources of their credit liquidity crisis and the sources of the Irish crisis - in both cases, as in the Greek case, some of the problems are political over-enthusiasm or political biases.  For instance, in the US, there was a massive political movement to increase mortgage lending to poorer sectors of society.  There was a massively strong political consensus to do that.  In Ireland, the equivalent was the relationship with the property development sector - between the coalition governments and that sector.  I do not think I can give you a deeper understanding of that.  I just do not think I have the expertise and the deep knowledge.  That requires a deeper statement than-----</p></speech>

In the same paper, Professor Connor uses a phrase the committee has heard on a number of occasions, with Dublin being described in the pre-crisis period as the &quot;Wild West of European finance&quot;.  The paper states: &quot;Starting in the early 1990s, the Irish government made a strategic decision to become a world-leader in 'offshore' financial services.&quot;  Among the attractions of this country was the &quot;light-touch, almost nonexistent, tax and regulatory oversight&quot;.  The paper goes on to state:<blockquote><br /><br />An unintended consequences of the extremely light-touch financial regulatory regime in Ireland was to hobble Irish regulators in their oversight of domestic banks.  The actions of the Irish financial regulator [were at that time] secretive with limited public disclosure.</blockquote>Will Professor Connor explain these very strong statements?</p></speech>

German taxpayers probably have bigger losses than Irish taxpayers arising from the light regulation of the broader Irish financial sector through their losses in the IFSC.  It specialises in regulatory arbitrage and tax-type situations that are perhaps pushing the limits.  That has worked and is partly what offshore centres do, but it probably has been done to excesses in some cases in the IFSC.  Furthermore, that tendency or philosophy washed back to the domestic economy.  The regulation of financial markets in domestic Ireland was hobbled by the very light-touch approach that was one of the founding principles of the IFSC.</p></speech>

However, corporate deposits can be quite volatile, whereas retail deposits are a very stable source of funding for banks.  As to the relationship between bank bonds and corporate deposits, bonds can give a more stable stream but it depends on their length.  A long-maturity bank bond is somewhat more stable than a corporate deposit and the most stable is the retail deposit.  The Deputy is asking what would lead a bank to have more corporate deposits than bonds.  I am not sure that is something it would prefer from a risk perspective.  It might prefer the longer-term bonds because they are more stable than a volatile corporate deposit.</p></speech>

Were there any other groups, either internally within the banks or externally, that were pushing some of the more long-established financial institutions to go down that route?</p></speech>

The foreign entrants to the Irish market tended to be a very bad influence.  Bank of Scotland (Ireland), for instance, was a very bad influence in its actions.  Even the Icelandic banks were threatening to enter the Irish market, with talk of one of them attempting a takeover of Irish Nationwide Building Society.  The foreign banks were another troublesome feature in the Irish banking landscape.  The statement of the proportions of market share misses that there was also an increase in foreign actors.  The foreign share grew but the domestic versus foreign shares were roughly constant.</p></speech>

Shareholders were part of the problem.  We had pensioners with their Bank of Ireland and AIB shares, many of whom never voted.  Are they to blame?  They paid the cost; in fact, all shareholders equally paid the cost for encouraging the banks down that route.</p></speech>

Does he believe our EMU membership was a critical part of the financial collapse in Ireland?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-25a.196" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Gregory Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015022500002#K01100"><p>There has been a great deal of work by Paul de Grauwe and others on the very deep error in the design of EMU, which relates to the inability to control fast capital flows across member states.  That was fundamental, yes.  If Ireland had its own currency, French and German savers would not have felt they had the implicit guarantee of investing their low-risk, high-yield money into Irish banks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-25a.197" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/966" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015022500002#K01200"><p>Professor Connor referenced Iceland, which did have its own currency.  Previous witnesses, including Professor John FitzGerald in particular, have noted that Latvia and Estonia had property bubbles similar in nature to Ireland but were outside EMU.  What was the difference in those countries, which were European Union members but not members of EMU at that time?  Why did they have the same type of property bubble we had?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-25a.198" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Gregory Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015022500002#K01300"><p>Those are small economies - even smaller than Ireland - and they saw a lot of German fund inflows despite the currency difference.  The euro currency is not necessary for a financial bubble.  An important feature of bubbles is that they are all different and, superficially, each looks different from the previous one.  That is the nature of them because one prevents bubbles wherever one can, which means the next one will be something one did not think of.</p></speech>

I was a student of economics at the time and recall several significant voices in Irish economics who did express concern.  In fact, it could be argued there was a 50:50 divide.</p></speech>

Economists should have been more forthright and allowed that level of criticism to have more impact.  Whether they would have had an effect on the decision makers is not clear.</p></speech>

He has made strong statements about insolvency.  Specifically, he said that Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society were insolvent at the time of the guarantee.</p></speech>

A going concern should not need &euro;35 billion to be closed.  In fact, it was a supported closure because, as we know, the NAMA assets were bought at above their value to provide some support.</p><p>I believe the PwC report is clearly flawed.  That is all I can say.  I agree there is an inconsistency, that they provided such a report, which is not justified.</p></speech>

Many of us were unaware that the Department of Finance had even considered a special resolution regime.  Should that have advanced?</p></speech>

One of the reasons that Northern Rock had a run was that the British bank resolution system was also flawed at that point.  It was a fairly widespread European problem, including in Ireland.  Ireland has had to renew many of its finance related legislative systems following the crisis, for instance, bankruptcy was also very out of date.</p></speech>

Can Professor Connor comment upon his evidence that the other institutions, the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank, believed that this was not a good idea following the Norther Rock debacle?</p></speech>

I do not remember that statement in his evidence.</p></speech>

When he mentions Irish bank shareholders is he referring to individual shareholders or institutional shareholders?</p></speech>

The board of directors is responsible to the shareholders; the shareholders clearly wanted more of this and questioned why their bank was not growing the way Anglo Irish Bank was growing.  That is the claim, obviously partly to diffuse the blame.  I know from speaking to managers that they were under a lot of pressure, both internally and from shareholders, to follow Anglo Irish  Bank.  Until it collapsed, Anglo Irish Bank's stock price had increased spectacularly, and shareholders believed that they were lagging and that their share price should do the same.</p></speech>

Would that have been standard or unique in terms of very stable deposits moving towards a high growth economy?</p></speech>

Ireland was unlucky in that it was seen to be a reliable, fast growing, economy, and that generated over-confidence in the banks, in the property development community, in the mortgage buying community, and in the policy makers.  Yes, the fact that Ireland had a long, very good period of growth contributed to over-confidence and that contributed to policy errors.</p></speech>

In Professor Connor's deliberations today he spoke about net foreign borrowings and the proposal  that Irish banks should have contained or limited these at that time; I assume that in terms of a recommendation he would be making that going into the future as well.  Could Professor Connor explain to the committee how that can happen, given the nature of EU laws and the principles of free movement of labour and capital, and how we could keep other European funds out of the Irish financial institutions?</p></speech>

When it is a problem the Central Bank should immediately turn to the individual banks and take action on a bank by bank basis.  I do not believe it is necessary, when alarm bells ring, to take action against all banks;  instead, each individual bank should be looked at and told what they must do.</p></speech>

In general terms, in any given country or at any given time, should a Central Bank and a financial regulator be cognisant of the solvency of the banks under its remit?  Should that be part of its day-to-day job?</p></speech>

The rules of ELA are very clear with regard to solvency; money cannot be given to insolvent banks.</p></speech>

The liability guarantee was a fix-up.  It was a patch-up to allow funding into the banking sector in the absence of solvency.  That is the first of my three caveats regarding the liability guarantee.  It was used as a fix-up.  The ECB said it was not liquidity funding but that it had a Government guarantee that the funding would be repaid.  In my opinion they were using the liability guarantee indirectly.</p></speech>

I have trouble working through all of the possible scenarios there.  I do believe it is clear that the ECB was in some sense pushing its charter to the limit in the amount of liquidity support it was providing and it was using the liability guarantee as a cover.  The ECB was in an impossible situation where it had to keep the bank system running yet could only provide funding to solvent banks and could not deal with insolvent banks, because those were a national responsibility.</p></speech>

The other aspect was that much of the &euro;136 billion in liquidity support was made during 2009.</p><p>As the banks could not roll over their bond funding, they turned it into liquidity support from the Irish and European Central Banks.  They then realised this liquidity support was risky capital.  They had a Government guarantee but that was no longer good enough.  Now providing funding to the Irish Government was risky capital, meaning the backstop for liquidity support was also risky.  It was like someone who had a mortgage but who lost their job and their backstop - their parents - also lost their jobs.  Liquidity funding was provided to risky banks, backed up by a risky government.  That was a lot of the reason the ECB wanted Ireland into the troika bailout programme.  It wanted its support to turn into liquidity support and not become a risky position.</p></speech>

I was asked to consider the role of accounting in bank crises and also external auditors.  I have prepared some brief remarks on these two topics which, in the interests of brevity, I have distilled from my published statement.  I would be happy to elaborate on any of the points I have raised.  I am also happy to discuss other accounting issues of relevance to the banking crisis.</p> <p>  When we think about banking crises, accounting is largely a silent bystander.  A bank crisis generally involves rapid loan growth alongside which we get concentrations of risk.  Often this rapid expansion is funded from volatile sources.  When one is in this expansionary mode, if a regulator or anybody else questions the business model, management will dismiss them because they will be able to point to excellent accounting profits and, as a result, great contributions to capital.  This pattern of behaviour was evident prior to 2008 in Ireland.  Our banks were among the most profitable in Europe.  It was widely believed that in what appeared to be challenging scenarios there were sufficient cushions to withstand risks.  Balance sheets and income statements formed the basis for this analysis so accounting was clearly implicated in the misperception of risk.  By 2009 it was apparent that the capital cushions available to Irish banks were entirely inadequate.  Some financial institutions had liabilities that exceeded their assets; they were insolvent.  </p> <p>  Balance sheets and income statements are prepared using accounting rules or accounting standards.  In general these are known as international financial reporting standards.  They are a large body of rules which indicate how one should measure assets, liabilities and income for an enterprise.  However, during banking expansions these accounting standards may be a little unhelpful and they will serve to over-estimate the profits that are reported to external investors and lenders.  If we start thinking about bank lending which is going to be the principal asset for banks, and the Irish banks in particular, essentially the big problem is estimating loan impairments.  Loan impairments are the amount of the loans that will not be repaid and it is a challenging accounting problem.  Impairment may be understood as something not performing as anticipated.  If we think about it in American terms, one would speak about someone being visually impaired - it means the eyes are not working as originally anticipated.  The notion of impairment means that things are not working as originally anticipated.  </p> <p>  With bank lending, if one knew exactly how much the bank was going to lose the accounting would be straightforward.  For example, if a bank engaged in very risky lending and we knew in advance just how risky that was and the risks entailed, impairment accounting would be very easy, because we would say we expect to lose all the money we lent to a particular customer, therefore, we should buck a loss and decrease profits and decrease capital.  The problem is that this scenario is highly unlikely.  If we lent money to a customer and we knew we were going to lose it all immediately we would not lend in the first place.  Lending is based upon the proposition that we do not expect to lose our money when we lend money to a particular identified customer.  The problem then is that we must engage in some estimates of the defaults that might occur.  Given that there are estimates and judgment calls involved in determining these impairments, it is necessary to have additional guidance.  The accounting standards as they stand require an entity to assess at the end of each reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.  In other words, one is required if one is preparing financial statements for a bank to sit down and ask at the end of an accounting period whether there is objective evidence that an impairment has occurred.  The rules go on to state that a financial asset is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset.  In other words, one must point to some event that has occurred since we originated the loan that constitutes objective evidence that we have made a loss.  </p> <p>  If we believe that a loss has been made it is necessary to estimate the impact of that loss and one is required to produce a reliable estimate of the amount of that loss.  The most counter-intuitive part of all of this is that the standard explicitly states that losses expected as a result of future events no matter how likely are not recognised.  In other words, if the dogs on the street expect that losses will occur they are ignored by accounting standards.  One is required to have objective evidence that the loss has been incurred rather than a belief that events will occur in the future which will endanger these loans.  Therefore, it is a very conservative definition of impairment since it requires objective evidence that a loss has been incurred.  As a result, impairment accounting is pro-cyclical.  What this means is that in a period of expansion as a bank expands its loan book, the bank will appear far more profitable because as it originates the loans it does not expect to lose money, it has not incurred a loss and so the bank will appear incredibly profitable.  In turn that means it will have additional capital so it will appear that it has additional cushions against future losses.  In a period of contraction the reverse happens.</p> <p>  When the bank expanded it made lots of loans.  When there is contraction it becomes apparent that some of these loans are impaired.  That immediately means a swing from having excessive loss of profits to excessive losses.  That is what we mean by procyclicality.</p> <p>  There are two additional features of accounting policies which lead to even greater procyclicality, one of which is the accrual of interest.</p><p>It means that if one lends money to a customer and agrees that they do not need to repay interest immediately then instead the interest will be rolled up on the loan.  That roll-up of interest will be recognised as a profit even though the cash has not been received from the customer.  </p><p> The second thing that can juice up the amount of income that is reported during the expansionary phase is the existence of loan arrangement fees - in other words, some agreement whereby the lender will give money to the bank, at the origination of the loan, as compensation for the origination costs of that loan.  It does mean that accounting rules give rise to excessive reporting of profits when we are expanding credit and it will also lead to substantial declines later in the cycle.  This cycle was quite evident in Ireland.  We had exuberant new lending which gave way to no lending at all because we went from having very high profits to almost no profits at all.    Nevertheless, it is difficult to conceive an outcome that would have been very different.  Even had accounting rules permitted the use of expected losses, as distinct from incurred losses or other alternatives, I believe that profits would have exhibited a similar pattern.  </p><p> Impairment accounting is largely diversionary for four reasons.  First, the rules are well understood by informed users of bank financial statements.  In other words, what I have said today is not new and has been known for decades.</p><p> Second, individual banks could create additional provisions despite the accounting rules.  There is nothing to prevent a bank from saying "We believe, to give a true and fair view of our results, that we should book additional provisions this year."  </p><p> Third, there is nothing to prevent the Financial Regulator from insisting upon additional provisions or enhanced disclosure.  The regulator did exercise such powers.  </p><p> Fourth, the expected loan losses during the growth phase in Ireland were likely to have been low anyhow.  No matter how one tries to cut it, during the period 2004 to 2006, inclusive, it is very difficult to conceive of any type of a mechanism that would have resulted in a large decrease in the reported profits of banks.</p><p> While these measurement rules are quite different it is important to realise that banks also make disclosures.  This is a key part of financial reporting, and it is not just what is in an income statement and a balance sheet, but also the additional disclosures in the financial statements.  Additional disclosures help one to understand exactly what is going on in terms of reported income.  In my opinion, the disclosures concerning the increased risks within Irish banks were inadequate during the period.  </p><p> Through the lens of 2002 balance sheets - which were balance sheets dominated by residential lending - users could have easily concluded that increased profitability was synonymous with increased cushions but a seismic shift occurred during 2002 to 2007.  There was a big change in the composition of loan portfolios for Irish banks.  Rather than residential mortgages dominating property landing, commercial and development lending became almost 50% of property lending.  In other words, the composition of the assets changed very dramatically.  There were concentrations of risky lending that displaced less risky home mortgages.  The distribution of the shift is also significant.  It is clear that these additional risks were not distributed equally across banks in Ireland at the time.  Further, a significant proportion of the loans were concentrated among a relatively small number of borrowers.</p><p> In summary, I believe that the real challenge for external users of financial statements was understanding the changing nature of the risks on balance sheets before 2007.  Had users fully understood the increased exposure to commercial and speculative lending, and that it was concentrated amongst a very small group of borrowers, it would have been far easier to realise that the quality of profits had declined and that capital mattresses, rather than cushions, were required.</p><p> The second point I was asked to talk about was bank audits.  What do auditors do?  Directors are responsible for preparing and approving the financial statements of a company or a bank and then auditors issue an opinion on the financial statements.  For example, an audit report will state something like the group's financial statements.  It will give a true and fair view, in accordance with international financial reporting standards as adopted by the European Union, of the state of the group's affairs as at 31 December 2015 and of its profits for the year then ended.  The first thing auditors do is express an opinion that the financial statements have been produced in conformity with international financial reporting standards.</p><p> Bank auditors have some additional responsibilities to a regulator and are required to bring certain matters to the attention of a regulator.  That means there are some additional responsibilities between an auditor and a financial regulator.</p><p> In addition to these responsibilities, a regulator has the power to request information from an auditor.  There is a particular additional set of duties with respect to bank auditors.  For example, bank auditors would have been required to perhaps produce reports of any breaches of prudential sector lending limit guidelines.  As Nyberg concludes, in the majority of cases the auditors did not report regulatory sector lending limit excesses to the Financial Regulator.  Even if all excesses had been reported, it appears unlikely that any action would have been taken by the Financial Regulator who was already aware of, and not concerned about, such excesses.  In other words, there were alternative reporting mechanisms between the banks and the Financial Regulator that are quite independent of annual financial reports prepared for shareholders and lenders.  While I have not had access to the auditors' communication with the Financial Regulator, Nyberg states that the auditors clearly fulfilled this narrow function according to existing rules and regulations.  </p><p> The committee might wish to know what else auditors do apart from expressing this opinion.  For say loans and receivables, there would be a general expectation that auditors should go along and look at a sample of some of the lending files within a bank.  As part of their audit they would do the following: ensure that lending policies are adhered to; review concentration reports and related party loan reports; establish evidence of any collateral assigned to the institution; check the financial condition of co-signatories and guarantors, examine past experience with the enforcement of guarantees, and confirm terms with the guarantor; compare loan amounts with appraisals; and ensure that construction loans are correctly classified as loans rather than real estate investments.  For significant construction projects, they would ensure that advances are based on progress and that there are offsite-onsite inspections to verify the collateral and the progress with the construction.  </p><p> Auditors should also assess management's loan reviews for impairments.  Audit procedures should establish that management has looked beyond the collateral to identify potential borrower weaknesses, to identify if collateral appraisals are adequate and that up to date borrower financial information is available.</p><p> Auditors are also expected to review performance against the original loan agreement and be alert to any biases, for example, loans to public figures or personalities.</p><p> In summary, when published financial statements are prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards, auditors also play a valuable role in assuring the veracity of the loans and receivables on a bank's balance sheet.  </p><p> I shall make some concluding observations.  Between 2002 and 2007 the aggregate loans in Ireland grew rapidly and exhibited significant concentrations of commercial lending, and speculative commercial lending.  However, these concentrations varied across banks and there were also significant individual borrower exposures which gave rise to exponentially greater risks.  Contemporaneous knowledge of these loan portfolio risks would have alerted external users to the sources of bank profits and their sustainability.</p><p>While there was no requirement to report these risks in the published financial statements, especially for financial statements prior to 2007, there were requirements to report capital adequacy, liquidity, impairment, large exposures and sectoral limits to the Financial Regulator.  It is an empirical matter as to whether these amounts were correctly reported to the regulator and to the boards of financial institutions.</p><p> I thank the committee members for their attention and I would welcome any comments or questions you might have.</p></speech>

In general this involves an annual report consisting of a very large document - for a bank this may be 200 pages - which gives much detail about the bank's directors, how governance works, a balance sheet, an income statement and notes to the financial statements.  This is not timely information and is produced four or five months after the year end.  If the bank is quoted on a stock exchange it will, at a minimum, have a preliminary announcement of its results.  This might be a month or two ahead of the publication of its annual financial statements but about two to three months after the end of its financial year.  If a bank is listed on a stock exchange it might also produce a half yearly report.  If the bank is listed in the United States it might also produce quarterly reports for investors.  Investor reporting is generally not very timely.  There are time-lags between events occurring and the publication of those financial statements.</p> <p> Reporting to a financial regulator is the next type of reporting.  A regulator is almost omnipotent regarding the information it can demand from a regulated entity.  Regulators set up rules which can call for quarterly reporting of large exposures; there will be quarterly reporting of detailed balance sheet information; there will be far more detail than information available to external investors and there might be more frequent reporting concerning matters like liquidity.  There are two universes - one is reporting to external users and the other is reporting to regulators, where the regulator sets the ground rules.</p></speech>

Not being an accountant, and conscious of the people at home, could you confirm that IAS No. 39 is the standard applied in accounting and auditing in Europe?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-25a.263" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Eamonn Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015022500002#R01100"><p>Thank you Senator.  International accounting standards have been around for a very long time.  They started in the 1970s.  A big change occurred in 2005 when the European Union introduced a requirement that if you issue equity to the public you are a listed enterprise and as such you are required to prepare your financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards or IFRS.  I have a copy here with me and as you can see it is a thick volume of accounting standards.  There is one standard within this called international accounting standard No. 39.  This IAS No. 39 deals with financial instruments.  The principal assets and the principal liabilities a bank is likely to have are its financial instruments.  When one speaks about accounting for banks the principal guidance is IAS No. 39.  These rules apply to all enterprises.  A retailer applies the same rules as a bank or an insurance company.  These rules do not have a specific standard which deals with banks, they have a general standard that deals with financial instruments.</p></speech>

It is clear from Professor Walsh's opening statement there were limitations on IAS No. 39 in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-25a.265" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Eamonn Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015022500002#R01300"><p>The rule IAS No. 39 says that one should not book an impairment until one has objective evidence of an actual loss.  There is, however, nothing to prevent a financial institution from saying it has losses coming down the road, and in the interests of presenting a true and fair view to its shareholders, it might make an additional allowance for those expected losses.   It would not conform with international accounting standards but it could be something a financial institution could do - Anglo Irish Bank did so in 2008.  In its annual financial report Anglo Irish Bank put in an additional provision of &euro;0.5 billion.  There is nothing to prevent a bank putting in an additional provision, albeit being against the rules.  There is a big body of rules and if one goes against the rules people will ask what it is that is being tried here.</p> <p> Alternatively, one could have a disclosure which says the impairments are low, the profits are high, and loans have been made which could go bad quite quickly.  A disclosure could be made to investors which states that loans may get into difficulty despite the fact they are not reflected in the balance sheet or the income statement.</p></speech>

There is a post-change to these rules, largely as a result of the financial crisis.  I believe that from 2017 or 2018 the banks will be required to record impairments using expected credit losses.  This will involve making an estimate of expected losses so that greater impairment can be recognised earlier in the cycle.  When one makes loans, one does not expect to make huge losses.</p><p>It is only as the cycle progresses that it becomes apparent that one has some borrowers who cannot or will not repay their loans.</p></speech>

There was a standard up until 2007 known as IAS 30, which dealt with bank disclosures in a general sense about concentrations, but largely the guidance was so woolly that I do not believe one could find anybody who was not in compliance with the standard.  In other words, what some regulators did, for example, in New Zealand, was put in additional interpretations of what they had said banks should be disclosing under IAS 30, but in the absence of such additional guidance, it is fair to say there was no requirement to make extensive disclosures.  Nevertheless, there is absolutely nothing to prevent any financial institution from engaging in additional disclosure.  As a financial institution is not required not to disclose, a bank could have engaged in significant additional disclosure and a financial regulator could have given guidance to a bank that additional disclosures should be made in the published financial statements.</p></speech>

Rather than quote every word, it spoke about rapid loan growth, concentrations emerging, aggressive lending and so on, as it stated and the record would show.  In Professor Walsh's view, were such features understood adequately by the Irish authorities, including the Central Bank and the regulator, during the pre-crisis period?</p></speech>

I largely think this is an empirical matter, that is, to ask them whether they knew about these risks.  If so, what did they do about them?  Did they know about the risks and do nothing or, alternatively and quite possibly, did they not know about them?  It is quite possible that, given the way information was being reported and making its way through channels, they were not fully aware of the nature of these risks.</p></speech>

In Professor Walsh's statement he described the growth and the change in the composition of loan portfolios at the aggregate level in the Irish banking system as being the seismic shift that occurred between 2002 and 2007.  He also stated: "The risks associated with increased commercial lending are well known and have been well known for many years."  Given that such lending had been recognised for some time as an important risk factor in banking crises, was the accumulation of such risk disclosed in periodic reporting by individual banks during the period 2002 to 2007?  If so, what is Professor Walsh's assessment of the disclosures?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-25a.278" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Eamonn Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015022500002#S01100"><p>Again, I had a very short period of time in which to prepare my statement for today.  These financial statements date back to about seven or eight years ago.  Unfortunately, it would be quite difficult for me at this stage to recall specific reporting practices.  If I were to say in general, one of the difficulties is that, in the absence of disclosure, it means that one just reports a number like that for loans and receivables.  We have loans and receivables of &euro;50 billion and that is all of the information one receives in the annual report.  It would clearly be very helpful if one said, "We have &euro;50 billion of loans and receivables, &euro;48 billion of which is speculative development lending."  To an investor, if he or she were to receive that information, he or she would immediately know that this was quite a risky loan book and chances were that the income might not persist in the future for this particular financial institution.</p> <p>  Post-2007, disclosures were made.  One of the problems with international financial reporting standards more generally is that they are designed for general purpose use.  It means that the requirements for credit disclosures are not very well specified or articulated; the Senator can imagine, therefore, how disclosure could be quite difficult.  Let us consider examples.  Suppose a bank lends money to a retailer and that retailer is going to use the proceeds of the loan to purchase some development land, seeks rezoning of that land and then extends the retail store onto that land if the rezoning is successful.  The question is: is that a loan to a retailer or is it a loan for speculative property development?  One of the difficulties with the disclosures is that it is possible that somebody might look at this in the cold light of day and make a determination that this was a loan to a retailer rather than a loan for speculative property development.  One of the difficulties with disclosure is that the absence of specific guidance means that it is possible that in that situation, there would be some judgment involved in determining whether it was a retail loan or a speculative development loan.</p></speech>

If that were the case, would there be any reporting obligation on auditors to regulators if, for example, an investment was seen to be particularly large, on the one hand, or, on the other, for a particularly short period of time?</p></speech>

The accounting rules - they are very specific rules - are called offset rules.  In other words, one could construct a transaction whereby offset rules under international accounting standards would forbid one from offsetting these two amounts.</p></speech>

It has actually issued additional guidance to banks in terms of their disclosures on their loan books, in particular disclosures on impairments.  If we were to look at the financial statements of the larger banks in Ireland today, we would find that there were much more copious disclosures of impairments, of loans past due and so on and it would be much easier for an informed user to make a sensible judgment on what was going on with a loan book at a point in time.  I think that, largely, the difficulty is that international accounting standards are aimed at all enterprises.</p><p>One needs some sort of regulatory overlay, or some other overlay, which requires them to disclose more information, in a sensible manner, to investors.</p></speech>

I referred earlier to the idea that the focus on loan impairment accounting may be a bit of a diversion.  What has happened, and this frequently happens after a crisis, is that people are looking for somebody or something to blame and loan impairment accounting has been identified as something that was wrong.  There has been a huge effort by international accounting standards setters, since 2008, to devise a new set of loan impairment rules.  Everybody then thinks that if we solve the impairment rules, we will prevent bad things happening in the future but I am not convinced by that argument.</p></speech>

Generally, one will have quite low loan reserves.  For example, the Nyberg report makes mention of the Spanish authorities which required a particular form of provisioning.  They said that they were not interested in the international financial reporting standards but wanted their banks to provide for loans in a particular way.</p></speech>

In 2006 the loan to value ratios for domestic mortgages were changed by the Financial Regulator, with an additional capital penalty for lenders if they issued a mortgage that had a loan to value ratio in excess of 80%.  In the regulator's report on this, one of the reasons given for doing it was international financial reporting standards.  In other words, because it knows that impairments were not being recorded in a timely way, it puts in an additional capital requirement for these particular riskier residential mortgages.</p></speech>

Let us take a hypothetical bank that is really bad.  There is no way it would want to tell everybody that it had a really bad loan book.  There are no incentives for a bank with a bad or risky loan book to disclose that fact.  If anything, the incentives that operate are such that it might try to convey the impression that the loan book is a lot less risky than it really is because that will lower the cost of funds and make the bank more profitable.  In that sense, an intervention is required which demands additional disclosure.</p></speech>

The former would happen, largely, at a very late stage.  It is probably fair to say that in terms of audits for external users, any signals from the auditor's report published by a bank is going to come late in the day.  That occurred for the British banks, the Irish banks and indeed, right across the banking sector.  The audit report is something that comes late in the day and it is really only when the ship is sinking and has probably hit the bottom of the seabed that it suddenly becomes apparent that the audit report is flagging something.</p></speech>

Is that unusual?</p></speech>

My reading from Nyberg was very much that quarterly statements were going to the regulator, so the regulator was receiving this information anyhow.  The auditors were probably assuming that the regulator was receiving this information.  They would have seen the reports that were issued by the bank to the regulator - one would imagine - and would assume that it was largely known that these limits had been breached.  The Nyberg report is very helpful in this regard with its diagram illustrating how much of the lending was taking place outside of these limits versus how much was within the limits.  That diagram is very useful in showing the extent to which there seemed to be an absence of control with respect to those limits.</p></speech>

We can imagine how the process might work, but we are speculating here.  It might be the case that there is some sort of standardised Excel spreadsheet issued to every bank to be filled in and returned to the regulator.  The main challenge with the design of such a spreadsheet is the captions that are used, for example, whether something is a retail loan or a speculative development loan.  The captions used will colour the information that goes through.</p> <p>  The second issue is sectoral lending exposures or large exposures to individual lenders.  One would anticipate that this would be reported up through the system.  What could happen that would mean that it was not reported up?  First, the guidance issued for filling in the spreadsheet might not be sufficiently detailed to make clear what must go into every box in the spreadsheet.  Alternatively, the spreadsheet might not have had enough places to put in extremely risky lending.</p><p> There is a final consideration.  I am not suggesting this occurred in Irish banking but we know from other jurisdictions, that one might structure information in such a way that it comes out in a certain way in reports.  In other words, let us consider a big loan as a big chunk of salami and find a way to slice the salami so that it might not be apparent when looking at aggregate reports.  Equally, one can think further back the food chain and if I was someone borrowing money from a bank, I might seek to structure a large loan in a way that might make it easier for the bank to slice salami later on.  I am not suggesting that has occurred in an Irish setting but there are other cases, like BCCI, that are very informative if one looks at the auditing processes that went on in banks.  It is an awful example of how information was making its way through the system.</p></speech>

There is a different regulatory environment and a different financial reporting environment.  Comparisons between the US and Europe are difficult to make given our different environments.  It is difficult to establish what might be transparent reporting and what the bank should be reporting.  One would like to see good disclosure about the risks financial institutions have.  The international Financial Stability Board has issued extensive guidance on the types of disclosures banks should make.  This considers credit risk and involves extensive disclosure.</p> <p>  The second issue is the roll-up of interest.  This is not apparent under international accounting standards.  Under US accounting rules, there are various regulatory overlays to help us to establish how much cash interest a financial institution is receiving.  Australia, which uses the international financial reporting standards, requires banks in Australia to tell the amount of cash interest they have received.  It is quite possible to take international accounting rules and use it to basically insist the rules are applied in a particular way that involves disclosure of cash interest received.  That would be very helpful in dealing with the interest roll-up issue.  It gives users an immediate indication of what is being rolled up and the risky loans in it.</p> <p>  Outside of international accounting standards, one area where this is quite transparent is in Russian banking.  The Russian banking regulator has a requirement that people say what is the amount of cash interest being received.  I see that as being key.</p></speech>

If one were to look back and think that the risks were primarily the residential mortgage book then we would specify stress tests that say that if residential property prices change by a certain amount, we can ask what will happen to bank profitability.  However, if it turns out that, instead of being primarily a residential property book, it is also a significant commercial book with significant speculative lending and significant concentration to individual borrowers, the way we would conduct stress tests and the kinds of stresses we would like to impose on the model would be entirely different.  The perception of risk is important in terms of determining how we ultimately conduct the stress test.</p></speech>

The accounting is then done in such a way that we must wait for an impairment to occur which means it is not reflected on the balance sheet.</p> <p>  There are other disclosures.  For example, the fair value of the loans.  Currently,  banks have a footnote where they disclose the fair value of those loans, namely, the price they believe that an unrelated third party would pay for those assets in an arm's length transaction.</p></speech>

The professor did not speak about impairment provisions but that at the level of the individual loan, one must make a judgment as to whether an impairment should be booked against that loan.  Is that how it works or it is more general?</p></speech>

I have glossed over a lot of the technical detail with respect to these impairments but I would be delighted to go through that technical detail.</p> <p>  Basically, impairment assessment could occur in a number of ways.  First, there is the level of individual loans.  Second, one might look at groups of loans.  That would be the case if one considered something like a mortgage book where it would probably be very challenging to go through each and every mortgage and assess it individually for impairment.  One would be essentially engaged in a group assessment of impairment for those loans.  One can view it that we could look at loans in groups and then individual assessments of loans.  There are detailed rules with respect to how one conducts that assessment.</p></speech>

What does true and fair mean?</p></speech>

When I hear the term "true and fair" I think of the City of London in 1750 where everybody knows everybody else, my word is my bond and we engage in true and fair reporting.  As I would understand it now, largely the term "true and fair" has become synonymous with reflecting international financial reporting standards.  It is a legacy term that is used in Britain and Ireland, the idea of a true and a fair view, but it has largely been superseded by detailed accounting standards, which we did not have 50 years ago.  The notion that somehow, there is a principle of the true and fair view that would guide one on the right way to account for a particular transaction becomes largely redundant when there are many rules governing guidance, as there are today.  If the Chairman is interested, there is a legal opinion that was prepared about a year ago which explains how a true and fair view should be interpreted under UK law.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-25a.348" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/966" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015022500002#V01800"><p>The Chairman has stolen my true and fair question.  In light of that question, I wish to ask a general one.  Does Professor Walsh think that in the run-up to the crisis, the audits of the banks in Ireland served the true and fair purpose for which they were intended?  What purpose did they serve?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-25a.349" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Eamonn Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015022500002#V01900"><p>The first thing they did was to say that financial statements should be prepared in accordance with this set of rules.  That is probably not such a bad thing.  In the absence of such a set of rules, and in the absence of somebody making sure that a financial institution had applied those rules correctly, one would have very little confidence in the reported financial information of a bank.  It is a third party assurance that the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with a set of rules.</p> <p>  Let me outline the second aspect.  I guess people are quite down on auditors and take the view that companies spend a fortune on audits but do not seem to get anything in return.  One has to consider the counter-factual.  If there were no audits then one would create a Wild West situation.  That means one could create an asset on one's books and there would be no external attempt to verify that the asset existed.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-25a.350" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/966" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015022500002#V02000"><p>I understand what Professor Walsh has said.  Other witnesses have used the term "Wild West" a lot to describe the banking sector in the run-up to the collapse.  A lot of commentators have made the point that the audit process did not reveal, satisfactorily at least, the difficulties that existed in the balance sheets of Irish banks.  Did a Wild West situation exist?  I do not want to ask a leading question or I shall be accused of doing so.  Even with external auditing, and I do not suggest that there should not be external auditing, did a Wild West situation not exist in the run-up to the crisis?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-25a.351" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Eamonn Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015022500002#V02100"><p>I shall turn the question on its head.  It is easy for people to have expectations in terms of what they believe an audit should deliver.  It would be true to say, and it is not just in Ireland but across the world, that audits are quite limited in their scope.  Audits indicate first, that financial statements have been prepared in accordance with rules and, second, that there is evidence these loans exist and so on.  It is important to have a relatively low expectation of what an audit is meant to be delivering and then to look for other mechanisms that would blow the whistle on things such as a financial regulator.</p></speech>

Is there not a contradiction at the heart of the traditional appointment of auditors by financial institutions as well as other companies?  I do not want to ask a leading question.  Is there not a contradiction in the sense that if one is a commercial bank and choosing one's own external auditors, does that not, potentially at least, lead to a contradiction in what the audit hopes to achieve, and in terms of the true and fair test that we mentioned?</p></speech>

The latter reflect the possibility that there could be a conflict.  I refer to circumstances where one is getting, on inspection, a clean bill of health but one is paying the cheque for that clean bill of health.  The question is whether the auditor can be truly independent if one is paying for the clean bill of health rather than perhaps a third party doing so.  The same could be said of credit rating organisations as well.  It then comes down to the individual rules relating to ethical conduct by auditors and so on which kick in to ensure auditor independence.</p></speech>

Is he of the view that it might be necessary that the auditors of financial institutions should change regularly and that the same firm should not be responsible for auditing a particular institution's books for a protracted period?</p></speech>

Auditor rotation is an issue the EU is addressing at present.  There is a notion that it might be unhealthy for a company to have the same auditor for 120 years and that perhaps some rotation might be in order.  The more subtle point is whether there is partner rotation.  In other words, we are basically down to four audit firms that are capable of conducting an audit of a large bank.  I am not really being fair in this regard because there are a number of other mid-sized firms which could assist with or carry out such a process.  Ultimately, investors looking at a large bank that is not audited by a big four firm would be concerned about the audit.</p></speech>

Clearly, however, one would like to ensure that an individual audit firm was not entirely dependent on a single client.  This again brings us back to the big four.  Outside investors or lenders to a bank would generally expect a big four audit, simply because that danger of having a smaller audit firm dependent on a single customer would clearly be incredibly unhealthy.</p></speech>

That was because I had not looked at it in a long time.  Unfortunately, I was not able to find it on the Internet but late yesterday evening I did obtain a copy of a small part of it that deals with Anglo.  As I understand it, there were three phases to PwC's analysis, namely, a phase that was undertaken in mid-September 2008 - a report relating to which was submitted later that month - a second phase in November and a third in December.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

One gets a certain sense about the concentration of risk when one reads the first one.  With the next one, it is a case of "Oh my goodness, there are 20 large borrowers and there seems to be quite a bit of exposure to development lending in very concentrated areas of north and south Dublin".  With the third phase, it was "We'll have a look at the next 50 borrowers and guess what?  It seems they also borrowed money in much the same areas of north and south Dublin".  As I read through the report, I felt that in September these concentrations did not appear quite as bad as when we get to phase 3 of the report.  That is how I read it.</p> <p>  The other thing that jumped out at me relates to the sort of concentrations outlined.  PwC lists the 20 largest concentrations in the UK, the US and Ireland in its report.  As I looked at it, the question I would have felt remained unanswered relates to whether there was an overlap between all of those concentrations.  In other words, that there was a super-concentration involved.</p></speech>

I stand open to correction but I am of the view that there was a change between phase 1 to phase 2.  Paragraphs 4.8.4 and 4.8.8 of the Nyberg report deal quite well with this matter.  Paragraph 4.8.4 states:<blockquote><br /><br />The outcome of the initial PwC assessment was generally viewed by the Authorities as reasonably benign.  In early November a joint letter was sent by the CB and the FR to the Minister for Finance which included assurances as to the solvency of the covered institutions on the date of the Guarantee as well as their future solvency through to 2011.</blockquote>While paragraph 4.8.8 states:<blockquote>Notwithstanding the benign view generally taken by the Authorities of the PwC initial assessment it has been argued &ndash; correctly, in the Commission&rsquo;s view &ndash; that the nature, scale and concentration of the exposures now listed should have aroused more heightened and widespread concerns that institutions were likely to face solvency difficulties.</blockquote></p></speech>

Just above that Professor Walsh quotes the United States Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation which documents the life cycle of a bank failure.  It says:<blockquote><br /><br />In the first stage there is rapid loan growth, loan concentrations emerge and lending is aggressive, internal controls in the growth areas are weak and underwriting standards are lenient.  Management usually points to the excellent earnings and contributions to capital that the growth has provided.</blockquote>If the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in the United States in 1997 can outline the life cycle of a bank failure, if Professor Black and other witnesses come in here and rehearse more or less the same scenario, and if those features were manifestly present in Ireland prior to the crash, how can accounting reports in Ireland imply that there was no problem, as indicated by what Professor Walsh has said, that the belief was based upon accounting reports, particularly income statements and balance sheets?</p></speech>

The accounting rules say a bank goes out and lends money to a customer and it earns interest from that customer.  In Ireland between 2002 and 2007 banks expanded their loan books very dramatically.  In the early years of issuing a loan to somebody, in general one would expect that nothing is likely to go wrong with that loan, so early in the boom when everything is going up there is very little objective evidence that anything might be going wrong with these loans.</p></speech>

Given what Professor Walsh has just shown us, the obscuring was certainly not due to a shortage of space, so might that as well be a mystery novel, or were accounting standards framed in such a way as to deliberately obscure the real situation?</p></speech>

They have the same set of accounting standards for a retailer, a bank or a manufacturer.  The challenge is that banking is a different business to retailing or manufacturing.  There is not a specific standard that deals with accounting for banks.  As a result we get these unusual settings and the one I would worry most about is accrual of interest.  A bank can make a loan to somebody and it can agree with that person that he or she does not need to pay any interest for five years.  During the life of that loan, for five years, the bank can book interest every month as if it had received cash from the customer.  It will then be able to say that the loan is continuing to perform because cash is being received from the customer.</p></speech>

The way I would have addressed it would have been to emphasise the notion of an informed user of bank financial statements.  An informed user of bank financial statements would understand that these rules exist and therefore would know that during the up cycle the amount of profits is overstated and during the down cycle the amount of profits may be understated.  I think the most helpful way I can respond is to say that there is this bundle of rules there and as a result of this bundle of rules, to simply say that profit went up 10% is probably not such a good idea.  Instead one has to understand why profits went up by 10% and to what extent the increase was driven by particular twists in these rules with respect to accounting measurement.</p></speech>

The chief executive of NAMA, the National Asset Management Agency, Mr. Brendan McDonagh, said in 2010:<blockquote><br /><br />[NAMA&rsquo;s] our own detailed due diligence on a loan by loan examination has revealed a troubling picture of poor loan documentation, of assets not properly legally secured and of inadequate stress-testing of borrowers and loans - all born of a mindless scramble to funnel lending into one sector at considerable pace and of a reckless abandonment of basic principles of credit risk and prudent lending.</blockquote>The Minister for Finance informed me in reply to a parliamentary question that, as a result of this poor loan documentation, NAMA paid &euro;477 million less on the &euro;32 billion it paid.  Would an auditor be expected to pick up on some of these issues and report them?</p></speech>

In my written statement, I listed what one would be expected under US audit guidance to establish with respect to looking at a loan book.  The interesting question is to take some examples that NAMA has referred to and step back to see what happened to these particular loans and their documentation in the process.  Were they subject to audit?</p></speech>

We know NAMA paid just shy of &euro;32 billion for these loans.  We know &euro;477 million of a write-down was given to NAMA, a large portion of &euro;32 billion, as a result of poor documentation.  Is this something an auditor is supposed to pick up?  Should an auditor have picked up that &euro;1 out of every &euro;60 of the loans transferred to NAMA had poor loan documentation and their security was not enforceable?  Alternatively, is it the case, as Professor Walsh said, that an auditor is guided by the provisions and if they did not expect them to do this, then they did not have to do it?</p></speech>

I agree with the Deputy that there appears to be a disconnect between what was being reported as the amount of loans a bank had and what we know subsequently happened with NAMA where it would appear security was not perfected on these loans and, perhaps, there was a belief there were guarantees but they were inadequate.  It is also possible that unanticipated events occurred.  This is an excellent line of inquiry.  In shedding light on what occurred, it would be a far more interesting line of inquiry than worrying about impairment accounting.</p></speech>

The International Accounting Standards Board is a stand-alone not-for-profit foundation.  It issues rules and goes through due process.  For example, with respect to loan impairments, it issued a proposal in 2008 I believe it was, and would have issued another proposal having obtained feedback from the banking community.  All the feedback is on the public record.  It then sought to work with the US authorities to change the rules.  It goes through extensive due process but it is a largely independent body and lobbying would not work.  That is not part of its cashflow, so to speak.</p></speech>

That essentially means that now we have interest coming in on those mortgages.  Our interest goes up.  We will pay some money out from funds we have managed to get to support those mortgages, which hopefully we receive quite cheaply.  Our overheads are probably much the same as they would otherwise be, which means our profit shoots up as a result of expanding the loan book.  However, we all know that some of those mortgages will not turn out as anticipated.  It is only later in the cycle that will be reflected in the financial statements.  As a result, profits will inevitably be high because in the early years a loan generally performs.</p></speech>

Would they be obliged to tell the Central Bank they had done that or would the Central Bank have discovered it from their accounts?</p></speech>

The old rules had something for expected provisions for losses, the new rules did not.  There was a small change for the large banks, probably approximately &euro;100 million in the provisions as a result of this.  This would have been entirely transparent to the users of financial statements.  It would also have been entirely transparent to the Financial Regulator and the Financial Regulator adjusted capital requirements for loan to value, for home mortgages and stated part of its reason for doing so was these new rules.  The whole process was completely transparent.</p></speech>

I want to get his view of several aspects of it.  There is a chapter heading for external auditors, section 3.4, Auditing Irish Banks.  It covers sectoral concentration limits, prudential sector lending limits of 20% of a bank&rsquo;s own funds for one sector, and 250% of a sector, subject to a common predominant risk factor.  The Honohan report states:<blockquote><br /><br />Rules of this kind were actually in effect, but not enforced. Specifically, there was a long-standing ceiling (200 per cent of own funds) which was supposed to be applied to loans to any one economic sector (various classes of property loan were treated as different sectors, so the overall property ceiling was higher). This requirement seems to have become a bit of a dead letter, [Professor Honohan mentioned that in his engagement with us.] with violations being noted but not acted upon. Albeit old-fashioned, this kind of rule would, if enforced, have been quite effective in slowing the bubble.</blockquote>These were rules for auditors going into banks to see how the sectoral concentration limits were operated.</p><p>How was it that the external auditors were not applying the recommendation or guideline indicated to them quite specifically in the Central Bank bulletin in 1995?</p></speech>

Certainly how I would understand it is that largely it appeared that there were these limits in place but they were being ignored by the regulator.  In other words, the quarterly reports that would go to the regulator or whatever would make it clear that there had been breaches of these limits, that auditors were basically seeing what was going to the regulator and Nyberg concludes that even if they had reported these things to the regulator, the regulator would not have done very much about it.  My feeling is largely that the difficulty is not an audit one <i>per se</i>, given the audit communications with the regulator and the regulator potentially knew, rather it is more a case that these prudential limits would have made tremendous sense, had they been adhered to we would be in much better shape today than we are and the question is why those limits were not adhered to by the regulator.</p></speech>

I would say the same if we move over to disclosures of individual exposures where clearly there were large individual exposures.  When we look at the PwC report referred to, this becomes a super concentration of risk among individuals and with particular types of real estate lending.</p></speech>

It would be very easy to slice up something or characterise a transaction in a particular way to navigate around such specific rules.

This book is called <i>Principles Based Accounting</i>.  The equivalent US rules would be about five times the size of this book.  The US rules are much more specific and would have much more detailed requirements about disclosures of concentrations of credit risk in published financial statements and much more detailed disclosure about what listed entities should do.  International accounting standards do not have that level of detailed requirement and then the opportunities for creating particular impressions for being able to slice up a transaction in particular ways, for example, to say that part of it was a UK exposure and part of it was an Irish exposure and, particularly, given Northern Ireland it would allow one to represent things as if concentrations were a lot less than it appeared.</p></speech>

The joint committee last considered the higher and further education grant system in 2013, following the establishment of SUSI.  Major concerns arose then but they appear to have been largely resolved at this stage.  There was a lot of work done and engagement by the committee, on a cross-party basis, with SUSI to get some of the issues our constituents faced at the time dealt with.  In the meantime, a lot of work has been done to improve the system, which SUSI now operates.</p> <p>  Some issues have been raised with us, as public representatives, and that is why we decided to arrange a meeting to discuss the matter.  Deputy Jim Daly, in particular, sought this meeting to discuss the matter, in particular the operation of the approach to income assessment that is used for grant applications and how that affects applicants.  The matter has given rise to concerns being expressed by members who have been contacted by their constituents.</p> <p>  To discuss this matter with the joint committee I welcome from the Department of Education and Skills, Mr. Brian Power and Ms Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Gorman, and from SUSI we have Mr. Seamus De Faoite and Mr. Graham Doyle.</p> <p>  We also invited the Student Grants Appeals Board.  However, the chair of the board has responded stating that the board, which is part-time in nature, is convened at regular intervals to consider appeals.  The role of the board is to examine appeals to determine whether the terms and conditions of the scheme, and associated statutory instruments, are applied correctly.  It is not open to the appeals board to depart from the terms and conditions of the grants scheme, regardless of the applicant's individual or personal circumstances.  The board regrets that it is not in a position to attend the meeting today but has provided a written submission.  The submission has been circulated to members and is on their database as well.  </p> <p>  To commence our discussion I invite Mr. Power to make his presentation on behalf  of the Department of Education and Skills.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-25a.474" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Power" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015022500002#B00600"><p>I can give a briefer version, beginning with the statutory student grant scheme, which is germane to where we are.  The Student Support Act 2011 is the legal basis that allows the Minister, with the agreement of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the power to prescribe a scheme of grants.  The unified single scheme first came into operation in 2011 and the eligibility criteria for student grants including income thresholds, are reviewed annually and must be approved by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Any changes in respect of rates of grant, income thresholds or significant cost measures are announced as part of the budget.</p> <p>  More than 110,000 applications for student grants are received by awarding authorities each year, approximately 65,000 of which are new applications, with the balance being renewals applications for continuing students.  In line with the transition arrangements from local authorities and VECs to the new centralised grant awarding authority, SUSI received in excess of 103,500 of these applications, approximately 94%.</p> <p>  In terms of the numbers involved, the State provides funds for the demand-led student grant scheme, which totalled &euro;345 million in 2014.  Since 2008, the numbers of qualifying students has increased by 42% to 81,600 grant holders in the current academic year.  The budget for the same period has increased to &euro;345 million.  The vast majority of grant holders are undergraduate students, at 86.5%.  A further 10.7% are post-leaving certificate students, with the remaining 2.8% being postgraduate students.  Some 90.4% of maintenance grant holders receive an award at the rate of 100%, compared with only 3.68% of those awarded maintenance receiving the 25% rate.  More than 19,000 students, 25%, qualified for the special rate of grant at the higher rate.</p> <p>  Regarding eligibility criteria, the student grant scheme plays a fundamental role in supporting families who are putting their children through further and higher education.  The majority of students continue to be supported by their parents through the course of their third level studies.  This may be financially, through continuing to live in the family home, or by providing support in a number of other ways.  The purpose of the student grant scheme is to provide additional assistance where parental income, or capacity to provide support, is below a certain threshold.</p> <p>  The eligibility criteria for student grants, including the income thresholds, is reviewed annually.  The student grant scheme recognises the particular pressures on larger families by providing for higher income thresholds for such families.  Further increases in the income thresholds are provided for where additional family members are attending further and higher education at the same time.</p> <p>  A special rate of maintenance grant was introduced in 2001, recognising the additional needs of welfare dependent families in supporting students through college.  The target group of those most in need was defined in terms of the dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, where the necessary conditions are fulfilled.</p> <p>  Income thresholds are necessary to ensure that grant support is properly targeted towards those who are most in need.  The reckonable income limits for the standard rates of student grant generally follow the percentage increases in average industrial earnings as provided by the Central Statistics Office.  This is provided on an annual basis and analysed.  Any change to the income thresholds are subject to the approval of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>  The reality of any programme of support that includes a process of assessment of financial means is that the defined income limits will invariably result in a proportion of applicants exceeding the specified thresholds, in some cases by small margins.  The 2003 report, Supporting Equity in Higher Education, recommended introducing extra gradations to the student grant scheme.  At the time, there was a 100% rate and a 50% rate.  To increase equity in the scheme and to address threshold issues, 75% and 25% rates were introduced from the academic year 2003 to 2004.</p> <p>  Student grant applications are means tested on gross income from all sources earned inside and outside the State within a specified reference period.  The assessment of income from the same starting point is considered to be fair and reasonable because this approach eliminates any distortion that might arise from different spending decisions in households.  The means test arrangements for the student grant scheme are applied nationally.  In all cases, gross income is assessed with certain specified social welfare and HSE payments excluded from income.</p> <p>  In the assessment for the special rate, the amounts taken into account are the basic weekly payment amount of the relevant social protection payment and any qualified adult allowance, where applicable.  Any allowance included in these payments in respect of child dependants is excluded when the calculation of reckonable income is made for the special rate.</p> <p>  Significant progress has been made on increasing participation in higher education by most socio-economic groups.  However, some socio-economic groups continue to be under-represented in higher education.  There are also areas where participation rates are considerably below the norm, particularly in some of the large urban areas.  Priority needs to be continued to support students from the most disadvantaged backgrounds, especially those from families fully dependent on income support from the State.  The principal support is the student grant scheme, and other targeted access supports include the student assistance fund, the fund for students with disabilities, and institutional funding for access made available through the Higher Education Authority.</p><p>There has been a consistent demand for increases in these resources in recent years.</p><p> In the context of making progress towards the system-wide objectives for equity of access for groups under-represented in higher education, the availability of new data resources arising from the centralised system will provide much greater detail on grant applicants, grant holders and the numbers and types of grants they receive.  This will inform policy on the future direction of the student grant scheme as a key measure to increase participation of students in higher education, particularly for students who are still not making the transition to higher education.</p></speech>

I will outline SUSI's principal objectives and some of the improvements that have been made since we were established.</p> <p> Our principal objectives are the delivery of a fully online grant application system for students; an integrated student helpdesk and document management  services; a centralised assessment unit with automated processing systems to support consistency in the application of the student grant scheme and regulations; electronic payment of awarded grants to students and colleges; and cost minimisation through administrative efficiencies.  To deliver on these objectives, we have made many improvements to our processes and procedures.  Continual refinement of the online application process and the introduction of new services have made the grants system more accessible to students, while improved internal procedures and flexible staffing arrangements have streamlined and speeded up the assessment process to ensure that decisions can be given as early as possible.  In particular, the introduction of direct data sharing with Departments and other agencies has significantly reduced the volumes of documents requested from students.  Automated procedures have been implemented with colleges to confirm that students have been registered and can receive their grants quickly by electronic transfer.  There are also efficiencies for more than 400 schools and colleges in dealing with SUSI as a single agency.</p> <p>  SUSI plays an important role in the provision of clear information for students regarding grant eligibility and the application process.  The SUSI website provides a single point of information and we are represented at many college open days and national and regional career events.  Our communications unit works closely with stakeholder groups, including student unions, parents, guidance counsellors and citizens&rsquo; information services, to ensure that information about student grants is widely available and accessible to all.  Our online information services include a grant eligibility reckoner that is quick and easy to use and provides a useful starting point for those considering applying for a grant.  In the particular context of today&rsquo;s discussion, the functionality of the eligibility reckoner will be extended this year to provide an indication of eligibility based on a more detailed breakdown of income.  Existing applicants can also follow the progress of their applications through a tracker in their SUSI account, and awarded students can view their scheduled grant payment dates and amounts.  SUSI provides a comprehensive helpdesk service by telephone, e-mail and social media, as well as a service through which Oireachtas Members can make enquiries on behalf of grant applicants.</p> <p>  As reflected in our formal title of Student Universal Support Ireland, we seek to support students in gaining access to further and higher education by providing financial assistance in accordance with the provisions of the student grant scheme.  The assessment of income is one of a number of eligibility criteria we are required to consider under the student grant scheme.  As Mr. Power has already outlined, the criteria, I do not propose rehearse them, but if members have any questions, I would be happy to address them.</p> <p>  For the purpose of considering whose income is taken into account for assessment, students are classified as either dependent applicants or independent applicants.  Dependent applicants are assessed based on their own income and the income of their parents or legal guardians, whereas independent applicants are assessed based on their own income and the income of their spouse, cohabitant or civil partner.  Income from all sources in respect of all relevant parties to a grant application is assessed to determine grant eligibility.</p> <p>  SUSI can verify details of income under data sharing arrangements implemented with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection through what we call our social welfare feed.  This has led to significant reductions in the burden of documentary evidence for students and in the number of requests for additional information, thus leading to a more efficient processing of applications.</p> <p>  The scheme also provides that certain types of income can be disregarded or deducted to arrive at what is referred to in the legislation as reckonable income.  These include a range of social welfare payments, Revenue-approved employment related expenses, holiday earnings, maintenance payments, pension contributions and non-recurring overtime.  Following the application of any disregards or deductions, the assessed reckonable income is then measured against the prescribed income limits or thresholds set out in the scheme to determine the appropriate grant entitlement of the applicant.  These thresholds may be increased in respect of dependent children and other relevant persons in full-time education.  In addition, where the resulting assessed reckonable income is marginally in excess of a threshold limit, we will write to the student to request any other relevant information that may have a positive impact on the outcome of the application.  If we are close to the threshold, we will always go back to the student.  For example, we might try to take account of holiday earnings.</p> <p>  All income is assessed on a preceding year basis, that is, for the calendar year prior to the year of entry to college in respect of which the grant application is made.  This is known as the reference period.  However, the scheme also takes account of the possibility that a change in income following the reference period and up to the end of the academic year may have a significant bearing on the financial circumstances of the applicant.  This is known as a change of circumstances and it allows income to be assessed on a current year basis.  We provide an internal review mechanism whereby applicants can seek to have their grant application decision re-examined for the purpose of considering any change of circumstances or in respect of the assessed distance from home to college for the purpose of a maintenance grant.</p> <p>  Students who are not awarded a grant or who believe they may be entitled to a higher rate of grant may make a formal appeal to the appeals officer, who decides whether the application should be re-assessed by SUSI.  In re-assessing applications on appeal, SUSI carries out a full re-examination of the application to identify whether there are any grounds, including on the basis of new information or change of circumstances, by which the original outcome can be improved.  As I have already outlined in regard to the assessment of income both generally and in marginal cases, our approaches in providing the opportunity for internal review and in reviewing applications on appeal reflects an ethos of inclusion rather than exclusion which is central to our practice in the administration of the grant scheme.</p> <p>  I would be delighted to answer any questions members may have.  We are currently preparing to open for our fourth year of grant application processing.  We have received approximately 250,000 applications to date.  The annual number of applications has increased 70,000 in year one to an expected 115,000 applications in year four.  We will be opening for applications in mid-April 2015, which is earlier than in previous years.</p><p>In our first three years of operation we awarded 170,000 grants.   With these improvements, we have increased our throughput of grant applications, not only meeting but exceeding our performance targets under a management framework implemented with the Department of Education and Skills.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-25a.481" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1154" speakername="Averil Power" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015022500002#D00200"><p>I commend SUSI, Student Universal Support Ireland, for the fact that the applications process is much better.  I know that there were teething problems in the first year, but most of the complaints I now receive are about the criteria to be applied under the scheme.  We have, therefore, come a long way.  Mr. Brian Power stated: "The assessment of income from the same starting point [gross income] is considered to be fair and reasonable because this approach eliminates any distortion which might arise from different spending decisions in different households."  That is arguable because, at same time, it takes no account of different costs of living.  Obviously, the income limits are far more generous for somebody living outside Dublin than they are for those in the capital, with no account taken of mortgage payments and so forth.  The Department is treating families the same when disposable incomes are very different.  The Government had initially indicated that it would review the means test.  Like everyone else in the education sector, I have read John Walsh&rsquo;s book and I am aware of the political reality as to why it was not done.  A political decision was made not to look at the means test.  Has this been parked at a policy level?  Is the fairness of the means test being reviewed?  A Dublin PAYE worker with a large mortgage might find himself or herself just outside the net, which is particularly unfair on him or her.</p> <p>  How will lone parents be affected when they lose the one-parent family payment?  Previously, they were able to keep the payment and stay in education.  As of 2 July, once a child is over seven years of age, lone parents will lose the one-parent family payment altogether.  What assistance will be available for them?  Will the back to education allowance be their only option?  This is a significant issue and it is a very unfair cut.  I know that the officials cannot comment on it, but I am concerned how lone parents will be dealt with by the education system.  How will we ensure people will not drop out of education and miss the second-chance opportunity they need because of this cut to their income?</p> <p>  As they stand, the requirements for somebody to prove they have been estranged from their parents are very strict.  I understand it is an issue the USI, Union of Students in Ireland, has raised with SUSI and the Department previously and that a commitment was given that it would be examined.  Where stands the Department on this issue?  I appreciate that set criteria are needed, against which applications can be judged.  Sometimes, however, crude criteria can mean that people in difficult circumstances who cannot live at home because of domestic violence, for example, have difficulties in obtaining all of the documentation the Department requires to prove they are eligible for estrangement support.  That can be unfair.  Has the Department examined how other countries deal with this issue to come up with a better system to deal with the matter of estrangement?</p> <p>  The student grants appeals board can and does make recommendations to the Department on changes to the grants scheme.  What changes has it recommended?  Which ones have been accepted and which have not?</p> <p>  I raised the issue of the student assistance fund with the Minister in the Seanad last week.  USI figures show that, by the end of December 2014, many colleges had completely exhausted their allocations for 2014 and 2015.  This means that a student in dire circumstances next month may be faced with dropping out of college for the sake of a few hundred euro for his or her rent.  This fund gives colleges discretion and flexibility to help students in such circumstances, but it is now completely exhausted in many colleges.  Is SUSI looking to increase the allocation in this regard?</p></speech>

I know that strict criteria are needed in this regard but some of the documentary evidence requested is very difficult for people to provide.  Students providing evidence from the Department of Social Protection have been told it is not adequate and that additional evidence is required.  Will the officials comment on this issue?</p> <p>  After SUSI&rsquo;s first year, a report was published on its operation, with several recommendations.  Will the officials confirm that all of these recommendations have been implemented?  If not, which ones are still outstanding?</p> <p>  Recently a proposal was made by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul that SUSI&rsquo;s application process work alongside and on the same timeline as the Central Applications Office&rsquo;s application process.  Obviously, this would have huge advantages.  Has any consideration been given to this?  Would it be a major task to move to such a system?</p> <p>  The appeals process is very long.  I understand one has to review all of the documentation.  However, from the moment an applicant receives a grant refusal, he or she has 30 days in which to appeal.  It is then viewed by an appeals officer, which can take up to 30 days.  If the appeals officer upholds the decision, it can then be appealed to the student grants appeals board within another 30 days.  The appeals board has 60 days in which to adjudicate on the decision.  That comes to a maximum of 150 days, close enough to five months, to process an appeal.  In that period some students would find it very difficult to remain in education and might have to drop out for financial reasons.  I know that 150 days is the maximum period, but are there data for average processing times of appeals?</p> <p>  It is surprising that the appeals board overturns almost 20% of refusals.  Essentially, one in five refusals, initially made by SUSI and upheld by an appeals officer, could be overturned by the appeals board.  That indicates that there is something wrong with the process somewhere along the line.  If the appeals board upholds the decision of the appeals officer, the course of action for a student is to take a High Court case.  I believe this has happened on at least one occasion and the student involved actually won the case.  Will the officials confirm this?  Will they also confirm if any other High Court case has been taken?</p></speech>

Everything was going wrong; documents were constantly being lost and everything was topsy-turvy.  I commend the body for the improvements and strides it has made.  I have not received a complaint about its operations for some time.  There has, therefore, been a vast improvement.</p> <p>  In the event of a student&rsquo;s mother remarrying, is it correct that the step-parent&rsquo;s income is not taken into consideration when assessing a grant application?  Many people are not aware that if they lose their job, they can reapply following a change of circumstances.</p><p>If they do apply under a change of circumstances, however, a late application must be made.  An appeal is submitted, they must wait for the response and then they have to submit a late application.  It is a bit of a waste of time.  Why can SUSI not just take the application and assess it instead of making people go through an appeal process?</p><p> Can the Department give an update on how the HEAR scheme is going?  Has there been a good uptake?  How is it working?  Has it been beneficial to students?  Has there been much feedback on it?</p><p> On the question of reckonable income, it is all very well to say a person has gross income of between &euro;45,000 and &euro;50,000 but what about that person's disposable income?  A working person with that kind of salary might actually end up with less money than an unemployed person or one who works part time, after they have paid tax, PRSI, levies and everything else.  We should move towards looking at people's net income for assessment.  Has the Department considered a loan scheme for students who are not eligible for a third level grant?</p><p> There is a lot of messing around with applications, in particular for the one-parent family where the parent goes back to education.  They are advised to claim the back-to-education allowance and then they find they are not eligible for the maintenance grant.  They have to go back on the one-parent family allowance in order that they can qualify.  We should move towards a situation where the back-to-education allowance qualifies a person for the maintenance grant.</p></speech>

I also thank the Chairman and the secretariat for arranging this meeting.  It is important for us to review the operations of these grants to see if we can make the system better.</p> <p>  I wanted to use this meeting to emphasise the lack of discretion in respect of these applications.  I know that SUSI has to operate within guidelines but while some schemes, such as the medical card scheme, have a very arbitrary financial threshold, there is more discretion in other schemes and I would like to see more discretion in this case.  As Senator Marie Moloney said, it is bizarre to say that somebody on &euro;40,000 per year can afford to send a child to college while somebody on &euro;39,000 cannot.  This cut-off point is arbitrary and too severe.  What suggestions does SUSI have for us, as legislators, to improve the system within which it has to work?  How can we bring less rigidity and more flexibility into the system?</p> <p>  I note that SUSI has turned out to be a huge disappointment in some quarters.  There were huge hopes at one point that it would turn into another Irish Water and become a new whipping boy but it has disappointed many in the media and in Opposition by putting together a very formidable operation.  We cannot overestimate the achievement of SUSI in taking 43 awarding authorities and combining them into one system.  There were teething difficulties, of course, and it is not long ago that this committee met its representatives in Buswells Hotel on the matter.  I was very impressed with the presentation on that day.  SUSI was the first body to get its head around the idea of Departments talking to other Departments, which is something for which we had hoped for a long time.  A colleague of mine in the D&aacute;il, Deputy Willie O'Dea, said not so long ago that nobody in Ireland would now consider calling their child Susie.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to engage with SUSI and review its operations but, apart from a few suggestions its delegates may make, the situation is out of its hands.</p> <p>  Have the delegates any figures for the number of people who are marginally over the limit?  Some people will not even apply, of course, so there may not be complete figures.  What are the delegates' views on the question of discretion?  I regret that the appeals body is not represented today as the question of applying discretion would be more pertinent to it.</p> <p>  What happens with people who are estranged or where there is a question of a person being independent or dependent?  I have constituents who had to prove they were independent.  Although it is a strict test, I found it was a fair process and I have no difficulties with it as people could otherwise take advantage of it.</p></speech>

The question at the outset was on gross versus net income.  A range of schemes are run across Government which use various means of income measurement.  For the student grant scheme, it has always been thought that gross income was the fairest place to start.  It means there will be no change to eligibility caused by decisions made within families about expenditure.  Other schemes, such as those run by the HSE, allow for some expenditure to be taken into account in various areas, but in some social welfare schemes, means testing is carried out on the basis of gross income only.  They may not, however, be the best examples to use.  The student grant was examined previously and the conclusion was that gross income was the fairest place to start.</p><p>There are a number of income disregards to ensure that less well-off families should not have their social welfare income or outboard payments included in the assessment of income overall.  There is a range of ameliorating measures in the scheme to help ensure gross income is reduced accordingly, where those measures impact on people from the point of view of social protection.  </p><p>  The issue was raised around the introduction of a broader and fairer means test, signalled by the Government.  While there is no agreement at this point the issue remains under consideration in terms of fairness in means testing.  That is still on the table, but it is an issue of policy for the Government to see how, if and when that should be done.  That is the current status.  On the issue of the one parent family I will ask my colleague, Eilish Bergin, to make a comment on that.</p></speech>

We are liaising with the Department to try to ameliorate arising difficulties, particularly for those who are in college.  A budget decision was taken on the back to education allowance a number of years ago and that has been implemented.  It would be unfair to allow different sets of people be treated differently on BTEA.  We are working with the Department to find ways to smooth the passage of Department policy in relation to one-parent family payments.  That engagement is ongoing.  The committee can be reassured we are very conscious of the issue and we work closely with the Department.</p></speech>

It is understood that the Department of Social Protection is using new transitioning arrangements for moving people.

I want to pick up on the estrangement which I know is a major issue for a number of members.  In the first instance, cases of genuine estrangement are relatively rare.  Each situation presents unique and often difficult circumstances.  Therefore, the scheme deliberately does not stipulate precisely how the grant awarding authority should satisfy itself that a person meets those criteria.  This allows the grant awarding authority sufficient flexibility to assess evidence of irrevocable estrangement in each case.  The assessment of a case of estrangement must be carefully considered to ensure there is enough evidence and demonstrate that the exceptional circumstances genuinely exist.  The type of evidence required is fully dependent on the applicant's individual circumstances which are often very different from others.  We must have evidence to allow the awarding authority to satisfy itself of the conditions of the application for exemption.  This is one of the areas where grant awarding authorities have some discretion around the kinds of proof that they accept.</p> <p>   We met with the Union of Students in Ireland and with the Higher Education Authority on this issue.  We also met our counterparts in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs because we wanted to link up with them to ensure the messages around this are right and the kind of proofs we are asking for are achievable from an individual's point of view. </p></speech>

Quite often cases come up through my own section within the Oireachtas help desk.  In the context of numbers, as Mr. Power said, they are relatively low.  SUSI had 103,000 applications altogether for the 2014-15 academic year.  Of that number, 170 applications involved estrangement.  A further breakdown shows that 50% of those 170 applications have been approved with students awarded the grant.  Of the remaining 50%, only ten were refused and we are currently working with the other students.  As Deputy Daly said, we must have strict criteria to ensure the system is not abused.  We are also cognisant of the extremely sensitive nature of these cases.</p> <p>   We work on a case-by-case basis and we work with the students as best we can.  We are very happy that the scheme is not restrictive in relation to evidence required.  We take evidence such as a court order which indicates when someone is estranged from the parent.  We would take as evidence a Garda incident report which shows a minor may have been removed from the home, or a letter from the HSE from a social worker to confirm that.  The reality is however, quite often, that applicants may have none of this evidence.  SUSI has met with the Child and Family Agency, and I have met with the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul, at a management level.  SUSI accepts evidence from the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul where it can indicate that an applicant is irreconcilably estranged from their parents.  We do try to work in supporting the students.  We get as much information as we possibly can to build a picture.  If we prescribe which documentation we can only receive, that would restrict us.  We find that the way we do it is working well.  There are ten out of 170 applicants in the 20014-2015 academic year who were refused to date and we are still working with the other students.</p></speech>

The recommendations of the appeals board came up a number of times.  The chair of the board, in consultation with the Department, convene meetings and make recommendations within 60 days of the appeal.  The current average time for issuing a determination is now 25 days.</p><p>I appreciate that if one adds up all the possibilities for appeals, the amount of time a student has to submit and the amount of time that both the appeals officer in SUSI and the appeals board has to respond, it is a very long time overall, but we are watching those timelines quite carefully.  There has been a significant improvement in the timeline of appeals on the SUSI side and we are down to 25 days in 2014-15 on the student grant appeals board from 46 days on average previously.  That is a very important improvement overall.</p><p> The rate of appeal regarding the repeat period of study being at a particularly high level-----</p></speech>

A normal repeat period is where a person, for example, may have failed an exam.  It often transpires in the course of a case being dealt with by SUSI or the student grant appeals board that there are extenuating circumstances, the illness of a student or a parent, for example.  My understanding is that part of the reason the appeals rate is quite high, at least at the student grant appeals board end, is that new information is often introduced at that stage, because of such circumstances.  That is from a discretionary piece which is in that.</p> <p>  There is still some discretion in the new single scheme, for example, in terms of the classes of applicant that would be considered.  This applies particularly to the requirement that a student wishing to be classed as an independent student must supply sufficient information to establish to the satisfaction of the awarding authority that they are eligible to be classed as such.  There is a certain amount of discretion on the part of the awarding authority to accept the evidence of independent students.  There is some very compelling acceptable evidence, such as where a person has clear living arrangements, for example, where they have ESB bills or other utility bills in their name.  We are handling students who very often have other arrangements, so there is some discretion built into that.</p> <p>  There is also discretion under article 21 regarding persons whose income is to be considered.  Some discretion can be exercised, for example, where it is established to the satisfaction of the awarding authority that a dependent student's parents have been separated but no divorce or legal separation has occurred.  Coming back to the area we have dealt with, namely, irreconcilable estrangement, the awarding authority also has latitude regarding being satisfied.  As Mr. Doyle has said, and as we pointed out, as we evolve, our objective is to ensure that people who are genuinely estranged from their parents are able to access the grant system.</p> <p>  A question was raised about the overall number of appeals and the 19% overturn.  We would caution that those are the overturns in terms of the number of appeals that end up with the student grant appeals board, which tend to be the most difficult and problematic cases overall.  The most pertinent statistic here is the percentage of applicants who end up before the board.  As a percentage of all the applicants each year, that would work out at about 0.4% overall, which, compared with other means-tested schemes, is actually quite good.</p></speech>

Disputes regarding means over the limit obviously have the highest rate of appeal.  People will contest means and whether means have been counted in or out.  The other area, which has been pointed out by Senator O'Donnell, concerns the repeat period, which also has an extremely high rate of appeal.  Other areas include applications for the special rate of grant, which is very often a function of means over the limit; documentation not received; postgraduate funding; and distance criteria.</p></speech>

I am not clear what the final outcome of this case has been, but we can find that out for the committee afterwards.  We are only aware of one case.</p> <p>  We now move to the student assistance fund, SAF.  There is an overall fund for third level access of &euro;16.2 million.  That is broken down by the HEA.  It covers two funds: the student assistance fund, which is a discretionary fund run by individual colleges, generally through the access office of the college; and the fund for students with disabilities, which provides extra support via the HEA through colleges.  That funding is made available to colleges through the HEA.  The HEA has a finance committee that examines it and examines the level of demand for the SAF and the fund for students with disabilities each year.  It splits that fund every year on the basis of the likely demand for each of those schemes.  There is always room for extra funding, if available, and there is always a high demand on this.  Interestingly, the HEA carried out a brief survey for us just before Christmas to see where demand was and it found that something in the region of 44%, almost half, of colleges felt there was a significant draw on the fund and they needed extra funding.  Some 48% had enough for what had been asked for up to that point.  The final 4% of colleges had less demand than they had had in the previous year.  That is obviously a very small number of colleges, but otherwise it is half and half in terms of the increase or decrease in demand from the colleges.  That is the information that has come back from the HEA.  The allocation for the current year overall for the fund is the same and the HEA will look at the relative split in that for the coming academic year, 2015-16.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-25a.514" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1154" speakername="Averil Power" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015022500002#G00800"><p>The difficulty is that they both come out of the same pot.  The money going to the student assistance fund has decreased from &euro;8 million to &euro;6.6 million in the past two years.  I understand that the overall fund is the same, but more is going to the disabilities side.  The students who can avail of the student assistance fund are our most vulnerable students.  They have to be in extreme financial hardship, so they are even more vulnerable than the other cohort we are talking about today, who get maintenance grants.  These students are a sub-group of that and a group whose members are often in such dire circumstances that a few hundred euro or a thousand euro might be the difference between them staying in college and dropping out.  If they drop out of college, they end up on social welfare.  They end up on a demand-led scheme, where the State is perfectly happy to pay them the dole, week in, week out, and will find the money to do so, but in the third level system, when there is not enough money in the student assistance fund, we are telling them that we cannot help them.  The reality is that half the colleges had exhausted their allocation by the end of December.</p><p>Last week in the Seanad I stated eight had used 100% and another six or seven had used 80% of their allocation, and that is for a student year that started only in September or October.  Perhaps within two and a half months of starting the student year, the affected students had no money.  From the colleges' point of view, that means that if somebody turns up on 1 January or 1 March, he or she cannot be helped.  This is problematic.</p><p> I accept the statement that the overall funding is the same, but the colleges have a responsibility to students with disabilities also.  It is not fair to pit one against the other.  The colleges probably have a stronger statutory responsibility to students with disabilities, which means they should get priority within the pot.  However, the lesson is that the overall pot needs to be increased.  The allocation has decreased significantly by comparison with a few years ago.  In recent years when the fund was exhausted at an early date, top-ups were provided.  This needs to be considered.  It strikes me as irrational that we would let somebody drop out of education and then pay him several times over to be on the dole when, for the sake of a small amount of money, he could be kept in college, as he desires, to get a third level education and improve his prospects so he will, it is hoped, never end up as a customer of the Department of Social Protection.</p></speech>

It will be interesting to examine these issues in the context of that review.</p> <p> The other issue that is probably important in this regard is the consideration of the management of the scheme in each institution.  Our understanding is that some institutions have a policy of making a full dispersal at the start of the academic year.  Given the nature of the issues that arise for students throughout the academic year, we would have a question about that.  This is one of the issues that might arise in the context of the review of the scheme.</p> <p>  Consider the range of general issues concerning students falling out of higher education.  Some of the issues are financial but some are very much academic.  Some research done on this indicates students who embark on the wrong course very often find themselves in a difficult position.  It is not necessarily for financial reasons that they drop out of a course.  Since their entitlement to participate in the free fees scheme is gone for a year or whatever, they fail to get back in.  Therefore, one consideration to be borne in mind in the development of the new national access plan is the need to ensure the existence of supports so that when students transition from second level into higher education, they will make the right choices and not be at high risk of dropping out.</p></speech>

It is not always appreciated that it is not a scheme run by the Department; it is run by the third level institutions.  They have a legal responsibility for admissions and they came together to put the HEAR scheme in place.  The Department has been quite supportive of it, and there has been support from the HEA also.  We do not have the statistics on the scheme because it is not one of ours but we can certainly monitor it with the HEAR implementation team, which currently works out of the Irish Universities Association premises.  The scheme assists thousands of students in getting into courses with lower points by recognising the disadvantage they may have suffered, educationally or financially, previously in their education overall.  That is important.  However, the most important part of the HEAR scheme from the perspective of individual students is that we try to use the access measure funding that is made available by the HEA to institutions to provide post-entry support for students.  Thus, it can be ensured that, having gained entry to higher education, students will not fall out of it for want of internal supports.  That is what we are trying to do in that regard.</p> <p>  I will move on to the improvements recommended by Accenture to the grant-processing system overall.  Consider the improvements from the external review that were implemented.  The implementation of the recommendation was undertaken by the CDETB in agreement with the Department and, as appropriate, with the Department of Expenditure and Reform because there are costs associated with those improvements.  Many of the Accenture recommendations have been implemented, including those relating to streamlining and simplifying the student grant process; strengthening SUSI&rsquo;s resourcing, programme governance and organisational structure; further developing communications and campaign management; further developing operational indicators and reporting; strengthening systems supporting the grant process; improving operational management and management reporting; enhancing operational controls; and formalising support from an expert group facilitating the transfer of expertise on the scheme to SUSI.</p> <p>  Also in prospect, and planned, is a new ICT system for SUSI.  As members probably know, the system ran initially with a combination of four or five individual ICT systems that were put together at a time when nothing else could be afforded.  We are moving to a space where we can have a new ICT system that should be able to do much more in terms of means testing, and with more automation.  Perhaps the representatives of SUSI would like to comment on that also.</p></speech>

I have mentioned the eligibility reckoner.  A key point is data sharing.  Deputy Daly touched on it earlier.  It has been significant and it has brought about significant improvements to the system.  It has really helped us to obtain information.  It lessens the burden on the applicant because we do not have to request the information and they do not have to provide it, and it also provides us with more safeguards because we are getting the information that has already been approved from Departments and agencies.</p> <p>  Another key point concerns the segregation of applications.  Applications numbered 103,000 this year.  Speakers have touched today on nationality, progression and the income of the self-employed, for example.  What we do is break up the elements into queues.  I will not bore the members with all the details.  The system allows us to have a very focused approach to dealing with applications as they come in.  This is based on a recommendation we have implemented.</p> <p>  With regard to my area, the training of staff, there is a comprehensive staff training programme in place.  When we are busy, we are busy.  In the middle of the summertime, when all the applications are in, there is a comprehensive training programme.  We are opening in mid-April this year and the training is starting tomorrow.  We have a month's training with all staff to ensure they are up to speed with the system.</p> <p>  The answer to Senator Moloney's question on step-parents is very easy, she will be very glad to hear.  If somebody becomes a step-parent, we do not take the income into account, unless he or she also becomes a legal guardian.  It is only in the case of a parent or legal guardian.  Where a mother remarries, we do not take the father's income into account unless he becomes a legal guardian.</p></speech>

They cannot be considered as a change of circumstances if we do not have an application in the first place.  We need to receive the information from the student.

Senator Power spoke about the USI earlier and there are also individual student unions and parents.  We have an advisory group which comes together from various areas.  It is important that we disseminate information on nationality and repeat periods of study.  Nationality can be a complex area for an individual who comes to the country with certain permission to be here.  It is about us working with the students, which is what we do.</p> <p>  Mr. Power spoke about repeat periods of study.  We communicate the message through various channels to students with regard to what is a repeat period of study.  In this regard, people appeal decisions because of exceptional circumstances.  Earlier I spoke about inclusion rather exclusion.  If somebody tells us there were medical reasons he or she had to drop out we will consider this.  We have dedicated personnel to deal with appeals, repeat periods of study and estrangement so we have a consistent approach and way of dealing with them.

The Revenue Commissioners have their own job to do and other information they need to obtain.  The information may not be available to us at that time of the year.  In the vast majority of cases involving leaving certificate students we cannot award grants until the end of August at the earliest because the students must receive their leaving certificate results and their CAO offers.  The earlier the process is open, the longer people will wait for a decision.  I know from experience I will receive queries through the Oireachtas helpdesk as to why people have been waiting for so long.  We have brought the date back to mid-April.  The current year, 2014 to 2015, has been very successful for the organisation.  The extra month will make a big difference.</p> <p>  My colleague, Mr. de Faoite, has statistics for Deputy Daly.</p></speech>

We carried out analysis on marginal cases.  We examined 282 cases within &euro;50 of the thresholds, some of which were above and others below.  Of the 282 cases, only 20% of them did not receive the higher rate.  This goes back to the ethos mentioned by Mr. Doyle, that we look at all income disregards and the higher thresholds, so if we can get somebody within the income limit we will do so.  Only five people did not receive any support from SUSI.  They fell between &euro;20 and &euro;50.  This is a small number in terms of the overall figure.  Regardless of what the limit is, there will always be cases which will lose out.  We have an internal review process and an appeals process.  Every opportunity is given to people throughout the timeline.</p> <p>  The number of cases being appealed has decreased.  This year 2,500 applications have been appealed and the number last year was 4,600.  We ensure we deal with cases within the 30 day timeline.  We must be conscious of the fact that if students want to come back we cannot be seen to be too hard on them.  We want to give them as much support as possible.</p></speech>

The 300 cases within &euro;50 of the limit also vividly illustrate my point.  Certain people will not even apply.  If the &euro;50 was broadened to &euro;100, &euro;200, &euro;300 or &euro;500 there would be a serious number of cases.  We know &euro;500 would not carry anybody across the road when it comes to going to college.  As front-line practitioners, what changes do the witnesses suggest should be made to bring flexibility into the system?</p></speech>

Wherever we draw the line, people will be on the margin and this will always be a challenge.  We must continue to examine the grant scheme on an annual basis to ensure it is as fair as it can possibly be.</p><p>However, the type of issue mentioned will always be problematic for people on the margin; that will always be the case, wherever we draw the line.  That is part of the overall challenge.  Also, if we increase the number of gradations, there is the challenge of the cost involved.  There is either extra costs for the system as a whole or, if one brings the gradations within the current cost, it ultimately means that some students will receive less.  We must examine all of these issues in the round.</p><p> One of the issues in this sphere which was raised by Senator Marie Moloney concerns the possibility of a loan scheme.  Again, all of the issues involved are being fully considered.  The committee is probably aware that we have an expert group on the future funding of higher education.  Funding of higher education is often understood as meaning the funding of institutions, but it also includes student funding.  It is part of the piece.  We have a full system where there is institutional funding, a free fees scheme under which funding is paid into institutions on behalf of students, a student contribution payable by individual students and a student grants scheme which includes not only student maintenance grants but also covers fees and the full cost of the student contribution in almost all cases.  In terms of the balance and how the broad suggestion of a loan scheme might fit into it, the issue must be examined in the round.  That is what the future funding group is examining.</p></speech>

In the case in question the lady concerned had received &euro;150 in the reference year under the Haddington Road agreement.  It was an additional payment.  The PAYE sector is crucified in this regard because the scheme is very black and white.  There is some latitude for the self-employed; that is the reality.  However, those in the PAYE sector are limited to the bottom line amount.  The lady mentioned had received &euro;150 in the reference year as a once-off payment and it threw her above the limit.  It is very difficult when one cannot have flexibility in the system in dealing with such cases.</p></speech>

We did not receive notice of it in time to enable us to attend.  We thought the best way to deal with the matter was to make submissions to the committee, as we have done, and also to attend, give evidence and answer questions members might wish to put to us.  There are only two of us and we obviously have considerable experience as we were both appointed about 22 years ago.  Given that our hearings are held <i>in camera</i>, what we do is not widely known.  We thought the most appropriate thing to do was to come to be of assistance to the committee and make a few points we thought were important.  That is why I am here.<br/><br/>I will briefly outline the scope of the office.  Effectively, we act as an interface between Revenue and the taxpayer on all taxes.</p><p>I am looking here because I wanted to talk about our costs, but I am taking it from the last full set of the finance accounts to December 2013.  I am just going to the sources of income, all of which we are quite intimately involved with - income tax, VAT, excise duty, corporation tax, stamp duty, customs duties, capital acquisitions tax, capital gains tax and local property tax.  We do not have a function in regard to the training and employment levy or motor tax receipts but we do in regard to everything else that has been read out, and also the plastic bag tax, which has not featured but we have had one or two cases on it.  We are involved in anything covered under any of those headings.  Under the heading of &ldquo;scope of the work&rdquo;, in the 22 years since we were appointed there has been a considerable increase in the scope, apart from the fact that new taxes were added.  For instance, stamp duty appeals, vehicle registration tax appeals, and custom duties appeals, among others, have all been added on, but much more importantly, the nature of the work has changed hugely.  VAT, to be blunt, is a bit of a monster.  It is rooted in European law.  We frequently have cases where there are perhaps three or four ring binders of European precedents and complex arguments about European and Irish case law involving barristers on both sides.  Essentially, the work we do has become much more legalistic in the past 20-odd years than was the case previously.<br/><br/>Self-assessment was introduced in the late 1980s.  Prior to that, people were using the appeals system as a way of deferring payment of tax.  They were dragging things out.  The legislation on self-assessment reversed all of that.  It said that if one has not paid one&rsquo;s tax and submitted one&rsquo;s tax return, one will not get an appeal.  Things have changed dramatically since then.  The way the Revenue Commissioners approach matters has changed.  When we started, we had quite a lot of cases in which the Revenue Commissioners might be arguing about mileage allowances, for example, but that is all gone now.  It is much more practical in its approach.  Some of the cases we hear are short but many of them are very lengthy.  We have had several cases lasting weeks.<br/><br/>Perhaps a very important point to make which people generally may not be generally aware of, although I am sure everybody here is aware of it, is that there is no limit on the jurisdiction in regard to matters we hear.  On one hand, it could be tens of millions, while on the other, if one goes to the District Court the jurisdiction is &euro;10,000 to &euro;15,000 and in the Circuit Court it is &euro;30,000, perhaps going up to &euro;50,000.  There is no limit on cases we hear.  I have a couple of cases running at the moment involving &euro;10 million in tax.  The work has become much more technical, particularly with the European dimension.<br/><br/>We act as an interface between the Revenue Commissioners and the taxpayer.  We go around the country.  A taxpayer in Kerry can have his or her appeal heard in Killarney or Tralee.  We counted it up this morning and there are 18 different locations in which we hear appeals.  When we are down the country we typically hear appeals in the local courthouse, but sometimes they are held in a hotel.  In terms of the cases before us, frequently the taxpayer will turn up on his or her own.  We do not award costs.  We do not have the power to do so, which is probably a good thing, but more and more the issues are technical and detailed.<br/><br/>In terms of our resources, I will start by giving the committee the figures from December 2013, as they have not changed very much.  The voted expenditure, current and capital, for the Office of the Appeal Commissioners for 2013 was &euro;409,000.  That represents two assistant secretaries, namely me and R&oacute;n&aacute;n Kelly, and, in that year, one executive officer and one clerical officer.  We had a total complement of four.  We have gained one clerical officer since then, so now there are five people in the entire office.  For many years we have had great difficulty dealing with the recruitment embargo, which has prevented us from bringing on board researchers or whatever else, which would have been very helpful.  To blow our trumpet a little bit, Vote 10 for the Office of the Appeal Commissioners is &euro;409,000.  I note that Vote 15 is for the Secret Service, which comes in at &euro;635,000.  The Vote for the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, which is about 60 times bigger than us, is &euro;28 million.  The Office of the Ombudsman costs &euro;6.5 million, which is roughly 14 or 15 times more than the cost of our office.<br/><br/>To stress the scope of our resources, we made some detailed submissions in writing to the committee.  I do not propose to take up the committee's time at this phase, but I do wish to raise a couple of points in regard to proposals in the heads of the Bill.  On the matter of public hearings in the heads of the Bill, initially I wondered about it, but while I am personally in favour of it, that will have to be carefully considered.  I do not mean this as a criticism of the Revenue Commissioners for a minute, because I am on record as saying the Revenue Commissioners do a wonderful job.  The one circumstance we do not want to come about is where someone is effectively threatened that their case will go to appeal and the appeal on their tax affairs will be held in public.  I could imagine lots of situations where someone might be sensitive about issues or they might be afraid of going public, and where the matter of the appeal being public would work against them.  I am in favour of the proposal generally, despite the comment, but there would probably need to be pre-hearings at which there could be consideration of what would be made public.<br/><br/>The Bill, as drafted, raises questions.  Section 949Y deals with public hearings.  It starts out by saying that every hearing of an appeal shall be public other than the preliminary hearing, and subject to subsection (2).  Under subsection 2(a) the Appeal Commissioners may give a direction that a hearing or part of a hearing is to be held <i>in camera </i>if they consider that restricting access to the hearing is necessary in the interests of public order or national security.  That is fair enough.  I think that would be unusual enough.  The second category of exemption is to avoid serious harm to the public interest - ditto.  The third category is to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive information.  That is immediately brought into question.  The fourth category of exemption is to protect an individual&rsquo;s right to respect for his or her private and family life or, lastly, in the interests of justice.  The point in subsection 2(a)(iii) is to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive information, but that is trumped by subsection (3), which states: &ldquo;Nothing in subsection (2) shall be taken to mean that the grounds on which access to a hearing is to be restricted extend to maintaining the confidentiality of a person&rsquo;s taxation, financial or business affairs.&quot;  I do not propose to go into an analysis of that here.  That is a matter for the committee to consider.  Issues arise as to whether this essentially says that maintaining the confidentiality of sensitive information does not extend to maintaining the confidentiality of a person&rsquo;s taxation, business or financial affairs.  In other words, if I am running a small shop in a town and the Revenue Commissioners are auditing me and I am going to appeal, perhaps my accounts are going to be public and my competitors will be able to see how I am doing and, as I read the draft Bill now, I will not be able to claim that the information should be kept confidential because my business affairs are sensitive.  That is a matter which requires further discussion, but it is important because it is such a dramatic change in the nature of the appeal hearings.  It is a cultural thing as much as anything else, one that needs considerable debate both for and against.  It is a difficult issue.<br/><br/>The other area that comes up regularly is the matter of our jurisdiction.  We have jurisdiction over, essentially, mostly tax assessments, which sometimes quantify the amount of tax due.  Sometimes there might be a decision by the Revenue Commissioners, such as a refusal to grant artistic exemption for a book or a refusal to grant medical expense claims or whatever else, but regularly, there are matters dealing with discretions afforded to the Revenue Commissioners.</p><p>I will give the committee an example of a case I heard not so long ago.  It was within the past couple of months.  I will change the facts a little bit.  A couple had separated in the late 1990s.  They had agreed that they would continue to be taxed as though they were married, as they are perfectly entitled to do.  In the early 2000s, the wife went to the inspector of taxes and stated that she wished to be singly assessed.  The inspector then explained to her that as a consequence, the maintenance being paid by her husband would, in the future, be taxable in her hands.  Up to that point, because they were treated as if they were still a married couple, there was no tax effect on transfers between them.  She paid tax on that amount.  Then, quite a lot of years later, the husband discovered that this had been going on.  His tax advisers sent in a series of tax returns claiming tax relief, for about ten years, on the payments he had made to his wife and in respect of which she had paid tax.  The Revenue Commissioners said, "We know we did not inform you that your wife had changed the circumstances, but we felt we could not because she was a separate taxpayer.  Now you are looking for tax refunds in respect of moneys on which she has paid tax, but there is a four-year time limit on the refunds.  Therefore, you cannot have them."</p><p> There are a series of issues in this, with which I will not bore the committee, not least of which is section 955(2)(a), which deals with the four year time limit and circumstances in which the Revenue Commissioners do not need to enforce it.  In fact, the Revenue Commissioners had acted in a manner which I believed I did not have jurisdiction to overrule.  There is a possible argument regarding a Supreme Court case - the Keogh case - which is to do with the taxpayers' charter.  The simple thing to do, which is what I urged it to do, was to allow, in the circumstances, the tax relief to the husband in respect of the amounts on which the wife had paid tax.  Strictly speaking, I am not sure I had that jurisdiction.  The inspector had failed to inform the husband.  Generally, the principle is that we do not have jurisdiction over the behaviour of the Revenue Commissioners; we have jurisdiction over the quantum of tax.  A similar point applies in the UK.  The First-tier Tribunal, which is the equivalent of our office, would not have jurisdiction for equitable remedies such as legitimate expectation.</p><p> Another example might be an extra-statutory concession where the Revenue Commissioners might do a deal with a building company and allow meal allowances, etc., on a certain scale.  There might then be a disagreement between the Revenue Commissioners and the builders.  The builders would appeal and we would say that it was an extra-statutory discretion and that we do not have jurisdiction.  Mr. Justice Frank Murphy in the Revenue Powers Group recommended that our jurisdiction be increased to take account of this.  As we see it, we do not have that function at the moment.  This is an important area which needs to be addressed and is not currently addressed in the Bill.</p><p> There are various other matters to which we have adverted in our written submissions.  Another heading is "expertise required to carry out the functions of the review commissioner".  We are of the view that it has become so legalistic that it would need a legal degree.  Neither of us has a legal degree, but we have been doing the job for 20 years and we have been gradually educated about many issues.  Coming in cold would be difficult for someone who is not a long-term tax expert or does not have a legal background.  Those are the principle points I wished to make, but there may be questions.</p></speech>

It relates to Mr. O'Callaghan's covering letter.

Does he want to bring this to the committee's attention?</p></speech>

The tax collection system works pretty well.  From our point of view, the idea that we have a large number of cases is simply wrong.  This came up six months ago or so when the Comptroller and Auditor General was auditing our little operation.  That office was interested in a large number of cases which, on the Revenue system, were shown as being under an appeal stop.  A really important point to make about something being under appeal is that, when someone appeals an assessment, it does not necessarily mean the person wishes to have a hearing.  If a person gets an assessment and does not appeal it within the appropriate time, which is mostly 30 days, the tax becomes payable.  What one does, if one gets an assessment, is to appeal it.  Some 99.99% of appeals never proceed to a hearing, much as 99.99% of parking tickets never go to the District Court.  The ticket is paid.  A person may engage in correspondence or whatever else.  Similarly, the appeal function is, for most people, merely a way of enabling them to continue to correspond with the Revenue Commissioners and to come to an agreement about the quantum of tax they owe.</p> <p>  What I think has happened is that in the Revenue Commissioners there are a lot of appeals.  Someone appeals, the case is under discussion, perhaps the case has been settled, but the appeal stop has not been taken off.  When the Comptroller and Auditor General came to us and we showed it the actual number of files we had which were live, the number was tiny.  As we said in our submission, the number is perhaps in the low double digits.  However, there seems to be some sort of an accounting issue throwing up numbers of taxes under appeal.  Of course, "under appeal" refers not just to appeals to the Appeal Commissioners but also appeals to the Circuit Court, the High Court, now the Court of Appeal, and the Supreme Court.  To put on record, this is a simple error.  We have a tiny number of cases in front of us.  If there were any sort of a backlog, I would have anticipated a lot of letters from the Revenue Commissioners and from taxpayers looking for information on the progress of the case.  We do not have any such letters.  We have no one requesting us to proceed with this case, that case or the other.  I am not saying that we do not have a work in progress.  However, there is no iceberg-type effect.</p> <p>  I was in two minds whether to put that on the record, but I think it was better to have done it.</p></speech>

It seems that this was the motivator for the witnesses' request to address the committee.  I would like Mr. O'Callaghan to clarify for the committee a statement which was given by Mr. O'Leary.  Mr. O'Callaghan takes issue with the statement and the impression which was given.  Mr. O'Callaghan states that Mr. O'Leary's statement gave the impression that this office was responsible for almost 600 cases which have been under appeal for more than five years.  How many cases are under appeal in the Office of the Appeal Commissioners for more than five years?</p></speech>

Let me explain what can happen.  We give a decision.  The taxpayer has two options when we give a decision, if he or she loses.  There is the option of a rehearing in the Circuit Court in most instances.  Alternatively, there is the option of an appeal to the High Court on a point of law.  If appealing to the High Court on a point of law, the taxpayer must notify us within 21 days of us giving the decision that he or she wishes to go to the High Court.  The taxpayer requests a case stated.  We have checked the numbers.  In the past ten years, roughly one tenth of the applications for a case stated have resulted in cases going to the High Court.  In 90% of them, people decide not to proceed to the High Court.  It is an expensive business.  It takes time and so on.</p></speech>

When Deputy Doherty says "under appeal", we are not seized of any such case.  It might be that cases are stated with which people have just not bothered, and which are certainly nothing to do with us.  It is up to those people if they wish to proceed.  Within our office's bailiwick there is no such thing at all.  I think it is a numbers thing.  I do not think-----</p></speech>

If somebody makes an appeal on a tax issue, whether it is corporation tax, a large tax bill, the plastic bag levy or property tax, is the Office of the Appeal Commissioners notified of each and every appeal?</p></speech>

He would write to Revenue saying it is too much and explaining why.  He would then enter into correspondence with Revenue.  It might be a year or two before Revenue would correspond with our offices to request a date for the hearing.  Revenue waits for the appeal to be ready to be heard.  Initially, Revenue will get one letter showing in a couple of sentences what the taxpayer is saying, and frequently it does not have enough evidence from the taxpayer.  The parties have to go to and fro and, eventually, if the issue is still live, they will contact our office to request a date, and we give them the date for the hearing.  If the taxpayer thinks Revenue is sitting on the case and not listing it, he or she has a specific right, under section 933 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, to apply to us directly for a hearing.  That is an unusual situation.  It is nearly always Revenue that liaises with us about the time and date of the hearing.</p></speech>

It might be &euro;70 million for all I know.  We have not got the full submissions yet.  We do not list the actual total of tax assessed when we are summarising the cases.

I was quite surprised that a relatively small number went for a re-hearing in the Circuit Court.  We took it as being reasonably complimentary of what we were doing.  It might be 10%, off the top of my head.  We do not have a record of that.  Once it has gone from us, the Circuit Court starts from scratch.  It is not an actual appeal from us but a re-hearing.</p></speech>

Is that not the whole point?  There are hundreds of cases with Revenue and it has not passed them on because, as Mr. O'Callaghan says, it is just a way for taxpayers to try to facilitate more time and engagement.  If we are to have an appeals process, should it not be an appeals process?  If I appeal my parking ticket - if I get one - then I am going to court and the appeals system and am not looking for extra time to haggle with the parking warden.</p></speech>

In the tax system, people mostly start sending information to Revenue after they have submitted their appeal.  Correspondence then ensues and in the vast majority of cases agreement is reached.  To try to use the appeal function as a way of getting the Revenue Commissioners to smarten up, and I am not suggesting for a minute that they need to, is over-stretching the appeal function.  Revenue is well capable and its systems are very good.</p></speech>

If I had a dispute with Revenue over a particular tax, if the new legislation were to be enacted, and I were to appeal, I would obviously appeal to the Office of the Appeal Commissioners.  Does that still allow me time to engage with Revenue?</p></speech>

Otherwise the whole system would be clogged up.  That is what happens all the time.  Most of them are agreed.  I would guess that out of 50,000 assessments issued, maybe 400 or so would get to us.

However, given the resources that Mr. O'Callaghan's office has, I can understand the concern he would have about even a limited amount of additional bureaucracy.</p><p>The last thing I want to ask concerns public hearings.  There was discussion here about whether hearings should be held <i>in camera</i>.</p><p>I am in favour of having hearings in public.  It has been mentioned to me, and Mr. O'Callaghan made the point, about people's concerns about having their issues disclosed and having to argue in public, although there are many exemptions in the legislation whereby the commissioner could hold a hearing <i>in camera</i>.  In a situation in which somebody from Revenue has not treated a person as fairly as he or she should, would the fact that the <i>in camera</i>rule is gone facilitate Revenue officials to be more considerate in their approach in the knowledge that all the documentation could come before a public appeals court?  I am not suggesting this is happening.  Today, the Financial Services Ombudsman published a report which stated that the significant drop in the number of people who have made appeals was a result of the legislation for naming and shaming that had been passed, because financial institutions resolved cases before they went to appeal.  Could the same apply to the Revenue Commissioners?</p></speech>

On occasion, people complain that they are being victimised or whatever.  Revenue is not perfect and there will be some individuals who are difficult and take a dislike to a client, as they call them.  It is unusual.  In our experience, Revenue is pretty good in its dealings.  I am in favour of it being in public as it will make people more aware of their rights.  I regularly read newspaper reports quoting the Revenue Commissioners' comments on tax as if they were law.  Revenue's guidelines are not necessarily the law at all.  However, there is a risk that many people would be afraid of a public hearing about their tax affairs.  I had not thought about the possibility that public hearings would put manners on Revenue.  I do not know which way to go on it.  In so far as it would put manners on any of us, it is a good idea.</p></speech>

There should be a timeframe for the length of time one spends with Revenue before a case trips into the jurisdiction of the Office of the Appeal Commissioners.  Tightening of time concentrates everybody's minds.  I am completely against holding these appeals in public.  Many businesses have come through very tough times and do not necessarily want to show everybody that they are not as strong as people might perceive because, if they do, their suppliers might not give them credit, which would be very difficult for them.  The number of people who have non-core debt which they are trying to negotiate with banks would become apparent, which would be an infringement of their rights.  Holding an appeal <i>in camera</i>ensures it can be scrutinised at a later date if there is an issue.  Nobody here would like to put their financial dealings out on the table.  The Revenue Commissioners do not always get it right, as they must interpret legislation.  I know many tax officials who will sit down and tease out a point.  This would cross a Rubicon, although I can see why some people would like it.  Business people would typically decide to settle with Revenue rather than go to an appeal and risk putting all their financial details in public.</p></speech>

One of my fears would be that the taxpayer might perceive Revenue was using the appeal almost as a threat.  I do not mean this as a criticism of Revenue.  Say a person was running a Spar shop in Banagher and had one competitor, a Mace shop.  If this person were claiming an office room in his or her home as an expense in his or her business accounts, Revenue could propose an appeal, at which the business accounts would be made public and the person's competitor would see how vulnerable the business was.  It should be possible at a pre-hearing for such a person to ask for his or her accounts to be made available to the Appeal Commissioners but excluded from the public domain.  The net issue of whether a person can use a room in her or her house and office and the related expenses and tax information could be heard in isolation from the personal circumstances, which could be kept private.  This is the sort of proposal I discussed with Deputy Pearse Doherty.  The solution may lie in such an area.</p></speech>

Sole traders' accounts are not made public, while limited companies have abridged accounts.  There is leeway.  I encourage Mr. O'Callaghan to try to expand the list of exemptions.

Therefore, even if it is outside the four-year rule, if we give a decision that one is entitled to one's refund, the inspector may amend the assessment.  It says "nothing shall prevent an inspector", but does not say he or she has to.  I referred to this obliquely earlier.  In the case to which I referred, which was outside the four-year rule, I said I could not force the inspector to do it, although it seemed to me that any proper inspector should have acted in this fashion.</p><p>The answer to the Deputy's question is that they can give effect to the appeal hearing outside of the four-year period.</p></speech>

At the moment there is no time limit and I think there probably should be.  I agree with the Deputy.  It is desirable that there would be a time limit.  However, people tend to miss time limits and then the courts generally are reluctant to rule people out on procedural matters.  When one's job is to decide on an issue in dispute between two parties, I find it difficult to decide whether I should throw them out if the time limit has been missed.  If they have an argument, one is inclined to want to let them make their argument, even if they slipped up on a procedural point.</p></speech>

We have needed a couple of, or certainly one, good legal researcher.  Reporting on cases and drafting cases stated takes a certain level of skill that is above and beyond normal experience.  It is very difficult to get people at that level and we certainly need them.  The embargo on appointing staff has been a real problem for us.</p></speech>

If it gets to the point where the function of going to appeal will put people off, that will destroy the whole purpose.  We have a small office, yet all disputes between Revenue and the taxpayer are funnelled through our office.  In my view that is quite a tribute to two sets of people - Revenue and the tax practitioners who are dealing with Revenue.  Some of the cases that come to our office can last for weeks and are highly complex.  The fact that the rest of the system works is, in my view, quite a tribute to those people.  On the Deputy's point, if people are to be intimidated about going to appeal, that is to be avoided at all costs.  It is better to stick with the current system than bring that into the picture.</p></speech>

In many cases, unless we have proper submissions beforehand, we would not know what was happening.  The appeal would be heard and people would make arguments in front of us without having worked them out.  For technical cases, we required and asked for full written submissions.  The taxpayer is obliged under what used to be section 957 to provide in detail the grounds for an appeal before he or she is entitled to an appeal.  We found that requiring those submissions put discipline on people.  When we receive a taxpayer's submission, we look for replies from Revenue.  Once we have received a taxpayer's submission, he or she will have a case heard within two months.  When Revenue requests a listing for a hearing, we write immediately to the taxpayer and ask for his or her submissions within two months.  If this is received within two months, the hearing will be held within another two months.</p></speech>

I cite the example of a difference of &euro;300,000 between the value of a house as against what Revenue decides is its value.  The tax is 0.18%, call it 0.2%, of &euro;300,000.  One per cent of &euro;300,000 is &euro;3,000 so 0.2% is &euro;600.  If a person decides to go to appeal the amount of &euro;600 and hires a valuer and so on, it is not worth it.

One might have the odd mad Appeal Commissioner who might make a bad decision and there would be a desire to go to the Circuit Court to have the facts corrected.  That could happen.</p></speech>

I am not suggesting Revenue is a big Kafkaesque institution, but people are not aware of their rights and my principal reason is to assist people in general.  If the process, instead of having the function of assisting, turns it into something which intimidates, that should not be done.  The process is in place to assist people in their dealings with a much larger body.</p></speech>

When I saw the draft heads of the Bill, I was taken aback.  I thought, "I do not know about that," but then I came around to the purely personal point of view that, on balance, I would like hearings to be hel in public.  However, there are big problems in that regard.  It is a little like the elephant problem in that one knows what an elephant is, but it is hard to define precisely what it is.  To answer the Deputy's question about the criteria, one has to trust the person involved in a hearing.  Personally, I would amend the section to give a lot more discretion over personal financial matters, etc.  I would generally be biased in favour of excluding purely personal details.</p></speech>

Personally, I would have reservations about hearings being held totally in public on the basis that one was dealing with people's livelihoods.  I note that there are cases in which one has individuals who are blatantly flouting the system, but, equally, there are many people who are doing their best where it is purely a matter of interpretation between Revenue and the individual business person concerned.</p></speech>

All I care about is how much tax the person concerned owes.  It is not my function to correct other ills in society through the tax system.  It is about how much tax a person owes and that is the end of it.  If somebody has been delaying, messing or whatever else, ultimately, I am not there to award points for good conduct, either to Revenue or the taxpayer.  What tax is owed is the issue.

Nearly all of us are concerned about the same aspects of the proposed legislation.  I share the concerns of Deputies Tom Barry and Kieran O'Donnell.  When I saw it first, I thought so what if it was in the public domain, but the more I explored the issue, the more concerned I became in an inverse way.  The less well-off will be more inclined to be afraid of a process that brings their position into the public domain they will be.</p></speech>

My parents would pay any amount of tax rather than have to ring the Revenue Commissioners, let alone make an appeal.  That any of their neighbours would know a personal detail such as how much they earn or how much their pension is would absolutely be a no-no in making an application to the Appeal Commissioners.  It is important to bear in mind that people value their privacy.</p> <p>  A couple of proposals came before us previously.  Deputy Kieran O'Donnell mentioned the idea of having a quantum.  In other words, where a dispute involves an amount less than &euro;10,000, &euro;20,000 or &euro;30,000 and does not revolve around a precedent, perhaps guidance might be given in the proposed legislation on the protection of privacy.</p></speech>

We are not dealing with hundreds of cases.  One of the documents Mr. O'Callaghan submitted to the committee deals with the number of appeals handled by the appeals commissioners.  The yearly statistics for the years from 2010 to 2014 show that between 361 and 488 requests for hearing were received by the appeals commissioners and the appeals heard in those years dealt with between 329 and 1,089 issues.  As that covers the five years from 2010 and 2014, with 488 requests it indicates approximately 100 per annum.</p></speech>

We should have discretion over Revenue discretions.  For instance, a person seeking a subcontractor's certificate must have complied for what is called the relevant period of three years with all the requirements of the tax Acts, making returns on time, paying taxes on time, etc.  A person who submitted one VAT return late will lose.  There is a provision allowing the Revenue Commissioners to overlook certain misbehaviours in tax terms, but we do not have a power to review that discretion.  Somebody might come into us and say: "I was only late once and it was a small amount of VAT.  It's over the top.  Give me the cert."  That is a Revenue discretion; we have no power to review it and cannot do anything about it.</p></speech>

Having a full equitable jurisdiction in things like declaring who owns what land, etc., would not necessarily be appropriate, but there has to be some scope for us to review Revenue discretion.  I believe we should have an appeal over Revenue discretion.  I have had cases where somebody has claimed that his wife actually owned half the land because of equity, that she had worked, etc.  I have always held, as has my colleague, that is a matter for the High Court.  That is the equitable jurisdiction of the High Court.  I do not suggest we should stray into that kind of territory.  However, with regard to practical cases, we should be able to move away from the rigid legal basis on which we currently operate essentially to be fair.</p></speech>

We have covered the issue of the public hearings.  He also referred to written submissions and the Freedom of Information Act.

I ask Mr. O'Callaghan to expand.</p></speech>

He suggests that it should be more like the appointment of judges, which struck a chord with me.  He asked where does someone, who is appointed as an appeals commissioner for seven years, go afterwards.  The chances are that he or she would go to a tax firm.  We have seen that kind of thing happen with city and county managers who are appointed for a number of years.  I ask Mr. O'Callaghan to elaborate on that.</p></speech>

Independence is important.  Some of the cases in which we are involved could have an impact on the State, running to perhaps &euro;50 million or &euro;100 million.  If the person is up for review in two years and the Minister for Finance is the same person, there could be some pressure to find for the State.  I just think those things are best avoided rather than being speculated about.  These terms need to be very carefully considered.  Ireland is a small place; the UK is much bigger.  I would be worried about limited-term appointments both from the point of view of objectivity and simply because people know one another.</p> <p>  A former appeals commissioner who goes back to working with one of the big firms is very likely to have made decisions in the previous year or two on clients of that firm.  We see the same firms of solicitors and tax advisers all the time.  One has to be a bit careful about matters.  Even on the issue of whether an appeals commissioner should hear a case, I ask myself two questions.  First, would I have any compunction in finding against this taxpayer?  Second, would I take any pleasure in finding against this taxpayer?  If the answer to both of them is "No", then generally I will hear it.  However, there might be cases where I could not hear it.  For instance, it might involve a relative or someone who had been a client of mine.  Even if I was completely comfortable objectively, it would not look right.  It is very hard to lay down the rules, but ultimately one must rely on oneself and whether one feels comfortable.  There are many reasons one might excuse oneself from a case.</p></speech>

We had a recent case with a former Attorney General representing the Revenue where the taxpayer was a pensioner.  He claimed that his wife, being a qualified adult dependant, was entitled to the single person's tax credit.  He came in on his own.  In many of those cases, we are effectively put in the guise of defence counsel because the person would not necessarily know the tax minutia, etc.  It is our function to decide.  We are not like a judge in a civil case where whoever makes the best case wins.  Our job is to decide what is the right amount of tax.</p></speech>

There is a slightly new dimension in terms of what is proposed in that the public will be aware of what is involved.  In addition, it will also be fair to both Revenue and individual taxpayers.  Mr. O'Callaghan referred to a point of principle.  There are probably people who are not aware that they can go to the Office of the Appeal Commissioners.</p></speech>

It is always possible to improve a system and perhaps we could do that in this instance, particularly in light of the volume of cases being dealt with.  Mr. O'Callaghan has made a very important input into the process in which we are engaged and I thank him for it.</p></speech>

Is Mr. O'Callaghan aware of the position in countries such as France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and Portugal?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-25a.756" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John O'Callaghan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015022500002#K02400"><p>I am not, to be honest.  In Ireland, if one is a taxpayer, one goes for rehearing in the Circuit Court.  It is exactly the same as if one were before an appeal commissioner.  The hearing is held in camera and one does not have to be represented.  The judge simply rehears the case.  If one goes to the High Court, however, it all takes place in public.  The position is the same in the Supreme Court.  Therefore, one suddenly finds oneself in the limelight if one wishes to pursue one's case on a point of law.</p> <p>  Another minor point is that if a taxpayer wins in front of the Appeal Commissioners on a point of law and if the Revenue challenges the finding in the High Court, he or she could be obliged to pay the Revenue's costs if he or she loses the case.  Some barristers would not want to seek costs in those circumstances.  However, that to which I refer is an aspect which might be considered.  I have always thought the current system unfair.  Where someone wins a case in the first instance and where the Revenue, on a point of policy, wants to challenge the finding, then I do not think the taxpayer should pay the latter's costs in the High Court or the Supreme Court.</p></speech>

When watching the proceedings in my office earlier, I noted Mr. O'Callaghan's remarks about the kind of cases with which he deals.  He instanced, among others, a case involving a very large amount of VAT.  I am of the view that he exploded a few of the myths relating to the scale of the crock of gold out there that supposedly remains uncollected.</p> <p>  Our corporation tax rate is much written about and is always in the ether in one way or another, whether this be as a result of a couple of US Congressmen taking the opportunity to have a lash at the Irish system or whatever.  Does the issue of multinational companies not being liable to pay the full 12.5% rate of corporation tax ever come before the Appeal Commissioners?  Do such companies have their own professional tax advisers who resolve matters directly with the Revenue or would one of them ever come before the Appeal Commissioners and state - outlining the reasons for same - that it is not liable to pay the full rate of 12.5%?  In jurisprudence terms, could the Appeal Commissioners have decided cases in the past about which we, as legislators, would not know anything?</p></speech>

We do not tend to see multinationals very much.  This is despite the fact that all sorts of tax issues arise.  For example, the definition relating to tax relief on research and development expenditure is quite complicated.  I have one case, which has been ongoing for some time, regarding whether the company involved qualifies.  There is perhaps &euro;1 million or more in expenditure involved in that case.  We do not to see the multinationals that often.  What tends to happen is that they iron out the basis on which they are going to operate before they commence operations here.  Thereafter, they go off and operate as planned.  That is the sense I have of it.  Some multinationals come before us on various issues that arise.  However, those issues would be technical in nature and they would have nothing to do with the overarching structure.  We might be presented with arguments in respect of double taxation agreements or whatever on occasion.  My answer to the Deputy's question on whether we have made decisions regarding multinationals and the operation of the 12.5% corporation tax rate in respect of them is "No".  I am not aware of any case relating to that matter.</p></speech>

It was comparable to the work that other religious groups like Tr&oacute;caire, GOAL, and Christian Aid were doing, and this group should at least be afforded a meeting to explain its humanitarian work in these areas of crisis.  Rather than having noted the document, can we follow it up with a request to hear from it about the work the Muslim community in Ireland is doing on behalf of those in distressed regions?</p></speech>

We are joined by Liam O'Neill, president of the GAA and P&aacute;raic Duffy, director general of the GAA.  We have asked Mr. &Oacute; N&eacute;ill to discuss the GAA's role and interaction with the Irish diaspora, so we are delighted to have both the president and the director general here today.  Before introducing both men, I want to note the role played by the GAA at Croke Park in particular.  Some members may have attended the meeting hosted by Mr. O'Neill on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  His contribution to that meeting was noted by all the delegates, particularly the role the GAA has played in reconciling the two parts of the island.  As well as that, the GAA is making inroads, particularly in the UK, as a result of the sport being broadcast in the UK by Sky.  Mr. O'Neill also mentioned that the Queen spoke to him about watching some GAA matches as well.  He has done a great job as an ambassador for the country in that role.</p> <p>  This is a very important meeting for us because the GAA is one of the largest Irish associations abroad, with over 400 clubs overseas.  For many Irish emigrants, the GAA is the first port of call.  It plays a very important cultural and social role for Irish communities abroad.  I have seen this, as have some of the members, in our visits abroad, whether in Hanoi, Treasure Island in San Francisco, Chicago, New York or any of the various other areas where the GAA has a presence.  There is now even a presence in Myanmar.  That network is extremely important for us overseas.  We are delighted that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade plays a key role with the GAA in fostering, not so much a sports relationship, but a social relationship in the funding it provides to the GAA abroad.  It is important for the committee to have that close relationship between the Department, the committee and the GAA.</p><p>Without further ado, I will call on the president of the Gaelic Athletic Association, GAA, Mr. Liam O'Neill, to make an opening statement.  I believe he also has a presentation to show to members on the television monitors.  Both witnesses are welcome and the joint committee is delighted to have them.  I thank them for their attendance.<br/><br/>Before I hand over to Mr. O'Neill, I must attend to some procedure and I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery to ensure their mobile telephones are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting as they cause interference with the recording equipment in the committee rooms.  As members are aware, today's meeting is being broadcast live on television on the Oireachtas channel.  <br/><br/>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>i</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  If they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they will be entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I invite Mr. O'Neill to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I will present some facts and figures to give members an idea of the extent of the GAA involvement with the diaspora, as well as a general overview of where we are and the general direction in which we are trying to go.  As I am sure members are aware, in early January, the Department of Affairs and Trade held an assembly of ambassadors and consuls general from most locations around the world in Iveagh House.  I attended that assembly on two days, one to take part in a panel discussion and on the second day for a meeting with the ambassadors from the 20 biggest countries in which the GAA is present overseas.  The strong message to emerge was the important role the GAA plays from the Department's perspective in reaching out to the Irish people in the diaspora.  It is fair to state that the general tone and tenor is reflected in the quote on the slide on display that "The GAA is the foremost organisation today in terms of active engagement with the Irish abroad".  The point to come across strongly was that if the ambassadors and consuls general wished to engage with the Irish abroad, the best way to so do was through the GAA clubs.  It has probably become the easiest point of access which is something of which we are very proud and wish to continue to develop.  I make the point that our relationship with the diaspora is spelled out clearly in our own rules.  One of the aims of the organisation is to promote its aims among communities abroad through its international units.  That is a stated goal of the association and we take that responsibility and objective seriously.  The photographs now on display were all taken in units abroad and I will seek to discuss those in more detail as I move on.</p> <p>  I will give a brief outline as to where our clubs are located.  New York, which was the traditional starting point for the GAA abroad, now has 29 clubs, while in Britain we have a total of 83 clubs.  In North America, we have another 97 clubs outside New York, located in virtually every major city in the United States.  In Canada, we have 20 clubs while in Australasia, which encompasses both Australia and New Zealand, we now have 63 clubs.  We now have 73 clubs all over Europe, located as far east as Russia.  There are 22 clubs in Asia in 11 countries and in the Middle East, which is our newest county board, only having been established last year, there are now 11 clubs across six countries.  There is a total of 398 clubs abroad in 41 countries.  Two of the more recent ones are stand-alone clubs, namely, the South Africa Gaels and the Hurling Club of Buenos Aires, which has recently been re-established.</p> <p>  In respect of those 400 clubs dotted throughout the world, the GAA pursues what we hope is a cohesive strategy based on partnership, planning, funding and development.  It is important to note that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is an important part of that partnership.  It is a strong and active partner that has been very supportive of our efforts, not so much to develop the games overseas but to make it possible for people to play the games overseas and bring that sense of community they have in their clubs at home to wherever they now live.  I will provide a few facts and figures about the engagement with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  That partnership has been in place since 2007 and over the past seven years, which coincided with my term as director general, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided &euro;2.9 million and we have put in another &euro;5.8 million.  This has been through funding for games development personnel and capital projects in Britain and North America, on which I will give more details in a moment.  In addition, in the last couple of years there has been funding through what we call global games development projects.  As for personnel, we employ community development administrators in Britain and North America of whom we have eight in Britain, five in North America outside New York and one in New York.  Overall, we have six people working full-time on the ground with the clubs in New York and elsewhere in North America, of which there are approximately 130 if one includes Canada, as well as eight full-time people in Britain.  The global games development projects are smaller amounts that have been distributed over the past three years to specific projects and specific clubs all over the world.</p> <p>  In respect of capital funding, one great thing for the GAA in recent years has been that our clubs abroad are now seeking to go beyond simply playing the games and are trying to establish permanent homes on the same model as a club here at home where one has playing facilities and one tries to add to them.  In the slide on display, I have indicated six projects abroad that the Department has supported over the past five or six years and these have been developments of huge significance.  The model on display at present is of the Rockland GAA club in upstate New York.  That club has developed two pitches, a main pitch and a secondary pitch, and is now in the process of building a community centre there just as one would have at a club at home.  That club envisages this as establishing a base for the Irish in that part of New York.  It is a major project and the GAA itself has funded several pitches and now the latest infrastructural development, with the support of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I will revert to the figures later on.</p> <p>  The Chairman has seen the facilities at the Treasure Island complex in San Francisco, which are fantastic.  It is an old naval base just outside the city at which the land was acquired and two wonderful pictures were developed, as well as facilities.  The facilities in Chicago Gaelic Park and in Boston probably are well known to many members.  The most recent one is Ruislip, London at which we are upgrading the GAA grounds, again with support from the Department, as well as a significant financial input from us of &euro;2 million.  The most recent development in the United States has been with the Shannon Gaels club in New York.  Shannon Gaels is a club that has been given property by New York City in Queens.  If one travels from Manhattan to the airport, one will pass close to where the Shannon Gaels club is developing its new grounds.  It is a club with a lot of undocumented Irish among its membership and there are a lot of young people with young families.  The Department recently gave &euro;250,000 towards the development of its ground there and we have just put in &euro;500,000 of our own.  The last location listed on the slide is Willawong Park, which is in Queensland, Australia.  These are all projects into which we recently have put funding for infrastructural development.  This has become one of the big challenges for us in that as the games grow abroad, the expectations of the units abroad for funding from home has also grown.  While this is very good, it certainly puts a little pressure on us but we are trying to meet that demand.</p> <p>  As for the range of activities abroad, I will mention a few of them.  Mr. O'Neill can speak in depth about them all when I have concluded because he has visited or attended all of them.  The Continental Youth Championships, CYC, take place each year for clubs in the USA and Canada and the location rotates from year to year.  Last year they were held in Boston while this year they will be held in San Francisco.  In 2004, just over a decade ago, 40 teams participated whereas in 2014, more than 230 teams took part with 2,500 participants aged between eight and 18.  It is the biggest international festival of indigenous sport in the world and we now have similar models in Britain on a large scale and on a smaller scale with the China Youth Games.  The next slide shows some more photographs, after which I will turn to a recent project involving the South Africa Gaels.  Again, it is being funded as part of the global games development projects and we received a small amount of funding from the Department for it.  It is operative in the townships around Johannesburg and last year saw a trip to Ireland by the South Africa Gaels team.  They visited &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in, Croke Park, etc.  That is an example of the spread of the game in that part of the world.</p> <p>  The Asian Gaelic Games are one of the more well-established activities and again, Mr. O'Neill can tell the joint committee of his experiences there shortly.</p><p>That is a hugely successful tournament that has taken place every year since 1996.  The host cities have been Manila, Singapore, Phuket, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Penang, and Bangkok, all in Asia.  It is a two-day tournament which brings together teams from all over Asia.  For the teams taking part it is akin to the All Ireland final, in that the winning of that tournament is highly prestigious.  Alongside the tournament itself every year there is a new Asia-Pacific Ireland Business Forum which has been extremely successful in enhancing business connections between Irish business and business in the Asia-Pacific and Gulf regions.  The 2015 games will take place in Shanghai alongside the introduction of the China Youth Games.  There is an important link there between both the games and the development of trade opportunities.  We find that in Asia many of the people who are involved in the organisation of the GAA are also the people who are involved in Irish businesses overseas.</p><p>  A new club has been established recently in Augsburg in southern Germany and has been partly funded by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  That has been quite successful.  We also have similar stories in parts of France and Italy and Spain.  In 2014 for the first time we had international football matches played between France and Italy.    </p><p>  In March 2015 the first GAA World Games will take place in Abu Dhabi; 28 teams from Argentina, Asia, Australia, Canada, New York, North America, Europe, South Africa, and the Middle East will take part.  The only teams that are not taking part are the Irish teams because they would probably be too strong for the international teams.  Alongside that a business forum will take place and partners there will include Tourism Ireland, ConnectIreland, and Enterprise Ireland and over two days the championship will be played.  It is a big event sponsored by Etihad and created huge interest in more international units.    </p><p>  We have made a huge effort this year to get our games broadcast abroad through Sky in Britain and also through GAAGO.  Our games have been watched this year in 167 different countries; we know everyone who watches the games and where.  That has been a huge support to us in trying to spread the games overseas.  Most important, we did that because of the demand from the Irish abroad.  I attended the Global Irish Economic Forum in Dublin Castle in 2013 and many people complained about the fact that they could not access GAA games abroad.  Mr. O'Neill and I decided that we would make the games available to the Irish overseas.  We have done that through GAAGO and by making the games available through Sky.  It has been hugely successful and the feedback, most important, not on a commercial basis, but from the Irish abroad, both in Britain and overseas, has been absolutely fantastic.  It is hard to put into words what it means - one would need to speak to people overseas - that on a Sunday they can sit down and watch the games that are played in Ireland no matter where they are in the world.  In 2015 there will be 100 games made available to the Irish overseas, not only the championship games but the national league games and so on.  If one is interested in the GAA and interested in Ireland and living abroad that is a huge plus and it has been a really good initiative, one I believe we can claim some credit for.  </p><p>  We are always driving forward and we are currently seeking UNESCO heritage status for hurling.  That is a work in progress and will require the Irish Government to sign the UNESCO convention before we can move on with that.  I am sure the committee will be supportive of that.  </p><p>  I will finish with a few quotes that capture the spirit of the GAA abroad and what it means to people.  One of the points I will make here is that one of the most notable things about the GAA abroad is that many of the people who are involved in it are people who never had an involvement in the GAA at home.  They may have had a passing interest in our games and gone to the odd match but when they go abroad it is the chance to become part of a community.  It has amazed us on numerous occasions that people will come to represent an overseas unit at an event in Ireland, and I have had this experience myself with a couple of my students whom I taught in St. Macartan's College in Monaghan, arriving as delegates to a congress or a convention even though they never had the slightest interest in GAA when they were at home.  Now they are secretaries or chairmen of clubs because they went abroad and they wanted to feel part of a community, part of the Irish abroad, and to keep something of what they had here abroad.  </p><p>  I will not read through all of the quotes but the committee will see from them some of the benefits provided by GAA clubs abroad.  The club in Stockholm provides jobs and homes, and helps members to register for tax and benefits.  The Irish clubs abroad are quite happy to welcome those who come from Ireland who need a bit of help.  They see themselves as a support system and they see that as part of their brief and part of their role.</p><p>  The second quote is from 2013, before the games were broadcast on Sky, "I was still very lonely returning [back] to Liverpool ... I went along to my first Gaelic Football training session. I was made to feel very welcome [and] I knew that being in Liverpool [would be] a lot easier."  That sums up a lot of them; they just want to be part of an Irish community.  Similarly, Philip Hearne in Toronto talks about the same thing, how they used to go down to watch the games to be part of a group gathering around the screens to watch the matches but now they can watch the games in their own home.  </p><p>  I will make some final points.  For the Irish abroad the GAA represents an opportunity to play Gaelic games and, perhaps more important, it is an opportunity to meet people and to make friends, to network on a professional level and to find employment.  That is a huge part of this.  It is an opportunity to retain and pass on Irish culture to others and to the next generation.  </p><p>  Recently, an ambassador from a European country made the point that he wanted to organise and Irish St. Patrick's Day event in his city but he said the only organisation that could make it happen was the GAA club.  I do not say that with any sense of triumphalism because it has happened this way rather than us seeking to do it.  It has become a huge part of what the GAA abroad is, the meeting point and the connecting point for the Irish abroad.  It does not matter if one has an interest in Gaelic games or not, one will be very welcome in the GAA.  That is the important thing about the GAA abroad.  One does not have to have played before or have been involved before.  If one wants to join to be part of a community that is fine; everybody is welcome.  </p><p>  Research has been carried out recently by the Clinton Institute in UCD on the Irish diaspora and I believe it was very positive in terms of what the GAA contributes in terms of its engagement with the global Irish.  As I said, we see ourself as providing a connection with home and an important networking role.  </p><p>  That is how we view the GAA abroad and for us it is a hugely important part of our work that we want to continue.  Mr. O'Neill will be happy to draw on his experience as he has been to most of those places that I mentioned where GAA games have been played over the past three years.  We will be very happy to respond to any questions or comments the committee members wish to make.  </p></speech>

The Continental Youth Championships in the United States are an absolutely huge event.  Americans like to plan a year in advance.  They do not take holidays at short notice so they already have their flights booked for San Francisco.  They have their holidays built around it.  Irish families will go to San Francisco to take part in the games.  They will take it very seriously because Americans take sport seriously.  It is unlike in Ireland; in America one plays to win.  It is difficult for us to understand that at times.  They are driven by participation in sport and success in sport.  It is heartwarming to see so many people descending with camper vans.  In Randall's Island in New York this year there was a whole tented village.  Each club brings its own tent or has a tent provided for it.  It is their base for the week.  They have hotels booked.  There is a huge family atmosphere.  Something that we would not experience in Ireland.  I think the Americanisation of the Irish and the organisation that Americans bring just brings the thing to a different level.  It is really heartwarming to go and see it.  It is staggering that they play 550 games on 17 pitches over four days.  Even with the North American finals for adults the first game of the morning can start at 7.30.  I would not like to try to organise a Laois Junior B final for 7.30 in the morning but that is the way they do it.  They just go and do what has to be done.</p> <p>   In Asia at the Asian games people came from all over Asia at their own expense.  Singapore brought 11 teams, more than 220 people, to participate in the Asian games in Kuala Lumpur.  It is just mind boggling at times.  They play short sided games because of the heat and they have to organise hydration.  It is really well organised.  People fly in for the games. </p> <p>   The interesting thing about the Asian games, which is increasingly happening now, is the fact that we are now linking our games and GAA people with business.  This is a huge step forward.  I have attended the Asia Pacific Ireland Business Forum both in Croke Park and Kuala Lumpur and to see the business people interacting is fantastic.   We have now a situation where people are saying, "We are there, we are involved in business, why not do business amongst ourselves, why not find better leads for Ireland, why not just get more business done?"  A significant thing too is that because of our partnership with ConnectIreland we now reach out to a huge number of people and get people to sign up, people who are working abroad or working in companies that are thinking of locating to Europe.  ConnectIreland's message is: "Let us know please.  We will try to entice them to Ireland."  It is well known now that more than 1,000 jobs have been brought to Ireland so far by that means.  I think there are huge connections.  That is one of the spin-offs of it.  The GAA abroad is different now.  The old fashioned GAA was London, Birmingham, New York, Boston, and maybe Chicago.  Now it is spread all over America.  The interesting thing is that people abroad want to be part of it.</p><p>A total of 300 hurlers play in Milwaukee and they are organised by a Dane called Dave Olson.  They are Americans, not Irish, but they have just taken to our sport.  Hurling and camogie clubs have started up in Denver and Indianapolis.</p><p> It is a surprise to us that people would take to hurling and camogie as adults but they want to conquer what they see as a warrior sport and a sport that is carefully ruled and has definite safety regulations but also gives a chance for physical activity and skill.  It is eye-opening to see their attitude to it.  At a previous Oireachtas committee meeting when we were discussing the Sky component of the media rights deal, I related how in games I attended in Bahrain, the ladies football team from Abu Dhabi was all teachers while the team from Riyadh was all nurses.  People from Australia who saw what they were doing and saw the community spirit in the games liked them and wanted to be part of them.  I spoke to three Australian nurses in Bahrain who said that their time in Riyadh was made bearable by the fact that they not only found a wonderful sport but a wonderful community as well.  The community aspect of our games gets to people.  On the importance of broadcasting the games abroad, I quoted a nurse from Galway who said, "Seeing the games in Riyadh would be like a Band-Aid on a homesick heart".  That was a wonderful means of expressing what it meant to her.</p><p> We started in 1999 in Europe with five teams.  Mr. Joe McDonagh went across to form a county board.  I was involved in Leinster coaching at the time.  We were twinned with Europe and we saw this as something that might expand.  As Mr. Duffy said, it has grown to more than 70 clubs.  Brittany is the only place in the world where Gaelic games are on the formal school curriculum because of a partnership between a second level school and the Leinster Council.  They have formalised it.  They see Gaelic games as providing the key component for their second level schools.  We have not even managed to do that here but, hopefully, we will.  I am delighted that the Croatian ambassador is present.  Nobody would ever have envisaged that there would be an interest in Gaelic games in Croatia, so much so that the country would like to see the All Stars play at some stage.  That is an example of the impact the Irish are making abroad.  People see that our games are competitive and friendly and there is a community spirit about them.  It is also interesting that we have eight or nine clubs in Galicia, Spain and, by the end of this year, we will have 14.  They are starting up of their own volition because they see Gaelic games as a means to express their Celtic origins.  No one would ever have envisaged that.</p><p> We will be charged with finding a mechanism to guide the development of Gaelic games abroad.  We have traditional strongholds in New York, which is big, and we support Gaelic Park as well.  Then there is Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia and San Francisco.  I visited San Francisco recently and was followed out there a week later by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Deenihan.  We were looking at a ground which we could lease from the city and a complex to share with other sports.  However, a new stadium is being built there and the stadium group would like to incorporate a Gaelic games field and other sports fields in the new complex.  People are beginning to realise that the GAA has something to offer.</p><p> When the first group left Ireland and arrived in Sydney, they expected us to have a GAA field ready for them.  It took a while and we have one now but people expect that sort of response from us.  The Irish abroad want their children to play Gaelic games and that is why we have development officers.  That initiative is working well for us.  Access to the games on TV or the Internet is a vital component for us in spreading the games.  We find people want to join the games in their hundreds.  </p><p> However, the adult players who travel to populate the adults teams in the north American competitions might squeeze out the young people coming through if we do not find a balance.  We are trying to work with New York and the north American board to find that balance and to give the children of Irish emigrants and their friends and neighbours a career path from childhood to adulthood.  We get to visit the Irish centres when we are abroad but everything changes.  The centres were fantastic when the emigrants arrived.  They are old buildings, although a great deal of work has been done by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to renovate them and to make them more relevant but the difficulty is the younger transient population cannot give a commitment to these centres and to a certain extent, the GAA clubs are bolstering them at this stage.  That is part of life; things change.  The games and clubs are smaller than here but there will be more of them in the future.  However, there is no doubt that if one wants to reach the Irish abroad, the GAA club is the place to go first.  It is also important when people want to connect with home.  People know the GAA abroad will help out.</p><p> The president gives presidential awards to people who give great service not just in the context of the games but in community activity.  Approximately 20 months ago a young man from County Down, Kevin Bell, lost his life in New York.  Some fundraising was done and the residual funds became the Kevin Bell Repatriation Trust through which the bodies of people who die abroad are brought home.  This fund was started by a GAA person and, staggeringly, it has repatriated 60 bodies of young Irish people.  Mr. Duffy and I could not possibly claim credit for that.  That is not down to the GAA but it is about members of the GAA doing what they would do at home and helping out.  The advantage the GAA has is people bring their experience of home with them and they want to replicate it while building communities abroad in the same way we, as an organisation, have helped to build communities here.  In Ireland if we strengthen our communities we will strengthen our GAA clubs.  If we invest abroad, activity will expand to fit the space we provide for them.  That is why it is important to provide facilities.  It is important for us to put down roots and remain relevant for Irish communities.</p></speech>

Ireland is doing a great deal of business with China.  For example, the beef market was recently opened to us and our exports to the country are at all-time high.  There was a high profile visit of the then Vice-President of China, now President, Mr. Xi Jinping, to Croke Park.  When we visited China two years ago, he told us that the picture of him playing football in Croke Park is on his office wall.  Has the GAA been in contact with the diaspora in Shanghai, Beijing or Hong Kong to promote Gaelic games?</p></speech>

People will have to accept it will take us longer to conquer China but we are strong in those three cities.  Shanghai hosted the All Stars and it was a huge experience.  There is formal contact through Mr. Pat Daly, our games director in GAA headquarters, between UCD and a sports university in Shanghai.  While we were out there, we showed the students how to play games and they took to them instantly.  The reason is China is the country in which stick and ball games were first played.  The officials in the Chinese sports university indicated to us that the difficulty they have is they are trying to spread a coaching model for table tennis because players in other countries cannot beat them.  They want to build that sport up in the same way we are trying with Gaelic games.  Unless we build capacity in people abroad to play our games, we will never have a vibrant international competition.</p> <p>  The first world cup, which will be held the weekend after next, will be significant.  One competition will be mainly for Irish people playing Gaelic football in the areas Mr. Duffy mentioned all around the world.  There will be ten teams in each competition but there is a competition for teams from countries in which only non-Irish people will play.</p><p>At some point, native players from various countries will represent their homelands in a world cup-style Gaelic games competition.  However, that is a little down the road.</p></speech>

That story is a testament to the leadership provided by Croke Park over the years and to the volunteers who run clubs on the various continents.  Mr. O'Neill is due to complete his term of office next weekend and I compliment him on a very successful presidency.  I am sure he will enjoy the meeting of congress in Ballyconnell at the weekend.  I welcome the ongoing and important support provided by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the various groups involved.</p> <p>  We often discuss the possibility of extending votes in elections here to members of the diaspora.  It goes to show the increasing relevance and importance of the diaspora that its members will be able to vote in elections for president and other offices within the GAA in the future.  That is a welcome development.</p> <p>  Where GAA clubs abroad do not have their own playing facilities, do they encounter difficulties in terms of accessing suitable facilities?  Where public facilities are available, are they allowed to use them?  In recent years I had the opportunity to watch London senior footballers play in the qualifiers at Croke Park.  I also watched the New York women's team play in the All-Ireland junior final.  There is a major cost involved in such teams travelling here to compete in the end stages of championships or whatever.  Is the GAA in a position to provide financial assistance to the clubs - or counties, if one wants to refer to them in that way - which reach the ultimate stages of competitions?</p> <p>  F&eacute;ile na nGael is an important event in the GAA's calendar.  I recall attending it in Cavan many years ago, when both New York and London were represented.  Is the GAA able to encourage greater participation in F&eacute;ile na nGael on the part of clubs from the various continents?</p> <p>  Mr. O'Neill stated that GAA clubs have taken on the role previously played by county associations in the past.  From attending county association meetings in Cavan and Monaghan, I am aware that, unfortunately, the age profile has increased substantially.  I would not like the county associations to go out of existence.  I hope that the existing architecture can be maintained and that there is a good working relationship between clubs and county associations.  I am aware that they do not exactly dovetail with each other but it would be important that as great a level of co-operation as possible be maintained.</p> <p>  Reference was made to Gaelic Park in New York.  For those of us who spent time working in that city when we were students, Gaelic Park was our refuge at weekends for many years.  Is that facility still privately owned or is it owned by the New York county board?</p> <p>  Deputies Quinn, Durkan and I, among others, have raised the issue of the long wave radio service to Britain on previous occasions.  RTE has indicated its intention to retain the service for a period.  In that context, it was mentioned that funding from the emigrant support programme could assist in ensuring that the service will continue.  I do not believe we should go down that route.  Huge demands will always be placed on the emigrant support programme, the funding from which is put to very good use.  I presume our guests have made their concerns with regard to the continuation of the long wave radio service known to RTE.  Many people who are based in Britain and elsewhere, and even those north of the Border, are reliant on the service in order to obtain GAA results from home.  I hope our guests will continue to exert pressure on RTE in the context of ensuring that the service remains in place.</p> <p>  What our guests outlined in their presentation speaks for itself, it is a marvellous success story.  I wish Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael continued success.</p></speech>

The GAA is actively seeking UNESCO heritage status in respect of hurling, which would be great and which would underline the uniqueness of the sport.  Will our guests outline the process involved in this regard and how such status will benefit both hurling and the GAA?  Is there anything the committee could do to assist the process?</p> <p>  Our guests referred to outreach programmes in communities.  In some instances, the areas in which clubs abroad are based are not necessarily home to Irish communities any longer.  How do the outreach programmes operate in such circumstances?  On the question of the relationship between clubs and Irish embassies abroad, will our guests provide examples of the close co-operation that exists between the two?  I am aware that the GAA is involved - in the context of using its contacts, etc. - in the movement for immigration reform in the US.  Will our guests comment further on that matter?</p> <p>  On the investment in club infrastructure, including pitches, abroad, has there been any negativity from Irish politicians or others in society here in that regard?  Members should really declare their interest in respect of this matter because many of us a strong supporters of Gaelic games.  I can understand why the deal with Sky in respect of broadcasting rights is popular among those abroad, and I can see the benefits involved, but I do not believe that many people in Ireland would agree with it.</p></speech>

I take this opportunity to congratulate them on the evolution of Gaelic games into worldwide sports.  We are all more conscious than ever of the fact that we live in a global community.  It is appropriate, therefore, that the GAA has responded in the way that it has by spreading its wings in international terms.  There is more to be done in that regard.  The availability of coverage of GAA matches virtually worldwide is, as our guests noted, a hugely important development.  People like to feel that they can touch base with home regardless of where they find themselves and modern technology allows them to do so.</p> <p>  I also wish to congratulate the GAA - and the other sporting organisations - in promoting the national image.  People throughout the country travel all over the place to watch GAA, soccer and rugby matches.  This is because we have a great interest in sport.  In that context, I should welcome what is fast becoming our next national game, namely, cricket, and the fact that we are lending players to neighbouring countries in order that they might lead their teams.  What I want to do here is emphasise the huge importance of using sport as a means of expanding our culture worldwide.  I completely agree with what Mr. O'Neill said in respect of promoting business and industry through the medium of sport, which is also very important.  A huge amount of work has been done in promoting our national image abroad in recent years and it has been of huge benefit to both the Irish psyche and the country's economy.  I fully support what Deputy Smith had to say with regard to the retention of the long wave radio service to the UK.  I can see the relevant radio mast from my back door and I am aware that it is doing no harm whatsoever.  Long may the service it facilitates continue.</p></speech>

I have had an opportunity to read through the presentation and I congratulate both of our guests on it.  I wish to endorse the comments that have already been made.  In the interests of brevity, I recognise all of the issue so accurately outlined by our guests.  I wish Mr. O'Neill well in the final few days of his presidency.  It seems that no time has passed since our first meeting following his coming to office.</p> <p>  I wish to make two points.  I ask our guests to reflect upon them and perhaps over the next couple of years Mr. Duffy will consider how the relationships involved might be consolidated.  The Irish constitute the biggest European tribe in the world.  Germans constitute the largest ethnic group in the United States but its members do not recognise each other for all sorts of reasons.</p><p>The biggest tribe is the Chinese and the second biggest is the Indians.  We are the next in terms of networking.  </p><p> The GAA has brought a dimension to networking that I do not think anybody could have predicted and its scale clearly surprises itself.  </p><p> In terms of ConnectIreland, the business network, we need an Irish salesperson in every village in the world.  As Sean Lemass famously said, the world does not owe Ireland a living; we must earn it.  I refer to the globalised world market and having that kind of connection, like in Milwaukee where Danes have come into contact with Ireland.  If we can turn people into sales people for Ireland, provided our product is good and people want to buy it, then our children and our grandchildren will have a living in a global economy.</p><p> The funding comes from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  What can we do?  What do the witnesses think we should explore or examine to consolidate that?  I am thinking about 20 years or 30 years into the future rather than 20 back.  I say "Well done" to the GAA.</p></speech>

We had a meeting with the ambassadors in January.  One of the suggestions made at the breakfast Mr. Niall Burgess hosted was that we would set up a small working group comprising the GAA and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to address the kind of issues about which the Deputy spoke, namely, how we can assist the Department in its work and how it can assist us.  That is a fair point and the kind of question that underpinned the agreement.</p></speech>

Many of us would not be as aware of the extent of the international presence of the GAA.  Have the witnesses ever approached a television station to broadcast information on what is happening abroad, because it would be an extremely interesting programme?  It could perhaps show matches or snippets of matches that have taken place, especially the more high profile matches.</p> <p>  Do the civic authorities abroad fund or assist the work of the GAA?  I presume they would in New York.  Internationally, do they recognise the contribution the GAA makes to their communities?  How self-sufficient are the clubs currently?  Does the GAA have to supplement the activities, including the games and the extracurricular activities of the clubs abroad?  What is the level of self-sufficiency?  I can fully understand it contributing to the development of those clubs but does it have to contribute to the running, organisation and management of the clubs?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-25a.808" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1030" speakername="Eric Byrne" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015022500002#F00600"><p>I thank both contributors.  I come from a rather different background in terms of sporting activity.  As a young student in Synge Street, I think I had a reaction against the GAA because if the Christian Brothers saw us playing soccer, which was the game we used to play on the streets around Portobello, we suffered badly.  For a long time, I had a negative reaction to the Christian Brothers and the GAA because they were synonymous with each other for penalising us poor working class kids in Portobello.</p> <p>  Once I got involved in politics, I discovered the likes of the Liffey Gaels, the Lorcan O'Toole club, the Good Counsel club on Davitt Road and the St. James's Gaels.  To think the GAA is a purely voluntary and amateur organisation, and to think that what we were presented with today is as a result of a grassroots movement, is mind-boggling.  I congratulate the organisation and say I hold no ill-will from the days of my deviant youth.</p> <p>  As politicians, we are anxious to bring back as many as possible of our diaspora.  Clubs in Ireland have been decimated because of emigration.  Are there any good examples of indigenous people in the countries in which we have all these clubs engaging in the process?  In the long term if people return, would they be replaced by indigenous populations?  Do the witnesses think the games are sufficiently attractive to absorb indigenous people?</p> <p>  We are all sports fans.  That the Irish cricket team won its match against the United Arab Emirates today is a phenomenal success and as sporting people, we should congratulate it.</p> <p>  The GAA is looking after the Irish diaspora throughout the world but we have a different diaspora in Ireland.  We have just created 70,000 citizens who come from 160 different nations.  I am familiar with the name of Jason Sherlock who is Vietnamese-Irish.  I congratulate the GAA and just as the schools are absorbing this cultural diversity, I hope there will be more engagement by the new communities in Ireland in these games.</p></speech>

In particular, I congratulate Mr. Liam O'Neill on a wonderful presidency and the very fine contribution he has made to the organisation during his presidency.  The presentation highlighted an amazing success story, namely, the fact the GAA, an amateur organisation, has managed to spread the organisation throughout the world in a relatively short time to a situation where it now has more than 400 clubs overseas.  I can certainly confirm that the organisation in Milwaukee is particularly strong.  I had the pleasure of being part of a Galway delegation there some years ago and of putting on the jersey and playing against a team there.  As was rightly said, it is mainly Americans who are playing the game there.</p> <p>  I very much welcome the fact a very strong relationship has developed between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the GAA which has the potential to forge very strong business and commercial links between Ireland and our diaspora.  What is particularly wonderful about the strength of the GAA abroad is the connectivity it provides between people who are living and working abroad and keeping them in touch with what is happening.</p> <p>  We talked here previously about having a formalised system where we could permanently keep in touch with our diaspora through a dedicated website or whatever.  The GAA should be central to any plans we have to strengthen the links and to keep in regular contact with the diaspora.  I wish the GAA continued success in its endeavours.  I look forward to seeing the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade forging stronger links with the organisation and seeing the GAA continuing to grow in every corner of the world.</p></speech>

Ba mhaith liom tr&eacute;asl&uacute; le Liam O'Neill go pearsanta as ucht an jab at&aacute; d&eacute;anta aige &oacute; thaobh cur chun cinn na Gaeilge le roinnt blianta, fad agus a bh&iacute; s&eacute; mar uachtar&aacute;n.  Bh&iacute; an-&aacute;thas orm &eacute; a cloiste&aacute;il ar Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta maidin D&eacute; Luain agus a cloiste&aacute;il go bhfuil gradam faoi leith le bronnadh air.  Is maith an aghaidh air &eacute;, mar t&aacute; an-obair d&eacute;anta aige &oacute; thaobh cur chun cinn na Gaeilge.  Maidir leis na clubanna thar lear, t&aacute; cuid mhaith acu as Chonamara, as T&iacute;r Chonaill agus as &aacute;iteanna eile agus t&aacute; Gaeilge acu.  T&aacute; na clubanna ar fud na t&iacute;re seo ag cur chun cinn na Gaeilge, ach c&eacute;n deis at&aacute; ann &oacute; thaobh cur chun cinn na Gaeilge ar fud na cruinne maidir leis an bhforbairt at&aacute; dh&aacute; dh&eacute;anamh?</p> <p>  Although Mr. O'Neill and Mr. Duffy have sold themselves well here, I think they have undersold themselves a little.  One benefit I have noticed from visiting some of the clubs abroad is the social benefit.  There are two elements to this.  One is the social aspect, the music, the culture and the language, while the other relates to emigrants abroad who have found themselves on hard times.  They might be out of work and be finding it difficult to adapt to their new lives and their new homes.  The GAA plays a central role in this, but does it have a formal role?  Is there training available to club and board members to help deal with people who might suffer from depression or feel down?  We have heard that some people get into trouble with drugs, alcohol, etc.  The GAA has good programmes on these issues here, but are these programmes extended abroad?</p> <p>  I heard a fantastic interview this morning on Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta about liathr&oacute;id l&aacute;imhe, handball.  This has not been mentioned yet today, but teams will  travel from Connemara to Canada in the next couple of weeks to play in international competition.  Handball is a more accessible game to be exported.  Can our guests tell us more about the success of exporting handball through the clubs as an international sport?  </p> <p>  Ar&iacute;s, tr&eacute;asla&iacute;m bhur gcuid oibre libh.

I have a vested interest in this issue.  I am a member of Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael and had the privilege of being on the first comhairle programme with Liam O'Neill, an t-uachtar&aacute;n.  I compliment and pay tribute to Liam O'Neill as he comes to the end of his term of office as uachtar&aacute;n on the way in which he has quietly and effectively brought our games to all parts of the world.  He and P&aacute;raic Duffy have transformed how our Gaelic games are transmitted and covered and ensured the diaspora can, at the flick of a switch, watch our games.</p> <p>  Senator Mullins mentioned connectivity and one of the best things the GAA has done has been to make our games available to the diaspora.  I know from having been abroad recently that in a city such as Taipei or other vast cities, Irish people are delighted to be able to see these games and to have that connection with home.  Our Gaelic games are a manifestation of our Irishness.  We have had a fantastic president of the GAA in Liam O'Neill.  He has visited almost every club and parish in the country during his term and has put people at the front during his presidency, in particular those abroad. The GAA is very important to Irish people all over the world now.</p> <p>  I note that the photograph used in the presentation is a picture of the airport departure gates, but there is a big change in this regard now.  I have been talking to people in New York about new developments there, where we will have a fantastic showpiece for Gaelic games there and for North America.  Under the stewardship of Mr. P&aacute;raic Duffy, we have seen the Government improve the link to the diaspora abroad through the emigrant support programme.  It is important to look at this in the context that the GAA is about people and the players that play our games.  The impact of this on the diaspora cannot be underestimated.  It is not just about playing the game.  Traditionally abroad, Sunday morning was about going out to watch the Sunday game, but now it is a whole social setting, with Irish people coming together.  Sometimes people are lonely and homesick, do not have work, have no money or have issues with addiction.  Now, they have a great support network within the GAA abroad.  I am pleased that in many parts of the world, Irish people involved in CLG lend support in a professional way by helping people get jobs or find housing.  There is solidarity among them.  Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael is also involved in the passing on of our culture our games and the Irish language. </p> <p>  When I knew Mr. P&aacute;raic Duffy and Mr. Liam O'Neill were here, I did not want to let the occasion pass without congratulating them on their work.  It is easy to be blas&eacute; about the support and commitment given to people, but we must commend the way in which the GAA abroad builds a structure, the club, and puts in place a social infrastructure that makes it personal to the people.  This would not be possible without the support of the funding partnership or the commitment of people like Liam and P&aacute;raic.  I congratulate Liam O'Neill on his successful term of office.  He has come a long way since we were on the comhairle programme and has probably done much better than I have.  I commend him and thank him for his great work.</p></speech>

It is when the business is done that Kerry comes to the fore.  I welcome Liam O'Neill and P&aacute;raic Duffy to this meeting.  As a chairman of the Kenmare Shamrocks hurling and Gaelic club for five years, from the age of 27, I learned more in that committee room than I have learned in this committee room, with all respect to the Chairman.  I often found GAA committees far more political than politics, because there was so much passion involved.  The Kenmare club has a distinct and unique record in that our players were the first to play in Holbrook in New Jersey in a hurling match in 1857, in the same field where baseball was founded.  We were ahead of our time in that regard.  Kenmare men like Se&aacute;n Price and Collie Mathers who is not from Kenmare but whom we will give an honorary title, are still developing GAA games in the US, through having Shannon Gaels' new grounds on Long Island.</p> <p>  The diaspora has come to the fore since the global economic forum.  I was appointed by my party leader as the first spokesperson on the diaspora in the Seanad because we believe it is important our many citizens living overseas should have a voice at home and Fianna F&aacute;il was the first party to call for a Minister for the diaspora.  I am glad that Deputy Deenihan has been appointed to that post and he has been doing a great job since.  The GAA has been the minister for the diaspora for the past 100 years and more.  What does the GAA believe the Government and future Ministers should be doing in the long term?  The GAA has delivered on the sporting end, but not just in that area.  As colleagues have pointed out, this is also about health, mental health, jobs.  Anybody looking for a job abroad turns up at the GAA club and will probably get a job that way.  What should the new Ministry be doing for the diaspora?  The GAA has the best built-in network of any organisation and is probably best placed to advise on this, with all due respect to the Department.</p></speech>

I am glad Deputy Byrne has forgiven the Christian Brothers.</p> <p>  We are working in many countries and we welcome people coming in and joining our clubs.  This ties up with the promotion of Gaeilge also.  We have a talent competition called Sc&oacute;r.  It was set up purely to promote Irish culture and heritage and some of our acts are based on these.  We have solo song, recitation, a drama or l&eacute;iri&uacute; and music competitions.  However, we have changed the competitions somewhat.  We felt that while we have a brief to promote our language and culture, we cannot continue to be a monocultural organisation in a multicultural society.  Therefore, we have changed our rules significantly and now if people want to recite, sing or dramatise something, it can be something from the history, mythology or culture of Ireland or of the country of origin of the person participating.</p><p>We recognise that the competition has to be inclusive because if people from abroad come to our clubs, we have to accept their right to perform their activities.  Our decision to open up this competition is a significant step.  While not everyone agreed with it, it has now been accepted that we are trying to open up the GAA in every possible way.  </p><p> As regards being inclusive on our teams, reference was made to Jason Sherlock.  In 1949, when County Laois last qualified for a senior hurling final, the captain was a man called Paddy Ruschitzko, which is not a Laois name.  Paddy had Polish origins and my county was very proud to have him as our captain.  This has been going on for a long time.  People from abroad who join our clubs are made welcome.  The GAA is delighted to be an inclusive organisation. </p><p> Shannon Gaels in New York are entering our Sc&oacute;r competitions.  The Gl&oacute;r na nGael competition to which Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh referred also has a best club award with a prize of &euro;1,000.  We are delighted that people are beginning to assert their language and culture through GAA clubs.</p><p> Deputy Neville asked whether the civic authorities abroad recognise the work being done by the GAA.  This is a difficulty because most facilities on the Continent are owned by municipal or local authorities, which means recognition is required to use them.  It is difficult to secure recognition in all 27 member states of the European Union and non-EU countries.  We could liaise with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to ascertain whether we could address this issue together.  Clubs also experience difficulties opening bank accounts abroad because different rules apply in different countries.  The GAA's presence in such a large number of countries creates a challenge.  It may be argued that we should be able to get around this, but good governance and transparency are also necessary, and it is best that we ensure that is the case.  This is a difficulty which can be overcome.</p><p> I was pleased to hear Deputy Quinn's comment that we need someone in every city to connect with the GAA.  ConnectIreland is the means by which we can achieve this.  The GAA would not claim to be doing this alone.  While we were reasonably successful when doing this work alone, the position changed when the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade recognised what we were doing and decided to support us.  This was a major boost to our collective confidence, as it demonstrated to the authorities abroad with which we were dealing that the Department was working side by side with us.  This stamp of approval was a significant step. </p><p> Mr. Duffy referred to the funding of &euro;2.9 million provided by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The GAA also provides &euro;5.8 million in funding.  In allocating this funding to the GAA, the Department recognised that we are doing good work and acting as a conduit through which good ideas could flow back and forward.  We are most happy with this. </p><p> As to how we could all work together and plan for the next 20 years, we must get serious about working in partnership.  Mr. Duffy indicated that this process has started.  We must row in behind it and ensure everyone is made aware of what is happening.  We also need to have achievable and measurable objectives.  People will then see us working together.  Irish people are great and can achieve great things on their own, but when we get together we can achieve a hell of a lot more.  That is the key message I wish to send today.  We are open for business and partnership, as is the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  It is a matter of finding the means to develop a cohesive plan and work together.  Given our reach - and I say this in all modesty - the GAA can be a force for good among the Irish community abroad and in the communities in which Irish emigrants live.  We are fiercely proud of this. </p><p> The F&eacute;ile competitions were mentioned and the need to bring people from abroad.  While the games must be organised in a way that allows people to take part, we cannot subsidise everyone taking part in a game.  We give a large subsidy to the continental youth games in North America.  We had an international minor tournament which we dropped in the early 2000s and we are heavily subsidising the all-Britain competitions because we regard those as focused.  We are also delighted to augment funding from the Department of Foreign Affairs for development officers abroad.  Partnership is what matters in this regard because people on the ground are much better placed than we are.  It is preferable to have people who will augment what the volunteers are doing and add value to it.  That is the beauty of how this works.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-25a.818" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P&aacute;raic Duffy" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015022500002#H00200"><p>I will respond to a few questions that Mr. O'Neill did not cover.  Deputy Brendan Smith asked a question about Gaelic Park.  The landlord of Gaelic Park is Manhattan College, the university that adjoins Gaelic Park.  The GAA has a very good relationship with the college.  We have a long-term lease, and a 3G pitch was developed on the grounds not long ago.  There is also a process under way to develop a community centre with community facilities such as a bar and restaurant.  Gaelic Park is still very much at the heart of the GAA in New York and, as I noted, the GAA has a long-term lease on the property in partnership with Manhattan College.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked a question about RTE's longwave radio service.  The GAA has been supportive of the campaign to retain the longwave channel in the United Kingdom from the outset, for the simple reason that it provides a very important service for older Irish emigrants.  For many emigrants, listening to RTE, including its coverage of Gaelic games, is extremely important.  We have been very supportive of the campaign throughout.</p> <p>  A question was asked about whether there has been any opposition from clubs in Ireland to the increasing funding for international activities.  While there has not been much opposition, there is an awareness of the issue.  The GAA has limited resources and, as with the Government and everyone else, we could do with more money.  For this reason, we must use what funds we have as best we can.  Last year we invested &euro;2 million in Ruislip, and we provided &euro;500,000 in funding to Shannon Gaels just a couple of months ago.  Clubs in Ireland that are seeking funding may argue that we should prioritise clubs at home.  While this has not been a major problem, it would be wrong to state that it is not an issue. </p> <p>  Deputy Eric Byrne asked a question about attracting people who move to Ireland to Gaelic games.  This has been a challenge, because soccer is the first game of most of those who move to Ireland from abroad, be it from Africa or the rest of Europe.  The reason is that soccer is the international sport with which people are most familiar.  A couple of years ago, when we brought representatives of many nationalities to Croke Park for a seminar, we found that many of them believed that one had to be Irish to play Gaelic games.  They viewed Gaelic games as exclusively Irish.  This is changing, however, especially as children go to primary schools and start to play our games.  I have seen evidence of this in it Croke Park in recent years.  In the next few years, we will see many more players of African or continental European extraction playing Gaelic games.  This is a slow process that is developing as people from abroad become part of the community.  As those with refugee status integrate in the community, we will see more of them playing Gaelic games.  Nevertheless, it remains a challenge because people from abroad are not familiar with Gaelic games. </p> <p>  A very good point was made about the GAA's role in providing assistance in the area of mental health.  This is one of the issues we discussed in our meeting with Irish ambassadors.  Anne Anderson, our ambassador to Washington, emphasised that one of the major challenges the embassy faces in the United States is that of Irish people abroad who have mental health issues or are down and out and experiencing other problems.  Croke Park now has a very strong health and well-being section.  We employ four people who work full-time on mental health, health and well-being and so forth.  Many of the resources we have developed in this area could be used by our clubs abroad.  One of the issues we intend to explore with the Department of Foreign Affairs is how clubs abroad could utilise some of the skills we have developed for clubs here.  We have not yet taken these programmes outside Ireland.  It was an issue about which Ms Anderson was enthusiastic and it is something we need to do.  The working group we have with the Department of Foreign Affairs will examine this issue.  </p> <p>  To briefly address a question asked by Deputy Brendan Smith, one of the problems the GAA faces abroad is the issue of bank accounts.  The cultures abroad differ greatly.  For example, it is very difficult for our clubs to open bank accounts in China, whereas it is relatively straightforward to do so in other countries where one might expect it to be difficult.  There is also a significant disparity in terms of the availability of facilities and the level of support available.  Apart from New York and, to some degree, Britain, we have not had any success in securing funding from governments abroad.  In terms of opening bank accounts, renting facilities and so forth, the position varies greatly depending on location.  No single description fits all countries.</p></speech>

Hurling is unique and everybody from abroad who watches it is taken by the game.  I am sure everyone present will have had the same experience.</p><p>The hurling we have had in recent years has brought that home.  It is unique, something which is being recognised more and more.  We are currently involved in a number of European projects with the European Union, in terms of keeping alive and recording the skills of the game.  For us, there is a major advantage in the recognition of hurling as a unique warrior game in terms of spreading the sport.  It also has advantages in terms of funding to protect the future of the game.  That is dependent on the Government recognising the conventions.  It is one area where the committee could be of some assistance.  </p></speech>

There is a very good relationship between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the ambassadors abroad, the consulates general and the GAA.  It is important to put on the record that we appreciate the support they give to our clubs abroad, in terms of attending functions, opening doors, getting around red tape and so on.  The Department and its representatives abroad have been very good, and I want to put that on the record today.</p></speech>

Everywhere we go I have to commend the work done by our consulates, embassies and ambassadors.  They will always give priority to the GAA to ensure that we see the work it and local clubs are doing.  No matter what reception one attends on our behalf, young GAA players always attend.  The &euro;3 million the Department has given to the GAA over the past number of years was money well worth spending.  Obviously, it works in partnership, which is extremely important.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Neill's legacy will be that he extended the games worldwide, in particular in the media.  That is something for which he will be remembered.  That is extremely important for most members of our diaspora.  We saw a match live in Hanoi some time ago.  I am sure that is happening all over the place.  Technology has moved on very quickly.  It will be part of the legacy he leaves as uachtar&aacute;n Chumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael.  </p> <p>  Are the members okay with that?  I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank the witnesses for coming before the committee.  They have given us some very interesting facts on their work abroad and the number of people on board.  It is good to hear that the GAA is extending the facility for the diaspora for those suffering from stress and other problems.  Many of the Irish abroad suffer from stress and mental health problems.  As the witnesses said, some of the centres in the US are in old buildings and there is always a new way of doing things.  We always have to be learning.  The GAA's role in that area has been extremely important and for that I commend the witnesses.  </p> <p>  We will keep in touch and the presentation has been important to us.  We have learned something, as I am sure have those watching the proceedings, about the important role Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael plays all over the world and at home.  For that we thank it.  The witnesses have dealt with all of the questions very comprehensively and we look forward to keeping in touch with them regarding other issues which will affect the committee.  </p> <p>  We will go into private session for the rest of the meeting.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

I am from the Philippines and I have lived and worked in Ireland for 11 years.  I am undocumented.  In 2004, I looked at my children and asked myself, "Can I give them a good life or will they be the same as me, working hard but getting nowhere?".  As a father, one does not want to see that.  One wants to give one's children a good future, so I left the Philippines and came here.</p> <p>  For my first six years in Ireland, I worked in maintenance, cleaning and painting.  We call it a 3D job, that is, dirty, difficult and dangerous.  I was not paid much, but the employer promised me a work permit and I was learning a lot, so I stayed.  It was not until I came to the MRCI for advice that I discovered there had never been any chance of getting me a work permit.  I am now working as a carer, looking after an elderly person.  I have been working as a carer for over four years.  I have always worked for the 11 years I have been here.</p> <p>  When I first left the Philippines my youngest was five years of age.  He kept asking me when I was coming back.  He is 17 years of age now and has not stopped asking.  He wants to be a pilot, and he has the grades and is doing well in school.  That is the reason I am still here, to continue to fund my youngest child's education to give him the opportunities I never had.  With the money I have earned here, my two daughters have gone to college.  One has a degree in IT, the other in midwifery.  I put my sister-in-law through college and supported my parents when my father&rsquo;s heart condition stopped him from working. </p> <p>  This month last year my father passed away suddenly, during a routine operation.  The last time I saw him was in 2004, when I left the Philippines to come to Ireland for work.  Not being there for his funeral was one of the hardest times in my life.  Watching it on Skype and being unable to comfort my mother was difficult beyond words.  My family is in the Philippines.  I am a foreigner there now.  It breaks my heart.</p> <p>  This is where I live and work, I have friends here.  I am still supporting my children so they can finish their education.   I am in the same situation as the thousands of undocumented Irish in the United States.  My story is their story.  We have the very same hopes and dreams, and we too deserve a chance to regularise our status.  We are calling for a reasonable solution.  We could come forward, pay a fee, and have our situations assessed on a case-by-case basis.  It would be transparent, straightforward and fair. </p> <p>  I am very happy to be here today to share my story but I am one of thousands of people in this situation.  We are a asking for a chance to be recognised and contribute more formally to Irish society.  We are not recent arrivals to Ireland.  We are here long-term, have put down roots and are making a valuable contribution.  We have been calling for regularisation for over seven years.  We believe it is time for change.</p><p>We would love to see the same political leadership of the kind President Barack Obama has shown in the US.  I know that members of this committee values fairness, equality and justice and I hope they will support our recommendation for the introduction of a regularisation scheme in Ireland in the lifetime of this Government.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-25a.836" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Lowry" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015022500002#B00200"><p>The MRCI was set up in 2001 and has been working with undocumented migrants since then.  We operate a very busy city-centre drop-in service that provides information and support.  From May 2009 to October 2014, we provided information and support to 2,644 undocumented migrants from 96 different countries, all living here on average eight years.   We established the Justice for the Undocumented campaign group just over four years ago in an effort to progress a policy solution and advocate for change in this area.  To date, successive Governments have not done a huge amount to address the situation of undocumented migrants.  This is increasingly worrying in a diverse Ireland where there has been inward migration for over 15 years and where undocumented migrants and their families have put down roots and make a valuable contribution.  The improved economy and significant length of time undocumented migrants have lived here make this an opportune time to bring about a comprehensive solution.</p> <p>  It is clearly not possible to categorically state the number of undocumented migrants in Ireland.  However, it is possible to make a well-informed estimate, which is clearly critical in the planning of any policy response.  We appreciate that and have done a lot of work in this area.  Based on research carried out by the MRCI, we estimate that there are between 20,000 and 26,000 undocumented migrants living and working in Ireland.   We can provide a breakdown of how we devised this figure.  In our experience, the vast majority of undocumented migrants have entered Ireland legally and have been working and living here for many years.  Our survey of over 540 undocumented migrants found that over 92% of people entered the country legally and became undocumented afterwards.</p> <p>  People can become undocumented migrants for a variety of reasons.  Undocumented migrants in Ireland can be broadly described under the following categories.  Clearly these need careful consideration and inclusion in any potential regularisation scheme.  They include visa "over stayers", including tourists, people from non-visa required countries, student visa holders and others; migrants with un-enforced deportation orders who are not in a position to leave the State; and children of undocumented migrants.  We estimate there are between 2,000 and 5,000 children of undocumented migrants in Ireland.  We are particularly concerned about their precarious future growing up in a country where they have a very uncertain future.  </p> <p>  In a similar fashion to the undocumented Irish in the US, there is a lot of stress and fear associated with being undocumented.  We find that the people with whom we work encounter significant problems in accessing basic and essential services.  We are particularly concerned about the high rate of non-compliance and workplace exploitation experienced by people who are working.  It is very hard to advocate for one's employment rights when one is being deported.  Undocumented migrants fear the authorities, in particular the Garda, and are reluctant to report crimes such as domestic violence, theft and racist incidents for fear of detection.  The MRCI is particularly concerned about the vulnerable situation of the children of undocumented migrants, some of whom are born here and some of whom came here at a young age.  They are growing up and going to national and secondary school here and face very uncertain futures.  To them, Ireland is very much home.  </p> <p>  I mentioned the research.  We have circulated the infographic and the research we did.  We have put a lot of work into that research, which was carried by out by Mr. Montenegro, his colleagues and ourselves in the MRCI.  It was the first research of its kind in the country and carried out with over 540 undocumented migrants.   The research speaks for itself but I will highlight a few statistics.  We found that 81% of undocumented migrants have been living in Ireland for five years or longer and one in five for over a decade; 87% of people were in employment and 92% were not in a formal legal process to regularise their situations.  We are finding that many people are in employment.  A total of 70% of the respondents were also working over 30 hours per week, many of them in minimum wage jobs that are essential to keep our economy and society functioning, such as restaurant and catering, domestic work, cleaning and maintenance.  </p> <p>  The findings of this research paint a very similar picture to that of undocumented Irish living and working in the US.  Having worked directly with undocumented migrants in Ireland for over 14 years, we firmly believe it is time to look closer to home - a diverse and multicultural Ireland where migrants and their families have put down roots.  Mr. Montenegro ha spoken eloquently about the fact that he has the same struggles, hopes and dreams as the undocumented Irish in the US.  As somebody who works with the undocumented, I am regularly humbled by the significant sacrifices undocumented families we work with are making to ensure their children and extended family members have opportunities in life that they did not.</p> <p>  We appreciate that our leaders, delegates and committee members will be travelling to the US, particularly around St Patrick's Day, for a number of reasons, one of which will be to highlight the situation of the undocumented migrants, and we commend this.  We would like to bring their gaze closer to home in terms of the situation of undocumented migrants here.  </p> <p>  The MRCI is about working on problems and offering solutions.  We have put forward a proposal to introduce regularisation.  We believe the situation can best be addressed through the introduction of policy measures allowing for the administration of a once-off, time-bound regularisation scheme.  This scheme could be implemented in tandem with other solutions for those living in direct provision, etc.  A scheme such as this could be introduced as part of a policy package and does not require legislation.  I hear that this is an important point.  The Irish Born Child and Undocumented Workers schemes were two examples of common sense schemes that were introduced as part of a managed migration policy.  We see this scheme as being pragmatic, enforceable, clear and fair and one that responds to rather than rewards illegality.  </p> <p>  There needs to be clear criteria to identify people and to administer the scheme in the Department of Justice and Equality so we have suggested that the following criteria could apply.  The first criterion is length of time in the State.  All persons resident in Ireland for four years would be eligible to register for the scheme.  The second criterion is a criminal bar.  Similar to other programmes implemented in OECD countries, of which there are many, and the EU, this scheme would exclude all persons with a serious criminal conviction.   The third criterion is the implementation a probationary period.  We have suggested this because it gives migrants a window of time to register for the scheme and potentially pay a fee.  They are temporarily regularised and enter a two-year probationary period much like the successful student probationary extension scheme of 2004.  This serves a number of purposes.  It gives the Department an opportunity to administer the scheme.  We appreciate this will take some people hours and a bit of organisation.  It serves as a protection element upholding the integrity of the immigration system, gives the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service and the Department control over the process and puts in place a number of conditions that applicants must satisfy in order to secure residency.  During the probationary period, undocumented migrants would be issued with a temporary status or visa, have the right to work without a work permit so they could formalise their employment situation and have the right to travel to a maximum of three months of the year - possibly back to their home country.  </p> <p>  The MRCI estimates that the administration of such a scheme will cost &euro;3 million.  However, the projected income from the scheme would far exceed this.  We believe the scheme will bring in an annual income in excess of &euro;7.5 million through direct taxation.  A once-off fee will generate over &euro;11.5 million.  Ongoing immigration registration fees will generate an annual income of &euro;5 million.  Finally, income brought in through employer PRSI contributions will generate &euro;20 million per year.  In total, this scheme has the potential to generate &euro;185 million over five years, which is a conservative estimate.  This offsets any resource implications for the introduction of such a scheme and contributes significantly to the tax purse.  Such as scheme would have other benefits of which members of the committee will be very aware in the context of communities and social cohesion.  Many members are in constituencies with very diverse communities.  These benefits include security, keeping in step with international practice and humanitarian concerns.  We also believe it is the right and responsible thing to do.  </p> <p>  We have a number of recommendations for action.  The MRCI is calling on the Minister for Justice and Equality to introduce a once-off, time-bound regularisation scheme with transparent criteria in the lifetime of the current Government.   The MRCI very much hopes that the committee can support this recommendation.  To progress this matter, we respectfully propose either that the committee appoints a rapporteur to work with the MRCI and others to develop a set of recommendations to put forward to the Minister or that the MRCI could submit a formal proposal with the recommendation to the committee for review and endorsement to the Minister.</p> <p>  We again thank the committee for its time today.</p></speech>

I listened to the piece on Newstalk this morning and I found it very moving and I have now also heard his evidence here today.  We often hear about the opening of floodgates and huge numbers coming in.  If Irish people with concerns about this heard the testimony of Mr. Montenegro they would realise that it is the testimony of any Irish family, particularly families across the west.  That region has been heavily affected by emigration.  We argue for the regularisation of our own citizens who have had to leave and are based in the United States.  These people have missed funerals, weddings and family occasions.  The arguments we heard today are the same arguments we make to Americans when we visit the United States.</p> <p>  The proposals the MRCI has put together are reasonable.  They concern people who have been in this country for a length of time and who have contributed to our economy.  The centre has also included the substantial net financial benefit to the State in the presentation.  It is clear that the centre is mindful of the concerns of some members of the public in that regard.  Based on these proposals, the concerns about an opening of the floodgates are unwarranted.  Will the witnesses address this issue further?</p></speech>

We have a common sense approach in the MCRI to the problems we encounter.  We have been working with undocumented migrants from the outset and are, therefore, very aware of how people come undocumented.  A lot of thought has been put into this including a lot of research in terms of the concept of a regularisation.  We feel clear criteria would allay the public's fears but would also be manageable from a Department of Justice and Equality perspective.  We have found increasingly that the people with whom we are speaking and working are here long term.  They are making a contribution and working and many, though not all, are paying taxes.  We are not talking about recent arrivals.  A regularisation such as this, particularly one with a probationary period, allows an opportunity for the Department to administer the scheme.  It is almost like a safety valve which will allow the scheme to be administered and for people in that period of time to abide by certain criteria.  This is in the proposal also.  We felt that four years was a fair period.  Choices will have to be made, potentially, by the Minister for Justice and Equality and her Department on the further detail for the administration of the scheme.  It is not a once-off amnesty as such because a probationary period is built in.</p></speech>

Regularisation is, in fact, a pragmatic and fair response to a situation which has emerged over a long period of time.  In general terms, the drivers of migration are economic and family factors.  People move because of their economic needs and because they have family in the state already.  There is one example of regularisation as a pull factor.  This is along the border in the United States and is the only research which looks at the potential of regularisation.  It is a very specific place and does not correlate to an island.  There is, therefore, no relevant research that bolsters the pull-factor argument.</p></speech>

I raise these questions because of misconceptions which exist in terms of the profile of the people and the families who are here.  They are already making a huge economic contribution.  They are in our schools and have hopes and dreams and want to make a huge contribution to our future.  Will the witnesses elaborate on this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-25a.843" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Lowry" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015022500002#C00600"><p>We interviewed 540 undocumented migrants.  Some 87% were in employment and 66.5% were with the same employer for more than two years.  Almost 30% were in the same job for longer than five years.  We were surprised ourselves by the last two statistics in terms of length of time with the same employer.  We have found consistently that people are in medium to low-wage work but they are carrying out essential work.  At the moment, considering our projections, they are employed in sectors that are essential to the function of the economy and society.  They are working in the care sector, which Mr. Montenegro mentioned, and in the restaurant and catering industry.  They are involved in domestic work, looking after older people, children and people with special needs.  They are in cleaning and maintenance jobs.  People are in all types of jobs.  We have found, categorically, that the vast majority of people are working.</p> <p>  Not all people were paying tax, but over half had paid tax at some stage in their employment history.  This says a lot because, as we know with the undocumented Irish in the US, there is an inherent risk, in terms of being detected by the state, in using one's social security number, or in Ireland's case one's PPS number, and fully disclosing and paying tax.  People want to pay tax and make a contribution.  As someone from the group reminded me yesterday, people want to work.  They have no access to social welfare; it is not possible.  People also do not want to access social welfare because, in the long term, if they are applying for citizenship, it will not be viewed favourably on a citizenship application.  Therefore, in the first place, they cannot access social welfare and, in the second, they do not want to as they are here to work.  </p> <p>  I am glad Deputy Mac Lochlainn heard Mr. Montenegro's interview this morning.  He was asked what is the first thing he would do if he got his papers.  He said the first thing he would do is go home and see his children.  He would then, it is hoped, come back and finish his work here so his youngest can finish college.  We would hear the same from the vast majority of undocumented Irish in the United States.  This is the idea of circular migration, that is, being able to come and go.  People have put down roots.  This is the disconnect.  People are here long term.  We have found 81% were in Ireland a minimum of five years.  Of that figure, 40% were here over eight years and one in five were here over a decade.  These people are not recent arrivals.  They have put down roots.  There are people in the Visitors Gallery today who have two or three teenagers each.  These teenagers have finished secondary school.   One of the women has a daughter who was a straight A student.  This girl is currently unable to go to college or work.  She is having a very tough time, to say the least, because of this.  In her mind, she is Irish; she grew up in Ireland.  This is the other side to it.  People put down roots and many are in employment.</p></speech>

There is a constant fear.  One of the things which struck me about the presentation was that women who are victims of domestic violence and crime could be fearful of going to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because it would bring them to the attention of the authorities.  Will the witnesses speak about the impact of this on families?</p></speech>

They did not have a bank account so all of their savings were there.  It was &euro;900, which is a huge amount of money.  They have a small child back home.  They could not report this theft to the Garda for fear of detection and deportation.  It is a huge issue.  We come across many people who are in situations of domestic violence, but this fear exists.  We come across people who are homeless.  There is a vulnerability associated with being undocumented when it comes to earning money.  People can be exploited by their employers.  They are afraid to assert their rights in the employment relationship.  There are also more serious situations relating to violence or theft.</p></speech>

I am very supportive of the general principle of the regularisation scheme for undocumented migrants in Ireland.</p><p>The Migrant Rights Centre Ireland does excellent work and I commend its work.  It is a very difficult job and from listening to Jayson Montenegro it can sometimes be very emotional because of some of the cases the centre deals with.</p><p> My first question is about the figure of between 20,000 to 26,000 undocumented migrants.  How has this information been compiled?  I refer to the submission to the committee which states that the MCRI has dealt with 2,644 undocumented migrants from 96 different countries.  Where do the figures of 20,000 and 26,000 come from?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-25a.848" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Lowry" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015022500002#D00200"><p>We were very aware that at times we were dealing with the tip of the iceberg in terms of undocumented people.  We have very close relationships with undocumented people through trust and by word of mouth and therefore, we deal with a large number of people.  As I said earlier, we did some work to arrive at a well-calculated estimation of the numbers.  With regard to the figure of 20,000 to 26,000 persons, the information is on the public record with the Department of Justice and Equality.  For example, I refer to information on the number of persons on deportation orders since 1999, the numbers of order enforced and the numbers not enforced, which information is available to the public.  We made a calculation of the number of people who left the country voluntarily in that period, counting those in what is called the section 3 process; those people who have applied for humanitarian leave to remain; those people who have been granted that leave; those who have been refused; and those who over-stay.  These over-stayers are a more difficult category of persons to calculate.  For example, the entire Irish undocumented population in the United States are probably visa over-stayers.</p> <p>  We based our calculations on a UK report which is included in the eight-page research paper we submitted to the committee, entitled, Ireland is Home.  This contains a very good explanation of the research methodology.  The UK population structure is more similar to ours than other countries.  We used a residual methodology which has been widely accepted as an expert way of carrying out a well-estimated calculation of undocumented persons by looking at those whom we know are undocumented and then doing a percentage version from a residual methodology perspective.  That is what we used, along with our own ongoing case management system in which we document every single person who comes through our doors.  We have that kind of data for 14 years now.  We combined all that information.  There is a low, medium and high set of numbers.  We were of the view that 20,000 to 26,000 was a well-informed estimate.  In calculating the &euro;183 million contribution, we took a median number between 20,000 and 26,000 and we used 23,000 as a figure for calculation of what the actual scheme could bring in.</p></speech>

Two European studies carried out in recent years point to this number.  These studies were both commissioned by the European Commission and they have pointed to a figure of approximately 30,000.  Our figures and those reported by the European Commission show a correlation.  I refer to the CLANDESTINO project report which states the number at between 30,000 and 60,000, so we are at the lower end of that spectrum but we believe that the numbers are in the region we have stated and that information is supported by these two European projects.</p></speech>

The delegates make a very strong economic argument for a regularisation of the situation.  They state that the scheme would bring in an annual income in excess of &euro;7.5 million through direct taxation and that a once-off fee would generate &euro;11.5 million.  They state that income from PRSI contributions would generate approximately &euro;20 million.  They state that over five years this has the potential to generate &euro;180 million.  This presents a very strong argument because in the current economic climate there are issues about revenue and income.  Are the delegates confident about the figures on the income and revenue side of it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-25a.854" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Lowry" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015022500002#D00800"><p>I discussed this with Pablo Rojas Coppari who is our research officer.  We have decided on a more conservative estimate because we do not wish it to seem that we have inflated the figures more than they are proportionately.  It is important to show that this will cost money because any change costs money, but it may be that we cannot afford not to do it.  Not only does it not cost a huge amount but it can bring in a significant amount of money.</p> <p>  A large number of people are outside the formal economy.  We took the figure of 23,000 as a median and we applied the minium wage even though some undocumented people in Ireland are high income earners while many are not.  Our current study calculated on the basis of people who were not paying tax.  If people were to be brought into a scheme, into the formal economy, they will start paying tax.  That is how we arrived at the figure of &euro;7.5 million.  We were looking at an administrative fee or fine of &euro;500 for people to pay, similar to what is proposed in the United States.  When this is multiplied by 23,000 people, the sum is &euro;5 million.</p> <p>  This does not take into consideration the fact that if people enter a regularisation scheme and they are given a temporary residence while that scheme is administered, they will probably go home.  This is what happened in Jayson's case.  That will require payment for a visa.  The cost of a visa paid once a year by half of the 23,000 people could easily generate &euro;2.3 million.  The figure of &euro;5 million is conservative.  People must also pay an annual fee to GNIB over five years in order to keep their GNIB card in order and this amounts to &euro;300 a year at the moment.  There are additional figures but we wanted to show that while there may be cost implications, the economic benefits are far greater.  It is both an economic and a moral imperative.  Ireland is losing out on revenue and money is being wasted.  We are benefiting to some extent from people's labour but we are missing out on the revenue generated by their tax contribution.</p></speech>

I wish to ask about his own and his family's experience.  I was very moved by his statement that when he first left his youngest child was five and that he kept asking Jayson when was he was coming back; he is 17 now and he has not stopped asking.  The D&aacute;il is currently debating the Children and Family Relationships Bill.  There must have been a significant negative impact on Jayson, on his family and on his extended family.</p></speech>

I missed them when they were growing up.  When they are sick they call me and I cannot do anything.  At Christmas my son always asks me, "Dad, it is another Christmas again.  Can you come home?  Do I know you, Dad?" That is a difficult question for me.  "Do I know you, Dad?"  It is like my life stops when I hear that question because I do not know how to answer it.  I always say to him that it is for his future and to support day-to-day living for my family.  When my father passed away this month last year that was the hardest time in my life which I will never forget.  My Mum telephoned me to tell me I needed to pray and after two minutes she told me that my Dad had passed away.  I do not know what to do.  The hardest time was when I saw my father in his coffin on Skype.  It broke my heart.  There is a knife in my heart that I cannot remove.  I want to go home but my Mum said to me, "What about the future of your children?  Can you support it?"</p><p>I wanted to see my father in the coffin but what about the future for my children?</p></speech>

Deputy McGrath complimented Migrant Rights Centre Ireland on its work, and I thank Mr. Montenegro for bearing witness.</p> <p>  I was a documented migrant for a number of years before I became a citizen, but I never felt threatened in terms of becoming undocumented.  I felt that was because I was from the United States of America, I was white, privileged and middle class.  Equality issues arise here along with human rights issues in terms of the ethical imperative to examine the area.</p> <p>  I listened to Mr. Montenegro as he spoke.  I participated in my father's last rites through telephone.  I cannot imagine not having been able to have gone to his funeral though, so I offer him my sympathy in that regard.</p> <p>  I have many questions but I will put three.  First, has Mr. Montenegro had engagement with the Department of |Justice and Equality, and what have those discussions resulted in with regard to his proposals?</p></speech>

As our numbers grew and we started to research what a solution would look like, we had a proactive engagement with the previous Administration and the previous Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter.  The group has been before the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality regarding the introduction of a regularisation.  It has been difficult to get the issue up the political agenda.  We had a proactive engagement with members of this committee recently.  We have good working relationships with civil servants in the Department of Justice and Equality because of our drop-in centre and because we are at the coalface.</p> <p>  We got feedback on some of our proposals in terms of the possibilities, the cost and the time it would take, so we went back to the drawing board and looked at our regularisation proposal in that period.  The Administration then changed, including some of the relationships.  There was a turnover in terms of staff, and we now have a new Minister for Justice and Equality.  We are in a new phase around some of that, so it has taken us a little while to get to where we are now.</p></speech>

We have been trying to meet her for some time.</p> <p>  In terms of engaging with the Department  of Justice and Equality in the past and the civil servant end of it, we have a good working relationship because we would have campaigned for the introduction of what was the undocumented workers scheme.  That responded to people who had fallen out of the system through no fault of their own.  That was a very welcome development, but there is resistance from within the Civil Service regarding the implementation of something like that.  I cannot pretend there is not, and political will is needed to drive it forward.  That is where we need to get to because there are some blocks within the Civil Service to advancing that.</p></speech>

The witnesses have two recommendations for action, one of which is directed to us to engage, appoint a rapporteur and compile recommendations.

The Senator would have to look to European experts and bringing in organisations at a European level, although there would not be a large number of interest groups to invite.  There are groups which are interested in and support this area of work, but we do the bulk of the work in terms of supporting undocumented migrants in Ireland.</p></speech>

They mentioned direct provision a few times in their presentation, and that is being reviewed, but how can we move forward with a regularisation scheme when there are all the other challenges in terms of the direct provision issue?  Could they comment on that?</p></speech>

We are without that overarching legislation, and that is probably why we are having some of the conversations we have had about immigration reform and single procedure.  This scheme does not require legislation.  There is a proposal to clear the backlog, and people in direct provision would be supportive of that.  We see the two schemes as complementary, but what we are putting out there is more comprehensive.  It is not just for certain types.  It is the concept of being undocumented, and we are saying one of the primary criteria would be length of time in the State followed by a probationary period.  We do not believe that would be confusing but the devil would be in the detail, and we can have that conversation if we get down to the fine detail of what it would look like in its roll-out and the implication it might or might not have for people with ongoing applications.</p> <p>  We believe the current review of direct provision is timely in that we are now almost two decades into inward migration from a humanitarian and an economic perspective, and we cannot afford to ignore these issues.  It is timely and because it does not require legislation, it is an opportunity to examine it.</p></speech>

There are people in the direct provision system who are undocumented, and this clearly corresponds to that.  They may be on a deportation order, for whatever reason, that has not been enforced, so there is definitely a crossover.  They have to be mindful of each other, but there is a great opportunity in this because one probably will be enacted in the course of this Government's term.</p></speech>

There is expertise at a global level to which we would have access in terms of the Migration Policy Institute and others who have examined different forms of regularisation.  We have done a snapshot of that and used what we felt was the most relevant to it in developing our own regularisation work over the years.  There are others too.

For example, Mr. Montenegro has many friends and colleagues in Cork, so it was all-Ireland research.  I do not have the breakdown but it was predominately the greater Dublin area.</p> <p>  We know well from our drop-in centre and because between one third and a half of the people coming through our doors each year are undocumented that they are living and working in towns throughout the country.  We have people coming up from Mayo to get advice and information.  We handle a great number of phone calls.  We believe it is not just an urban phenomenon.  I have received many calls from my home town of Ballina in County Mayo because people know I work with the Migrant Rights Centre.</p><p>They work on everything from hotel and catering to community development work but are undocumented and looking for advice.

There have been 22,459 deportation orders signed, of which 4,564 were enforced.  Therefore, we can estimate that there were 17,895 non-enforced deportation orders in Ireland.  We can also estimate that the rate of voluntary return of migrants is 13.8%.  That is sourced from ongoing meetings with the Department of Justice and Equality and data we have been able to glean from the Department.  This means 2,470 people of the estimated 17,895 non-enforced deportation orders would have left Ireland voluntarily.  Therefore, an estimated 15,425 people have non-enforced deportation orders in Ireland.  That is an informed estimate.<br/><br/>With regard to people who overstay a visa, that is a more difficult figure to calculate, as I mentioned earlier.  As the committee can see from our research, over 90% of people we surveyed were not in a formal process with the State.  They are just getting on with their lives, like the Irish in the United States.  They are not in a process of legally doing something about their position.  I do not want to bore people to tears but this is important.  Those who overstay their visas are undetected migrants in the State, which include tourists, people from non-visa requirement countries, student visa holders and others.  We can make the data available to the committee afterwards.  If we use coefficients from research conducted by Gordon <i>et al</i>in 2009, entitled &quot;Economic Impact on London and UK Economy of an Earned Regularisation of Irregular Migrants to the UK&quot;, we can make a very informed estimate of the number of undetected migrants in Ireland.  We do not really use such language, although it is in the report.  The research identifies a coefficient to calculate the number of undetected migrants based on the numbers of undocumented migrants known to the authorities.  It is a residual method.  The study was pioneered in the UK but it offers the most appropriate measurement tool as the UK has the most similar immigration system, geographic boundaries and immigration flows to Ireland.<br/><br/>From this we were able to examine the 15,000 cases I mentioned with respect to deportation orders, as well as other data from the Department of Justice and Equality, to do a coefficient sample.  Based on the residual methodology, the following calculations can be made.  A low-estimate coefficient, at 9.58%, would have 1,796 cases and a medium coefficient, at 22%, would have 4,279 migrants.  This may be corresponded with numbers of undocumented people coming through the drop-in centre.  A high-estimate coefficient, at 36%, has been chosen, resulting in an estimate of 6,761 undetected migrants in Ireland.  We selected the coefficient and used it to calculate the numbers.  If we add the undetected numbers to the cases we know, we can extrapolate the number of between 20,000 and 26,000, depending on whether we use the low, medium or high coefficient.<br/><br/>The element of children is important.  Coefficients were obtained from the study to calculate the number of UK-born children as a percentage of the overall undocumented population.  These coefficients, when applied to various estimates of undocumented migrants in Ireland, generated the following figures.  There is a figure of 2,400 for the low coefficient, 3,672 for the medium coefficient and 5,100 for the high coefficient.  That is why we have indicated consistently that we estimate there is between 2,000 and 5,000 undocumented children in Ireland.  That is very difficult to estimate as children would not be registered anywhere and would not be until they are older.  That is some of the rigour behind the figures.</p></speech>

It was a very successful scheme which was time-bound and limited.  It has been put on a statutory footing and is now called the reactivation scheme, which is currently being administered by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p> <p>  One of the most recent schemes was in Belgium.  It was a broad-based scheme.  It had problems because it operated as an amnesty, which led to a major backlog.  It took approximately two years to clear that because each case had to be assessed at the point of entry.  We are proposing with the probationary period that two years will be given for the Department to assess schemes over time; it will not be a once-off consideration that could lead to a bottleneck.  That happened in the Belgian scheme, and three years afterwards some people were still not regularised, despite an entitlement to same.</p> <p>  Another learning element comes from the type of immigration status given to a person when he or she is regularised.  Part of the Belgian scheme gave people work permits and others full access to the labour market.  Those who were given work permits became undocumented again as there were major problems with getting work permits and unscrupulous employers.  What is given to people when they become regularised is very important, as we either set people up to fail or achieve something.  The key learning elements from the Belgian regularisation was not to create a bottleneck and to give a stamp that helps people realise a method of being regularised properly.</p></speech>

It may not be possible to return the person to the country from which they came.  There is the principle of non-<i>refoulement</i>.  There is a number of such countries.  Some people on a deportation order may not be returned to the country of origin because of a number of different reasons and we consider such people to be undocumented as well.

I will not make the arguments for why managed migration is a good or bad thing.  Until this becomes a political issue and there is political will behind it, the people who are there to develop and implement policies would be reticent to do so until they are directed by the Minister to do it.  The only way they can be directed is if there is political will behind it.  This is part of it.  If this committee supports the regularisation, it would naturally mean that the civil servants must come up with a solution and move.  Their role is to develop and implement an immigration system, unless they are told or directed otherwise.  It is part of a managed migration system.  In any managed migration system, all countries must do a regularisation.  There are different types of regularisation in the lifetime of their immigration history.  Some have to do more, because they do not get it right and they are bigger countries.  America must do a major one and, as we said, there are 40 different ones across the European Union.  The civil servants will react and respond to political will.</p></speech>

The Justice for the Undocumented group now has 900 members.  It was started with six people, including the man to my left and the woman to my right.  There were four other individuals.  I remember it well.  Given that it has 900 members now, we believe this work is very important.  It is a great deal more expensive to deport somebody.  Our job is to make this a problem.  People are not causing trouble here.  They are infringing on immigration policy and it is an administrative infringement.  The other issue is that we believe this is a good idea because it makes more sense economically.  From a Civil Service perspective, many would be very aware that this is a reality, but doing something about it requires political will, as Edel said.</p></speech>

I regularly meet people in my clinic who are in this situation.  It might be a work, student or holiday visa that has run out, there is a break and they do not know where to go next.  I have encountered several people who have had people supposedly helping them with their paperwork and charging them for it.  Now, when somebody comes to me with that problem whom I cannot help, I send them to the MRCI because I know there are people who are charging for help with the paperwork.  One person who came to me was told by somebody else to get a letter from me saying that the person had worked for me and that I was happy with their work.  Obviously, I could not write that letter as I am not a registered employer and the other person had not paid tax.  Do the witnesses encounter that on a regular basis?  Are the undocumented being exploited like that all the time?</p></speech>

We are working with people who are more on the margins of the labour market.  If one is non-EU migrant one requires permission to live and work in the country.  We have found a third party recruitment problem over the years, particularly for people who are in harder to reach sectors and jobs.  People are working where generally they are not members of the trade union movement because they are in less regulated sectors.  It is not all of them, but many of the people we are working with are more vulnerable to non-compliant employers, unscrupulous employers and bad recruitment practices, whether that is a third party, a company or individuals.  That has probably been part of the migration journey since the beginning of time.  One thinks of Irish labourers going abroad and their first couple of weeks' salary being given to the person who got them the job on the site.  There is a little of that as well.</p> <p>  In terms of bad practice and, perhaps, people going somewhere to get legal advice and paying for it, or poor representation in that area, we have reported and do report people, particularly if they are a registered firm or registered practitioners of the law.  There are places where one can make those complaints and have people blacklisted.</p></speech>

Is the MRCI only based in Dublin?  Does it ever do a type of roving clinic around the country?  People cannot always travel to Dublin to call to the MRCI and it is not ideal for somebody who does not have good English to speak on the telephone.</p></speech>

We do outreach to certain places around the country, such as Galway and Cork.  We did it in Gort in the past because it had a very high undocumented population.  We engage with many different organisations around the country.  In Meath and other places, we might hold information sessions for people.  However, we engage a great deal with the citizens information network and we provide a support service to that network and to the Citizens Information Board, CIB, so if there are queries locally we support those queries.  We do not have to be in every location because there are already people in those locations and we support their work.  We also work closely with community sector organisations which might also be on the ground to engage vulnerable migrants and to work with those migrants.</p></speech>

What about people with children who are here for less than three years?  What is your proposal for those?</p></speech>

The Justice for the Undocumented campaign group had many discussions about this with members and others.  It is probably the line which we can organise behind and is politically possible.  It is also realistic.  Irregular migration or being undocumented is a global reality and after a period of time most countries realise that they must do something about it.  We have been saying this for some time in our work in this area, but felt we had to put forward criteria that were realistic.  We tossed a few different ideas around, but we felt that in the case of somebody who was here for six months, a year or less than two years it was very hard to advocate that they should be in the same situation as somebody who has been here for 12 years.  That is not to say that somebody who has been here for less than four years should not be eligible for this scheme, but that is something that requires further consideration.</p></speech>

I refer you to a recent analysis we did of our drop-in centre.  We dealt with almost 2,700 people in the period May 2009 to October 2014, which is a substantial number of individuals.  They came from 96 countries and were living here for an average of eight years.  We find that people are less likely to be here for a shorter period.  Since the enlargement of the European Union and managed migration policy, in terms of work permits and eligible categories, Ireland is no longer a country of inward migration to the same extent it was in the so-called boom years.  The figures for non-EU migrants migrating to Ireland to work have reduced substantially.  There is still a high percentage of international students coming to live and work here, but they do not necessarily end up undocumented or outside of their status.</p></speech>

When the recession started, people knew there was not much employment here.  We saw a reduction in those networks of migration.  We know from our drop-in centre who was coming here.  There was not a large number of people coming here after that time, but there are some and they need consideration also.</p></speech>

Right now, people are just not able to qualify.  A decision might need to be made about the two year probationary period.  Access to social welfare is earned, so it will not kick in until down the line when people are in the country long term, and have their status and their stamp 4.</p> <p>  In terms of education, we previously worked very closely with the children of non-EU migrants through the migrant education access campaign, MEA, on access to third level.  A person has to be a citizen in order to qualify for what are called free fees, which are no longer really free due to the level of the registration fee.  We did a good costed analysis of how much it would cost the then Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, to implement changes in that regard and it was a fraction of the education budget.  It is really about allowing people who are in the country long term to qualify.  Again, it probably would not apply straight away, as parents would have to be legally resident.  We would like to see some change around that whereby, for example, somebody who is legally in the country for ten years would have some right of access to the free fees category.  However, it still would not apply to undocumented migrants because those young people would not have been legally resident.  We probably need to go back to the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010, and there needs to be a conversation between the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Justice and Equality.  The bigger matter is that the system is still built around citizenship.</p></speech>

We are all here today to highlight issues relating to the social protection system.  We are all involved in services that provide information and advocacy for people engaged with the system and we are here to ask for the committee's help in pushing for changes to system, changes we feel would have a positive impact for all users of the system.  We acknowledge there has been significant pressure on the Department in the past six or seven years and a high volume of applications and decisions has been processed.  Nevertheless, the second Person or Number?2 report outlines significant areas for improvement in the system and we make suggestions as to how this can be achieved.</p> <p>  We believe that if individuals are in a position of needing to approach the social protection system and the State for financial assistance, they should always be shown the utmost dignity and respect and great care should be taken in clarifying and swiftly providing for their rights to financial support.  As many members are aware from their constituency work, this does not always happen.  While the core focus of the report is migrant experiences, ten of the 12 main findings from the core sample are relevant to all users of the system.  I urge members to look at the issues in that light.</p> <p>  I wish to provide some context for the report.  In 2011, Crosscare, Doras Luimn&iacute; in Limerick and Nasc in Cork produced a first report and the Minister for Social Protection - then and now - implemented the main recommendation, the establishment of a migrant consultative forum, whereby representatives from migrant focused NGOs met with Department officials to work through various issues arising in our services.  The forum has met six times and improvements have been made to operational guidelines and support documents for Department of Social Protection staff.  We hope the work of the forum will continue.  Last year, as we approached the three-year mark since we took the first case sample, we felt it was necessary and indeed good practice that we revisit the situation on the ground and, therefore, took another case sample, which forms the core of this report.  Also, two new partners joined in the development of this report, FLAC and Dublin city centre citizens information service.</p> <p>  I will now give the committee a flavour of our findings.  The findings come from three main sources.  First, we have documentary analysis, which may sound a bit dry but provides useful information.  Second, we have the 35 case samples and third, the online survey carried out with managers of all the citizens information services nationally.  The documentary analysis focused on the annual reports of the social welfare appeals office.  There is much information in these reports providing strong indicators as to the quality of decision making in the front line across the Department.  First of these is the successful appeals rate.  In 2013, an astonishing 55% of appeals were favourable for the applicant.  This is a high success rate for people appealing refusal of a payment.  An equivalent year in the United Kingdom had a success rate of 38%, which was unusually high there.  Questions need to be asked as to why this is the case.  </p> <p>  The appeals office report also deals with clarifications sought.  The report states that where it appeared to that office that the reason for the adverse decision may not have been fully understood by the appellant, in those circumstances the letter of appeal was referred to the relevant scheme area of the Department, requesting that the decision be clarified for the appellant.  This concerns situations where the appeals office decided the decision of the deciding officer was not very clear and bounced the appeal back to the Department.  The number of these clarifications has doubled in the three years up to 2013, to approximately 5,000 per year now.  This is, at the least, an indicator of questionable practice.  </p> <p>  The appeals office report also dealt with supplementary welfare allowance, a key payment for people who are particularly vulnerable.  Often, people need this payment to tide them over if they are awaiting processing of a mainstream payment.  The appeals office prioritises processing of these payments but, unfortunately, the average time for processing is five months.  Considering the importance of this payment, this is not acceptable in the case of people who are at their wits end without any income.  </p> <p>  There has been a pattern in the past three reports of the appeals office and clear criticism by the chief appeals officer of the administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, by the community welfare service in particular.  The chief appeals officer stated that an estimated 5% to 10% of social welfare appeal files were returned to the Department in 2013, as they lacked some or all of the basic documents which would be required to allow an appeal to proceed.  These documents were the application form, the formal decision and the submission of the designated person.  Obviously, these are basic documents in terms of assessing an appeal.  We suggest a question arises in this regard.  If this criticism has arisen three years in a row, what is being done in response to it.</p> <p>  The second of the three main findings relates to the 35 case samples, the core of our report.  It is important to be aware of how we chose the 35 case samples.  These were not cherry picked and we did not pick the best cases.  We selected four of the organisations and selected a particular day last year and recorded the next ten cases that presented to our services where there was any question regarding social protection.  Basically, this provided a snapshot of a point in time.  We gathered 35 valid cases.</p><p>While no issue arose with how the Departments dealt with the person in nine of these cases, unfortunately issues arose in the other 26 cases.  I will briefly outline the main issues that arose in the sample of 35 cases.  In eight cases, officials used inappropriate behaviour or language and two of these cases involved racist comments from officials.  Seven cases involved misinformation or omission of key information, while in three crisis cases emergency needs payments were refused.  It is important to note that the habitual residence condition does not have to be satisfied in cases of emergency needs payments.  In five cases, interpreters were needed but not provided.  Statistics obtained by Crosscare from the Department indicate a low level of usage of interpreters.</p><p> In four cases, arrears were not paid or were delayed.  In a further four cases, repeat requests were made for documents that had already been submitted.  In four other cases, payments were stopped without notice and there were four cases of speculative decisions being made on means.  There were three cases of non-response from the Department and two cases of documents or applications being refused.  To clarify, this refers to circumstances in which a person has made an application, visits a local office and provides additional documentation.  In one case, this additional documentation was refused and in a second case the application form was refused at a local office.</p><p> There were two cases involving customer complaint fears.  While this number is low relative to the sample, the fear of making a complaint is a particular problem which needs to be addressed.  We have raised previously with the Department the problem of people being afraid to complain about the level of service provided to them.  The reason is that deciding officers have significant power and the level of trust between the customer and Department is inadequate.</p><p> There were also three cases of incorrect refusal of habitual residence status.  While there has been some improvement in this area compared to the previous sample, it remains an ongoing issue.  </p><p> The third main component of the findings of the report relates to an online survey we did with the managers of the 42 citizens information offices nationally.  Citizens information services are crucial in dealing with many of the shortfalls in the social protection system.  An indicator of this is that in the first six months of last year, the 42 offices nationwide dealt with 25,000 queries from migrants on issues related to social protection.  The citizens information service has an important role in the broader area. </p><p> We were particularly interested in asking citizens information service managers about reports by clients of racism they had experienced at the hands of departmental officials.  While slightly less than half of managers reported having no knowledge of such reports, a small number reported significant numbers of clients experiencing racism at the hands of officials.  In combination with the racism findings from the sample of 35 cases, the views of CIS managers confirmed to us that there is an issue with racism, at least with some staff in some offices.  It is unacceptable that a public servant would behave in a racist manner.  </p><p> The difficulty is that having an open and honest conversation about racism can be difficult, which is understandable considering the seriousness of the issue.  We urge the Minister to recognise that the issue must be named as a problem and addressed.  We have made a number of specific recommendations for addressing it.  </p><p> To sum up the findings of the report, a combination of an analysis of documents, particularly the appeals office reports, the findings from the 35 case sample and the views of citizens information service managers nationally shows significant administrative and customer service deficits in the Department.  On a more positive level, there is an openness to positive change in the Department.  Last year, Axiom consultants completed a report for the Department aimed at encouraging the development of a coherent and progressive organisational culture in the Department.  In consultation with departmental staff, the Axiom report identified the values of public service, customer focus, professionalism, engaged staff and innovation as being required.  This was approved by the management of the Department.</p><p> The Axiom report recommends holding planned and structured conversations at all staff levels about the important core values of the Department.  Crosscare would be very supportive of a process of imbuing these values in the Department.  We can also think of many policy and procedural changes and improvements that would make the experience of accessing social protection better for people.  All of these relate to the culture of doing things in the Department, which is what must ultimately change.  We suggest that the recommendations in the report be used as practical measures to facilitate the type of organisational culture envisaged in the Axiom report.</p><p> The Crosscare report makes 19 recommendations, which I do not propose to discuss in detail today.  Instead I will focus briefly on two recommendations which would impact on everyone who uses the system.  We have worked with the Department in recent years to improve guidance and support documents for front-line staff and decision makers.  We are close to the point of identifying how things should be done in the areas of administration and customer service.  The problem, however, is with implementation.  There is not a sufficiently strong function in the Department to ensure that expected and desired standards of administration and customer service are achieved in reality.  In other words, there is a gap between what the Department states it will do and what is done on the ground and at the front line.  To this end, we have recommended the establishment of a new performance monitoring, evaluation and implementation unit in the Department.  We ask the joint committee to urge the Minister to implement this recommendation.  The first step in developing such a unit would be to establish a high-level working group consisting of the Ombudsman, the chief appeals officer, a high-level customer services expert from the private sector and other stakeholders. </p><p> The other recommendation we propose to highlight is that the Department focus more on changing interaction between officials and service users.  We urge the joint committee to press the Minister on this issue, for example, by introducing name badges for all public front-line staff in the Department.  This is a simple idea and while we expect it would meet some resistance, we believe it could significantly improve transparency, accountability and, ultimately, customer service and decision making for all users of the Department's services.  </p><p> Many of the users of the social protection system whom Crosscare sees are experiencing extreme hardship, stress and vulnerability and are, naturally, in financial hardship.  They deserve the best possible service from the State.  For this reason, we ask the joint committee to take on board our recommendations for change and ask the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection to give them serious consideration.  </p></speech>

It is important that the committee, in its oversight role, raise this matter in an appropriate manner.</p> <p>  Some people will argue that the types of attitudes the authors have identified in the Department of Social Protection are also displayed to people who are not immigrants.  Public representatives frequently receive complaints from across the spectrum of those who engage with the Department that they have not been treated in a positive manner.

I am sure officials of the Department of Social Protection will argue that they must put up with a significant level of abuse from people who come to departmental offices.  They will be unwilling to use name badges because it is very easy to find out where someone lives nowadays.</p><p>People who work in the Department of Social Protection say they put up with a fair amount of abuse as well from people who come in from time to time.  They do not want to put out their name badges given how easy it is to find somebody these days.  One can Google them to find their home addresses and there might be repercussions for people if they were to wear name badges.  Is that one of the reasons name badges are not a popular option?</p></speech>

We have not infrequent situations where we get letters back from the Department which are either unsigned or illegible in terms of the signatures.  There is a case in point in the report.  One of the case studies refers to an official who refused to give his name to someone who was looking for it.  While I can understand why people would be reluctant to do it, its potential for changing how things are done from the front-line upwards makes it worth it.  It is certainly something we are going to keep pushing.  We have deliberately picked it as one of the two matters today as it is a simple idea in some respects.  While there might be complications in terms of winning people over, in terms of accountability, transparency and how that would impact on how officials do their business would make it a very worthwhile measure to push.</p></speech>

I have had suspicions as have others that there is a general policy within the Department to turn everything down initially which will turn a fair number of people away.  Fewer people will come back, which will mean less expense for the Exchequer.  Does the 55% success rate in terms of appeals point to incompetence on the part of front-line workers, a misunderstanding between themselves and the people before them or is it, perhaps, that there is an unwritten policy to turn more applications down initially so that fewer people come back?</p></speech>

There are very varying levels of practice and competence at the front line.  A large proportion of cases we see and the cases exampled in the report relate to the community welfare service.  There is a particular issue with that service.  We analysed the cases and took them at face value.  There is a level of analysis that we would be making leaps if we were to come to some of the assertions the Senator is making.

Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh referred to the view that if a person was initially refused it might save the public purse money.  However, people appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office where appeals end up in a backlog of cases.  The appeals office takes on a huge burden in terms of trying to address the high volume of appeals.  Within that, there is a certain poor level of decision making because approximately 21% of all appeals are revised by deciding officers anyway and go back to the Department where they are successful for the applicant.  That shows that there is a very poor standard in regard to some of the decision-making in the Department at first instance.</p></speech>

If somebody comes in with a refusal who has additional information, we always submit a review request to the Department first to speed up the process and to see if providing that information again to the deciding officer helps.  We have come across situations where it seems that the actual review requests are often sent on to the appeals office by the social welfare officers themselves.  We send in a review request and a social welfare appeal to speed things up but the social welfare officers are actually sending them on the appeals office directly without considering them.</p></speech>

We provide a front-line service of free legal clinics on issues of immigration and social welfare.  We had approximately 219 interactions last year on social welfare queries.  Of the cases we take on and progress, we have a success rate of approximately 80% to 90% and that is because we take the time to tell clients what they need to bring us and to obtain the relevant information and documents from them.  There can be real issues with lack of understanding of what is even being asked for or of strict adherence to lists of required documents with no willingness on the part of the Department to look outside them.  It can be very difficult for migrants, particularly where they have fled their countries, to provide the type of evidence people are asking for.</p></speech>

I am also a member of the committee here and it is something we have been arguing with the Department, the Social Welfare Appeals Office and officials since I have been advocating on social welfare.  They need to change the mechanism to include something simple like a telephone call before a decision is made to notify a person that he or she is missing a particular document.  That would save the Department time and money and would also save people distress.  I presume that for somebody who is a migrant and who might not be literate in the English or Irish languages, it would be doubly stressful than it is for a citizen who can manage and make his or her way around the system.  I commend the report for highlighting that issue in particular, even though many of the issues it identifies are commonly experienced by citizens also, particularly those who are semi-literate or illiterate.  Even I find it difficult on occasion to navigate between a review and an appeal and I have argued consistently with the Minister and her officials that it needs to be made a great deal clearer to people that when a decision is made, the easiest avenue is a review.  It is only easy if one knows what the problem is.  I recommend that.  I am not asking a question in this regard as it has already been addressed, but the witnesses can discuss it.</p> <p>  I can understand the arguments on both sides regarding ID badges.  I dealt with a case of a social welfare inspector who was being followed home by somebody.  Garda&iacute; and others were involved and the Department did not stand in quickly enough to provide her with the defence she required.  Eventually, she had to move office.  There is that fear within the Department.  This case involved a very violent criminal.  While that concern exists, I support the view that even if it deals simply with a first name, a name tag or a response where someone asks for a name, it is a matter of common courtesy.  The offices are not that large and one could ask to speak to "Tom" or "Jack".  It breaks down a barrier which should not be there.</p> <p>  Have the witnesses liaised with Travellers' rights organisations to see whether the themes that emerged in the report are common in their interactions with the Department of Social Protection?  I believe it would be the case.</p></speech>

Has the research identified specific offices or officials?  My constituency office is in Ballyfermot and I know some of the officials well.  They are the best in the world but in the case certain officials one would pray that some characters would not have to meet them.  I am speaking about a fair hearing.  If particular offices or officials have been identified with regard to the charge of racism, it would make it a lot easier to have a targeted response to address a problem, if that is the case.  However, if this is across the whole range of offices, then the Department has a bigger problem which needs to be dealt with quickly.</p></speech>

The core of the report is a 35,000 person sample and we had to ensure anonymity for those sampled.  At a very early stage we filtered out locations and identifying details.  The identification of particular offices was not a part of the report.  However, in our day-to-day work, I agree that there are particular offices where we believe that these kind of incidents are more likely to happen.  To an extent, my colleagues in Crosscare would know of cases with certain individuals where it is more likely for such interactions to happen.  However, the difficulty when we attempt to raise it is that, understandably, we are told that the person with the issue needs to make a complaint directly and to provide all details.  That is where it tends not to go any further.</p></speech>

I presume the Department should target anti-racism training at those officials or offices where racism is identified as being a problem.  I make that suggestion in an effort to be helpful.</p></speech>

My constituency clinic comes across issues of this nature quite regularly.  In tackling this issue is the best approach to focus solely on the failure to deal appropriately with migrants rather than across the board?  I have no doubt that migrants are confronted with specific problems, although I hope it is in a minority of cases in the overall scheme of things that they experience racism.  I can think of many other groups who have also experienced discrimination.  I refer to sexism, anti-Traveller attitude, racism, just plain old class prejudice, and even not liking the look of someone.  All of these factors are there.  I stress that they are a minority but none the less, when they happen, which is reasonably regularly and they come to my attention reasonably regularly, they are very disturbing for the people involved.  These attitudes are very unfair and are unacceptable.  We must do something about it.  I wonder whether tactically, is it not better, without exacerbating the problem, to approach it from the point of view of having a certain standard of courtesy and an appropriate interaction with people?  This could include the specific issues that may arise with immigrants and with other named groups and it would be a way of providing training to cover over all these areas.  This would be preferable to singling out immigrants as having a particular problem because there is a slight danger that such an approach could reinforce the difficulties I have outlined.</p></speech>

We agree with the Deputy to the extent that it is most likely the exception rather than rule.  We are NGOs working with people who have problems with the system and some of us focus on migrants.  It is a combination of having an overall approach in terms of customer service and how everyone is dealt with but also to make a couple of targeted efforts.</p> <p>  We have made specific recommendations in regard to migrants and with regard to interpreters in particular because there is a significant issue with regard to the under-use of interpreters.  We regularly see people who do not get a fair chance at engaging with the system because they are not provided with an interpreter, which is a requirement.  I agree with the overall approach but we still need to name the specific issues faced by migrants.  In the wider context we are not saying it happens to everyone or to every migrant or that every officer is like that but when an official of the State throws out racist comments towards someone who is applying for his or her rights, this behaviour needs to be named and it needs to be specifically tackled.  The overall approach of improving customer service across the Department is probably the best tactic.</p></speech>

Certainly, we are trying to get to the same place.</p> <p>  On the question of name badges for staff, I have enormous sympathy with what Mr. O'Brien is saying.  We are constantly having to advocate for people who are in these difficult situations, but I also am conscious of the other side.  That is not in any way to excuse racism, sexism or any type of inappropriate behaviour but I am keeping in mind the difficulty this might present for staff.  In the case of some of those difficulties, I am not sure whether any code of conduct will deal with them, because they are to do with staff numbers being cut, increasing demands on individual workers and so on.  In the area of housing, for example, it is essentially a no-win situation on both sides of the table, with frustrations abounding in general.  The person who has the housing need cannot understand why it cannot be met, while the person on the other side is saying, "I have 50 similar cases, all of which are terrible, so what do you expect me to do?".  They should not say things like that, but sometimes they do.  It is important that we try to get as much buy-in as possible from staff and their union representatives in addressing these issues, rather than having a situation where we go at it in what looks like a heavy-handed, dictatorial way.  I am interested in Mr. O'Brien's view on that.</p></speech>

It is not about that; it is about improving the service level.  Our argument is that if officials are aware their name is out there, then customer service and the administration of applications will improve.  The paradigm is really about providing a better service rather than making people more identifiable and thereby, perhaps, leaving them feeling more vulnerable.  Having said that, public servants should be identifying themselves in any case.  The badge proposal is simply a mechanism that would help to ensure this happens consistently and across the board.  Consistency of practice is something of an underlying theme.  We deal with many good officers and good officers but, equally, there are problematic pockets.</p></speech>

However, I could anticipate problems where officials on the front desk in a housing department or in certain areas of public service are required to have their full name on display.  I take all the points Mr. O'Brien has made and agree it is important to humanise the process.  I do not know how we might square the circle.  It is something that will have to be agreed with staff and their views will have to be taken on board.  It might well be the case that they agree to displaying, say, their first name and a number.  That would satisfy the humanising point but also ease workers' concerns about a possible backlash.</p></speech>

Their recommendation for a monitoring unit is very positive.  On the question of name badges, I represent a rural constituency and people generally know the staff working in the local social welfare office.  A problem I see with this proposal, however, is that it might lead to the closure of smaller social welfare offices and their amalgamation into larger centres.  That has implications for staff and their workload and for the public availing of the services.</p> <p>  Have the delegates examined the idea of people being visited by officials in their homes?  Some people, including immigrants, have difficulty travelling to meet the social welfare officer.  If such persons could be accommodated by way of home visits, there would be an opportunity to build good relations.  Have the delegates found this to be an issue for immigrants?</p> <p>  On the issue of interpreters, this is something that would take some organisation in a context where different offices might not have precise data on how many different nationalities will be availing of their services.  I have just left a meeting with a delegation from Ukraine.  We knew these visitors were coming, so we arranged an interpreter to facilitate the meeting.  However, how practical is to say social welfare offices should make better use of interpreters?  The first difficulty is knowing which languages are required and recruiting the appropriate interpreters.</p></speech>

That is generally how it is done, but it is not used as often as it could be.  There are some stand-out languages in terms of what is required.  However, this issue is not the cause of the low level of usage.  There are other reasons.</p> <p>  In terms of officials visiting people's homes, this does happen already with social welfare inspectors in some instances.

While they operate under the same departmental rules in terms of processing applications it can be argued that they do things differently.  In some rural areas, for example, branch offices do things differently to local area offices or Intreo offices.  They have different management and reporting structures as well as different methods of supervising front-desk staff.  In that context, I assume it is possible to get different standards of customer care.</p></speech>

The vast majority of officials with whom I have dealt do their very best in difficult circumstances.  That said, I understand the constraints under which Crosscare is operating.  If a client says that he or she was treated appallingly or had to deal with a racist, sexist or rude official, it is very hard to move from that situation to building up a profile and determining whether there is a problem in a particular office or type of office or with a particular official without going further with the complaint.  I take the point that the witnesses cannot force a client to go to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or to go further with the Department.  If the behaviour in question is racist then it might be a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to investigate because such behaviour is an offence as far as I am aware.</p> <p>  Difficulties could arise in terms of training or re-training because if a member of the front-line staff is inherently racist then all of the training in the world will not deal with that.  At some stage, sanctions are required.  Training might address issues like offensiveness, rudeness or sharp practice but not the more serious issues.  The officials in questions must be identified but they will not be identified if those in upper management do not realise what is going on.  There is an onus on us and on organisations like Crosscare, if we become aware of a particular problem, to report it.  Is there a blockage there?</p></speech>

As I have said a number of times, that is what stops us.  I agree with the Deputy that in the case of some officials, no amount of training will change that individual.  I would also agree, however, that such individuals are very much the exception.</p></speech>

They were speaking about people from the European Economic  Area who were entitled to access our social protection services.</p> <p>  As I understand it, habitual residence is an issue because it is open to interpretation and is subjective in some senses.  While there are guidelines in place for officials, decisions are often based on whether an individual appears to have a connection or appears to qualify, based on the evidence presented.  Quite often that evidence is difficult to put together.  Is that a big issue in terms of frustration on the part of clients and the Department?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-25a.979" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe O'Brien" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2015022500002#H00600"><p>First, I must clarify that for the case sample we decided to deal with any migrant who had a social protection issue but it turned out that of the 35 cases identified, none were asylum seekers.  They were generally people who had a right to access our social protection system.</p> <p>  All of us on this side of the room have been dealing with the habitual residence issue and the Deputy obviously has some experience of it too.  One could certainly get the impression that the criteria are subjective but that is not the case.  There is an element of discretion and it is this discretion which leaves issues somewhat open to personal interpretation.  </p> <p>  When we presented the first report to the Department we made particular recommendations on the habitual residence condition.  At the time we were pushing for guidelines on the use of discretion.  In other jurisdictions guidance has been issued on the use of discretion.  There is a particular way of using discretion so that determinations are not simply based on the opinion of an official.  There are certain things that must be considered when one uses discretion.  This is also the case with regard to the habitual residence condition.  There are five factors that must be included in the mix but that has not been done properly.  The condition has been in place for over ten years but the guidance on discretion has not been done properly.  </p> <p>  The case sample, for what it is worth, would indicate that the application has improved somewhat in recent years.  That said, it is a condition that has been around for more than ten years but it is still showing up in the case sample as problematic.  Habitual residence is still a problem.</p></speech>

People who go to social protection offices are, by and large, dealt with satisfactorily and have a positive outcome.  Others do not have a positive outcome, perhaps because they are not entitled to social protection.  Enormous frustration builds up in social protection offices at times.  I am sure that if we interviewed officers from social protection offices they would give us many examples of rudeness, offensiveness and so forth from the other side of the counter.  I believe it is appropriate that officers be identifiable, but only within that particular office.  I do not believe it is necessary for them to be identifiable externally.  I believe that over the telephone, for example, Christian names should suffice.  That might be a way of improving the service.</p></speech>

It is not possible to prevent them being identified outside of that because obviously a lot of officials will sign their name properly and will be identifiable from a letter and so forth.  If a person really had it in for them, they could follow that line.  In principle, however, I would agree.  What we are looking for is that someone is easily identifiable.  Ideally, everyone would identify themselves verbally but it is optimistic to believe that we could get that to happen.  A visual identifier of any kind would suffice from our point of view.</p></speech>

Did geography have any bearing on that or was an unwillingness to use interpretation services found across the board?  Was that because people were under pressure and felt that it would be too time consuming?  Was it because they did not want to have the hassle of having to telephone somebody else?  What was the issue there?  If we are to bring this to the Minister or the Department for further work, we need to tease out why this was not being done.  I ask the witnesses to clarify that for us.  What is their understanding of why there was little use of interpretation services?</p></speech>

The 35 cases did not show any particular pattern.  There were five cases where interpreters should have been called upon but were not.  There was one case where somebody asked for an interpreter but was refused.  We had a team meeting in my organisation this morning and someone wrote to request an interpreter but one was not provided.</p> <p>  The FOI figures we got on interpreter usage did not dig down in terms of where they were being used or not being used and perhaps that needs to be explored further.  Our own take on it would be that the interpreter service costs money and choices are made in that context.  We feel, however, that a lot of people who have the right to access the system are not being given a fair hearing because they need an interpreter in order to access their rights.</p></speech>

As an energy company that has operated in this market for over four decades, even prior to the establishment of the Commission for Energy Regulation, we take both our role and our responsibility to customers very seriously.  We are always happy to discuss ways in which this market can be made to work better for our customers.  That is why in recent times we have actively engaged in the review of energy policy being conducted by the Minister and his Department.  Our responses to same have focused in a major way on how the industry can work on behalf of customers.</p> <p>  As we indicated in our submission to the committee, we reduced the cost of our standard unit rates for both gas and electricity on 22 January.  We did this having regard to the fall in the cost of wholesale gas during 2014.  We announced our decision to reduce prices as soon as we could see that lower wholesale gas prices were giving rise to a reduction in the near and medium-term cost of gas and electricity that we purchase on behalf of our customers.  As the energy regulator explained to the committee last week, energy companies such as ours buy forward; therefore, movements in wholesale markets do not translate into immediate price movements - whether up or down - for customers.  A significant proportion of the gas our customers used in January 2015 was bought in early 2014.  As the cost of wholesale gas continued to decrease into 2015, we have been able to secure a lower cost product for our customers.  As a result, we were able to translate this into a discount on our standard unit rates.</p> <p>  We fully understand the perception to the effect that we are quick to pass on increases and slow to share reductions.  However, that is not the case.  In the past decade, for example, our gas prices were regulated on an annual basis by the Commission for Energy Regulation.  Each year we submitted the cost of gas purchased for the previous 12 months and projected the cost of gas for the following 12 months and on that basis the price was set.  Increases approved by the regulator during the period were, therefore, made following periods in which the wholesale cost had been rising steadily and were designed to recover against the latter rather than being a move to counter it.  Following deregulation on 1 July, we were happy that the first price adjustment we could make in the price of gas involved a reduction.  In the case of electricity, we have consistently tried to offer a competitive standard rate since entering the residential market in 2009.  Our customers have enjoyed the lowest standard rate for electricity for 46 of the past 49 months.  In respect of both gas and electricity and as we confirmed at the time of our price announcement, we will continue to review wholesale costs.  If further savings arise, we will pass them on to our customers.</p> <p>  It has taken many years to develop the Bord G&aacute;is Energy brand.  I have been proud to work with the company for over 15 years.  I can reassure the committee that it is desperately important to us, as an organisation, that our customers can trust us.  In 2010 we published the first Bord G&aacute;is Energy index, by means of which we share short and medium-term insights into energy markets with key stakeholders, the media and customers alike.  We did this in order that people might be better informed about energy markets and what influenced the price they paid for electricity and gas.  We continue to publish this index every month.  We remain of the view that transparency in wholesale costs and other factors which have an impact on energy costs is important in order for customers to be confident that we are doing what we can to deliver competitive prices to them.</p> <p>  As members will be aware from last week's discussion with the energy regulator, our energy market is intensely competitive.  We are continually obliged to extend ourselves and invest in order to acquire and retain customers.  In the 23 years I have worked in the industry I have never before seen the level of choice currently available to customers.  That is good and we welcome the competition.  None of the energy companies represented at this meeting can be complacent in the context of retaining customers, which is how it should be.  The committee and members of the public can rest assured that there is plenty of pressure on us to deliver competitive prices to our customers in order that we might retain them.  That is why we reduced prices and will do so again if the opportunity arises.</p></speech>

I am managing director of Energia and accompanied by Mr. Gary Ryan, our retail director.  As we are probably not as well known as the other companies represented here, I will spend a few moments providing some background information.</p> <p>  Energia is involved in the generation and supply of energy to businesses and homes throughout Ireland.  We employ 450 people directly and another 100 indirectly.  Energia is one of Ireland's 50 top businesses and a major contributor to the national energy infrastructure and security of supply.  Since 1999 we have invested &euro;1.2 billion in gas-fired generation in north Dublin and renewable generation across the island.  We are going to invest a further &euro;1 billion to support renewable generation in the coming years.  The company is, therefore, a major investor in and contributor to national energy infrastructure and economic progress in Ireland.  We are very pleased to support that agenda.</p> <p>  In January 2014 Energia entered the Irish home energy market, with a dual fuel offer of electricity and gas.  This involved an initial &euro;10 million investment.  From the outset, we stated we would always be competitive in terms of price.  We consistently offer market-leading products.  The average discount enjoyed by customers who switch to Energia is 15% off our standard rates, which is very competitive.  Some 83,000 customers have switched to us for their gas and electricity supplies, of whom 97% are on discounted tariffs that are significantly below standard tariffs in the market, even in the aftermath of recent price reductions.  Since our entry into the energy market, switching levels among consumers have increased by approximately 70% per year.  The committee has heard from the CER that the promotion of switching and competition will have the most positive impact on customer costs.  Despite the increase in switching levels, the fact remains that a large proportion of customers have not switched in order to avail of the benefits of the competitive market.</p> <p>  The committee is aware that commodity pricing has become more favourable and where the opportunity arises to do so, we will take advantage of this.  We will pass on as much of the ensuing benefit as possible to our customers.  I say this bearing in mind that, as a new market entrant and a competitive operator, it is in our interests to keep prices as low as possible in order that we might retain customers.</p> <p>  I again thank the committee for the invitation to come before it.  I will be happy to reply to questions members may wish to pose.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-25a.996" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Dollard" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015022500002#H00400"><p>I welcome the opportunity to come before the joint committee to discuss what is an issue of significant importance.  I will spend my time talking about a small number of key issues which have an impact on electricity prices on the island of Ireland.  The first relates to what drives electricity prices.  There are four key factors in this regard, the first of which is wholesale commodity prices.  As the CER indicated to the committee last week, it is the main driver of electricity prices in Ireland.  Oil accounts for less than 1% of the electricity generated on the island.  The second factor is infrastructure costs.  I refer to the networks used to bring energy to people's homes.  Given the island nature of our system, we are unique in Europe in this regard.  The third factor which has an influence is Government policy, which involves support for renewables, security of supply and energy efficiency factors.  The fourth factor is the market in the context of the activity of suppliers, their endeavours and practices in supplying customers and the costs incurred in doing so.</p> <p>  The second issue to which I wish to refer is Irish prices as seen in a European context.  Intrastat reports indicate that as of June last year, most Irish businesses were paying for energy at prices which were at or below the eurozone average.  That is a very important point.  Another issue to which I refer in this regard relates to the fact that the Irish residential market is broadly comparable to those of the other countries in the eurozone.  The largest category of residential customer in Ireland, which represents the average Irish consumption of energy, is paying 2% below the eurozone average.</p> <p>  In the context of the comments the committee has just heard, Ireland probably has the most competitive market in Europe.  The level of switching here is the highest in Europe and, in global terms, is probably right at the top of the league.  This means that the market is incredibly competitive.</p><p> The third point is wholesale energy costs.  That is probably what is causing attention on this industry, particularly at this point in time.  Wholesale gas prices have a significant impact on energy costs.  They are the driver.  Forward gas prices in euro terms fell in 2014 by about 18%.  It is important to understand that much of the 18% happened towards the second half of the year.  Recent forward prices have risen by about 8% as of earlier this week, in tune with commodities generally.  One can see it at petrol pumps where prices are beginning to come up again.  </p><p> Another factor in wholesale energy costs, as pointed out by CER, is that energy costs represent about 30% of the total electricity price.  The other factors are infrastructure costs, Government policy and the cost of supplying customers.  One of the key factors in end-user energy costs is the concept of hedging.  This is the process of buying power into the future in small slots each month, typically over a 12 or 18 month period.  One is trying to protect domestic customers which is essential in a volatile market.  Electric Ireland does this on a staged basis over a long period of time.  This is common practice around the world in terms of the residential market.</p><p>On our approach, Electric Ireland is a State body which has served customers for almost 90 years in this market.  We see affordability and confidence in the market as a huge issue.  Last autumn Electric Ireland implemented a 2% electricity price reduction before the winter as we considered this to be incredibly important.  Be assured that we can give an assurance that we will continue to pass through reductions in wholesale prices if other factors stay static.  Margins are modest in this market when we compare with other markets in Europe.  </p><p> Affordability, be it for domestic, business or small business customers, is a huge issue for our economy.  Right through our history we have been focused on that.  Things are very difficult for businesses and domestic customers out there.  A lot of work has gone into trying, as best we can, to shelter people from the impact of that.  Disconnections by Electric Ireland are down 20% this year, a significant reduction in the teeth of an incredible recession.  An important tool in helping people deal with arrears in a structured way is the pay as you go meter.  We actively support the installation of these meters.  The number of customers who have payment plans with us, typically people who are struggling, is beginning to fall.  This is a positive development of which we are proud.  Electric Ireland has additional protections for vulnerable and elderly customers who are important in this environment.</p><p>As wholesale prices continue to fall, Electric Ireland is committed to passing the reductions through.  Thank you.</p></speech>

I thank you for your invitation here today.  From small beginnings, SSE Airtricity has grown substantially since its entry into the market in 2008.  It has achieved this by investing more than &euro;2.5 billion here and creating direct employment for more than 800 employees, up from 120 employees at that time.  This investment means we own and operate over 1500MW of generation capacity, one third of which is renewably generated wind power.<br/><br/>We have driven market competition and have built up a customer base of 800,000 customers, up from 40,000 in 2009.  We have done this by offering some of the most competitive prices in the market.  Customers who switched to SSE Airtricity have saved over &euro;100 million since our entry into the domestic market in 2009, all the more important given the tough economic conditions we have gone through over the same period.<br/><br/>It was during these difficult economic times that SSE made some of Ireland's largest capital investments.  I am pleased to report that in the last year alone we have completed our Athea wind farm in County Limerick, <i></i>a<i></i>&euro;70 million investment which created 300 jobs during its construction.  We are nearing the completion of our new 460MW gas-fired power plant in County Wexford, a &euro;330 million investment that created more than 1,200 jobs during construction, 80% from the local area.  We have just begun construction of Ireland's largest wind farm, the 170MW Galway Wind Park in partnership with Coillte.  This &euro;280 million investment will employ more than 350 people during its construction.<br/><br/>Over the past five years our business in Ireland has delivered a dividend of &euro;70 million to its shareholders enabling us to generate significant economic activity and jobs here.  As illustrated in our recent PricewaterhouseCoopers report, SSE's Economic Contribution to Ireland, SSE has contributed &euro;956 million to Irish GDP in 2014 alone directly providing more than 800 full-time jobs and supporting an additional 5,150 jobs. This was the equivalent of 0.3% of total Irish employment and 0.6% of Irish GDP in the fiscal year 2014. <br/><br/>A core value for SSE is sustainability.  We live this value by investing in low carbon generation sources and by investing &euro;1.2 million every year in community projects through our wind farm community funds.  In particular, we seek to help communities reduce their energy consumption by investing in energy efficiency initiatives.  One recent example is the retrofit of 107 local authority fuel-poor homes in County Limerick in partnership with Limerick County Council and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland SEAI.  This was provided free of charge to those households.  We have also successfully completed retrofitting a further 412 council homes with local authorities in Wexford and Fingal.<br/><br/>While I felt it important to set out the overall economic value of SSE's investment in Ireland I expect much of our discussion here this morning will centre on energy costs for consumers, ensuring customers benefit from falling wholesale markets and protecting them from rising prices.  Let me assure Members that this is a priority for us at SSE.  If there are more savings we can pass on, we will pass them on in due course.  Driving this is Ireland's highly competitive retail market where SSE Airtricity must deliver competitive and value based energy products in order to attract and retain customers.  In doing so, we at SSE Airtricity are also particularly focused on helping our most vulnerable customers.  This is why SSE Airtricity has been to the forefront in deploying prepayment meters to help customers in managing their bills, and also ensuring that they are on the cheapest pay as you go tariff in the market.<br/><br/>In January, we announced that SSE Airtricity is reducing its gas tariff by 4% and its electricity tariff by 2% for all customers.  This reduction applies to both the unit rate and standing charge.  While market commentators suggested that bigger decreases were achievable, we would ask the committee to note three things.  Wholesale prices represent half of the consumer's bill.  Individual companies' hedging policies, foreign exchange rates, timing and the volatility of commodity markets directly influence price.  Finally, while commodity prices, particularly oil, have reduced over a short period, other costs have increased.  These include the cost of policy measures such as energy efficiency.  Costs such as market operator charges, use of system charges and public service obligation costs are not in the control of generation or supply businesses, but they offset decreases in wholesale prices.<br/><br/>During difficult economic times SSE Airtricity has made significant investments of around &euro;2.5 billion; directly and indirectly created employment for almost 6,000 people and saved its customers more than &euro;100 million.  To remain competitive in a crowded market we must ensure that we are passing on savings to customers and offering products they value.  It is also important that those costs not in the control of generators and suppliers are minimised, that all customers realise the savings achievable through supplier switching and that costs more aligned with social policy are removed from the bill and funded through the Exchequer.  Thank you for your time and attention.</p></speech>

This issue has arisen in the past few weeks in the context of reduction in fuel price and people had noticed it.  It is important that the witnesses have explained why there might not be an immediate reduction.  The committee has been told how energy is bought ahead of time.  Is there a presumption that there will be a reduction for the remainder of the year since supplies of gas were bought when the price was lower?</p> <p> Switching was also mentioned.  All the witnesses seem to put huge effort into getting customers to switch.  The committee would like to know if that is where resources are going, rather than on reducing the basic price. </p> <p> There have been suggestions by witnesses that bigger reductions were available for bigger customers such as businesses or industry.  Is there discrimination to a certain extent?</p><p>For instance, does the small corner shop pay the same rate as a domestic customer or is it just the very big industry customers that get the bigger reductions?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-25a.1002" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Dollard" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015022500002#K00200"><p>In terms of prices, typically Electric Ireland buys the power for any given month in slots in order to smooth the impact and reduce the likelihood of vagaries of price occurring.  In this way it takes advantage of the market and does not expose customers to peaks in prices.  What that means is that it has taken particular slots.  Certainly the price reductions that happened, particularly towards the latter end of last year, were because those slots were coming in cheaper and that price impact has been passed on to the customer.  The bigger impact is more likely to be in 2016, because as we buy forward more of that will come through.  Assuming that the 70% of other costs remains stable I would forecast that prices will continue to come down and the suppliers will do that.  It is my expectation that those prices will come down later this year.<br/><br/>In terms of the switching and where resources are going I will comment generally on that.  It is only five or six years ago that we in Electric Ireland, ESB as it then was, had 100% of the domestic residential market.  In that time more than 50% of customers have switched.  They may have switched back and forward but more than 50% have switched.  The rate of switching in Ireland is significant and is now among the highest in Europe.  I believe that switching is a factor in any market.  A policy decision was made to open the market; once that was done providers had to compete on either price, products, or through some other method.  Discounts and switching are a key factor if there is to be a competitive market.  Electric Ireland has received the brunt of that because it has conceded huge amounts of share.  In the longer term the focus of switching <i>per se</i>will have to be balanced by other directions.  The customers who stay with a provider have to also see benefits and I believe that is a very important factor.  It is not something that is widely known.  Electric Ireland is beginning to focus more and more on existing customer and the loyalty of those customers.  </p></speech>

That is information that is not generally available.  I welcome the opportunity to say it.  Existing customers of Electric Ireland can also avail of discounts.  That is probably true of all of my colleagues as well.  That is true and it is a very important point that I would like to get out.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-25a.1005" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1073" speakername="John O'Mahony" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015022500002#K00500"><p>Is Mr. Dollard saying that people should talk to the providers?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-25a.1006" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Dollard" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015022500002#K00600"><p>Yes.  A significant portion of the people who are benefiting from discounts at the moment are existing customers.  It is not just about that though.  I would argue that the loyalty issue is a bigger issue.  Some people do not want to sign up for a contract.  They do not want to commit to particular conditions; they are not in a position to do so.  I believe those customers have to be dealt with as well.  In Electric Ireland we are building up loyalty schemes and last winter we gave back a lot of money to customers in that regard.</p> <p>    In terms of existing customers we are concerned with how vulnerable customers are treated.  A significant portion of our current customers, probably 50,000, are on pre-pay meters.  Those customers are getting a discount from us.  We are treating them favourably.  We are giving existing customers a 4% discount, which is very important in the market.  Those customers have been with us for a very long time, and probably, in reality, cannot easily switch providers and what we are trying to do is to help them in their current situation.</p> <p>   Last autumn Electric Ireland announced a 3% price reduction for SMEs, so slightly ahead of residential customers.  SMEs are probably one of the biggest drivers of employment in the economy.  Electric Ireland believes that working with SMEs is important.  Some SMEs can avail of some of the hedging products that big customers can avail of.  They certainly can switch and they certainly are getting discounts.  There is no doubt that the bigger the customer the more fuel is an issue in terms of their overall bill and they are more likely to be able to take risk in a market, which allows them to win and to lose.  Once they take risk in a market, which big customers can do, they can win and lose.  </p></speech>

There was a 3% reduction announced for that whole sector last year.  It would not be easy for an SME to take a risk profile.  Small businesses trade on very tight margins and as with the domestic customer certainty is of huge importance, and so is being able to price that in.</p></speech>

In respect of the prices and how that flows through the book, it is as Mr. Dollard has outlined.  It is a case of buying in stages and, even though we focus on the down sides, there are benefits to that.  It means that neither we nor our customers see the volatility in the market.  The overall view of Bord G&aacute;is Energy at the moment, which is supported by the monthly index we publish, is that there is a confidence level that has been building in the market <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>supply and demand.  Isolated events can change that.  I mentioned in our report to the committee that it appears that Europe's largest gas field is constrained at the moment due to concerns around seismic activity.  Events such as that do affect the underlying confidence.  Hopefully the underlying confidence that there is excess supply to meet demand will flow through into the winter months of 2015 and into 2016.  Bord G&aacute;is Energy would like to be in a position to pass on the benefits to customers.<br/><br/>Mr. Dollard raises a very good point in respect of switching.  I believe for the most part, for the people who have been in this industry a while, even before there was open market competition, the measure of success was considered to be a high level of switching activity, i.e., customers are aware of the choices that are being presented to them and are free to choose and move around competitors, which keeps us all on our toes.  It is true to say that the Irish energy customer has really grasped that.  The level of switching, as everyone has said here this morning, is greater than in other markets.  It is very important that we do not forget the customers who are loyal to us.  We would be mad to, to be quite frank.  Bord G&aacute;is Energy will be launching a campaign in the next number of weeks which will offer discounts to customers for staying with us and who have been with us.  We hope that this gets a response from our loyal customers.  Bord G&aacute;is Energy was the first in the market to introduce a rewards club where customers can, by paying their energy bills, receive Tesco loyalty cards, which they can trade against grocery bills, or indeed their energy bills.  These devices and others are being invested in to pay back customer loyalty.  If customers come to us saying that they want to shop around Bord G&aacute;is Energy will respond by seeking to keep their business.  <br/><br/>In respect of large customers benefiting more than residential customers, the energy industry is a large volume low margin business.  The way in which the industry is structured does benefit larger users with a larger volume.  Even in respect of the amount of network costs that large users pay, it is less <i>pro rata</i>than the residential equivalent.  <br/><br/>Last week the Commission for Energy Regulation highlighted that industrial users in Ireland have benefited from falling wholesale costs more quickly than their European counterparts.  There is a very sophisticated large user base in Ireland and they shop around and put us under pressure in respect of prospecting for the best product available.  The Bord G&aacute;is Energy trading team in Cork buys specifically for customers at their behest, and those customers can take positions.  SMEs just cannot afford to take the positions that larger users do.  The same would apply to the residential market.  It is very competitive out there.  SME customers are switching on an annual basis and they are shopping around.</p><p>It is a different kind of structure for smaller users but no less competitive.  </p></speech>

When wholesale prices continue to fall, if everything else remains the same, then you can see further reductions passed on.  However, as of now all other things are not remaining the same.  One of the biggest challenges is around foreign exchange.  We buy gas in sterling and we sell it in euro.  The euro has weakened significantly against sterling.  Over the last nine months it fell between 12% and 14%.  That has a significant impact.  It is important to consider the context. Wholesale gas price is a significant portion of end user price but there are other factors we need to keep an eye on.  We have trading teams focused on how we can get the best prices for our customers but there is a lot happening that we do not have control over.</p> <p> The Irish market is very competitive judging by the extent of energy provider advertisements on our televisions.  It is also a very inert market.  Over 50% of the total customers in Ireland have never switched.  They have never availed of any introductory discounts in the market at the moment.  Customers are very sticky and there is much inertia in the market.  Existing customers that do make a move avail of introductory discounts and further discounts through payment methods.   </p> <p>  Progress has been made around disconnections, with engagement of vulnerable customers, to make sure they are on the lowest standard rate.  My colleagues share that view/.  In regard to big consumers versus small shops, it is very much about appetite for risk.  Big consumers have teams in place to take positions.  Sometimes the positions work out well for them, other times the positions come with more risk.  This needs to be balanced when one is considering the issue of big consumers versus small shops.</p></speech>

We have had to hedge quite far in advance to get into this market.  When we entered the market in January 2014 we were starting a year beforehand and there are good reasons for that.  We have to fix prices and we have to know what our profit and loss is going to be.  Movements in commodities prices can put companies like us out of business, so we do not take risk on this aspect but price changes will be reflected.  Energia is new in the market so we have to offer price as an incentive for people to switch.  It is a very competitive market and all of us will have to reflect the cost if we want to keep those customers.  While there is a lot of switching in the market many customers have not switched and we need to do something about that.</p> <p>  In regard to businesses, the large end of the market is more sophisticated.  We do offer products to the smaller customers, we have very small customers on variable products and some like it.  Most SMEs however like the fixed prices, as do most domestic customers.</p></speech>

It was a very worthwhile discussion and debate.  Some of the witnesses have explained the exasperation that is prevalent and the perception that prices have dropped in the last quarter of 2014 with no corresponding price drop in household or business energy bills.  I understand hedging but there has been a considerable reduction in wholesale price in the last quarter of 2014 and in early 2015.  Even though prices have crept up by 8% in the past couple of weeks, can the witnesses explain when we can see this reduction reflected for consumers?  Is it true that the wholesale price of gas, as pointed out by the Commission for Energy Regulation last week, has dropped by something like 18%? The figures presented by the witnesses that 30% of the energy price is made up by the wholesale costs of energy means that consumers should be seeing a reduction of 6% or 7% across the board in energy prices.  Will the witnesses indicate to the committee when we might see this reduction as the price coming through is between 1.5% and 3%?  I presume that all the companies having looked at their hedging and bought in the last quarter of 2014 would have reserves of cheaper, wholesale gas on the market.  Are we looking at energy price being stabilised at a lower rate in the latter half of 2015 or early in 2016?  How far in advance would the gas purchase have been hedged?</p></speech>

The proportion of the end price for electricity impacted by wholesale gas is around 30%.  We all buy differently but we all buy in advance.  At the end of 2014 there was a trend downwards, a significant movement in the curve, but in the period December 2014 into January of 2015 a pre-market situation prevailed.  When we returned after Christmas and reviewed the curves we saw there was headroom to pass on a reduction in the unit price to the consumer and we moved promptly on that basis.</p> <p>  We have not bought out completely for 2015.  It is difficult to do that as one has to buy in slots and it depends what is available in the market.  As a result, Bord G&aacute;is Energy is still buying over the course of 2015.  If there are further wholesale reductions in the next couple of months we will be able to procure that and feed it in.</p> <p>  Currency has been mentioned as a factor.  Unfortunately the euro has continued to weaken against sterling.  In the last four weeks we have seen a 5% weakening.  That sets off against the wholesale benefit.  Currently for every percentage drop in wholesale, one loses about one third of that on the sterling to euro conversion.  That is a challenge for us.  We will watch the wholesale prices, we will buy in over the next number of months and if the savings accrue over that time we will be seeking to try and pass that benefit on towards the end of 2015.  We do not have a crystal ball on it.</p> <p>  Nobody anticipated the earthquakes at the gas field in Holland over the last couple of weeks.  That can add 2% or 3% to the price in a day and it takes a while for that confidence to build back in to the market place.  Bord G&aacute;is Energy will publish its monthly index which is available to everyone.  It can be seen in an objective manner where that movement is going and where sterling comes into it.</p></speech>

This is completely at variance with what energy experts are saying. Consumer correspondents in the national papers refer to a figures closer to 30%.</p><p>There has been a great deal of talk about what has happened in the industry and the efforts that companies are putting into encouraging people to switch by asking consumers to shop around and so on.  It is all very fine to give a few quid to people who will move from one company to another but I think it is a smokescreen.  One can afford to give relatively generous bonuses to people who switch, because Irish people do not like charge and they will resist switching.  The number of customers who have not changed is in excess of 50%.  The people who will probably never change are low income families and elderly people.  The people who will not change providers are being fleeced.  They have got nothing from the energy providers.  Cheaper prices have applied to new customers for the past 13 months but the customers who have stuck with their providers have received no reductions.  The companies can afford to play around with the people who are shopping around.Having read the presentation I cannot see a mention of the percentage fall in the price of gas.  Did it fall by 18% or 28%?<br/><br/>The reductions that were made prior to the Christmas period were alluded to in the presentations.  The companies could afford to reduce prices because the six main suppliers in the United Kingdom reduced prices by double the amount of their Irish counterparts.  I know that the witness will come back with the retort that there are various factors at play.  I understand about forward purchasing and the variance in the euro <i>vis-&agrave;-vis,</i>sterling but if the price of gas fell by that amount, and I do not agree with the figure of 18% or any other in that ballpark, why are the decreases to customers so minimal?  The balance sheet of the various providers has been the main beneficiary, not the customers.  As things stand the providers will gain most.<br/><br/>There is speculation about possible price reductions in the first quarter of this year.  If one is able to analyse all the material and all the variations in the industry in the past year to 18 months how come the delegates cannot tell the committee what reductions we will get by June 2015? </p></speech>

I have seen the reports in the media and the debate in various fora.  As my colleagues have said, we genuinely appreciate this opportunity to debate the matter.  The reason the CER focused on Intrastat reports is that it is important there is transparency on how Ireland is faring in the European context.  Intrastat is the system for collecting information and producing statistics on the trade in good between countries of the European Union.  The statistics are developed independently of all of the energy suppliers and they show that we are competitive.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the rate of reduction when the price of oil is down 60% to 70% and why, when gas is down by big margins, the price of electricity is not down by a corresponding rate.  I welcome the opportunity to reiterate that the price of oil is irrelevant.  I know that Deputy Maloney did not raise that point.  </p> <p>  The Deputy rightly said that there are reports of a 30% reduction and I have also seen those.  The analysis by the CER, which is an independent body, is that forward prices, which is the relevant price index for us in buying power, is about 18%.  I would not disagree with that value.</p> <p>  Spot rates, that is the day-on-day rates, are very volatile and can move significantly day-on-day.  Depending on the day, one can get numbers as high as the figure mentioned.  I do not know the specific background to the 30% rate but I suggest that it relates to the spot rate.  We do not buy gas on the spot market.  That would result in unbearable volatility in the price of a necessity.</p> <p>  There were words to the effect that we were creaming it but my view is that if this industry tries to build profits on the back of falling fuel prices confidence will be lost and the industry will be broken.  That is the reason I made the point that margins in Ireland compare favourably across Europe.  Prices compare favourably and margins compare very favourably.  We are trying to do the best we can in a difficult environment.  I understand that there is a lot of anger.  Energy is an essential necessity for people and businesses and we are passing on the reductions as best we can.  We are not gaming the system.  The view of the CER, an independent body, would support that.  The real test is whether we are moving in the right direction against our competitors or are building significant margins.  If either of those were true, we would have a problem in the industry.  I do not believe they are true.  I hope that has gone some way to answer the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

There are two very important points, first, the domestic prices in the Republic of Ireland are below the EU average.  That is a fact verified by a third party.  When one compares the prices in the Republic with those in Great Britain, in particular to the prices in Northern Ireland, where the price reductions are so much higher, the first reason is the FX exchange rates.  As I said in my opening remarks, we buy gas in sterling and we sell it in euro.  The other major factor in Northern Ireland is that it is a regulated market and there is a k-factor adjustment in Northern Ireland, where companies that have over-recovered previously give back.  If one looks at a unit rate comparison between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, there is very little difference between the standard rate.  In spite of the higher reductions in tariff, when one compares the figure from 1 April in the Republic and Northern Ireland, the rates are very similar.  That needs to be considered.</p></speech>

The regulator has gone through a process with the main supplier in Northern Ireland, Power NI and has gone through all its hedges and all its cost and the price it comes out is the cost to domestic customer, which is comparable to the price in the South after these reductions.  I can understand that members may think that our profits rise when gas prices drop, that is why we hedge, so I can tell members that we are not making excess profits on the fall in prices. </p> <p>  There are another number of things that impact on cost that are not wholesale related.  There is an increase use system cost that was not passed on to the customers and costs about 1%.  The Oireachtas passed legislation that puts an energy efficiency obligation on all of us which is quite a significant cost.  That also has not been passed on to domestic customers as of yet.  We face costs apart from the wholesale price which customers will have to bear to meet the European commitments.</p> <p>  In terms of comparators, we referred to the situation in Northern Ireland and in the EU.  From talking to somebody the other day, I learned that the tariff for domestic customers is 30% cheaper in Ireland than in Germany.  I was asked why we do not set out our prices.  The reason is that the market is competitive and it would be foolish for me to tell member that we would reduce the price here and there because that would be telling our competitors.</p><p>We are saying we will be pricing the reductions because if we do not do this, we will lose customers.</p></speech>

Let me summarise what people think.  They see the wholesale price of oil and gas reducing dramatically; in percentage terms, the reduction is in double digits, yet when they drive by the petrol pumps, they see a percentage reduction in a single digit figure.  They also see single digit reductions in the bills from their energy provider.  Most people think the regulator could instruct the companies to reduce the cost of energy by a specified percentage figure.  It took me a while to figure out that was not the way it worked.</p> <p>  The themes common to all four presentations this morning refer to the level of competition which encourages the delivery of value; customer switching which forces the companies to offer attractive rates to new customers; forward buying and hedging, which I understand; and the impact of Government policy on renewables and affordability measures.  It was mentioned that the price of oil or gas was only one component of the overall cost to the companies, that the cost of oil was not really a factor and that margins were very modest.  Currency fluctuations were also mentioned.  I understand the concepts behind it. </p> <p>  In relation to forward buying, does each company have the expertise to conduct the negotiations, or is there a bank of international oil auctioneers that are specialists?  How does the process work?</p></speech>

Bord G&aacute;is Energy has a trading division in Cork which interacts with its counterparts across Europe.  In purchasing gas the local liquid market is in the United Kingdom.  When we purchase gas there, it is shipped across the interconnector into Ireland, in respect of which we pay transportation charges.  Unfortunately, because we depend so much on the importation of natural gas, we pay an extra carriage charge to transfer it from the United Kingdom to Ireland, which accounts for the difference one sees in absolute price levels in the United Kingdom and Ireland.</p> <p>  I am sure every company has a different approach in how it tries to manage volatility and smooth out the peaks and troughs.  The period over which we buy is probably unique to us versus our competitors.  Our team in Cork has developed its expertise over 20 years and we always try to procure the best price for our customers.  It is important to state we do not trade to speculate and make a profit.  We trade to try to secure a stable price.  We have very strict risk mechanisms for our traders.  They are not encouraged to bet on future gas trades but encouraged to lock things down in order that our customers are protected against volatility in the markets.  Our approach is probably mirrored by the other companies.</p></speech>

We were the last energy suppliers to have price regulation.  Up to 1 July, we were allowed, as a maximum, to have a 2% net margin, if we had had a good year.

The level of switching in Ireland is at the highest in Europe and worldwide.  To a degree, I agree with the Deputy in his view on loyal customers.  There is more we can do for them.  The standard rate is a very important one and Electric Ireland tries to keep it as low as possible.</p><p>We also focus very much on a low standing charge because our customers are typically lower level consumers.  We will give discounts to existing customers, if they are willing to enter a contract.  I accept that does not suit every customer type but we will make them available.  We are focussing on building a loyalty programme and last Christmas we gave a significant amount back, particularly to loyal customers.  We focus particularly on vulnerable customers.  There 50,000 people in difficulty with arrears.  They are our true customers who have been with us for a very long time and Electric Ireland is giving them a 4% discount on top.  There is a lot being done around loyalty in the market but we need to do more.</p></speech>

Could each of the witnesses outline their policies on that, what the fees are and explain why there is such an increase after 18 months?</p> <p>  A retailer who makes an effort to use very little electricity is being punished by paying quite a high price and the reason given is that the business is not using enough electricity.  Could the witnesses elaborate on that?</p> <p>  At a recent meeting of Kerry County Council, Councillor Niall Kelleher from the Killarney electoral area, raised the issue of energy companies paying below market rates for energy credits associated with energy upgrades by local authorities.  This arises from the energy retrofit scheme and refers to the kilowatt hour savings assigned to works carried out, or the carbon reduction saving certificates.  Councillor Kelleher obtained information that the local authorities are disposing of these certificates for what he considers to be far below the market value, for example, in 2013-14 certificates were given to Electric Ireland for as low as &euro;0.4 and &euro;0.6 per kilowatt hour when the market value was seen to be &euro;0.88.  The knock-on effect is significant loss to local authorities which gain these certificates as a result of investment from public funding through the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  How much are the energy companies paying to local authorities per kilowatt hour credits?  How many hours have they purchased since 2012?  How many have they obtained?  Will they give as much information as possible on that area please?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-25a.1045" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Wheeler" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015022500002#O00300"><p>In regard to reconnection policies, everyone&rsquo;s objective is not to disconnect any customers.  In the past year the Deputy may have seen the work that went on behind the energy engage code which is a commitment by all suppliers that we will not disconnect any engaging customers.  We will work with customers, whether through payment plans, or pay as you go metres.  We will consider their needs and work with them.  One challenge is that not everyone is engaging.  That becomes a problem and unfortunately disconnections do happen.  To be clear, there is no benefit to anyone in this room today in disconnecting a customer.  The Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, stipulated 18 or 24 months ago that each energy company, or supplier, pay half the reconnection fee.  Disconnections usually happen because of debt and that is why people do not engage.  The supplier is losing the debt and has to pay a reconnection fee.  It makes no sense to disconnect.</p> <p>  I am not aware of the punitive fee after 18 months because I am not aware of that policy within SSE Airtricity.  I will not speak on behalf of my colleagues.  I am happy to come back to confirm that is not the case at SSE Airtricity. </p> <p>  On the point of energy efficiency and paying more, this comes back to how one breaks down energy costs.  Wholesale prices are less than 30%.  There are fixed charges, such as network charges which have gone up this year.  We need to be mindful that although consumption is a key driver of one&rsquo;s energy cost there are fixed costs associated with that.  Nothing can be done in that regard, they are network and other associated costs.  They do not affect the kilowatt hour.</p> <p>  With regard to energy certificates, it is very important to step back when we look at the energy efficiency targets.  We have signed up to a significant obligation which will come at significant cost to all our consumers.  This is a competitive market and it is in everyone&rsquo;s interest, and ultimately the consumer&rsquo;s interest, that suppliers pay the most competitive price they can for certificates because that cost will be passed to the customers.  I cannot comment on any other supplier&rsquo;s practices.  The Deputy asked a detailed question about the number of certificates and how much we paid.  I will be happy to furnish that information after this meeting.  I cannot stress enough the point that this is a consumer cost and we need to do whatever is in our capability to keep that cost to a minimum.</p></speech>

My interest is in the Exchequer and the value for money for investment in better insulation in local authority housing stock and the subsequent rebate to local authorities for those credits.

It is a position of last resort.  Disconnection is a no-win situation.  It is loss-making.  Through the energy engage code we have increased communication and we validate every single disconnection in our organisation.  The committee could help us in this respect.  There is no need for any customer in this country to be disconnected.  A free issue prepayment metre is offered to every single customer in distress.  If customers are happy to take that prepayment metre a disconnection will not happen.  It is very important that people know that.  We are doing our best to communicate it and any help the committee can give us would be appreciated.</p> <p>  In respect of reconnection fees, the cost of disconnection and reconnection is a matter for the network companies that are regulated.  There is certainly no profit here.  It is simply passed through but in respect of the burden on customers it is key to stop it in the first place.</p></speech>

In respect of the usage rates there are costs approved by the regulator for a network which are passed through in standing charges.  There is nothing we can do about it.  If usage is low one still has to pay them.  It is done differently in other countries but the market still takes that cost.</p> <p>  I understand the Deputy is talking about the county council energy efficiency obligation but central government wants a competitive market and wants the stuff delivered as cheaply as possible because it knows that cost will be passed to consumers.</p><p>I understand the point the Deputy is making, but the Government wants this to be cheap.  I do not know about the individual case, but I presume it went out to tender and that it was the best price.  At the end of the day the costs flow through to customers.</p></speech>

The price reductions during the past four or five months have been welcomed by consumers.  In the past year the consumer has been looking at plunging oil prices and expecting to see a correlation in their energy bills.  They are demanding it, rightly so.</p> <p>  In the course of the meeting the delegates have clarified how wholesale gas prices affect the companies.  They have outlined the projections, the fixed costs, the other increasing costs and foreign exchange rates.  I would like to address a few points in that context.</p> <p>  It was stated oil prices, for example, the Brent crude oil price, did not materially affect energy prices.  It has been put to me that long-term natural gas supply contract prices are indexed against the Brent crude oil price.  I would like to have it confirmed that they are so indexed and that they are not matched, but that there is a long-term correlation between crude oil prices and natural gas prices.</p> <p>  It was stated that in 2014 the reduction in the wholesale price of natural gas was about 18%.  The media, however, report that the average wholesale price of natural gas in 2014 reduced by 27%.  That is a major difference, a difference of 9%.  The point was made that the consumer price was based on the projected price in 2015.  I suggest the reduced wholesale price in early 2014 could have been the future price for 2015 and that consumers should enjoy higher reductions than 2%.  I accept the point made about foreign exchange variations and the fixed costs of companies, but in view of the reductions ranging from 18% to 27% in 30% of the companies' costs, I would like to know what is the story.</p> <p>  Many members have touched on my second point, offering reductions based on a consumer switching between companies.  This is punishing loyal customers.  Consumers find it hard to understand why they cannot be offered a direct reduction in the price they are charged but instead have to switch providers to get the best value.  This is a direction from the office of the Commission for Energy Regulation, but from the consumer's point of view, why should he or she have to switch to be offered the discount the companies have enjoyed in the wholesale market? </p> <p>  My third point concerns the impact of renewables.  It is estimated, but I could be wrong that 19% to 30% of our energy comes from renewables, mostly wind energy.  It is supposed to be cheaper to produce electricity using wind energy rather than gas.  The consumer, through the PSO levy, has paid for the capital investment in renewable energy projects.  What impact did such projects have on reducing energy prices in the previous three or four years?</p> <p>  I do not know if each of the companies offers different price matrices to business than to the domestic market.  What is the ratio in commercial and domestic energy consumption?  Commercial consumers have clout that the domestic consumer does not have.  I do not think the domestic consumer receives the same support from the Commission for Energy Regulation as the domestic consumer in the North.  I also suggest a customer in the North might be very anxious to know how his or her prices compare to those in the South given that the foreign exchange rate does not apply to them.</p> <p>  I welcome the 2% reduction in price for the domestic consumer, but it is not enough.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-25a.1063" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1058" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015022500002#P01300"><p>As I concur with everything Deputy Noel Harrington said, I will not repeat it.</p> <p>  Recent commentary has suggested one could abolish Irish Water's charges and transfer them to those paying commercial rates.  Presumably, all of the companies represented are paying commercial rates to local authorities, be they wind energy producers or engaged in the use of gas or oil.  Using that analogy, will they provide an insight into what it would mean to the ultimate user of electricity if, for argument's sake, commercial rates were to be dramatically increased to subvent the investment by local authorities in water infrastructure?  A person in my constituency who generates wind energy recounted to me that his commercial rates had risen dramatically.</p><p>There is a wind-operating facility on his property.</p><p> I wonder what level of engagement those present have had with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and local authorities on their companies' competitiveness because I presume that every increase in commercial rates by the local authorities ultimately wind up with the consumer.  Certainly, these people do not take the hit for it.  Perhaps they would provide me with some degree of insight as to the engagement they have had with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  For instance, have they made a submissions to the Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 that is currently going through the D&aacute;il and have they engaged with the local government management association because I understand that there has been much commentary on this, particularly in the wind energy context?  The reason I ask is it affects my constituency.  It affects the Chairman's constituency too.  It affects the constituencies of all members present because we all come from coastal constituencies and those are the ones most likely to produce wind energy.  If there is to be investment in it in the future, there needs to be a level playing field in terms of the commercial rate base.  From what I have seen, that is not the case.  The change that has taken place in how the valuations are determined for the energy sector, not only in wind but as a whole because we are looking for micro-producers to the grid as well, makes it prohibitive.  However, they might address my first comment, which is, if they were to take the existing increase that local authorities are seeking, together with the push that is there from the Valuation Office and the suggested political push that they take on Irish Water as well, how would that go down with them?</p></speech>

I must declare I was employed by the ESB for quite a while.</p> <p>  I am glad to hear that sympathy, concern and every opportunity is given to the consumer in the case of disconnections.  I am glad that this is still continuing and I hope it will continue that way.  It is as a last resort that consumers are disconnected.  For my colleagues, I can endorse that.</p> <p>  How does the consumer decide on who is the cheapest provider?  I am not saying that I am more clever than any of the rest of them.  Would it be possible for them to merely reduce the bill and maybe let the consumer know?  They will know when they see the bill.</p> <p>  I am fearful.  I am with the same provider - without stating which it is.  I never changed.</p></speech>

If one thinks of it, a few short years ago there was only one supplier and we would deal with the Regulator.  It is to be welcomed that the market has opened up.  To pre-empt the response to the Senator's question, I understand that in the past few years, I am sure in big part due to the opening up of the market, we have seen a reduction in the domestic electricity prices.  Today, the concern, because of the considerable coverage of the drop in gas and oil prices, is what that means for consumers.  This offers a great opportunity to drill down and look at the components of the electricity bill that consumers receive.</p> <p>  The part I would like to look at is the wholesale price.  It follows on from Deputy Harrington's point.  On wind energy, there is a large wind resource in my county, County Mayo.  Of course, we face challenges in developing wind farms at this juncture.  It was not so a few years ago, I might add.  In recent years, there seems to be more concern about the development of them.  From the point of view of cost, and the fact that we have a renewables policy that we must follow and we must develop some form of renewable energy, they might speak to the cost effectiveness of wind, as the chosen renewable source.  At what point might we see the removal of the necessity of a refit tariff for the generators?  The companies represented here are not all generators but some of them are.</p> <p>  We talk about the cost of electricity but, equally, when we go to another committee, the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, we must look at carbon emissions targets.  As well as the good environmental benefits, we are obliged to use more renewables to diversify our dependency on carbon fuels.  Would any member of the delegation care to comment on Government policy and European strategy for the future that will impact on electricity prices and the renewable of choice?  I have heard many groups which have come in suggest it is not wind and it should be something else, and that by the time one puts the concrete in the ground it neutralises the carbon credits one gets.  I seek feedback on the way we should proceed and what the mix should be.  We all know wind is not the ultimate solution in that the system cannot take wind because it does not blow all the time, etc.  I would appreciate some comments on that and its cost to the consumer, which is reflected also in the build-out of the grid because of the need to take the wind energy from the windy parts in the west and along the western seaboard.</p> <p>  There is one other point related to the delivery of wind projects.  As I stated, they are not all in the generation business.  I can only speak from my experience in my county that while a few years ago there seemed to be a positive feeling among the public about wind energy, unfortunately, much of that has dissipated.  I would blame much of the coverage on the midlands project, much of which was misunderstood.  There was a lot of bravado in terms of selling the projects in terms of delivering supply to the United Kingdom, and in the process the change required of the ordinary person and in communities was not taken into account.  That put people off.  I ask the representatives, particularly those of SSE Airtricity, to comment.  SSE Airtricity has a project in Dunneill, only up the road from me, and I have visited it.  There are also State companies which have interests in developing wind farms.  The contrast between the turbulence of the State companies in dealing with the public and the way SSE Airtricity has dealt with the public is stark.  In essence, SSE Airtricity cultivated a recipe of community gain in dealing with the public and the landowners.  The feedback I get from the community is positive.  I contrast it with what I see Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte doing.  That is not taking from the merits of the projects.  On the public relations side, and bearing in mind that the public acceptance of these projects has a big bearing on the ability to deliver them, I wonder do they have any observations on that or whether they have a particular formula for doing it because the approach to the public on the delivery of wind is in danger of scuppering or unduly delaying many projects.</p></speech>

He said there is a view abroad that the wholesale prices of gas are more than 18%, 30%, 40% or whatever, that we have not actually passed them on and that we were basing our position on projections.  I understand that is what he said but he can correct me if I am wrong.  I will deal first with that issue.  As I said earlier, that is a common misconception.  People hold such a view, as I have read in the media.  It is a sustained position when I speak to people in the community.  When we talk about hedging, it is not just projections, we are actually buying power.  It is physically bought in slots as we go forward but is not delivered yet.  We are presently committed to 2016.  The percentage of the actual projection is falling all the time as we get closer to the point, so it is physically bought and it increases in size as we get close to the end.  Therefore, the element of projection is relatively small when one gets to a tariff element.</p></speech>

Again we might have a dispute about the reduction in the wholesale price, some analysts say it is 27% while it was stated as being 18% in this evidence.  Electric Ireland would have bought it early in 2014.  If it had done the same last year as it did this year Electric Ireland would have bought it at that price differential.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-25a.1082" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Dollard" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015022500002#R00900"><p>The key point from our perspective is that any reduction we would have delivered in those slots we have passed through.  We have definitely passed it through.  There is no intention to build margin on the back of falling fuel prices.  We have not done that.  Where those slots have been priced at a lower rate we have factored that in and we have delivered that in the tariff.  There are different numbers about what the rate is and what is the reduction.  It is difficult for us to combat that because it is coming from different perspectives.  The CER, independent from us, has said the reduction in gas prices last year was of the order of 18%.  I would say - it is relevant to the comment I have just made - much of that happened in the second half of the year and it affected the following year as well.  I would stand over the principle that we have passed through everything that we can on what we have bought.  If the wholesale prices continue to fall we will continue to pass them through.  We will buy power at a cheaper price for the future and we will pass that through in due course.  Electric Ireland's view is that if the supply companies try to do anything different or get clever about this it will end badly, as has happened in other markets around us in Europe.  Where the suppliers are starting to build margin in that situation it does not augur well, it is not a good position for supplier companies to take.  The nature of the competition in this particular market will not allow it.  In summary, in terms of the actual gas price reductions that we have achieved, we are passing them through as much as we can in so far as can, and that includes the full value of them.</p> <p>  Why do customers have to switch to get a reduction or a discount?  I made some earlier comments about that.  It is not the case that customers necessarily have to switch.  The perception is that people have to switch.  </p></speech>

For us our dual fuel current offering in the market place discount is available to existing customers as well.  They do have to sign up to certain contract types and all of that.  Some people are not able to do that and I recognise that.  It is true that discounts are available to existing customers.  I made a comment earlier which I think the Deputy is driving towards, that is, the loyal customer.  That is an issue.  If we look at what is happening in the area of health insurance, it appears to me that there will be significant competition in the next few years.  That is a factor of competition.  As the market opens up there is fierce competition in the energy industry and when that is worldwide it is driven primarily by discounts because that is how the competitors, our competitors, gain share.  It has driven our cost base down and it has made us more effective but as the market matures - this is a personal view - we have to move more and more towards loyalty.  We did some work last year in the area of loyalty schemes and they are not insignificant.</p> <p>  We also have to be mindful of how we treat customers in duress.  Affordability is a huge issue in terms of how we deal with customers.  I would like to think that across the industry we are responding and we are trying to be mindful not just in the area of disconnections but in terms of people who are in trouble and who are suffering.  There are some 50,000 customers in our book who are struggling and we are helping them with a significant discount.  There is nothing related to switching.  They are getting that discount because they need it.  That is what is happening.</p> <p>  What is the impact of renewables?  We would all probably have a different perspective on it.  I am a supplier.  I do not have a generator and have no licence to speak about generation but from a supplier buying renewables it is having an impact, it is suppressing prices.  A tariff supports that which is a cost in the PSO, so there is this playoff and that is what people talk about in the industry.  It is having an impact and it is a major factor in energy prices.</p></speech>

There is much merit in that decision though it has an impact for the customer.  There is merit in the country moving away from sole dependence on imported fuels.  We are importing so much of our energy that there is a massive security of supply issue.  I suppose the State took the view that it had to move towards renewables to reduce that impact.  There is a cost.  Wholesale prices are not as high as people would have projected then and that is what is causing that PSO to rise.  If one looks at some of the EirGrid websites, day on day one can actually see the impact of wind.  Over a period of time I cannot say it is having an impact.  I genuinely do not have that information to hand.</p> <p>  The last point was that the domestic customer does not have the clout.  On an individual basis they do not have the same clout as some of the marquee industrials but at another level my colleagues provide them with that clout.  The battle for customers in Ireland is very significant and I think standard rates are not lost in that.  There is a huge fight for domestic customers on this island.  The operators here would have a different perspective on it but I would say we had 100% market share five or six years ago and they have eaten into that as more than 50% of customers have moved.  While on an individual basis the domestic customer does not have clout, through the competition process they have secured greater clout.</p></speech>

We have experienced huge pain in our supply business.  There has been full centralisation and very significant outsourcing.  It has been difficult for our staff - no more than for people in other industries - but competition has driven huge change in our business and it has been at a difficult cost for our staff.

For example, I will extrapolate to show that it will be about &euro;75 million as an additional cost for the industry as a consequence of this change.  It is not a small number, by any means.  On the question of whether we have received any comfort that this will be considered today, the answer is "No", not really.</p></speech>

We highlighted the issue and we signalled a solution to it.

We have to achieve a 2020 target.  The most efficient way to achieve that target is through onshore wind.  Compared to other technologies such as offshore wind, which is highly cost-prohibitive, Ireland has a natural resource of which we must take advantage and I have no doubt that wind has a significant part to play.  I share Deputy Mulherin's concern.  The way social acceptance of the industry has moved in recent years, is worrying.  Where wind farms were regarded favourably in the past, one can see in the media that there is much opposition to them currently.</p> <p>  However, in our view it is our best opportunity to deliver on 2020 targets.  It is hugely favourable to communities.  We have recently begun construction in Galway of the largest onshore wind farm.  It will be an 18-month construction project.  We plan to invest &euro;280 million in it and there will be significant local employment in the building phase in particular.  Three factors are essential for public acceptance, the first being early inclusion.  Wind farm owners and operators are in this for the long term, whether that is 20 up to 50 years, and they are part of the community.  Early engagement with communities in order to understand their needs and for them to understand the plan and to become involved, is very important.  This is one area in which we all need to achieve a very high standard.  </p></speech>

How does the Valuation Office put a commercial rate on a sandbank in the sea because commercial rates are supposed to be about a notional letting value of the property?  Who will rent a sandbank?</p></speech>

The conditions offshore are much more prohibitive and there is more associated risk.</p></speech>

From the point of view of public acceptance, early inclusion is essential.  It is important that companies undertake responsible development and act within the guidelines and within best practice.  Deputy Mulherin referred to community gain, which is hugely important.  At SSE Airtricity we believe that we have led in regard to community gain by way of our community fund whereby a fund is put in place at the start of the operation of the wind farm which benefits the people in the locality.  This can be anything from energy efficiency to university bursaries.  It makes a difference to local communities and that is a very important element in bringing forward renewable energy.  Ultimately, if we do not continue with onshore wind, we will not hit our 2020 targets.</p> <p>  There is a cost to renewables and in Ireland renewables are supported through the refit mechanism.  This mechanism is very cost-competitive when compared with Europe.  It is not over-expensive relative to the EU average.  A comparison of refit 1 versus refit 2 shows the benefits with a reduction in the level of support provided for wind farms.  Ultimately, the aim is to get to a point where technology does not require support, but we still have some way to go in that regard.</p></speech>

Concerns have been expressed by certain local authority areas that the technical expertise is not available on smaller wind farms in particular in order to ensure against flicker and to ensure a properly designed wind farm.</p><p>Do the witnesses have an opinion on that?  Do they think that Government guidelines could be more prescriptive?  As the experts, developing the sector, what is their assessment of that suggestion?  It is fair to say that some local authorities, especially those in the midlands, never thought about wind farms until planning applications started to arrive on their desks?</p></speech>

We believe there has been a level of expertise.  In terms of maturity, it is still an immature market and there are lessons to be learned.  Issues crop up on a site-by-site, project-by-project basis.  The most important point is that it is incumbent on any developer to deal with issues as they arise in a responsive way.  We focus on our responsibility to ensure that the development is done in the proper way.</p> <p>  I cannot comment about what happened in the midlands.  SSE Airtricity is not involved in the midlands.  What I can comment on are the projects we are currently involved in and what we are building.  Our wind farm in Galway will be the largest wind farm on the island of Ireland.  That has been a very positive experience, both for the communities, the developers and the council.  We have come to a meeting of minds where we are developing and will build out a socially responsible project, which will be delivered in the next 18 months.</p></speech>

This is cited as an example of how wind farms are inevitably anti-social and against people.  My understanding, having looked into it, is that the issue that has arisen could have been avoided if the wind farm was designed in the correct way.  That is my concern.</p></speech>

The price of gas for residential customers is 6% below the European average, and the price of electricity is on average.  Compared with Europe, Irish energy prices compare favourably.  That is not to say that we should not try to do better.  To be fair, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has done a great job in charting energy policy in recent years in respect of the optimum mix for the power generation portfolio.  Its support for onshore wind has introduced a good mix.</p> <p>  We have discussed the issue of competition at length.  I think it is demonstrably working for customers.  We re all under pressure and we would love to have Senator Brennan as a customer.  If I may I will get his details afterwards, we will be delighted to talk to him.</p></speech>

In general, Electric Ireland works with customers, in particular  small business or as the Deputy mentioned, the hotel sector to ensure that we have an arrangement that will work for them.  In the case of an existing customer with a good credit history who pays on time by direct debit we would not need a security deposit.  We would certainly never disconnect a customer because of a deposit, we would work to reach an arrangement that would suit the customer.</p></speech>

The last time I looked at this, our company, Energia, had put up &euro;80 million as a security deposit with all the other companies just to enable us to trade.  We have never missed a payment even by a day.</p> <p>  We as suppliers are at the end of a very long supply chain.  We have to pay our taxes, the PSO levies, the new system charges, and our costs.    I have asked numerous times if that could be shared among industry but that has never happened.  That is the reason Energia is focused on credit because we have to pay everything from our sales and the security deposits are significant.  If a customer, be it a domestic or large industry customer does not pay us, we still have to pay everyone else.</p></speech>
