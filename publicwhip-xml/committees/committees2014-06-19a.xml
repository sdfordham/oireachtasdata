Agreed.</p><p>  No. 3 is correspondence received since our meeting of Thursday, 12 June 2014.   No. 3A is correspondence from Accounting Offices and-or Ministers.  No. 3A.1 is correspondence dated 10 June 2014 from the Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, in relation to matters arising from our meeting on 15 May 2014, to be noted and published.  This correspondence relates to CIT and other matters.  As a further report from the Department of Education and Skills remains outstanding, we will hold that correspondence until the full response has been received.  Members can then discuss it.  No. 3A.2 is correspondence received on 10 June 2014 from Mr. Martin Whelan regarding social housing arising from our meeting on 29 May, to be noted and published.</p><p>  No. 3B.1 is correspondence dated 15 April 2014 from an anonymous source regarding Kilmainham Estates Office, to be noted.

Arising out of this reply, we will now ask the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser to assist the committee in putting together a robust response to the two letters we received from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges last week.</p></speech>

The response to the request for senior counsel was that the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser of the Oireachtas can put forward the appropriate replies to both of the letters.</p></speech>

Therefore, Ms English or that office will provide the response to both letters.  It must be remembered that that office would have played a central role in the drafting of the new inquiries legislation and as such would know it line-by-line.  Presumably, bearing that in mind and the role of the Committee of Public Accounts, that office is adequately equipped to respond to both letters.  That is what is stated in the reply from the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-19a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/953" speakername="Shane Ross" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014061900003#E00900"><p>I am not sure we should necessarily accept that.  We will need to respond to the Parliamentary Legal Adviser in regard to whether we accept what she says in her letter to the committee in regard to her not being conflicted about Chinese walls.  We need to take a view on that.</p> <p>We need to take a view on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-19a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014061900004#F00200"><p>The members can take a view on that if they wish.  My explanation for this is that we received the two letters, the legal advisers referred back to us and told us they are more than well equipped to respond to both of the letters and that they have made a decision that the response can be made in-house.  What one can draw from that is that they are not conflicted.  They are very independent in respect of the advice that they give.  You have raised the letter itself and, as you say, it is for the members to decide how to respond to it.  I am suggesting that the response should be that they go ahead and provide the clerk with the legal advice to enable that response to be representative of the opinion of the Committee of Public Accounts and also to put forward a robust case for compellability.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-19a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1008" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014061900004#F00300"><p>I do not believe anybody in this committee questioned the PLA, Mellissa English's, independence or the quality of her advice.  It is important to state that, so no incorrect inference can be drawn.  However, I understood from our conversation at the last meeting that the concern was to get a second opinion.  The committee is breaking new ground.  There is no established set of experiences with compellability.  The legislation is new and the guidelines adopted by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges are new.  In that context it is entirely reasonable for the committee to seek outside legal advice.  It is not necessarily tied up with the workload of the PLA, although that workload is considerable as we are all aware.</p><p>  It appears from the letter that there might have been a misunderstanding on two counts: first, that we were questioning the independence or quality of the advice, which we were not; second, that the dilemma was about workload, which it is not.  The dilemma for the committee is that it is breaking new ground and must get this right.  That is the reason a committee such as this would seek outside legal advice and counsel.  I am not sure how we should proceed.  We are anxious to get the advice and move this matter along.  There is nothing to be gained by stalling matters any further.  However, I am not inclined to let it go at that with the PLA.  I would be inclined to revert to the PLA again, through the clerk, and explain more clearly the reason we want the advice.  Ultimately, we are the elected members of this committee and we are charged with the public responsibility of pursuing matters.  Some weight in the decision making must be given to the view of the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-19a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1106" speakername="Simon Harris" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014061900004#F00400"><p>I largely agree with Deputy McDonald's comments.  It is clear in Ms English's letter that she says there is merit in senior counsel advice, but I believe we must follow the process.  We must do whatever is necessary, which probably involves meeting with the parliamentary legal office to try to progress this to the next stage.</p><p>  Now might not be the appropriate time, but there is also a broader policy issue here and I do not know how we will rectify it.  At some point somebody will have to take the bull by the horns and address the remit of this committee.  Standing Order 163 of the D&aacute;il dictates the remit of this committee and it has not been updated in donkey's years.  It is not always this committee that is pushing the boundaries, as is often portrayed by politicians who are not members of the committee.  It is often the leaders of all political parties in the D&aacute;il who refer issues to this committee, saying that the Committee of Public Accounts should examine the matter.  In fact, it was not just members of this committee who called for certain individuals, whom we are now seeking to compel, to appear before the committee.  Politicians of all political persuasions and none did that as well.  If an expectation is created by the political system that the Committee of Public Accounts is the body to investigate or examine issues, there must be clarity for witnesses, members and the broader political system that it is or is not.</p><p>  Once this compellability saga comes to an end, one way or another, we must have a serious discussion with whoever the relevant people in the Oireachtas are about our exact remit and whether our terms of reference must be updated or not.  If not, we are just wasting people's time by creating an expectation that we can undertake a task and when we try to undertake it competently, we are told we are acting outside our remit.  That is becoming a frustration at this stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-19a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014061900004#F00500"><p>Before inviting other members to speak, I draw attention to the paragraph which states: "The committee's request in the second part seeks legal advice on the topic of PAC's legal remit.  It is stated the committee wishes to seek senior counsel advice with the input of the Office of the PLA on this matter.  I am of the view that there is merit in seeking senior counsel advice on the issue."  There are three issues here.  There is the issue of our compellability request in respect of the section 39 organisations, the issue of our compellability request in respect of the HSE SIPTU account and the third issue, the general remit of this committee and whether it must be updated because it has been the same for donkey's years.</p><p>  On the first two, our legal advisers tell us that they can put forward a case for compellability on both counts that will be robust and will challenge the position of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  On the second count, they are saying to look at the remit and talk to senior counsel about that with them.  On the point you make, there appears to be an agreement that we would get senior counsel opinion on it, but on the first two, which are the two applications for compellability, we must tell the legal advisers to go ahead and present us with the letter of response to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  That case is generally prepared by the clerk and then the legal advisers would look over it, put the legal language into it and submit it to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Once we make that response, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges apparently has been given permission to have the advice of a senior counsel.  Either this committee or the Committee on Procedure and Privileges will test it with senior counsel advice, so we must put forward the best legal case we can.  Our legal advisers say they can do it and that they are competent, capable and independent for it.  Then it goes to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, which will bring in a senior counsel to deal with those two applications.</p><p>  Separate and parallel to that, we can continue to work on the remit.  That is being suggested in the letters.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-19a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014061900004#F00600"><p>For years in Waterford, if this makes any sense, the port in Waterford was suing CIE until somebody realised, after Ministers got involved to no avail, that they were effectively two State bodies.  People asked the very realistic and reasonable question, "Why the hell is the State spending millions of euro, time and energy dealing with something that involves two State bodies?"  The people we are writing to are in this building.  Notwithstanding everything you have said, which makes a great deal of sense, could the chairmen of the two entities have a chat?  Could the clerks of both committees try to figure out some middle ground on this, before we end up in a protracted legalistic nightmare?  We are dealing with an entity that is within the walls of this building.</p> <p>When we get to this point, there may be no return, that is, when we start to involve senior counsel in an exercise like this, in particular one which involves an entity with which we share a building.  We are going too far and need to stop and maybe have some conversations privately to see if we can find some middle ground before we go any further.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-19a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1011" speakername="Robert Dowds" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014061900005#G00200"><p>I support what Deputy Deasy suggested.  I am not sure what he suggests will work but it should be tried.  The bottom line, as far as I am concerned, is that it is really important this committee can compel witnesses where the spending of public moneys is concerned.  Whether they are section 38 or section 39 bodies or Departments is irrelevant, if it involves the spending of public moneys.  I would like us to be in a situation where we can compel witnesses to attend because that is our job.  Anything we can do to progress that should be done.  What Deputy Deasy suggested should be tried.  I have a certain scepticism as to whether it will work but it should be tried before we go down other tracks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-19a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014061900005#G00300"><p>Are members agreed on plan A, as outlined by Deputy Deasy?  If that does not work for any reason, plan B is to submit our case through the parliamentary legal adviser.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-19a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/953" speakername="Shane Ross" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014061900005#G00400"><p>I agree with plan A.  It is a very good suggestion from Deputies Deasy and Dowds that the Chairman should talk the Ceann Comhairle.  However, I would point out that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges has got itself a senior counsel.  We should also have a senior counsel if we are to get into any sort of court conflict with it.  There are problems.  The parliamentary legal adviser was at pains to point out in her letter that she was not conflicted.  I am not a great believer in Chinese walls.  I am afraid that even with the best will in the world, it is very difficult to justify them.  I think we are heading towards a situation where we may get into conflict with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, which should be avoided if possible.  However, we should not be in legal dispute with it on an unequal basis - in other words, it should not have access to senior counsel if we do not have it.</p><p>  It is not so much that the parliamentary legal adviser's office is conflicted, because it is advising both sides, but what we are looking for here - this is a very important point - is an expert in constitutional law.  If the Committee on Procedure and Privileges gets an expert in constitutional law and if we are arguing with it, we should also have an expert in constitutional law.  </p></speech>

That would have to be considered before giving compelability because it is making a serious decision.  On receipt of our reply, then the in-house senior counsel, which goes half way towards meeting what Deputy Deasy suggested, will look at it.  Regardless of what happens, that response has to be made.  The clerk will contact the clerk of that committee to see if we can arrange a meeting between the clerks and the committee Chairmen but I think-----</p></speech>

In the letter received from Ms English, she said senior counsel advice to the Committee of Public Accounts is necessary to see what our remit is but she said she would prefer to wait until after the compellability issue is resolved.  Would it be possible to run all three together?</p></speech>

Then there is an argument that we are testing the boundaries here.   After that, we will know exactly what needs to be addressed in the context of Standing Order 163.  They are the steps that have to be taken.  We can take the first two steps immediately and then the final step as to the remit of the committee.  If that needs to be changed, we will get an application together for a change.  That goes to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges also.  Are we agreed on that?</p></speech>

It is important that, as a committee, we set out acceptance of the independence and quality of the advice but also explain our perspective on it, given the fact this is new terrain, and also assert the right, notwithstanding the quality of the staff and the advice offered, that it should be taken in the spirit in which it is intended, when a committee asks for outside advice.  It should not prompt a response that is based on any kind of defensiveness because that is absolutely unnecessary.  I think, as a matter of courtesy to the woman, we should respond in that spirit.</p></speech>

No. 4.2 is the Health Service Executive.  I draw members' attention to the fact the HSE's annual financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2013 were delivered after our hearing last week.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has drawn attention to a number of notes in regard to the accounts, including the ineligibility for medical cards in the context of internal financial control and disclosures.  The second one is weaknesses in the HSE oversight and monitoring of grants to voluntary sector providers, the high incidence of failure to comply with relevant procurement guidelines and regulations, the non-recovery of potential income from other EU states and instances of non-compliance with the tax code.  That is arising out of the 2013 annual financial statements.  I do not know whether the Comptroller and Auditor General wants to comment on any of that.</p></speech>

I saw it last year and the previous one, where medical cards were held by people who were not in the country, who had left or emigrated, and where doctors were still being paid and sending out letters.</p> <p>They may have emigrated but the doctors are still being paid and letters are still being sent.  According to the 2012 accounts, there were 15,000 medical cards in respect of which nobody knows whether the holders were still in this country.  That was a follow-up from the 2011 accounts.  Three years later we are still dealing with the same issue.  I am not getting into the broader question; this is purely about accounting for medical cards of people who have moved abroad or died.  For three years in a row the annual accounts found the issue was not being addressed.</p><p> In regard to the non-recovery of potential income from other EU states, I learned from a parliamentary question I tabled yesterday that we get approximately &euro;200 million from the UK Government in respect of people who paid contributions in the UK and are entitled to services from the NHS.  As they have retired to Ireland, we are obliged to provide a similar level of cover, including medical cards.  Is that money paid to the HSE or the Central Fund?</p></speech>

At last week's committee meeting, the director general of the HSE advised the committee that he intended to issue the report to us earlier this week.  Given that we have been partners on the issue and that the reason for the existence of the interim administrator is because of the heavy lifting done by members of this committee in terms of posing difficult questions to the board of the CRC and its former chief executives, I wonder why the HSE has not lived up to its commitment to provide a copy of this report, which it has been sitting on for two weeks.

Some &euro;1.7 billion, or approximately 83%, was spent on transport, with the remainder going to tourism, sport and the Department&rsquo;s own administration expenses.<br />The majority of the Department&rsquo;s expenditure is in the form of grant funding for other State agencies.  For example, in 2012, the Department paid &euro;1.1 billion to the National Roads Authority for its programmes of investment in the construction, improvement and maintenance of national, regional and local roads and PPP projects and the authority&rsquo;s administration costs.  Some &euro;436 million was paid to the National Transport Authority in 2012 to fund public service obligation grants for transport operators, capital investment in public transport and administration expenditure.  A supplementary estimate for Vote 31 was passed in November 2012 to increase the provision for the CIE companies, partly offset by savings on other programmes in the Vote.  At year end, the amount liable for surrender was just over &euro;4 million.<br />Chapter 14 deals with accumulating cash balances at the Road Safety Authority.  In 2012, the authority had total income of &euro;43.3 million.  This included &euro;13.6 million in State grant funding from Vote 31.  The balance came from non-Exchequer sources, principally &euro;12.5 million from application fees for driver testing and &euro;15 million in proceeds from a statutory levy on the national car test.  The authority incurred expenditure of &euro;41.1 million in 2012, resulting in a surplus of &euro;2.1 million for the year.<br />Substantial reductions in annual Exchequer funding to the authority since 2010 have been more than offset by increased income from other sources.  As a result, ongoing annual surpluses have resulted in the build-up of substantial cash balances and accumulated revenue reserves.  At the end of 2012, the authority&rsquo;s bank balance amounted to &euro;25.5 million and its accumulated revenue reserves amounted to &euro;18.5 million.  The bank balance included &euro;2.7 million in fees paid for driving tests not yet taken.  The chief executive officer will be able to update the committee on the bank balance and reserve levels at end 2013.  The Department explained that the authority needed to have funds available for future capital projects and for contingencies.  However, it was noted that addition to fixed assets by the authority in recent years was only of the order of &euro;2 million to &euro;3 million a year.<br />One of the core principles of public financial procedures is that State funds should only be issued to grantees to allow them to meet foreseeable funding requirements as they arise.  Providing significant State funding in advance of when it is actually required has an opportunity cost in the form of interest on State borrowing. <br />Chapter 14 also reviewed the development of service level agreements between the Department and the authority associated with the funding provision.  Annual service level agreements have been put in place to formalise the arrangement for the provision of services detailed in the authority&rsquo;s annual business plans.  These were specified in great detail, with approximately 260 output categories.  The agreements provide for an annual review of the authority&rsquo;s performance under the agreement, but this was not conducted for 2012.  My report recommended that a smaller set of key performance indicators should be developed, with a balanced focus on the volume and quality of services.  A formal review of actual performance against agreed targets should be conducted on an annual basis.  The Accounting Officer and chief executive will be able to update the committee on progress in this regard.<br />The issues raised in the chapters on the management of the fixed charge notice system and the outsourced safety cameras are matters primarily for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Most of these have been covered in some detail at previous meetings of the committee, and I do not intend to repeat them.  If required, I can outline findings on any specific aspect during the course of the meeting.  Members may wish to note that just in the past couple of days, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Justice and Equality have announced changes to the administration of the fixed charge notice system that should deal comprehensively with all the recommendations addressed to the Garda Commissioner in Chapter 7.<br />The fixed charge notice system is primarily intended to have an impact on driver behaviour and to result in safer roads.  These are objectives that are shared with both the Department and the Road Safety Authority.  A key aspect of the overall penalty points system is the National Vehicle and Driver File.  Responsibility for the file and for road traffic legislation rests with the Department.  The authority deals with the issuing of driving licences.<br />One of the key objectives of the fixed charge notice system is to contribute to safer driving and reduce road accident casualties.  The number of fatalities on Irish roads has declined rapidly from a peak in 2005.  However, it is not clear to what extent this is attributable to the operation of the fixed charge notice system.  We noted that a similar level of decline has occurred in road accident fatalities in other jurisdictions.  For example, Ireland and the UK both achieved a 51% fall in road fatality rates <i>per capita</i>during the period 2002 to 2010, the latest period for which international comparisons were available.  Other factors that contribute to the level of fatalities include vehicle design changes, better roads, trends in travel patterns and road safety promotion.  The latter is a key activity of the authority.<br />One issue noted in chapter 7 relates to the incidence of unpaid fines for company vehicles, usually in cases where vehicles whose registered owners are companies are detected speeding.  Because the companies declare that the drivers of the vehicles at the time cannot be identified, unpaid fines in such cases are not being pursued through the courts.  This matter was raised in a 2003 report from my office.  Legislation was passed in 2004 to address this, but Members may recall previous evidence that this was found to be ineffective.   Revised legislation to enhance the existing provisions was passed in 2010, but had not been commenced at the time I reported.  The Accounting Officer may be able to outline progress since then.</p></speech>

However, I am always happy to get feedback, either directly or through the Clerk to the Committee, on whether the committee would like more or less detail on what is provided.  As committee members have this briefing material, I will keep my opening remarks quite short.</p><p>  As the Comptroller and Auditor General has said, in 2012 our overall gross expenditure was just over &euro;2 billion.  Almost 22% of this did not come from the Exchequer but from appropriations in aid, mainly motor tax receipts channelled through the local government fund.  The Vote was split more or less 60:40 between capital and current spend.  In 2012, some 84% of the Vote went towards the land transport programme, mainly roads at &euro;1.1 billion, public transport investment at &euro;254 million and public service provision payments at &euro;290 million.  The balance was divided between the tourism programme, at &euro;143 million, sports at &euro;80 million, maritime transport and safety, including the coastguard, at &euro;70 million and civil aviation at &euro;28 million.  Our administrative budget represents just 1.7% of our overall programme spend, at &euro;34.5 million.</p><p>  The year 2012 was the first year of implementation of the comprehensive review of expenditure.  The Department successfully delivered on the targeted reductions in its expenditure, achieving a 14% reduction on the previous year.  This was achieved despite the fact we had to reallocate funding within our subheads in order to supplement the public service subvention for CIE.</p><p>  Despite these financial constraints and a continuing and substantial reduction in our staffing levels, the Department contributed to a number of good outcomes for 2012 in transport, tourism and sport, and I will now give a quick overview of these.  In transport, we oversaw an investment of &euro;254 million in the upgrading of public transport infrastructure and services, including approval for the Luas cross-city project and the roll-out of the new Leap card.</p> <p>We also administered &euro;605 million in capital investment on national roads, &euro;42 million in ongoing national roads maintenance and &euro;377 million on regional and local roads.  Some 1.73 million passenger journeys were funded through the rural transport programme.  The national vehicle driver file collected &euro;1 billion in motor tax receipts, issued 4.62 million motor tax discs and 671,000 driving licences.</p><p> It was also a successful year from a safety perspective.  Road fatalities reached a record low of 162.  The Irish Coast Guard responded to almost 2,000 incidents, assisting more than 2,700 people and saving more than 160 lives.  The air accident investigation unit published 23 air accident reports.</p><p> While 2012 was a challenging year for tourism, revenue from overseas visitors increased by 4.5% to &euro;3.68 billion.  The sector saw a turnaround in fortunes from the US market, which was up by 10%.  Employment in the tourism and hospitality industry grew by 5,000 to reach 185,000 and 2012 was also the year that launched The Gathering initiative, which delivered exceptional results in 2013.</p><p> The year 2012 was also good for sport.  The programmes of the Irish Sports Council contributed to securing 64 medals at Olympic, Paralympic, world and European levels.  We also re-launched the sports capital programme with &euro;19.8 million paid out in sports capital grants and &euro;31 million allocated under the new round.</p><p> On the two specific issues referred to by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his 2012 report, I will comment briefly as follows.  As mentioned, the management of the fixed charge notice system is largely a matter for others but there is one recommendation in the report that relates to the responsibilities of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  This concerns the mismatch of driver information held by the Garda and by the national vehicle driver file.  It is suggested that a regular review of information should be conducted between the two bodies.</p><p> The Department has been participating for the past year in a penalty points working group that has been addressing the difficulties relating to the gathering and exchange of accurate and up-to-date information within State agencies.  As the committee is aware, there have been a number of examinations and reviews of the fixed charge notice and penalty points system over the past two years and, following the most recent report from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, a criminal justice working group was established which comprises representatives of all relevant State agencies.  The main function of the working group is to oversee and facilitate the recommendations contained in the inspectorate report.  The group will subsume the work of the penalty points working group and therefore will address the issues raised in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  The criminal justice working group is required to report to the Government regularly and its first report will be submitted in July.</p><p> At the conclusion of his statement the Comptroller and Auditor General asked me to expand on the issue of company cars.  This is not covered in my opening statement, so when we reach the question and answer session, I will deal with the matter in detail.</p><p> As regards chapter 14, which relates to Road Safety Authority cash reserves, I believe that the main conclusion to be drawn is a very positive one.  Since the RSA was established, it has been moving from a position where it was very dependent on Exchequer funding, to the tune of &euro;40 million in 2008, to an Exchequer allocation of only &euro;3.37 million this year.  It is expected to be entirely self-funding next year.  It has achieved this even while taking responsibility for two new functions, the commercial vehicle roadworthiness service and the national driver licence service, each of which involved considerable initial outlay.</p><p> If an agency is going to be self-funding, it needs to carry sufficient reserves to meet the needs of its capital programme and also to deal with cyclical downturns in income.  The latter point is a particularly important one that I am sure the chief executive officer will address in more detail later on.  The recession has meant that we have an ageing car fleet.  This means there is an above average demand for the national car test, NCT, and therefore a spike in income from that source.  That trend will reverse as the economy grows in the future and people replace old cars with new ones so NCT income may fall for a time.</p><p> The annual service level agreements in place between the Department and the Road Safety Authority have proved successful in ensuring the Road Safety Authority has adequate funding to deliver its functions, including an essential capital programme, while also providing the mechanisms for identifying situations where the capital reserve exceeds the agreed amount in reductions to Exchequer draw-downs.  The Road Safety Authority has not received any capital Exchequer allocation since 2010.</p><p> The report also identified a number of areas for improvement and made a recommendation as to how such improvements can be achieved.  Recommendation 14.1 of the report suggests that the Department and the Road Safety Authority should develop key performance indicators and conduct a formal review of actual performance each year against those indicators.  The Department has accepted this recommendation and, in addition to the monthly update meetings between the Department and the CEO of the Road Safety Authority that have taken place for some time, it will carry out a formal annual performance review this year.  Key performance indicators are set out by the Road Safety Authority in its business plan for 2014, and these will also be reviewed in the context of the annual performance review.</p><p> That concludes my opening statement and I am happy to take the committee's questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-19a.77" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Moyagh Murdock" time="10:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014061900008#K00500"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee members for this opportunity to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts and assist in the examination of the Road Safety Authority's cash balances as highlighted in chapter 14 of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General for 2012.</p><p>  I have been CEO at the Road Safety Authority for almost four months.  With me today is Mr. Pearse White, head of finance at the authority.  The RSA has achieved much in its relatively short lifetime.  I have seen road deaths fall from 335 in 2003 to 190 in 2013.  Aside from avoiding the loss and trauma suffered by families and society, reducing serious road collisions has a significant financial benefit.  A recent evaluation of the first road safety strategy from 2007 to 2012, which was commissioned by the Government, notes that the impact of the strategy equates to stopping around 686 fatal collisions, 1,300 serious injury collisions and 650 minor collisions.  This amounts to a monetary saving for the Exchequer and society of around &euro;1.85 billion.  The evaluation was conducted by the RPS Group using financial calculations set out by A&amp;L Goodbody.</p><p>  In the ten year period from 2003 to 2013 road fatalities have fallen by 43%.  In the same period injuries have fallen by 16%.  I have included a detailed report on the financial history of the RSA as part of this submission, including revenue and expenditure as set out by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The report outlines how the Road Safety Authority has utilised revenue and cash reserves in the first road safety strategy and how it has reduced dependency on Exchequer funding in recent years.  This occurred against a backdrop of assuming additional statutory functions, as outlined by the Secretary General.  The key statutory functions we adopted are the transfer of commercial vehicle roadworthiness testing from local authorities, implementation of the new driver licence service, responsibility for the approved driving instruction regulation, and regulation and provision of certificate of professional competence, CPC, training for bus and truck drivers.  The authority also assumed responsibility under the carriage of dangerous goods regulation some years ago.  All of the additional functions were assigned to the authority in accordance with statute and following detailed discussions with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on funding and resources.  The additional statutory functions were assigned on condition that the authority would fund them from its own resources.</p><p>  On behalf of the RSA I thank the committee members as elected representatives and all of their colleagues in the Oireachtas for the encouragement and support we continue to receive as we implement these projects.  There was cross-party support for all of these areas and the two major projects in 2013 were the commercial vehicle roadworthiness test, CVRT, and the national driver licence service, NDLS.  These were significant developments and there were hiccups along the way.  However, I am happy to report that we are in a better position and further improvements will be delivered in the coming months.</p><p>  As outlined in the submission, the Road Safety Authority has been funded through a combination of Exchequer and non-Exchequer funding.  The Exchequer allocation for 2014 is approximately &euro;3.37 million, and this represents 5% of projected income for the year.</p> <p>The remaining 95% emanates from revenues generated by those services such as driver testing, licensing, commercial vehicle testing and national car testing.  Both the Department and the authority expect us to be fully self-funding by 2015.  It is in that context that the authority and the Department see it as appropriate that reserves are in place to ensure we are on a secure financial footing in the medium term.  In any organisation it is considered good financial management to manage affairs prudently, provide for unforeseen expenditure, and have adequate liquidity on hand to cover short to medium-term cashflow demands.</p><p> The reserves held by the authority are essential in allowing us to implement the initiatives set out in the Government&rsquo;s current Road Safety Strategy 2013-2020.  They allow us to withstand unpredictable costs which may be incurred during early stages of some the major change projects, for instance, the commercial vehicle roadworthiness testing, CVRT, and the driver licence service.</p><p> The latter part of the detailed submission deals with the recommendation set out in the audit report of 2012.  This has been adopted and I, as chief executive officer of the authority, meet the road safety division of the Department on the last Tuesday of every month to present our latest achievements, our key performance indicators, KPIs, and our road safety issues and future plans.  This monthly meeting is used to update the Department on the authority&rsquo;s performance in respect of each of the service delivery requirements contained within our service level agreement.  Later this year I hope to have a full formal review with the Department on our overall performance.</p><p> I believe the Comptroller and Auditor General report on cash balances in the RSA demonstrates that the authority has exercised prudence and good financial management in the course of its operation in terms of its reserves.  I also believe that the Road Safety Authority has continued to make very significant and demonstrable progress in improving road safety in Ireland through effective use of these reserves and also previous Exchequer funding.  In the most recent rankings published, Ireland was sixth in Europe in terms of road safety, and this is in no short measure down to the continued investment in reform programmes, driver education, promotion, training and testing, enforcement and engineering.</p><p> Unfortunately, in 2013 we had 190 deaths on our roads.  That is an increase of 28 on 2012 and demonstrates that there remains considerable scope for further achievements.  So far in 2014 we are on the same level of fatalities as we were this time in 2013 in that 84 lives were lost on our roads, the most recent being a motorcyclist losing his life on the road last night.</p><p> The successes of the past indicate that further progress can be made provided effective policies and strategies are put in place and are resourced and funded appropriately into the future.  The RSA has dealt with the complex legacy issues we inherited with many of the public services now under the authority&rsquo;s remit at no additional cost to the Exchequer, and I am confident we will continue to do so into the future.</p></speech>

That is roughly the output if I am right.  The figure was &euro;42 million in 2012 and at the same time it has &euro;20 million in the bank.  That is a great deal of money.  I have heard that there could be cyclical demand in the future, that there is a capital programme and that the authority is getting ready to be cut loose, so to speak, but &euro;20 million, or half of the yearly spend of the authority, accumulating gradually over a number of years is a great deal of money to have in the bank.  In chapter 14 the Comptroller and Auditor General points out that there is a cap set, the following year the authority's revenues increase, and therefore the cap is changed to accommodate that.  Ms Murdock has said the money is for capital programmes, cyclical downturns and so on.  Are they calculated figures?  Are there plans in place?  Are there budgets, costings or is it bigger than that?</p></speech>

As the Deputy said, there are significant cash balances on hand.  We have reduced our dependency on Exchequer funding down to the current level of an allocation of &euro;3.37 million this year.  We also have a very detailed capital investment plan about which the Deputy asked.  We have initiated the commercial vehicle reform programme.  A significant amount of that capital is earmarked for the future development and the roll-out over the next few years.  We have spent approximately &euro;3 million this year on that programme, and over the next seven years approximately &euro;27 million will be assigned to that particular project.</p><p>  We also have a number of upfront costs with the new national driving licence service, NDLS, which also will consume allocations from the cash reserves.  We also have a driving test and a State refurbishment programme in the pipeline.   We are currently looking at an allocation of &euro;4 million towards that where it was flagged that a number of upgrades and improvements are necessary in the driving test estate within the RSA.  We have a number of other stakeholders involved in that process such as the Office of Public Works, OPW, and while on the surface it seems as if we have accumulated cash reserves, there is a timing issue at play, and that is in the pipeline.  I do not know if Mr. White wants to add to that.</p></speech>

That forms part of the ongoing discussion between the Department and the RSA on which we agree over the course of the year how much of its allocation we will allow it draw down.  Last year, we did not allow it draw down the full allocation and the likelihood is that this year we will not allow it draw down the full allocation either.  To put it in context, this was all foreseen when the legislation was being passed to set up this body.</p> <p>My Department is responsible for a number of commercial semi-States.  We do not give them money.  We do not have a concern about the reserves except for ensuring the reserves are enough not to threaten the viability or solvency of the body.  We then require it to pay us a dividend if it can afford to pay it.</p><p> When the Road Safety Authority was set up in 2006, section 28(6) of the Road Safety Authority Act 2006 stated specifically: &ldquo;The Authority shall not, as a matter of course, be compelled to surrender to the Exchequer any moneys it has on hands at the end of a financial year and may retain such moneys to finance its operations but the Minister may require the Authority to pay a dividend to the Exchequer of an amount determined by him or her.&rdquo;  I will outline the track that we have been following.  Around 2008, when the authority had geared up and was fully operational, it received about &euro;40 million in Exchequer funding.  This year, it will receive somewhere between &euro;0 and &euro;3.37 million.  The latter is the allocation but it may end up getting nothing or a figure in-between.  It will depend on how its commercial receipts &ndash; if we want to call them that &ndash; develop over the rest of this year.  The intention is that from next year, it will be getting nothing.  In terms of capital, it has not got any capital allocation from us since 2010.  This is the process we have been going through.</p><p> We might not be calling the authority a commercial semi-State but we are effectively turning it into one, whereby it will be entirely self-funding.  At the moment, we are effectively taking a dividend by not allowing the authority draw down the full amount of the allocation.  If and when it has no allocation and there is surplus money available at the end of the year, we will take it by means of a dividend, but we are very conscious that the reasons the reserves have been accumulating at a faster rate than expected is because of what will not be a permanent pattern in the NCT.  Therefore, there two things that the body must guard against, the first being a downturn.  Second, it must provide for its capital programmes.</p></speech>

During that year, a report was produced on behalf of the RSA on the driver testing estate, as Ms Murdock has called it.  This suggested that there was a need for an upgrade of the estate.  To meet EU-level requirements on heavy goods vehicles and motorcycle testing, in particular, there was a requirement to upgrade the estate.  The old testing centres were no longer fit for purpose, according to the report.  Therefore, the RSA needed funding to expand, upgrade and refurbish the facilities that were still usable.  We agreed, in that context, that we would extend the reserve by &euro;4 million.</p></speech>

That legislation was introduced under the EU regulations.  We sought and got a derogation not to implement that back in 2012.  We have had an extension at this stage, so as not to move to the eight-gear test standard.  However, the situation is now that we have given many of the driving training schools an extension so they could have time to invest in new capital equipment so they can conduct training and carry out the tests.  There is a feeling that it will impose some hardship on people but we have worked with the stakeholder group to push that out as far as possible.  However, we are now in a position where we must implement the latest standard, which is an eight-gear driving test.</p></speech>

I have included that as part of the submission today.  It began in October 2012 when he was advised that there was an issue.  He took a call from Mr. Conor Faughnan of AA Roadwatch to advise him there was an issue.  When our chairman received that information, he immediately informed a number of people, as set out in the chronology.  I will not go through it line by line.  In summary, he contacted GSOC and the Comptroller and Auditor General and he advised An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  He then met the whistleblower face to face.  He reported to his board the exact nature of that meeting, and then he proceeded to submit the detailed report to the GSOC body.  Following that, there were a number of letters to and from different agencies, including to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  It was just to advise him that this was in train.  Following that, the involvement of the authority was very limited in that we had passed over the file to the relevant bodies.  We awaited outcomes of investigations and reports.  One investigation, the one with GSOC, is ongoing.</p><p>  I have a detailed list.  If anyone has any particular question, he may ask it.  The list starts on 9 October 2012.  The last communication would have been on 5 September.  It was in and around that time that my predecessor departed from the Road Safety Authority to avail himself of a new opportunity.</p></speech>

Basically, I assume the feeling was that this needed to be addressed at the appropriate level and that if there was substance to it, obviously corrective action and remedial initiatives would have be taken, and it would have to be brought to the attention of the relevant authorities.  I am sure it caused shock and concern to the layperson.</p></speech>

Sergeant McCabe came to the Department with the dossier of information.  My colleague, Mr. Treacy, met him and at a later stage, though I am not sure when, Sergeant McCabe also met the Minister.  When the information was provided to us it was clearly of great concern.  However, the problem for us was that the information - as everyone now knows since the information is in the public domain and has been the subject of various reports - was in essence on the manner in which garda&iacute; were or were not enforcing the legislation.  Of course, we formulate the legislation but it is for garda&iacute; to enforce it.  The Department of Justice and Equality oversees that.  As with other Departments, we have a member of staff from the Office of the Attorney General assigned to us.  We consulted with her and took legal advice on what we should do.  The advice was that we should give the information to the Department of Justice and Equality.  We did that in September 2012.  There was subsequently correspondence between our Minister and the Minister for Justice and Equality also.  That was really the only route we could go with the information as garda&iacute; do not have any direct line of accountability to us.</p></speech>

I asked if there had been anybody else corresponded with.  Mr. Brett made the point there was not.  Once he received the report from the whistleblower, Sergeant Maurice McCabe, he communicated with GSOC and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  After that, he did not discuss the issue with any other party as he felt it would have been entirely inappropriate to raise it with anybody else outside that audience.  That is probably why there is no direct correspondence to the Department and the Minister.  I had that question from the committee before the meeting, but I was thinking in the context of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na if there was any other correspondence.  The same reason would apply to anybody else outside the GSOC body and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Once the report had been submitted and the investigations initiated, Mr. Noel Brett did not discuss it with anybody else.</p></speech>

He got confirmation from both those bodies that they had received it and that it would be dealt with appropriately.  There was some follow up confirmation communication on that.  I am happy to make the file available to the committee if it wants to examine it in more detail.

I wish to follow on from the issue the Comptroller and Auditor General found lay with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, namely, company cars.  He raised it in 2003 and there was an attempt to deal with it in 2004 that did not work out.  It is still an issue.  Can Mr. O'Mahony update us on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-19a.145" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom O'Mahony" time="11:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014061900012#O00200"><p>The issue here is where a car is picked up by the speed cameras and is found to be registered to a company rather to an individual.  The question then relates to who is driving.  A provision was put into the Road Traffic Act 2004 so that if the registered owner of the car did not give information as to who was actually driving it, the registered owner was responsible for the offence.  If the registered owner was a company, it would mean that the company would have to pay the fixed charge penalty but, of course, that would mean that no penalty points would be assigned anywhere, so from a company's point of view, the penalty is probably a fairly minor deterrent.  In order to strengthen that, the 2010 Act included a new provision that gave the Garda the power to seek information from a company regarding the driver details - in other words, the member of staff who had this car registration out at a particular time on a particular day.  Non-compliance was made an offence with a maximum penalty of &euro;5,000.</p><p>  That part of the Road Traffic Act 2010 is not yet commenced because, unfortunately, it is in the same part of the Act as a provision dealing with what we refer to as the third payment.  I will explain what the third payment is and the difficulties in this area.  The problem is that the Act is drafted in such a way that these two provisions are entirely intertwined so it is not possible to commence the company car provision until we can commence the provision about the third payment.  I am assuming the Deputy has never been unfortunate enough to get penalty points, but if he had been-----</p></speech>

One is supposed to go to a police station, pay the fine and give one's driving licence details so the penalty points can be recorded.  If a person does not do it in a prescribed period of time, they get another letter and the fine is increased.  If they still ignore it, they will get a summons.  Under the legislation as it is at the moment, there is no "out" from going to court at that point.  If a person has ignored the first two letters, they are definitely going to court and there is no other provision.  It was agreed by the Oireachtas that it would probably improve the efficiency of the system and reduce the demands on the courts system if the person could have the option of paying a further increased fine at the point at which a summons is issued.  In other words, they would have a third option of going to the post office, paying an increased amount again and having the points recorded on their licence.</p><p>  At the time we were drafting the legislation, everybody was in agreement with the principle of this and the courts and the Garda were anxious to have it in place, so it was put into the legislation and the legislation was passed in 2010.  It then ran into implementation difficulties.  The implementation is between the Garda and the courts, but it was going to require significant resources, including the development of IT systems.  Unfortunately, we were now into the period of severe cutbacks in everybody's resources and it became an issue for quite a period of time that neither the courts nor the Garda were in a position to proceed with the development of the IT systems that would enable this measure to be implemented.  Our legal advice was that one could not commence the provision until these systems were in place.  </p><p>  The light at the end of the tunnel is that over the past number of months, particularly in light of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and the various other things that have happened, there has been a major effort, through the group co-chaired by our Department and the Department of Justice and Equality, which includes the Garda and the courts, to resolve all outstanding issues around penalty points.  We are able to do this because of the previous issue we were talking about, namely, the fact that the RSA is reducing its demand on us.  We are coming up with a substantial financial contribution, although the systems are not our systems.  We are making the money available along with the Department of Justice and Equality so that these IT systems can be developed.  I need confirmation on whether it is the courts or the Garda that has taken ownership of it.</p></speech>

A previous report from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report spent a considerable amount of time detailing the evasion rate.  New legislation was being discussed at the time.  Can Mr. O'Mahony update me on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-19a.153" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom O'Mahony" time="11:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014061900012#O01000"><p>I can.  The legislation from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is colloquially referred to as "gapping".  It basically aims to remove the possibility people had in the past of declaring a vehicle as having been off the road after the event.  This was regarded as being the primary method people used to evade motor tax.  That legislation came into place last summer.  When we had the discussion last year, there was general agreement, particularly based on the surveys we had done using the cameras on the M50, that the evasion rate was in the region of 5%, or 5%-plus.  At the end of May, 149,000 more vehicles were taxed than had been the case during the same period last year.  Gerry O'Malley, who heads the national vehicle and driver file, was with us for the discussion last year and is absolutely recognised as the greatest expert in the country on motor taxation, estimates, based on his knowledge of new car sales and what one would expect to happen, that the taxing of 130,000 of those vehicles is attributable to the gapping measures.  We regard the actual live fleet of cars in the country as being about 2.6 million.  Doing the maths on that, we would estimate that there has been a 5% increase in the number of cars taxed specifically on foot of the closing of that loophole in that legislation.  That 5% is of the same general order as what we were estimating last year.  I am not claiming for a minute that nobody evades motor tax, but I think it can safely be said that this is a very significant return on the work involved in developing that legislation.  We would put the motor tax value of that at somewhere north of &euro;50 million.</p></speech>

I will commence with the Road Safety Authority.  In respect of the increase in the number of road deaths recorded, which we very much regret, what is the reason for the turnaround?  How can we get back to the continuing decline that was experienced from 1972 to 2012?  I pay tribute to the work done because according to Mr. O'Brien's figures there were 604 road deaths in 1972 which went down to 162 in 2012.  That was a huge achievement over those years but I do not want to see that figure increasing.</p></speech>

So far in 2014, the number has remained constant.  The nature of the fatality has changed.  There has been a 25% reduction in driver fatalities.  However, we have seen an increased number of deaths in more vulnerable road users.</p></speech>

The Deputy may have heard yesterday's weekly message stating that two young people under the age of 16 were killed, a total of eight up to now.  This is two more than for the whole of last year.  That is a very worrying trend.  We have also had an increase in the number of deaths in older road users, primarily motorcyclists.  A number of campaigns and promotion programmes are in place.  Of the ten motorcyclists deaths so far this year, five have been domestic Irish drivers and five have been tourists on holiday in Ireland.  They have been very freakish accidents that one could not necessarily mitigate against.  However, through our promotional campaigns we are working in tandem with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to increase visibility and enforcement of the legislative provisions relating to the use of mobile telephones.  We have a number of strong campaigns in train to try to reverse that trend.  In terms of drivers themselves, there has been a reduction in the number of deaths.  The message is to take personal responsibility.  Speed is the single biggest factor in road fatalities and we have to get that message across.</p></speech>

Density is probably an issue, also pedestrianisation, cyclists and distractions, with people walking with iPods and not being aware of the risks around them.  That is a big factor.</p></speech>

Following those allegations and subsequent findings of incidences of fraud, the Road Safety Authority has a robust auditing system in place with the operators to ensure that vehicles are presented with the correct driver-owner associated with it.  A regular audit procedure is in place.  We have introduced much more transparency in that the client sees his or her vehicle go through a test and everybody else sees it.  That is also part of the commercial vehicle testing programme.  All vehicles are filmed as they go through a test so there is full visibility of the procedure.  There are no short cuts and no attempt to present a different vehicle than should be in the lane.  An independent audit is carried out by PwC and AA Ireland to ensure the integrity of the test, the findings and the testers.  If we have a report of an incident of inappropriate conduct on a test, it is dealt with very promptly.  We have had a number of disciplinary actions in the past 12 months and swift action has been taken.  They have been investigated and appropriate action taken.  I am satisfied that we have a robust system in place subsequent to those earlier issues that were identified a number of years ago.</p></speech>

I turn to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  One of the aims of the Department's mission statement is to get people to leave their cars aside, people like me who probably should not drive in here every day, as I am a Dublin Deputy.  What is it planned to do in that regard?  What is the position regarding the use of public transport particularly in this city but in cities generally and is there any sign of moving away from the use of private cars?  What type of proactive policies are in place to encourage that move?  There is no doubt the Department is right to do that.  As a city we are very poor in terms of public transport compared to equivalent cities in other parts of Europe.</p></speech>

One is having more public transport options in place.  Given the cutback in expenditure in recent years, projects such as the DART underground and metro have had to be put on hold.  However, the Luas cross-city project is being developed at present.  Working with the public transport system, there is much that can be done and has been done in the past two or three years to make it a more attractive alternative for the customer.  The impact of the Leap card and the real time passenger information has exceeded expectations.  In April 2014, the 500,000th Leap card was sold, which was way ahead of the targets set.</p> <p>As the committee is probably aware, new initiatives are being rolled out almost on a monthly such as fare capping.  Today a tourist Leap card will be announced.  The idea behind the initiative is that one will eventually be able to know that public transport will not cost above a certain amount.  Even if one must use a train to travel part of the journey and then a bus, or whatever, one will have a daily and weekly limit, etc.  The realtime passenger information service has put people in a situation-----   </p></speech>

I use public transport and I am one of the people that I talked about who use the train and bus to complete a journey.  Therefore, I can vouch that it is useful to be able to read realtime information on a smartphone.  Let me give a practical example.  There are a number of different bus stops located on the streets of the city centre.  With realtime information one can check which bus will come first and therefore locate oneself at the right bus stop.  It is a small thing but it might persuade somebody to use public transport.  Also, the availability of Wi-Fi on buses and trains has proved a significant advantage.</p><p>  Since the start of this year the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and his Minister of State, the latter of which has responsibility for public transport, have met the chief executives of all of the public transport companies for a monthly meeting.  This year there is a target to increase the usership of public transport by 2% which equates to 5 million visits.  The monthly meeting with the chief executives are used to outline how the figures are going and what other initiatives are being put in place.  The National Transport Authority, which is responsible for the Leap card and provides oversight, is also in attendance.  There is a lot happening.</p><p>  As somebody who has used public transport for a long time, the current offering is better now than it was a number of years ago but it is not the only means by which we are trying to get people out of their cars.  I am certain that the committee is aware of the huge amount of initiatives that have happened in Dublin, and in other cities, for the past number of years in terms of cycling.  The Dublin bike scheme is probably the most successful scheme around.  There are similar schemes all over the world but the Dublin bike scheme has been recognised as one of the most successful.  Yesterday, a major expansion of the scheme was announced and the scheme has also been rolled out in some other cities.  </p></speech>

Has the Department seen a trend away from the car towards either bicycles or public transport?</p></speech>

The difficulty with trends in public transport is that figures for the past number of years were affected by the recession.  Obviously with fewer people working, and people less inclined to shop and so on, the numbers have fallen off.  The situation has stabilised and we are now beginning to see an increase in numbers.</p><p>  I do not want to sound over aspirational or naive but the car is still far too dominant as our primary mode of transport.  We still have a lot of work to do in this area.  The Department is not in any sense anti-car but it is a bit frustrating to see city streets clogged with single driver vehicles which causes delays when there are alternatives available.  It is a question of encouraging people more to avail of the alternatives.  </p></speech>

The project was going to be the centrepiece of the public transport investment programme because it would have brought huge benefits to the city.  Due to the situation that we have been in that project has not been affordable.  It was a PPP project on a huge scale.  For a period, and for reasons I do not need to go into, the PPP market was not interested in Ireland.  In any case, the Exchequer was not in a position to fund the scheme with the necessary amount.</p><p>  Earlier this year there was a court ruling on the railway order for the project.  It means that if properties or lands must be acquired compulsorily for this project then notices to treat will have to be issued by September of next year.  The court ruling reduced the period in which that must happen.  A notice to treat has the effect of committing the State to buy the lands or properties concerned.  Therefore, the Government must decide, before September of next year, whether the DART underground project will proceed.  If the Government decides to proceed, the DART underground will be the major public investment project of the next seven or eight years.</p><p>  As for investment priorities, there is a point that is generally not well understood and we did not fully understand the scale of it until we studied it.  The fact is a huge amount of capital investment is required just to maintain the capital assets that we have, and that is without bringing anything new into the system.  By that I mean properly maintaining the roads and also maintaining the rail network, which is extremely expensive.  Over the past year, with the help of a lot of transport experts, we have done work on - and I think such work has never been properly done - trying to tie down precisely how much each year, on average, the State must invest in maintenance of the network.  That is just to maintain it at a steady state so it does not deteriorate.  The figure is higher than the figure we are currently spending on our total transport investment programme which is a significant issue.  The Minister will publish the work that we have done on this issue in the form of a public information and consultation document.  When the Government gets into planning the next capital investment programme, as it will do in the near future, and one which will presumably run for the next four or five years, we will make a case that before consideration is given to new roads or public transport schemes, full provision is made for the cost of maintenance.  </p> <p>Even before consideration is given to new road or public transport schemes, it is important to make full provision for the cost of maintenance.  We have not been doing that for a few years.  We can get away with that for a few years but it means, in the case of the roads, a point will be reached at which the remedial work needed on the roads, because we did not do steady maintenance, is more expensive in the long run.  In the case of rail, we reach a point at which we must stop services on certain lines because an inability to properly maintain railway lines is giving rise to potential safety issues.  The major issue for us in respect of transport investment for the foreseeable future will be making sure we have enough to properly maintain the network that has already been invested in at a cost of billions of euros over recent years.</p></speech>

It is a PPP, so the Department provided funding to the NRA to proceed with the project.  The Department funds major construction projects and receives that through a Vote from the Oireachtas, which works its way through the NRA to the PPP project.  What action does Mr. O'Mahony take to ensure the projects funded from the Oireachtas are being carried out in a manner compliant with tax and social welfare codes?  What specific procedures are in place for these projects?  We went through this with the Department of Education and Skills on the schools building projects.  Subcontractors on the projects insist that the people working on them are in receipt of, and continue to claim, jobseeker's allowance so that they do not have to pay the official rate.  This is an ongoing situation with major Government contracts.  Someone gets the contract, the Department washes its hands of it and it goes down to a subcontractor, who insists on taking people who are on the dole.  Not only that; the workers cannot get their PRSI paid and when the work is over, the workers have made no PRSI contributions.  The tender was granted on the basis that the workers were paid the approved construction industry rates.  The employer got the job but is not paying the rates tendered for.  Will the Secretary General investigate these issues?</p></speech>

I do not have the full details here but I can certainly get more details for the committee.  The NRA has audits carried out on all of the PPP projects in which it is involved to ensure the companies are tax compliant and not engaged in the black economy.</p></speech>

However, PPP companies which win contracts employ subcontractors and in turn those subcontractors often employ other subcontractors and so on and somewhere down the line, the poor guy who is working there is made to seek jobseeker's allowance, is breaking all sorts of laws and is not enjoying basic employment rights.  In addition, someone is making money by not paying workers the going rate.</p></speech>

I have referred to it here in the context of school building projects in the past.  Contractors were complicit in this and were actually transporting people to dole offices and back to the sites.  I am not saying it is happening on this project but it has happened on other Government projects.  It happened on Department of Education and Skills projects on a wide scale for many years and is now happening on Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport projects.  I have made my point on that.</p><p>  Last year the NRA conducted a very interesting experiment when it lifted the tolls for trucks on some of our motorways to try to encourage hauliers to use those motorways and stay out of smaller towns.  I live in Laois where there are lots of bypasses but I have noted an increase in the number of articulated trucks travelling through the towns again.  How successful was that experiment?  Did the NRA have to pay a fee to the toll companies?  Can the witnesses talk me through it and outline the lessons learned.  Can the experiment be repeated?  I am aware that in countries like Germany, trucks travel for free on tolled roads at night.  The idea is to encourage hauliers to stay out of towns and to travel at night.

In 2012 we were in transition from the old contract.  As the Deputy will be aware, we now have new equipment.  We were using 1960s Sikorsky helicopters but now we have a much better fleet which can get to emergencies quicker over greater distances.</p></speech>

Under the heading "Allowances for higher, special and additional duties", how did one person get &euro;59,113 extra on top of his or her salary?

It is probably a little bit misleading to describe this payment as an allowance.  At the time, an officer of the Department was working in another agency at assistant secretary level.  The officer was an assistant principal but was working at assistant secretary level in another agency and was, therefore, being paid for duties at that level.</p></speech>

One of the major initiatives of the council is the international carding scheme for athletes under which it gives grants to individual athletes.  It is also funding high-performance units and giving grants to various sports governing bodies to improve their facilities.  All of these things will, in one way or another, support our Olympics effort.  I will ask Mr. Morgan, who heads up the sports unit, to elaborate further.</p></speech>

The Irish Sports Council would certainly like to be in a situation whereby it has certainty around its funding for the four-year cycle but we can only agree funding year by year basis.  At the same time, the council, through its interaction with the national governing bodies, would have a pretty good idea of what is needed, year on year.</p> <p>We do our utmost to try to maintain the sports budget.  Across the Department we have held this budget as best we can in comparison to other areas.  We try to build up the high-performance funding through the Irish Sports Council in the lead-up to Olympic years.  The greater demand is in the Olympic year itself.</p></speech>

We continue to try to pick away at it.  In the sports capital programme there is a sunset clause, so that we could in theory pull back any moneys that are not spent within 18 months, but there are various reasons the money does not get drawn down.  Our policy is to try to help clubs and not to penalise them.  We do not press them too hard.  Up to a couple of years ago, we were pressing very hard to have the older grants cleared because they were not going to go ahead.  People may be under the illusion that if the grants are not drawn down the money will become available to us.  That is not the case.  It is like an overdraft facility.  If everything that we owed was called it we would have to pay it, and we would not have the funding to do that.</p></speech>

I see the phrase "part funded by national lottery" all over the accounts in Departments.  Out of the &euro;21 million in funding provided by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport under item D3, how much was from the national lottery and how much was from the Department's budget?  It also states that the Irish Sports Council is part-funded by the national lottery.  It is not possible to get a clear audit trail, from what I see in the Government accounts, of where the national lottery money goes.  Nobody can say that a specific amount is a grant from the national lottery because there is a pot of funds that includes national lottery funding and it goes out in that way.  The same applies in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to the social housing programme.  Some of the projects are part-funded, and when I have asked specific questions on the exact amount of money the Department received and the projects to which the money was applied, the representatives were not able to answer that.  The usual response is that they get an allocation and the national lottery funding is in the pot and they pay from the pot.  The public assumes that if there is &euro;200 million available for good causes, there is a list of where the money goes and not just a general allocation in part-funding.</p><p>  Can something be done to bring clarity to the national lottery funding because the general clause applies across other Departments?</p></speech>

I am not even satisfied that there is absolute consistency in the way it is reported between certain appropriation accounts.  I am trying to do some work on this to try to bring greater clarity to it and link it all the way back through the accounts that national lottery funds flow through.  It could be much clearer.  To be fair, under Vote 31, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, it is probably clearer than it is in many other appropriation accounts.  They give the total spend in the categories and the amount of it that is attributed to national lottery funding.</p></speech>

Some of these may attract an additional charge and some may be improvements and cost savings.  We will also seek to have a reduction in the fee charge from either of the suppliers if we can take steps out of the process.  This is, therefore, a two-way process.

We have history in our existing national vehicle and driver file in Shannon, which would have given us a projected demand in terms of the existing licence holders and possible demographics associated with them.  The specification was to have an access point for a licence application that was accessible to 95% of the population.  However, in certain locations the demand on specific centres was greater than anticipated.  We are working with the supplier to open up additional centres in Mallow and Dublin, where there is considerable congestion.  We do not associate any additional charge with that increase in coverage, as this will be part of the contract.  The compensation from the supplier will be through the income and applications coming through the relevant centres.  That is part of the operating demand on the supplier.  There is a fixed charge for every single application.</p></speech>

If one has an online slot booked in a centre and one presents with all the correct documentation, the turnaround time is now between four and five days.  The actual turnaround time, as a commitment in the service level agreement, is eight days and we are certainly delivering on that.  So far, since 29 October, we have probably delivered approximately 300,000 plastic card licences through the centres.  On a weekly basis, we are seeing 10,500 applications coming through.  The backlog is now 3.6% and we call this work in progress.</p><p>  We have individual cases where some documentation may be missing or some additional medical report is required.  There are a small number of discrepancies in the system and we are doing our best to address them.  We will liaise directly with individuals if they have an urgent need.  For instance, if someone is going on holidays or needs something for employment, we can access the system as we have traceability throughout the system.</p><p>  It is worth pointing out that we hope to shortly introduce an online tracking system for the customer in the front end.  This will be something of an enhancement which we had not envisaged at the time of the contract.  There are improvements taking place and we are planning ahead to improve the system.  I accept that we are not yet where we want to be.  We would like the system to become a leading light in terms of licence production compared to our European counterparts.</p></speech>

It is similar to the question asked by Deputy Sean Fleming.  On the roads contract for the R158, which cost &euro;43 million and was under construction from 2004 until 2008, it has been alleged that a considerable amount of waste from the project - 56,000 tonnes - was dumped illegally on private lands.  The matter either has been before the courts or is at some stage in the legal process.  Who assumes responsibility for this matter?  In other words, who follows the contract in terms of remediating the land or fixing the problem?  Is it the Department, the National Roads Authority or the contract?  Who polices the issue?  Mr. O'Mahony informed Deputy Fleming that the NRA employs a separate company to deal with issues relating to social welfare and so forth.  I am trying to establish who is responsible when an issue arises regarding how a subcontractor may have behaved in this type of contract.</p> <p>Who looks after this type of contract where there is an issue about how the subcontractor may have behaved?</p></speech>

In 2012 it received &euro;544 million.  How does the Department account for that, does it get a report on the expenditure?  Is there a specific report relative to taxpayers' money?  How is that company performing?  Is the Department happy with its governance, procurement and so on?  Will it require more money?</p></speech>

I am responsible for the money it gets from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and for its overall corporate governance.  It is a commercial semi-State organisation which means that it must operate to a commercial mandate.  Board members have fiduciary responsibility as directors and are responsible to the Minister for their performance and for adherence to the code of practice.</p><p>  As discussed in some detail when I came before the committee last year, in 2012 CIE ran into serious difficulty.  I said in my opening statement we had to re-allocate money within our Vote to ensure that it could continue.  It has resolved that difficulty through a range of cost-saving measures, changes in processes and procedures.  The source of the problem in 2012 was that it had reached the limit of its overdraft and run out of money.  It has now negotiated new funding provisions and covenants with its bankers which have dealt with that problem but it needs to maintain the cost-efficiency measures it has put in place.  Those have involved difficult industrial relations, IR, negotiations.  There were short strikes in both bus companies last year.  The IR is at quite a delicate point in Irish Rail.  A Labour Court finding was rejected by some of the staff and the company is now in discussion with the unions concerned with a view to tweaking it enough to get it over the line.  It is reasonably optimistic of being able to do that.</p><p>  Until it ran into this difficulty in 2012 we dealt with it on the same basis that we deal with other commercial semi-State organisations in that the directors have prime responsibility but there is a regular flow of information about accounts and corporate governance and there are regular meetings between the Minister and the Department and the company.</p></speech>

The information flows within the company, to the board and the Department were inadequate.  It was essentially a cash management problem.

There are several Departments involved, for example, the Departments of Education and Skills and Social Protection.  What mechanism or reporting procedure is in place within CIE, directly to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport that enables Mr. O'Mahony to say confidently, if he can, that in the taxpayers&rsquo; interest he is absolutely happy with how that money is spent?</p></speech>

Each of the contracts it has, such as the public service obligation contracts, which we fund through the National Transport Authority, and school transport, which the committee has discussed in detail with my colleague, is governed by performance measures.</p> <p>These are scrutinised in detail.  It was an issue about how the money was being spent.  The issue was that the solvency of the company was suddenly threatened because of losses incurred and not having the cash management facilities and the overdraft facilities in place.  To deal with that situation, the Department and NewERA, with the agreement of the Government, set up a group which met initially on a monthly basis.  It meets less frequently now because it does not need to meet monthly.  New people were appointed in the CIE group to deal with the financial function which was greatly upgraded on foot of the Deloitte recommendations.  Every month the Department, with representatives of NewERA, met to go through the latest financial figures from CIE, to see how CIE was getting on in the negotiations with its lenders, to look at the likely cash position, and to look at what assistance it would require.  Over a period of time that resolved the problem and put CIE in a position to satisfy the bankers, which it previously could not do, that it could be a safe bet to have an increase in its overdraft facility because that overdraft facility had been limited at &euro;107 million-----</p></speech>

To explain exactly how this is done, the &euro;36 million was paid as part of the public service obligation, the public subvention which is paid through the NTA.  Apart from capital payments, which I can talk about separately if required, the current payments to CIE by my Department are routed entirely through the National Transport Authority on foot of the public service contracts drawn up in 2009.  Those contracts are very detailed.  They have a host of performance indicators which the company must meet and if it does not meet them, it will be penalised.  The NTA supervises those contracts and oversees the performance of CIE in giving value for money to the taxpayer on foot of those contracts.</p></speech>

Over the past 12 months, mobile checkpoints and detections for breath tests have shown a significant reduction in the level of detections with the new levels in operation.

The figures over the past 12 months have demonstrated a 3% reduction in the number of detections, even though the number of mobile checkpoints has increased.</p></speech>

The weakness in the system for years has been that some of the measures that were taken were introduced by legislators who were not tuned in to what really needs to happen.  The only way of finding out what is required is by doing the type of indepth analysis to which I referred.  I am surprised it has not been done given the time that has passed since the enactment of the legislation.  The issue of drug driving has been spoken about endlessly.</p></speech>

My next question is a constituency issue to do with regional airports.  The Department has been very helpful in recent years in regard to the provision of funding for one part of the runway at Waterford Airport.  That project has to do with health and safety issues.  I understand planning permission is being sought and the Department has given assistance in that regard.  There are difficulties with the airline industry across the Continent.  The people managing the airport in Waterford are working in a very competitive environment and are trying very hard to find a commercial customer to deliver a London-Waterford route.  We hope they will have some success in that regard in the near future.</p><p>  When it comes to capital budgets within the Department as they pertain to regional airports, are we looking at the same allocation for next year or is an increase likely?  In the case of Waterford, there may need to be another cash influx to deal with the other end of the runway and related matters.</p></speech>

The whole issue of regional airports post-2014 is something to which the Minister is now turning his attention.  All Departments have completed their comprehensive review of expenditure, that information has been fed to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and there will now be political discussion about it.  One of the issues to be addressed within that discussion is the future of our regional airport programme, whether it is possible to provide any more funding or if it will have to be reduced.  Those decisions will be taken in the context of whatever the Government decides it is able to do.</p></speech>

The region that is home to the Chairman and me is in a protracted recession.  Members have been talking about Dublin, which is fair enough; we all have our own constituency interests.  It is important to note, however, that the region I am from has an entirely different economic environment from that of Dublin.  This needs to be taken into consideration by the Department not just on the basis of numbers but also in the context of the economic reality facing people in different parts of the country.  The key piece of infrastructure we need to see revitalised is the airport.  When the Department puts its budgets together in the coming months and decisions are made as to where capital spending should go, that must be taken into consideration.</p></speech>

I accept that this is a policy issue, but the senior Department officials who deal with it cannot remove themselves from the reality of what is occurring around the country.  I will continue to make the case for Waterford Airport, as I have done in this forum countless times.  The airport must be funded and it cannot be allowed to shut.  The officials dealing with this, including Mr. O'Mahony, must take that into consideration when it comes to capital spending allocations into the future.</p><p>  My final question relates to the report on the Central Remedial Clinic that has just been published.

My second question is more general in nature and I have no doubt Ms Murdock has already referred to the matter to which it relates.  From what she said, I take it that the authority has a good working relationship with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that it can access data and information from the PULSE system, as necessary.</p></speech>

As I explained to Deputy Deasy, we now have full access to the PULSE system and we can fully interrogate the information we receive,  create our own analysis of it and engage in investigations as a result.  In general terms, I regularly meet representatives from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at headquarters in the Phoenix Park.  Once a month I go through with them issues, such as enforcement trends, collaboration and joint efforts in terms of enforcement, which affect road safety.  I refer here not just to enforcement in respect of private car users but also to commercial vehicle road worthiness enforcement.  We have increased the number of checkpoints and detections by 50% year on year in co-operation with the Garda.  We do that as a blitz operation with a number of State bodies such as the Department of Social Protection, Revenue and the Garda.  It is very visible and we select risk areas and risk times in order to try to maximise the potential.  In general I have a very good working relationship with the Garda and I hope to build on it with the interim Commissioner, whom I have met.</p></speech>

GoSafe has been very effective in carrying out its objective, which is to reduce speed and the number of collisions and raise awareness of speeding.  It is a double-edged sword.  When there is an awareness that a particular location is a speed risk zone, people adjust their behaviour.  This is exactly what the zones are in place to encourage, namely, to ensure people drive safely.  That is very effective.</p></speech>

We are talking here about a scenario where people from within GoSafe raised very serious concerns and queries as to the standard of the equipment and its "use-worthiness".  It seems people were brought before the courts for driving with excessive speed in circumstances where they had not, in fact, been doing so.  It might be that this was a limited phenomenon and the system is under review.  However, in view of the fact that the RSA relies on the relevant data for its work, I would have thought it would be paying quite close attention to the review.</p> <p>I would have expected there to be regular contact between the Garda and the Road Safety Authority, RSA, as to the progress of that review.

Perhaps I should state at the start that I am not a Garda spokesman, although I may sound and look like it occasionally.  Any of the views that I have are purely my own, but they are informed by 38 years in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p>I was the head of the Garda national traffic policy bureau in 1997, which was the first time the bureau was put in place to deal with road fatalities.  Having left the Garda in 2008, I did a review of the fixed charge penalty system for the Office of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  That formed the basis of my interaction with the committee.</p><p> All of the controversy with which we have become familiar in the past 12 months was totally avoidable because all of the issues were raised in the GSOC report, which made 18 recommendations and eight or nine significant findings.  It was all flagged in the report but the report never saw the light of day.  It is not because I wrote it that it is a particularly good report, but it did highlight the issues that are in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s four reports.  We had a long sequence going back to 2008, when the report was carried out, and it was presented in 2009.  What happened in the past year was totally avoidable because we had seen all of the symptoms.  We knew that the system was creaking and leaking.</p><p> I will spend a few minutes on the fixed charge processing system.  It is essentially a system that takes between 400,000 and 500,000 inputs every year from fixed-penalty notices.  When I was a young garda they were called on-the-spot fines.  Not all of the fixed charge penalty notices are of supreme relevance to road safety or road deaths.  They are for a whole series of minor road traffic offences that in themselves would not merit going to court in the first instance but within that there is a relatively small cohort of speeding offences that are now detected by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and by the GoSafe consortium by means of non-intercept, which means there is no connection between the detecting person and the individual that is detected.</p><p> I said the system was leaking badly, but the most classic mistake is that the worst offenders escape.  That has been the case since 2007 and I am sure it was the case before that.  They escape by ignoring the system.  They simply do not interact.  The other weakness in the system is that registered companies are not persons so under the system they cannot be prosecuted or processed as an offender under the fixed charge penalty system unless a series of other processes take place.</p><p> I also wish to say, perhaps a little controversially, that every time a detection is made for speeding using the automatic detection systems of the Garda or GoSafe, it records particular kinds of information &ndash; the number of the vehicle being used, the speed, obviously, and also a photograph of the individual involved.  I heard this morning some comments on how difficult it is to get third parties to admit who was driving the vehicle and I heard suggestions about amendments to the 2004 Act and another point relating to the 2010 Act.  Frankly, the obligation has always existed for registered owners to say who was driving.  If I as a garda in the old days had alleged that someone was using a vehicle then there would have been a legal obligation to tell me who was using it.</p><p> The point is that we are using a legal system rather than an administrative system to handle the fixed charge penalty process.  One of the recommendations I made in my GSOC report is that we should seriously consider using an administrative system that does not have any of the inhibiting factors of the criminal law system and allows for a much earlier reaction.  The Central Bank has the power to vote penalties under the administrative sanction process to financial institutions that involve massive fines and other sanctions.  That is at the top end of the business cycle.  It is entirely possible that we could use the fixed charge penalty system as an administrative process, as is done in other countries, and then for the minority of offences that are not resolved in that manner we would use the criminal process.</p><p> When I spoke to the president of the District Court and the chief executive of the courts body in 2008, they told me that the system was creaking and that they did not have the courts or the capacity to handle it.  In those circumstances, is it any wonder that the worst offenders under the system escape?  The system is only designed to catch and deal with the compliant.  For speeding, that is about 73%, and for all offences it is about 70%.  That is an inherently unfair system because the worst are escaping the sanctions of the system.  It is primarily a systems failure.  There are no exotic points of law involved.  Penalty points were introduced in 2002 and if one was doing a review of a system one would ask why it was being done in this way because it did not have the capacity to deal with the throughput.</p><p> I mentioned the GSOC report which I authored.  I had an opportunity to look at the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s latest report.  I am fully in agreement with the remarks he made on the &euro;11 million subvention by the Exchequer to the GoSafe camera consortium because the return from its detections did not meet the threshold.  In essence, the taxpayer had to put &euro;11 million into the system to keep it afloat.  The contract runs until 2015.  I have no issue with the commercial side of the matter.  It simply seems that we are getting the wrong end of it.</p><p> According to the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s figures, the GoSafe figures account for 22% of speeding detections, while the Garda&rsquo;s own cameras account for 24%.  Numerically, I believe there are something in the range of 40 GoSafe camera vans, and the number of Garda robots, which is an unusual title &ndash; we used to call them GATSO &ndash; was 24%.  Garda&iacute; also detect speeding by hand-held laser or radar.  Effectively, eight or ten Garda speed detection vans detect more than 40 GoSafe cameras.  That is the logic.  There are approximately four times as many GoSafe vans as there are Garda vans, and individual garda&iacute; also detect a range of offences.</p><p> We are essentially operating what I call the Victoria model, which is something I saw in Australia.  It is a road safety system predicated on a number of key points.  A robust enforcement policy by the police is required, as is a strong legal system to underpin it; a high degree of education and awareness was part of the process; there was a very strong IT system, so that one had a strong platform; and also it had the key element of being an administrative system rather than a criminal legal system.  That has produced enormous success.  Clearly, there have been aberrations in the system, but the saving of lives and the reduction in serious injuries has been due to the effectiveness of the system.  Nothing is perfect.  Last year 190 people were killed, which is 190 too many, but the highest number of fatalities ever in this country was in 1972, when more than 600 people were killed on the roads in this country.  We have come a long way in the meantime, rightly so.</p><p> I am in total agreement with the sentiment expressed in the Garda Inspectorate report on the faults and failings in the cancellation policy that was being employed.  It is as clear as crystal that there were many inconsistencies and there was no firm policy dictating how the system operated.  However, I am not in agreement with the Garda Inspectorate&rsquo;s main recommendations for the future.  I am quite surprised that its report, which is a far-reaching one, was accepted without debate.  It was submitted into the public domain and accepted.  It dealt with two separate issues, and perhaps therein lies the problem.  I do not agree with the statement in Chapter 4 of the report that road traffic enforcement is not a priority for the Garda.  That is totally wrong.  Neither do I agree with the business case with regard to the &euro;11 million it currently costs the taxpayer to keep the GoSafe cameras going, including the proposal that the speed detection system be transformed into a civilianised process and the Garda leave the robot vans at home.  The business case does not make sense, in addition to other issues.</p> <p>It makes neither economic nor operational sense and certainly does not help the targets under discussion.</p><p> While I apologise for being so lengthy, I wish to cite the comments this morning of the chief executive of the Road Safety Authority, RSA - I have a similar diagram at the end of my report - when she stated that notwithstanding the personal loss and impact on families and society in general, reducing the number of serious collisions on the roads also has a significant financial benefit.  She stated that a recent evaluation of the Road Safety Strategy 2007-2012, commissioned by the RSA, states the impact and effectiveness of the strategy equates to the saving over that period of 686 fatal collisions.  The numbers, in terms of people, probably would be approximately 700 because some collisions, unfortunately, have multiple victims.  Her point is that over that period, there has been this enormous saving.  In other words, had we done nothing and had we not introduced the Victoria model, this is the threshold at which we now would be.  She also estimates, according to what I call the Goodbody formula and which has been around for a while, that the saving to the Exchequer has been approximately &euro;1.85 billion.  While I imagine this is a new figure for some people, the audited figure for the cost of a single fatal accident is extraordinarily high.  She goes on to state that in the period 2003 to 2013, road fatalities reduced from 335 to 190.  In my view, no other country that started from a comparable base has reached that target.  Even Victoria, on which I was modelling our approach way back in the late 1990s, has not achieved that target.  She states this represents a decline of 43% and that over the same ten-year period, injuries reduced from 8,262 to 6,962, which represents a 16% decline.  I acknowledge that numbers do not speak to the tragedy and absolute horror of somebody losing someone in a road collision or of somebody being injured in a life-inhibiting way for the rest of his or her life, but these are figures that equate with success, not failure.  The whole point at which I became involved in this thing is when I heard all of the controversy erupting around this time last year.  I thought this would undermine confidence in the system and within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and simply was bad for the process in which we are involved.  I wanted the opportunity to make these points in a public forum and hopefully they are of some use to the committee.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. O'Brien for his attendance.  I heard the first part of his address on the monitor in my room but missed the piece while I was coming from there to here.  I appreciate his attendance.  I also appreciate in particular the table he provided on road deaths because it demonstrates the huge progress that has been made.  I had quite forgotten that in 1972, when I still was a teenager, so many people were killed on the roads.  At that stage, I was a regular cyclist so perhaps I was lucky to get through.</p><p>  I wish to ask Mr. O'Brien a question about the speed camera issue because it has been suggested that he would be the best person to ask.  Can he tell the committee something about his views on the GoSafe consortium and how it is operating?  For example, I do not like the fact that it now is controlled by an entity based on the Isle of Man.  If I understood him correctly, Mr. O'Brien appeared to indicate it was not that appropriate that some of this work should be hived off to a non-Government body.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-19a.496" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John O'Brien" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014061900026#EE00400"><p>I am very reluctant to comment on the commercial interactions because I am now involved in the commercial field and appreciate that commerce is something that drives the economy.  However, in simple, objective terms, if one wants to compare the Garda cameras and the GoSafe cameras like two horses in a race, in my opening remarks I stated there are something like 40 GoSafe camera detection vans and something like eight to ten Garda vans - I am unsure of the exact number.  The return from the Garda vans, with one fourth the number of vans, is greater by a few percentage points than it is from GoSafe.  In addition, the GoSafe camera operation was predicated on an assumption that did not prove to be correct, which was there would be an endless revenue stream from the detection of speeding offences.  People forgot something very simple, which is that one product of good road safety policy is that detections decrease as road safety improves.  The mandatory alcohol testing checkpoints are proof positive of that.  When I was a young garda 40 years ago, were I to operate a checkpoint in this city on a Saturday night, probably every second car would have somebody with an alcohol problem.  This no longer is the case and the same thing holds true in respect of speeding.  We have reached a high degree of compliance because people understand something very simple, which is there is the strong probability of sanction if one is exceeding the speed limit.  The same applies, to a lesser degree possibly, on the drunken driving side and the sanctions work from that point of view.</p><p>  The other point I wish to make to the Deputy on the question of GoSafe versus Garda vans is that a great deal of collateral information is collected by the Garda speed vans that is of use right across the entire Garda spectrum.  The committee may be aware of something called automatic number plate recognition, ANPR, which is now a well-known crime fighting tool in which the numbers of recognised criminals involved in organised crime or drug crime are fed into a centralised computer system.  These numbers are then recognised by the camera and, in turn, that collateral information becomes of use to the greater Garda force, as well as to citizens.  Consequently, there much collateral benefit to the Garda van in addition to speed detection alone.  On business grounds, it does not make sense and on operational grounds, the Garda and the community are losing a significant amount of information that is useful to the community and in the fight against crime.</p></speech>

Can Mr. O'Brien comment on the other matter that emerged in news reports about the inaccuracy of some of the GoSafe cameras whereby if they were not set up correctly, they were not actually monitoring the speeds correctly?  Was this also a problem for the Garda?</p><p>  Moreover, in order that I am not obliged to come in again, I am interested that Mr. O'Brien referred to Victoria because I actually have driven in that state and whatever effect the police have in Victoria, if the speed limit is 100 km/h, people do not cross that speed limit.  Even if they are out in a very rural place, they chug along at 100 km/h, even if there is not a car or anything else in sight.  I recall visiting a very remote town in which I had relatives and saying I supposed there would not be that many checks around there.  I was told not to assume that at all.</p></speech>

There are international standards, which in the United Kingdom are referred to as Association of Chief Police Officers, ACPO, standards.  These are the standards that have been applied for as long as I have been involved.  I was involved at the start of the use of the original Garda detention vans, which were called GATSO vans after the Dutch engineer who invented them.  There was a wonderful garda named Garda Ben Mackey, who was a total genius in respect of setting up this thing.  He is one of the unsung heroes of this particular exchange but the standards are set empirically and they must be tested each year.  If I remember correctly, there is a presumption under the Road Traffic Acts that the instrument is accurate until the contrary is proved.  It is quite the reverse of what might apply in another case but the standards are quite exacting, are set and must be validated yearly.</p><p>  Were I looking at this while wearing a different hat, I would be looking at the GoSafe cameras and would be asking what is the validation process, what steps does GoSafe set up and what audit process has it in place to ensure those standards are met.  However, these would be pretty ordinary auditing systems because, ultimately, it is a serious matter for an individual to get penalty points or whatever.  Consequently, there should be an internal auditing process that guarantees the integrity of that process.  I am not aware of what it is at present, but certainly it would be a normal common or garden matter to prove one's equipment is right and to be in a position to produce that information if it is requested.</p></speech>

If you look at the monitor, figure 7.3 is basically a split by each mode of detection.  I suppose the two that are easiest to compare are the Garda cameras and the GoSafe cameras.  Essentially, we were using the data from 2011 and 2012 broken into six-month periods.  GoSafe cameras were deployed in November of 2010.  There were about 70,000 detections by GoSafe cameras in the period from January to June of 2011, and then it dropped fairly rapidly.  By the last half of 2012, it was down at something like 50,000 - even fewer, actually.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-19a.503" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="13:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014061900027#FF00300"><p>About 35,000.  If one compares that to the Garda camera figures, one can see that there was an initial detection level of about 45,000 and then it went up and has been at a level of 52,000 or 53,000 ever since then.</p><p>  Elsewhere - I think this was mentioned this morning by the head of the RSA - with regard to speed testing, which is also done by the GoSafe cameras in the areas where they operate, the indications are that there has been a significant improvement in speed detections.  If one goes to table 8.3 on page 113, one can see what happened between January 2011 and January 2013, because we analysed the figures by the speed limit.  If one looks at the 100 km/h section, in January 2011, when speed compliance was tested, it was found that 96% of drivers were compliant with the speed limit, but by the end of January 2013, that level of compliance had gone up to 99%.  It is something of an improvement and is to be welcomed.  Compliance with the 50 km/h speed limit, however, went from 62% to 93%.  Part of what may be going on there is that, because the speed cameras are very identifiable in specific places, people who are driving in those areas recognise that there is a stronger likelihood of being detected and, therefore, they are able to change their behaviour in the areas where the visible GoSafe cameras are operating.</p><p>  Figure 8.2 shows an analysis of the number of collisions resulting in a fatality in areas where GoSafe cameras are operating and areas where they are not operating.  There are many areas where GoSafe cameras are not operating and where a level of fatalities is occurring.  Therefore, we raised a question about how An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na decides the best place to deploy the GoSafe cameras, and there has been some revision of that.</p><p>  The final point I would make is that it is not simply a question of the operational effectiveness of GoSafe, and I do not want to comment on that.  They are not free to operate in places of their choosing.  They operate where it is agreed with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that they can operate.  There is the element, which I think is clear in the statistics, that where it has been identified that they are operating there seems to be a higher level of compliance and, therefore, a lower rate of detection.</p><p>  On just one final point with regard to the cost of the GoSafe system, the actual expenditure is working out at about &euro;15 million a year.  Where the figure of &euro;11 million that Mr. O'Mahony has quoted comes from is that the payments related to detections  amount to about &euro;4 million a year, and that is netted off.  Strictly speaking, the cost of operating the number of cameras is the gross figure.  It is about &euro;15 million to &euro;16 million a year.  I just wanted to make sure that the record was correct about that.</p></speech>

The point Mr. McCarthy makes is that the GoSafe cameras are in what in some countries are called KSI zones, where KSI stands for killed or seriously injured, and they are anchored there to those zones, and to move a GoSafe camera from location A to location B is a major exercise - there is a whole one-two-three checklist for things that have to be done.  The problem, which is not of their making, is that there is a lack of flexibility in moving them.</p><p>  The committee will be familiar with the significant problem of boy racers in some parts of the country, which I shall not name on this occasion, and this means multiple deaths involving young men.  Essentially, if I was making the Garda operational decision, I would say, for the next two months or two weekends, whatever, we need to put extra resources in a particular area.  It would be very difficult to put in GoSafe cameras, as I understand it, from the regime of control that they are operated under.  They do not have that flexibility, and flexibility is essential in any operational scenario.  One can make a plan, and they say the first casualty of any war is the plan.  The same applies to an operation: one needs flexibility.  An inflexible system where the majority of these detection vans are in inflexible locations - particularly, as I understand it, in urban areas - simply is not an adequate operational response to the problem.</p></speech>

There may also be an intention of making their operation error-proof by being extraordinarily parsimonious in terms of how they operate, which results in inflexibility, but it is not a good operational tool.</p><p>  The other side of the coin, of course, is the one that we all object to, which is what we call shooting fish in a barrel.  In many areas of the country, particularly rural areas, there are speed limits that really leave a lot to be desired in terms of their efficiency, and if one wanted to take the hair-dryer approach in a particular location, one could get a lot of detections that have no real benefit in terms of the road safety component but that will keep the numbers ticking over.  One has to have a balance between the rigidity that is there at the moment and the inappropriate application of speed detection measures in areas where clearly road safety is not in question.</p></speech>

There are 40 vans in the GoSafe operation, that is 40 locations around the country where they are based.  I suppose the difference with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is that they are based everywhere and there are traffic units everywhere in the country.  Therefore, there is more flexibility about deploying that kind of resource than trying to use a commercial operation which will obviously have to be remunerated and so on.  How to get that kind of flexibility with a limited resource is going to be a challenge.</p></speech>

The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have identified some of the key offenders and are taking special action against them.  Although this is the wrong message to put on the airwaves, all one has to do is ignore the system.  If one goes through each of them, there are eight or ten process steps, some of them time-linked.  Eventually it will go to the summons issuing stage, which is the ultimate adjudication.  A very small percentage of the summonses issued are served and an even smaller number of the summonses that go to court result in a conviction.</p><p>  In the area I examined, only 14% of the cases that went to court resulted in a conviction.  Working on the balance of probabilities, one had an 86% chance of escaping by simply ignoring the system.  That is also compounded by the fact that vehicles registered to companies escaped totally.  I have been making the point, and waiting for somebody to argue with me on it, that every time there is a detection we capture a photograph.  Why do we not use that information?</p></speech>

What is preventing those who operate the system from identifying the individual driver within the company?</p></speech>

The Data Protection Commissioner has made a very clear ruling that one can retain data for as long as it is essential for the purpose for which one takes it.  Instead of using the photograph we get into a convoluted process which involves, in the first instance, sending out a notice; getting no reply; trying to follow up with the registered owner of the vehicle; and perhaps getting no response from that person.  If there were only one offence, it would be very easy to follow it up, but there are approximately 400,000 to 500,000 processes going into the system.  In the year I examined, 2007, the fixed charge processing office in Thurles received approximately 92,000 pieces of correspondence relating to the process.  Even then, it was obvious that the fixed charge processing office was under immense pressure.  It has neither the equipment nor the people to deal with the enormous correspondence.  In the new scheme of things it has become the central cancellation authority for the country.</p></speech>

Therefore companies can easily identify the driver.  If somebody sends in a note denying that he or she was driving on the day of the offence, it should be possible to stop that by using the photograph.</p></speech>

We should use an administrative system and the first notice we send should say we have the relevant information, including a photograph of the driver.  That would impel most of us - it would certainly impel me - to deal with the problem.  That would identify the recidivists or multiple offenders.  One should put a special operation in place over time to indicate the habitual offenders, who endanger themselves and the community, and deal with them by exceptions.  There would, therefore, be a double product.  However, it belongs in an administrative rather than a criminal law system.  With 400,000 to 500,000 processes per year, the president of the District Court in 2007 said there were not enough judges or courts to handle it.  The chief executive of the Courts Service said the mechanism did not exist to do so.  One of the questions this morning was about the endorsement of driving licences with penalty points in court.  The Courts Service was not part of the justice review group of 2005 that led to the privatisation bid that led to the role of GoSafe.  It was not in on the system, so it looks like it did not have a formal input into how it developed.</p></speech>

Yet licenses are not being presented in court, which we were told this morning, is an offence.  Where is the failure happening?  Surely the judge should ask for the licence and add the penalty points to it.  That does not happen.  That is a simple piece of administration, is it not?</p></speech>

A judge on a particular day in a busy District Court may deal with a range of offences.  If the licence is to be endorsed, it would have to happen in the District Court clerk's office, not in the judge's office, and that is a voluntary engagement.  The Judge is not the enforcer of it.  The judge can ask the person to give his or her licence to the court clerk.  If that does not happen, one must embark on a further prosecution process, which is very inefficient.</p> <p>My solution would be to stop the vast majority of them ever getting to that stage by having quite a different administrative process that allows one to interact in a different way, using, as I said, the photographic identification as a second stage process in identifying the person.</p></speech>

In that case, I think they even disguised the actual number plates of the cars because they are primarily used for traffic control purposes, traffic movements and so on.

I know that, historically, when I was involved in this area in 1997 and 1998, when the Dublin traffic department had made a detection and there was a dispute as to the accuracy of the detection, it then communicated directly with the person stating that &quot;we have got a photograph of [... ] and you may want to come and see it, maybe it was not you&quot;.  This was done on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis.  I am not aware there is any legal issue.  Clearly, there is a need to build in the proper safeguards that it was appropriate only for the purpose for which it was retained and all of the issues about destruction afterwards and so on.  I do not believe there are any legal issues involved.  If we take something that is far more intrusive, such as bodily samples or biological samples, there is a legal profile that allows one to do that kind of thing but it is proportionality.  In this case, the photograph is a totally non-invasive process and it does the classic thing.  It does what the system is trying to do for the next 20 steps - it identifies the driver.  Why on earth would we not want to use it?  Of course, we need to legal proof it to make sure it works but why on earth would we not want to use it?</p></speech>

I advise members to switch off their mobile phones.<br/>We will now consider the provisions of the Radiological Protection (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014 with representatives from the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII.  I welcome the following witnesses to the meeting: Professor William Reville, chairman and Mr. James Fitzmaurice, board member of the RPII.  I thank them for their attendance here this afternoon. <br/>I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if a witness is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in regard to a particular matter and continues to do so, the witness is entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of his evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  The opening statement and any other documentation the witnesses provide to the committee may be published on the committee's website after the meeting concludes. <br/>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/>As witnesses are aware the D&aacute;il Select Sub-committee on the Environment, Community and Local Government will take Committee Stage of this Bill next Tuesday.  The Bill provides for the dissolution of the RPII and the transfer of its functions, staff and assets to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  It also provides for the incorporation of the amendment to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material agreed in 2005.  Today's meeting is a good opportunity for Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad to engage with the institute and to hear its expert opinion of the provisions of the Bill prior to its Committee Stage.  I now call on the RPII to make its opening statement. </p></speech>

I am accompanied by my fellow board member, Mr. James Fitzmaurice.  I thank the committee for inviting us here to talk about the Radiological Protection (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014, which provides for the merger of the RPII and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  I find it heartening to participate in an exercise that involves the rational examination of legislation.  If the arguments we present are deemed to be of merit, I hope the Oireachtas will agree to make some amendments to the Bill.</p><p> The board of the RPII is deeply puzzled about why the Government is insisting on a merger.  When this idea was first mooted several years ago, the possible advantages of it were considered in detail.  The board of the RPII could identify few, if any, advantages of such a merger.  It was able to identify many disadvantages, however.  For that reason, it recommended to the Minister in 2011 that a merger of this nature should not happen.  The matter was further considered in 2012 when a critical review of the potential of the amalgamation of the two bodies was produced by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The review identified few, if any, advantages but many disadvantages and recommended that the merger should not take place.  We all thought that was the end of the matter until the Department of Public Expenditure announced out of the blue that the merger should happen quickly.  This was not expected by us.  We can identify no real advantages of this proposal.  Instead, we suggest that many disadvantages, dangers and hazards are associated with this merger.  Perhaps we can elaborate on them during the question and answer session.</p><p> While this is commonly referred to as a merger, that is not an accurate description of what is happening.  In fact, the RPII is being taken over by the EPA.  The RPII is to be dissolved and all of its functions are to be incorporated into the EPA.  We understand that many people would naturally think that a marriage between two organisations that are involved in dealing with the environment could be a good thing.  That is a misunderstanding of what is happening here.  While both organisations deal with environmental matters, the actual roles and functions of the RPII and the EPA are quite different.  By and large, the RPII is involved in protecting people against radiation hazards in their environment, whereas the EPA is involved in protecting the environment from being damaged by human activities.  As these two types of work are different, they require different approaches.  They are viewed in a different light by the stakeholders involved with the RPII and the EPA, respectively.  The ideal situation is actually the situation we have now, in which these two environmental functions are separated into two distinct national bodies.  This situation obtains in many, if not most, European countries.  It is a disadvantage, rather than an advantage, to merge the two organisations.  The situation as we have it works well.  The RPII works well and I assume the EPA works well.  I have heard no criticism of the EPA.  The merger of the two organisations offends the basic principle of common sense that "if it ain't broke don't fix it".  There is nothing broken about the situation as it is.  It is actually the optimum situation.</p><p> Having said all of that, of course the board of the RPII recognises the prerogative of the Government to organise these matters as it deems fit.  We have many misgivings about the merger - we do not think it is a good idea for radiological protection - but if it is to happen, the only consideration of the RPII board will be to ensure it is arranged in a way that will allow radiological protection to continue to be administered at the high level of quality that obtains at present.  I have to admit the Department was not deaf to the representations we made as the Bill was being drafted.  Some of the provisions in the Bill were included on foot of the board's encouragement or prompting.  Unfortunately, we failed to persuade the Department that some matters we consider very important - the name of the new organisation and the basis on which the arm of the new organisation that will deal with radiation will be established - should be incorporated into the Bill.</p><p> The proposed name for the merged organisation is the "Environmental Protection Agency".  We think the decision not to include a reference to "radiation" in the name is a bad thing.  At the moment, an independent institute - the RPII - deals on a national basis with the organisation of radiological protection.  It is known and respected internationally.  Of course the people of Ireland and our stakeholders know all about it.  That is to disappear.  It is proposed that there will be no reference at all to "radiation" in the name of the new organisation.  If this proposal is implemented, radiation advice and regulations, etc., will issue from the EPA.  I appreciate that it is proposed to set up a new office - the office of radiological protection - within the EPA.  When Michael Murphy or someone else is reading out the news about a matter of national importance - for example, the public might badly need to hear some advice about a radiation cloud that is overhead - the announcement will begin with a phrase like "the EPA this morning declared".</p><p> The loss of the existing branding in the name of the merged institution will be bad for the profile of radiological protection, which is currently very healthy.  It was never stronger than it is now, having been built up patiently by the RPII over 25 years.  It is well known internationally.  I do not doubt that if this branding is wiped out, it will have a bad effect on the profile of radiological protection in this country.  If this area is covered one day by a national institute with its own name - the RPII - but that institute ceases to exist the next day, it is common sense to suggest that this will be perceived as a diminution in the importance accorded to radiological protection.  If this merger is to proceed, we would like the name of the proposed new institute to be amended to include a reference to "radiation".  This could be done very simply.  The name "Environmental Protection Agency" could be changed to "Environmental and Radiological Protection Agency" or some equivalent name.</p><p> The Bill proposes that radiological protection in the new body will be administered by a new office to be created within the EPA and to be called the office of radiological protection.  If this merger happens, it will be a huge change for the RPII.  It will be part of a body that has a completely different culture and an executive board.  Our board is non-executive.  It will be a shock to the RPII to be part of the new body.  It will take a number of years for it to settle down.</p> <p>The culture of the EPA is that its individual offices are quite flexible.  Under the eye of the CEO of the EPA, functions assigned to different offices can change.  I have heard noises already that what will be established as the office of radiological protection could change after a year or so.  It will take several years for the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland to bed down properly and it is important that there would be no chopping and changing during that period.  To ensure that is the case, we would like the office of radiological protection to be established in legislation.  That does not mean it could never be changed but it would not be changed quickly.  A good period should be allowed to elapse before any chopping and changing would occur within the EPA.</p><p> Those are two amendments the board would like to see if the merger is going ahead, in order to give a good chance that radiological protection will proceed into the future with the same level of efficiency and expertise that it has at present.</p></speech>

The budget is approximately &euro;4 million in total.</p></speech>

Could he expand a little on what he perceives as the hazards of the merger?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-19a.562" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor William Reville" time="13:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014061900005#D00600"><p>At the moment the Radiological Protection Institute has direct access to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and advises the Government directly on all matters to do with radiation.  From time to time, some of those issues are controversial matters that have a high emotional impact with the public.  I refer, for example, to the accident at Chernobyl and the fallout that arrived in this country a week later.  More recently there was the accident at Fukushima and the fallout that came here.  On an ongoing basis we have the UK nuclear industry and possible accidents and events happening there.  The public is very interested and concerned about those matters.</p><p>  At the moment the RPII reports directly to the Government on such matters and gives independent scientific advice.  That is recognised and we have a high level of trust with the public which was built up slowly and patiently over the years.  It was not always there.  If the new merged situation obtains, the office of radiological protection, ORP, will not have direct access to the Government.  It will be an office within the EPA.  The EPA is a much bigger organisation than the RPII with many other considerations and irons in the fire.  I do not mean to suggest anything ominous but whatever advice comes from the ORP in the new EPA will be filtered before it goes to Government.  There could well be considerations and modifications.  All sorts of different pressures could come to bear in the bigger organisation that do not obtain at the moment within the single, independent Radiological Protection Institute.  It would not necessarily be the case that the Government would get the same quality and independence of advice in the new merged situation.</p></speech>

Is Mr. Reville suggesting that someone is going to filter the information and not give accurate information to the Minister?  That is wildly speculative.</p></speech>

It is nature.  I am speculating.  What I am saying is that at the moment the institute has direct access to the Government but in the new situation that will not be the case.  The ORP will go through the CEO of the EPA.  I was careful to point out that I do not read anything ominous into that.  It is just that the new situation will be far more complex and will be subjected to all sorts of variables that do not obtain at the moment.  There can be all sorts of pressures and opinions floating around.  I do not refer to uncontentious matters such as radon.  I refer to nuclear matters.  There are bodies in society that are ideologically opposed to the nuclear industry and they make arguments that something is very dangerous that scientifically does not seem to be very dangerous.  All of those things are floating about.  Advice on such matters is not straightforward and can be subject to political considerations.</p></speech>

What does he mean by that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-19a.566" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor William Reville" time="13:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014061900005#D01000"><p>No, I do not mean what I said in a negative manner.  The flexibility suits the EPA and works well for the organisation.  It has four offices at the moment dealing with different parts of the environment but it can chop and change the responsibilities and work and swap between the offices if it sees fit.  That is not intrinsically a bad thing but I would not like to see the office of radiological protection interfered with in such a manner for at least several years after it is set up in the EPA.  In order to bed it down properly I would prefer to see it established in legislation because that would put on a lot of inertia, and if pressure came on to chop and change it, that would not be easily or quickly done.  I would prefer to see it embedded in legislation.  Why would it not be?  It is qualitatively different from everything else the EPA does.  It is a whole institute that is now being put into the EPA.  Why would it not merit &ldquo;radiation&rdquo; in the name of the new merged institute?  Apart from any other consideration, it seems to be very unfair that it would not be the case.  It would be bad for the morale of the Radiological Protection Institute to be erased in such a manner.</p></speech>

Is the radiological protection institute in the UK a separate entity or is it part of a bigger health protection body?</p></speech>

A majority have a situation similar to this country where there is an RPII-like institute dealing with radiation.  If the country has a nuclear industry it will also deal with the radiological aspects of said industry.  The general environment work will be dealt with in a separate institute.  That is a common model in Europe.  It is not universal but it is common.  I think that is the logical way to do it.</p></speech>

We have had much discussion on the various types of renewable energy and low-carbon energy.  Does Mr. Reville believe nuclear energy would be an advantage to us as a nation or is that outside his remit?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-19a.570" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor William Reville" time="13:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014061900005#D01400"><p>This is a personal opinion because the Radiological Protection Institute has no official position either for or against nuclear energy.  Its brief is simply the protection of the public and professionals against the hazards of ionising radiation, whether that comes from a nuclear source or a non-nuclear source.  My personal opinion is that a nuclear station would be of great benefit to the country.</p> <p>In view of the climate change problem, the nuclear industry would be a great asset.  It does not emit carbon dioxide warming gas and it is very well understood.  There have been some accidents and while the modern design of the nuclear plant is not entirely foolproof, it is close to it.  The hazards from accidents associated with the modern nuclear plant are extremely low now.  I agree there are still some problems with the long-term storage of waste, but there are solutions to that as well.  I have no interest in the nuclear industry <i>per se</i>, but in view of the climate change problem, it is a way to generate electricity and it is very efficient compared with the renewables and we understand the technology 100%.  It is extremely well understood.  We could push a button and get all our electricity from nuclear energy without too many problems and that source does not emit warming gases.</p></speech>

I have read their document.  The point Mr. Reville covered in his response to a question from Deputy Corcoran Kennedy's is one the issues of concern to me.  I refer to how the RPII would  fit within the EPA and the fact that the witnesses want that legislated for to protect the identity of the RPII within the EPA.</p></speech>

I realise from where they are coming on that and Mr. Reville set out the argument for that quite well.  On a personal level, I must disagree with his last answer but that is not what we are here to discuss today.  In the context of the matter before us, what is the number of staff in the RPII?  I do not know if Mr. Reville is aware of the number of staff in the EPA and it would be helpful if he had that figure.  Is there a concern that if the RPII is merged, amalgamated or subsumed into the EPA, the expertise and grades within the RPII will diminish over a period of time and the effectiveness of the office in terms of its level of expertise and competence will dissipate?</p></speech>

The EPA is about eight times the size of the RPII.  There are 43 staff in the RPII and 340 in the EPA and they are based in Wexford and in Dublin.  The loss of staff or expertise is always a possibility in a devolved organisation and probably not as a great in a specialist organisation.</p></speech>

In its purest sense, the RPII's primary function is to protect people from the environment and the EPA's primary function is to protect the environment from people.  While both organisations deal with the environment, they come from diametrically opposed viewpoints.  It is possible that there could be a conflict of interest on the scientific end within the organisation.</p></speech>

I may not be able to wait for the reply but I will get it in written format.  I have read the submission and I apologise for not being here for the presentation.  On the two most important aspects that the witnesses have mentioned, the change of name and incorporating the name of the RPII into the EPA, my first reaction to that on reading the submission was that the function of the EPA is broader than protecting the environment from people.  Its function is to promote sustainable development to protect all of the environment which includes the people working together in a cohesive force for the protection of all for sustainable development.  Therefore, it incorporates all of that.  I was delighted to note in the new legislation that the RPII will have a separate office within the EPA, which would give it a stand-alone function.  We do not see many bodies in a merger granted that status, rather they are submerged and merged into one umbrella body.  The provision for what is deemed a new office, that of the office of radiological protection, should allay some of the fears the witnesses enunciated.  It provides that there will be a dedicated office and it will carry forward the body's aims and objectives, and I congratulate the body on the work it has done.  What will that office be doing if it not doing the work that the witnesses are doing?  The matter of names and administration is secondary to the work.  What is important is that the aims and objectives of the witnesses' work is carried on in that new office and that is the purpose for which it will be in place.  As a new office it will also have new work to do.  I hope that will allay some of the witnesses' fears.  The witnesses mentioned two matters and the most important of those is the name of the merged body and basis of the proposed new relationship that will administer radiological protection.  It is in all of our interests, those of the EPA and everybody outside the EPA on this planet that the work of the RPII continues because it for our protection and it is in the interests of everybody.  I do not think anybody will take their eye off the ball.</p></speech>

It is not the case that it will not go ahead at this stage.  On the background to it, the board of the RPII examined the possible benefits and savings, if any, that might accrue through such a merger and we found there to be little or none.  There is a possibility that a saving on the cost of the board of &euro;60,000 a year could be made and that would be about it, but that would be eaten up with expenses of travelling to Wexford.  It is estimated there are no real savings to be gained and that it will cost &euro;800,000, or perhaps more, to effect the merger.  The question that must be asked is that if a body is performing extremely well, doing its job, has a very high reputational value within the country with the stakeholders and internationally and it is not a good fit with another body ideologically, why go ahead with it?  We recognise the budgetary constraints of the Government and that it is trying to do away with many of what have been classified as quangos but in this case it is a matter of throwing the baby out with the bathwater in so far as we do not see any gain.  There is no gain for the public in Ireland or for the scientific community and there are only dangers.</p><p>  If the merger is to go ahead despite that, we are trying to ensure a few amendments are made to the legislation that would at least make sure that the radiological aspect of the organisation is recognised.  We propose that the letter "R" be put into the title of the EPA such that it would be the "ERPA" and that the office of the radiological protection would be recognised on a statutory basis.  We do not consider those proposals a huge ask and they would give recognition to all the stakeholders at home and internationally that we still have a view of the importance of radiological protection.  Currently, the RPII deals with the issue of ionising radiation, radiation from radon and medical devices.</p> <p>According to the Minister, the new body will be tasked with non-ionising radiation sources which will include radio masts and pylons.  This will be an area where credibility will be paramount.  The public will want to believe that what is being said is scientifically correct and by a body with credibility.  The RPII, Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, has credibility in this field.  To diminish that credibility in any shape or form does not make sense.</p><p> We have concerns about the proposals concerning the name, particularly after the RPII&rsquo;s UK counterpart was subsumed into a larger body and different aspects of its work were divvied out.  There is a much better argument to merge the RPII with the HSE, Health Service Executive, rather than the Environmental Protection Agency.  The HSE is about protecting people from illness and damage.  That is what the RPII is doing.  It has a medical element to it.</p></speech>

There are other areas around climate change where we could resolve this issue.</p><p>  What does the RPII believe are the advantages to a merger from the Government&rsquo;s point of view?  Professor William Reville was re-appointed in January 2012 by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Were there any discussions or conditions attached about the possible merger or dissolution of RPII?  If so, would that have given Professor Reville an opportunity to make his views known to the Minister?  What was the Minister&rsquo;s response then?</p><p>  I take it the delegation is speaking on behalf of the board of the RPII and that a clear majority share the views we have heard today.  It is unclear from the Bill as to the role of the chief executive officer of the RPII.  Is it the case that the chief executive officer becomes a director from the period of dissolution to 30 April 2016?  Is there a certain expertise at senior executive level to be lost with the possible merger with the EPA?</p><p>  The RPII published a major document on the proposed new nuclear power plants in the UK.  I attended a briefing here when it was launched a while ago.  My concern with the possible merger is the RPII&rsquo;s role to provide advice to the Government on matters relating to radiological safety.  When the UK Government decided to proceed with the construction of the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, there was no formal consultation process, particularly on the transboundary effect in that the Hinkley site is only 150 miles from Dublin.  The Minister claimed he had consultations with UK Ministers on this.  What role did the RPII play in that consultation process?  What is its view on a transboundary screening exercise being done in advance of a decision being taken to build another nuclear power station at Hinkley?</p></speech>

At the time, it was assumed the merger was not on the cards.  In 2011, the board had sent a detailed report to the Minister on its evaluation of any advantages or outcomes from a merger.  It was all very clear and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government was convinced that no one was identifying any significant advantages to a merger.</p></speech>

In its findings, it stated:<blockquote><br />The Department has carried out an analysis of the proposed merger of EPA and RPII using the guiding principles out lined in the memo for Government referred to in Secretary General Watt&rsquo;s letter [dated 28 March, 2012].  It is our view that the relatively modest financial benefit of merging the two organisations (potential maximum savings of &euro;80,000 per annum) is far outweighed by the administrative costs, inherent reputational risks and legislative complexities of such a merger.<br />There is a risk that a merger in this instance would not contribute to the leaner and more focussed public service desired by the Government, but risk a blurring of each body&rsquo;s considerable national and international responsibilities.</blockquote>That was the Department&rsquo;s considered view.  I have heard no argument from anybody identifying any clear advantage to the merger.  That is why I began my presentation stating that our board is mightily puzzled as to why this merger is being insisted on.  The net income will be that where there are two bodies, there will only be one.</p></speech>

There are 12 members on the board so this comes to &euro;80,000, the same as the figure of savings stated in the assessment.  This would be mopped up by expenses of travelling to Wexford.  A new advisory committee to advise the new office of radiological protection in the EPA would be established and its expenses would also mop up these potential savings.</p><p>  I do not know the Government&rsquo;s reasons for the merger.  No one has ever come up with a reason, except making one organisation where there are two.  Maybe it is like the followers of Pythagoras in Ancient Greece who were fascinated by numbers.  They reckoned the secret to the whole universe was based on numbers and, accordingly, worshipped them.  In this case, it seems to be the worship of the number "One" rather than the number "Two".  I do not understand the reasons for it.</p><p>  In principle, there would be no danger of losing expertise in the new body.  Our chief executive officer, if the merger happens, will transfer to be the head of the new office of radiological protection.  Her contract has been extended through to 2016.</p> <p>We lobbied for this in order to bed down the new office properly.  Dr. Ann McGarry, our chief executive officer, has extensive experience and is extremely capable.  We would have been very worried if her contract had been allowed to run out in 2014.  The intention had been that it would only be extended for a year and there was a further delay so if the merger happened she could have been in the EPA only ten months before the question of who would be CEO was up in the air again.  We were very worried about this and the Department agreed to extend her tenure for a longer period.  Other senior members and all staff will transfer to the new organisation so there is no reason to suspect that the office of radiological protection, ORP, in the new body will be depleted in terms of scientific expertise.  I do not know what will happen but I see no reason for fear.</p><p> On a regular and routine basis the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, consults with the UK authorities and is reasonably satisfied with the level of information from the other side.  I cannot address specific questions on what happened at Hinkley Point in detail.  As far as I am aware the ongoing consultations with the UK authorities are satisfactory and this contrasts with the situation years ago when they were loth to give information.  The atmosphere has changed and things are more transparent now.</p></speech>

This is happening in all Departments, including the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  This nonsensical merger is happening in order to cut board fees rather than for an ideological or administrative advantage.  My concern is that the RPII's expertise will be watered down in terms of its public advocacy on nuclear energy issues.  Some of us may disagree on those issues but they should be kept in the public realm and there should be education on the topic.</p></speech>

The council views interactions with this committee as integral to our work and they have proven to be extremely valuable.  Other members in attendance with me today are Mr. Sebastian Barnes, Professor Alan Barrett and Dr R&oacute;is&iacute;n O'Sullivan.  Unfortunately, Dr. Donal Donovan, who is based in the United States, cannot attend today.  The council secretariat is also present: Ms Rachel Joyce, Mr. Eddie Casey, Mr. Andrew Hannon, Mr. John Howlin and Mr. Diarmaid Smyth, head of the secretariat and chief economist.  I would also like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the ongoing interaction between the secretariat and the staff of the Oireachtas.  This work supports the very useful engagement we as a council have had with this committee.</p><p>  Today I will cover our sixth assessment report, which was published last Tuesday, 17 June.  The report is written in line with the mandate of the council set out in the Fiscal Responsibility Acts 2012 and 2013 and also with the memorandum of understanding between the council and the Department of Finance.  </p><p>  At the outset of this discussion, it is worth noting the significant progress that has been achieved in resolving the fiscal crisis.  Ireland&rsquo;s debt-to-GDP ratio should now be on a declining path, underpinned by nominal GDP growth, record low interest rates and the move to a planned balanced budget between 2013 and 2018.  The borrowing capacity of the State has also been restored, with secondary market bond yields falling to low levels.  Furthermore, the five main rating agencies all now rate Irish sovereign debt at investment grade.  However, this is not to downplay the significant macroeconomic and fiscal risks and challenges that remain, not least high debt levels and uncertain growth prospects.  It is part of the role of the council to analyse these risks and challenges as part of its assessment of the macroeconomic and fiscal position. </p><p>  On the basis of the analysis in our report, the planned &euro;2 billion adjustment for budget 2015 should be implemented.  There are three main reasons for this recommendation.  First, while significant progress has been made in repairing Ireland's public finances, the gap between general government expenditure and revenue is still projected to be close to &euro;8 billion in 2014.  Slowing the pace of deficit and debt reduction would leave the public finances more exposed to shocks that create unsustainable debt dynamics.  Second, even with the encouraging recent fiscal performance, the central projections of the stability programme update, SPU, 2014 indicate no margin of safety around the EDP deficit ceiling for 2015.  Recognising the high level of uncertainty surrounding the level and composition of growth, reducing the planned adjustments would increase the probability of missing the target and put the EDP exit in jeopardy.  Third, the dramatic reduction in the risk premium on Irish debt has reflected, among other factors, the increasing credibility of Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to make necessary fiscal adjustments.  While the relatively small reduction in planned consolidation in the last budget does not appear to have harmed Ireland&rsquo;s credibility, a second year of scaled-back adjustment effort could raise doubts about the political capacity to make necessary adjustments outside of a formal external programme.  This is particularly important as this will be the first budget following the ending of Ireland&rsquo;s programme of official assistance.</p><p>  Two separate fiscal objectives frame the 2104 stability programme update projections.  The more immediate target is the requirement to achieve a general government deficit of less than 3% of GDP in 2015 under the EDP, to which I have already referred.  The next objective is to meet the medium-term budgetary objective of a balanced budget in structural terms by 2018.  This deadline is ambitious and exceeds minimum requirements under the rules.  As part of the report, the council calls for a clear rationale to be provided for this deadline. </p><p>  While the Government&rsquo;s medium-term fiscal stance is assessed to be within the range of appropriate policies, it implies a stronger drag on demand and even greater pressures on spending than meeting the minimum requirements under the rules.  Recognising the trade-off between supporting domestic demand and improving debt sustainability, there is a case for a less ambitious medium-term fiscal stance that more closely follows these minimum requirements. </p><p>  Moving beyond the headline figures, the medium-term fiscal adjustment plans imply a sustained fall in non-interest Government spending as a share of GDP.  In fact, the SPU projects that Government non-interest spending will fall by approximately 8 percentage points of GDP by 2018.  This leaves non-interest spending at an historically low proportion of economic output and implies considerable pressures on Government services, public investment and social payments. </p><p>  The prolonged tight spending plans will be difficult to achieve given demand pressures and rigidities in certain areas of expenditure.  The forthcoming comprehensive review of expenditure needs to be used to identify appropriately detailed expenditure plans.  This would help to promote informed public debate and enhance the credibility of budgetary projections over the medium term.</p><p>  One area of particular relevance for this committee highlighted in the report is the strengthening of Ireland&rsquo;s fiscal framework.  This is an important positive legacy of the economic crisis and one which the Government has made a strong commitment to respecting.  The framework is a combination of European-level elements under the reformed Stability and Growth Pact and national-level elements that are designed to complement and extend the European rules.  Consistency between the national and European frameworks allows the two sets of formal rules and enforcement procedures to reinforce each other.  The monitoring, peer pressure and financial sanction procedures of the SGP help give credibility to the national rules, while the monitoring and enforcement procedures of the national rules provide a degree of domestic oversight and ownership of the overall rules framework.  This later element of monitoring and enforcement of the national rules includes roles for both the Oireachtas and the fiscal council.  Adhering to the new fiscal framework should help to smooth future boom-bust cycles, guide Government debt to safer levels, and underpin borrowing capacity during the period when debt will remain unavoidably high. </p><p>  However, for the framework to be an effective bulwark against instability, it is important that it has broad public understanding and support.  In assessing the constraints imposed by the new fiscal framework, the constraints that are also imposed by debt markets on fiscal policies should not be forgotten.  As experienced by Ireland in 2010, debt markets can be even more demanding in terms of the fiscal policies viewed as consistent with access to funding to cover deficits and roll-over debts.  A credible commitment to a framework that ensures debt sustainability can, therefore, expand rather than narrow the room for fiscal manoeuvre. </p><p>  Our assessment is that the plans in the SPU are consistent with this new framework.  Post-2015, the Government is committed to meeting the requirements of the national budgetary rule and the requirements of the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact.</p><p>  At our last meeting, I highlighted the new role for the council in independently scrutinising and endorsing, if appropriate, the macroeconomic projections underpinning budgets and stability programme updates.  This significant change in Ireland&rsquo;s budgetary architecture was extended in this round to include medium-term macroeconomic forecasts.  The SPU forecasts are within an endorsable range, taking into account the methodology and the plausibility of the judgments involved, as well as the uncertainty surrounding any growth forecast.  However, the forecast medium-term real GDP growth rate of 3.5% is at the relatively optimistic end of the range.  </p><p>  At our last meeting, several members of the committee highlighted concerns over recent developments in house prices.  In response to this, our latest report includes an analytical note examining house price risks.  In summary, we find that the recent price appreciation is likely to be driven by a reversal of some over-correction, while supply constraints are also likely to be key drivers.</p> <p>However, even if supply issues are at the core of the recent appreciations, the authorities should remain vigilant.  More detailed fundamental analysis of the housing market, if made publicly available, should also limit risks of price growth expectations becoming dislodged from fundamentals.  This is obviously an area of concern for the committee and we will continue to monitor housing market developments closely.  I thank the committee for providing us again with the opportunity to attend today and we look forward to taking questions and hearing the views of members.</p></speech>

We are all into consensus at the moment.  The fact is that taxes are just short of &euro;500 million ahead of target at the moment.  The ordinary person is under enormous financial pressure.

The framework that we have used in considering the appropriate fiscal stance has always balanced the harm that fiscal adjustments do to the domestic economy and to the living standards of households in the economy against the need to ensure the borrowing capacity of the State and that the debt is on a sustainable path.  The way we see it, we made significant progress in correcting the public finances and restoring the borrowing capacity of the State.  We see borrowing costs now coming down to record low levels.  Significant credibility has been built up in the adjustment process so far and much of that has come from following through on the plans with successive Governments doing what they said they were going to do; not just meeting the headline targets in percentage GDP terms but delivering the adjustments that have been promised.  That has been significantly behind the progress that has been made.</p><p>  Thinking about the headline 3% target, it very much depends on the growth of the economy.  As you said, Acting Chairman, the economy seems to be performing reasonably well in the early part of this year.  Exchequer returns have been encouraging but there is still a lot of uncertainty around growth for this year and also, looking out to 2015, one of the things we know from the international experience on financial crises of the kind we have been through is that growth can be erratic and prone to setbacks.  While we do seem to be on an encouraging path at the moment, there are no guarantees that will continue.</p></speech>

The council has reached a consensus following deliberations.  What is the underlying reason for its decision and where does he see the risks to the Irish economy in the next 12 months?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-19a.626" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor John McHale" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014061900005#E01700"><p>There are a number of risks.  In terms of the domestic economy, we know the balance sheets are still very much impaired across the economy.  Again, looking at the international experience, we know that can have a considerable drag on spending.  We also see that credit is still very much impaired and that could affect domestic demand, in particular investment demand.  The prospects in the international economy, unfortunately, are still quite uncertain.  The United Kingdom economy seems to be performing strongly.  In the US, Chairman Yellen downgraded growth forecasts.  There is a lot of uncertainty as to whether the eurozone economy is really pulling out of the recession it is in.  There are concerns about falling into a low inflation and possibly deflationary trap.  There are still a lot of uncertainties around the international economy.</p><p>  When it comes to our borrowing costs, what has brought bond yields down has been the combination of success in the fiscal adjustment process and also developments internationally at the European level, in addition to the actions taken by many central banks around the world.  There is a possibility that some of those positive developments could reverse and if at the same time we were losing credibility to stick with the adjustment programme, that could lead interest rates to rise back up again.  There are a number of risks.  I tis to be hoped that none of those negative scenarios will come to pass, but one thing we know from watching the economy &ndash; I am sure you know this yourself, Acting Chairman - is that the economy will surprise one.  Given the importance of getting out of the excessive deficit procedure which requires that we get the deficit down below 3% of GDP, at this point in time, given what we have achieved already and given the risks that remain, we think that it is appropriate to follow through on those plans for an adjustment of &euro;2 billion, giving us a very reasonable chance that we can put the excessive deficit procedure behind us.</p></speech>

I thank him for his opening statement.  We have already looked at the report.  To continue on from where the Acting Chairman left off on the &euro;2 billion adjustment &ndash; Professor McHale made his views on it very clear &ndash; does he think that if the Government goes with its stated intent of making an adjustment of less than &euro;2 billion, but we do not know how much less, there is a significant risk that we could not achieve a deficit of less than 3% by the end of next year?  How would Professor McHale characterise the risk if the Government were to make an adjustment of &euro;1 billion or &euro;1.5 billion, for example?  What would be the consequences of missing the target in that regard?</p></speech>

The forecasts factor in a &euro;2 billion adjustment and based on that adjustment assumption, the projection is that the deficit would be 2.9% of GDP in 2015.  It would just meet it.  If one were to do less, based on those projections the risk of missing the target would be greater than 50% unless one were to pursue other policies such as perhaps delaying capital spending in 2015 if one thought one would miss the target, but that is not something we would want to do either and that is not the way to allocate public expenditure.  Given the strong Exchequer returns to which Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell referred, based on a &euro;2 billion adjustment, the projection for the deficit in 2015 might now be a bit below 2.9% but probably not that far below it.</p> <p>Significantly reducing the adjustment below &euro;2 billion substantially increases the risk of not meeting the target or being forced to pursue sub-optimal policies to meet the target, which is not something we would welcome.</p></speech>

It is referred to as a target but it is a limit in that it has to be less than 3%; it is not a target.  What are the consequences, directly and indirectly?</p></speech>

We have met all the targets to this point and if we were seen to pursue policies that lead us to start missing the targets in the first budget post-troika, much of that credibility would be undermined, particularly the ability to follow an appropriate fiscal policy outside an official assistance programme.</p><p>  The potentially more direct consequences could be sanctions from the European Commission.  Getting the deficit below 3% of GDP is enough to get out of the excessive deficit procedure.  If we miss that target the Commission will do an analysis of what it calls effective action to see if we pursued the right policies but ended up missing the target because of a bad outcome on economic growth.  Where we have pursued what it views as effective action, it can extend the target so the consequences are not all that severe.  If we are viewed not to have taken effective action, the sanctions process could begin, initially leading to a fine of approximately &euro;300 million, which is significant.  Going through that sanctions process would be very damaging to credibility and is certainly something that would be much better avoided.</p></speech>

In terms of the role we can play in the process, it is better that we stick close to that mandate, which focuses on the broader macro picture.  If the Government were to choose to make adjustments to taxes, lowering some tax rates or changing tax bands, offsetting it with other measures either on the tax or the expenditure side, that is very much a decision for the democratically elected Government.  It is not our place to give specific advice on that.</p></speech>

We are looking beyond 2015, and something we do in this report is look at the expenditure projections to 2018.  A quite startling figure can be seen if we look at non-interest spending over the period 2013 to 2018.  It is projected to fall by eight percentage points of GDP, which is a very significant fall.</p><p>  As we look over the period 2016 to 2018, in money terms non-interest spending is being held constant but the presumption is that we will have growth in the economy.  Therefore, spending will be shrinking as a share in the economy.  It will also be a time of significant demographic pressures and other demand in cost pressures on spending.  Therefore, we need to be aware that even though the worst of the fiscal adjustment should be over in 2015, it will still be quite a difficult period after that, particularly given those underlying spending pressures.  Care would need to be taken in reducing aggregate revenue raising capacity in that situation, but we are not providing advice about particular taxes.  That is very much a decision for Government.</p><p>  The other aspect of that we note in the report is the importance of the upcoming comprehensive review of expenditure.  Given those very strong underlying spending pressures, it would be important to plan expenditure very carefully to identify areas where spending can be restrained in a way that does least damage to public services and to people relying on social payments.  It is a combination of not undermining that revenue raising capacity and also very carefully planning expenditure over the next number of years.</p></speech>

Yesterday, the Minister for Finance stated that the Department's assessment is that if the growth projections are achieved, beyond the budget for 2015 there will be no need for any further fiscal consolidation to achieve a balanced structural budget by 2018.  We can contrast that with the IMF's report yesterday which indicates additional fiscal consolidation in the region of &euro;7.5 billion between now and 2018.  Will Professor McHale discuss that?  He has said that based on the SPU 2014, non-interest expenditure would have to fall by about 8% of GDP by 2018.  What are we facing into after the budget this coming October?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-19a.637" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor John McHale" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014061900006#F00900"><p>Based on the Department's forecasts, additional nominal adjustments of the kind that make up the planned &euro;2 billion for the coming budget do not seem to be required for the period 2016 to 2018.  Things will change a little as we get closer to that but that is the assumption under which those medium-term projections are being made.</p><p>  The reason we still get an improvement in the structural balance is that essentially we are holding spending growth below the growth rate of nominal GDP.  Also, given the progressive nature of the tax system, even holding tax rates and tax bands constant in nominal terms, we can also get increases in revenue as a share of GDP.  We can get improvement in the underlying structural balance.</p><p>  It is important to note that just keeping expenditure constant in nominal terms, particularly given these underlying pressures, can be extremely difficult to achieve.  We saw with health last year that because of demographic pressures, the amount of savings it had to achieve were well in excess of the overall cut in its gross expenditure because our savings had to make up for the underlying demographic and other service related pressures.  It will still be quite a challenging period, even though the worst will be over.</p></speech>

Professor McHale is envisaging a very significant cut in spending.<br />While Professor McHale is making the point that the Government does not have to do this by 2018, what are our options in terms of meeting our responsibilities under the fiscal compact treaty to achieve the medium-term objective?  Over what period of time could we be doing that, and would that be better in terms of more gradually achieving that objective instead of doing it over a tight three-year window after next year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-19a.639" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor John McHale" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014061900006#F01100"><p>That is something on which we are looking for further clarity.  I will give the Deputy some background on the rules that will apply to us post-2015, assuming we make a successful exit from the excessive deficit procedure.  Currently, we are in the corrective arm of the Stability and Growth Pact, also known as the excessive deficit procedure.  Once we are out of the corrective arm we are into what is called the preventive arm, which is a different set of rules.  The preventive arm is largely mirrored in our own national budgetary rule, which is part of a fiscal responsibility Act that effectively implements the fiscal treaty.</p> <p>Under the preventive arm, one either must be at what is called one's medium-term objective - which in Ireland's case is a structural budget balance - or one must be on an adjustment path to that medium-term objective.  While the minimum required adjustment is 0.5% of GDP, the Commission has noted that for high-debt countries, a reduction of 0.6% of GDP is required.  If one considers the plans set out in the stability programme update, SPU, for the period 2016 to 2018, it provides a total adjustment in the structural balance of 2.7% of GDP.  However, if one implemented the reduction of 0.6% each year, that would amount to a cumulative adjustment of 1.8% of GDP.  As this involves an additional fiscal tightening in nominal terms of approximately &euro;2 billion, it is quite significant.  Consequently, it is not at all clear at this point that it actually is required to get to that structural balance by 2018.  If one follows the 0.6% annual reduction, one potentially could do it by 2020 or even possibly by 2021.  We have had extensive background discussions with both the Commission and the Department of Finance and based on those discussions, we really still do not have a clear picture as to how the 2018 date has been set.  The main thing for which the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council is asking is to set out a clear rationale as to how that relatively early target date was decided on, because against this background of strong expenditure pressures, we do not wish to be setting targets that in a sense are needlessly ambitious, given the pressures that will create.</p><p> If I may add one last point in this regard, given the council has tended to call for more and not less fiscal adjustment, it may seem a little unusual to members that in this case, we are worried about being too ambitious in terms of the fiscal targets.  However, this is all based on having in place a credible fiscal framework.  If such a framework is in place, hopefully with buy-in across the political spectrum, as well as from the public, it gives more space basically to follow the requirements of that framework and to avoid being obliged to do more to convince debt markets that their investments are safe.  However, assuming that such a credible fiscal framework is in place, following the requirements of that fiscal framework should be sufficient to ensure ongoing borrowing capacity for the State.</p></speech>

However, there are many risks around that.  For example, if one looks at the Department of Finance's forecasts for GDP, they are higher than those of the Commission or the IMF.  While we have endorsed them, we did say they were at the optimistic end of the range that we would consider for endorsement.  It may well be that things do not turn out like the Department of Finance assumes and then it will be much more difficult to meet this 2018 target.</p></speech>

The targets to which the council subscribed both last year and this year are roughly what were put in place by the troika.  Last year, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council recommended an adjustment of &euro;3.2 billion and this year, it is talking about &euro;2 billion to &euro;2.1 million.  Does this give recognition to the fact that the State's finances have improved dramatically since 2011?  There have been some draft reports from the Commission in the wake of its departure and it believes the economy is improving.  Should this not blend into the form of adjustment that should be made?  My second point is that we made approximately &euro;600 million - this is a debatable figure as some say it was &euro;400 million -  less of an adjustment last year in the budget.  Did that affect yields on Irish ten-year bonds, which are the quintessential barometer by which one measures it?  Professor McHale referred in his opening statement to how this could be detrimental if we were to not meet our targets.  My opening question is how do both those factors play out?</p></speech>

As for the &euro;2 billion adjustment for this year, the Deputy mentioned the European Commission, which actually believes we will need adjustments of &euro;2.6 billion in the coming budget to meet the 2.9% target and that largely reflects a more pessimistic assumption about growth.  Even though the fiscal correction has evolved according to plan and there are tentative signs that the economy is recovering, this again merely underlines the uncertainty that still remains.  As for the yields on Irish bonds, the Deputy is absolutely right and yields have fallen since budget 2014.  It does not appear as though reducing the size of the adjustment from &euro;3.1 billion to &euro;2.5 billion has done any significant damage.  However, one must realise there are many factors affecting bond yields, which include international factors such as the quantitative easing programmes undertaken by different central banks, including those of the United Kingdom and the United States.  In addition, developments at eurozone level have strengthened confidence that support would be there at a European level, which makes it less likely that countries could end up defaulting and therefore, investors are not demanding such large risk premia.</p></speech>

Can Professor McHale foresee anything he can highlight to members?</p></speech>

However, the fact it is there seems to have had a very positive effect in bringing down bond yields.  Relatively recently, the German Constitutional Court has raised major concerns about that and there also have been statements from the German finance minister noting that since one requires a European Stability Mechanism, ESM, programme in order to qualify for OMT, any ESM programme would require unanimity among all countries.  Again, this could raise doubts about whether OMT would be available when needed.  Consequently, there always is a risk of setbacks and the sorts of developments that really have helped to underpin the fall in Irish borrowing costs could reverse themselves.  However, I wish to stress I do not believe the fall in Irish borrowing costs is just because of these international developments.  There has been a positive interaction between our demonstration of our capacity to make the fiscal adjustments, which often makes us eligible for these types of programmes.</p> <p>Those two matters have interacted positively together which is why we certainly do not want to have back-sliding at the international policy level.  Also, if we were to move away from that demonstration that we can make those adjustments, that could have a negative effect as well.  We really need both continuing to work together to keep the low bond yields that we have at present.</p></speech>

If we were all sitting around and rationally discussing fiscal policy, what was optimal, etc., and it was all about the economics, maybe one could make a case.  However, we all know that the background here is the local election results.  The international community looking in will know that a lot of the discussion around the potential slippage from the targets is related to this domestic event and the forthcoming general election, even though it is whatever number of months away.  Although we have not mentioned it, it is a reality.  Even if one goes back to a year ago, we might have had discussions around the weakening of austerity, loosening our resolve and things like that.

It feeds into the system.  It is relative to people's lives.  That is the way the system works.</p><p>  The last part of this is the adjustment that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council purports to be necessary.  If one makes an adjustment of &euro;2 billion in cuts and taxes, what effect will it have on GDP?</p></speech>

If one was to implement a &euro;2 billion adjustment, that essentially knocks off approximately &euro;1 billion from nominal GDP.  It is significant.  Going back to what I stated at the outset, this trade-off between the damage that fiscal adjustments do the economy and ensuring that we retain the borrowing capacity of the State and the sustainable debt situation is the thing we are always grappling with.</p><p>  As I have stated to this committee in the past, all the members of the council approach macroeconomic issues from a Keynesian-type perspective.  There are certainly differences among us in the kinds of model that we bring, but that really means that we recognise that fiscal adjustment slows the economy.  If we were not facing any constraints in borrowing capacity, good macroeconomic management would tell one to try to phase the adjustment out to better times.  We recognise that one does not want to be making the adjustment when the economy is on its knees.  The unfortunate aspect is that we faced major constraints in borrowing capacity, and even though there have been improvements, there still remain substantial fragilities.  We are grappling constantly with that particular trade-off.</p></speech>

There are other uncertainties as well.  If scaling back the adjustments were to undermine the hard-won credibility that we have achieved on the borrowing side, the spectre of falling back from the progress we have made over the past number of years could also be a significant hit to confidence.  It can work in different ways.</p><p>  I take Deputy Kevin Humphreys's general point.

If one does not make the adjustments, one could undermine a lot of the progress we have made so far, which itself could have negative effects on the economy, but making the adjustments also has negative effects.  There really are no easy answers.  It is a balancing act.</p></speech>

There are equal dangers in the recommendation.  With hindsight, if one looks back to last year, when there was a decision to be made between a &euro;3.1 billion adjustment and a &euro;2.6 billion adjustment, which, like a table tennis ball, went back and forth, would Professor McHale agree that the correction that was made was the correct one, rather than the &euro;3.1 billion recommended by the fiscal council?</p></speech>

We still believe that an adjustment of &euro;3.1 billion would have been appropriate.

Generally, I would wait.  We have had only five months of Exchequer data, and we have had only two months of Exchequer data since the stability programme, and it would be prudent to wait until at least we have had eight to nine months of data.  Deputy Humphreys is correct that taxes are ahead by &euro;500 million, although approximately half of that reflects income tax and corporate tax, the latter of which is particularly volatile.  Some of the other savings probably do not reflect big structural improvements.  For example, we have seen Central Bank profits go up as well as interest savings.  Some of the headline figures may overstate the improvement.  It is probably a little early in the year.  Certainly, so far taxes are ahead, but there are some big months ahead, particularly November.  It is prudent to wait and see at present.</p></speech>

Is that correct?</p></speech>

There will still be a lot of uncertainty even about what happened in 2014 come this October.  There is still a fair amount of uncertainty about 2015.  On page 63 of our report we have a fan chart that expresses the uncertainty around the Government deficit.  The range of uncertainty is narrowing over time but it is still quite big at that point.  It is important to bear in mind that since last year, the budget has been moved forward.  Critically, it has been moved forward ahead of the November Exchequer returns which are pretty hard to predict.</p><p>  In our previous report we did some analysis which pointed out that the uncertainty around budget day forecasts is now significantly higher than it was in the past.  Although there will be more information by October, it is not as if 2014 or 2015 will be a done deal; there will still be a lot of uncertainty around.  </p></speech>

They have provided a wealth of data that we can pore over.  I have not been able to go through all the data since the report was published but it is good to see that an analysis has been done on housing.  That issue will be monitored in future so we should revert it.</p><p>  It is regrettable that we and the public end up focusing on one line in the data, which is the overall adjustment figure, although that is important.  More important is where the adjustment is made, be it in public services, the low-paid or highly-paid, but that is outside the council's remit.  That is the real debate on those type of adjustments.  Given the amount of detail and research that has gone into the report, however, it is a pity to focus on only one aspect.</p><p>  Having said that, I do not agree that society can take a &euro;2 billion adjustment in the next budget.  I understand the authority that the Fiscal Advisory Council has been given is to ensure that we meet the rules under the fiscal compact or austerity treaty.  If that is the council's task, it is important for it to ensure that the State meets the rules in acting prudently, conservatively and cautiously.</p></speech>

I do not think the Government has ever agreed with the council's position on the level of adjustment.  There is a long-term problem, however.  Whether or not we agree with the Government's position, the Fiscal Advisory Council is statutorily bound to provide data, yet within a day of that data being published, the Minister for Finance may say he is not accepting it.  The Minister has to weigh up public concerns and he is right in making that call.  He may say that is because the council does not have all the data.  He told the committee yesterday that the council does not have the soft data which the Department has.  The problem is that the council should have whatever data the Department has.  It does not make any sense for the council to assess whether we will reach targets, if the Minister tells the committee that the council does not have all the soft data available to the Department concerning the &euro;2 billion adjustment being made.  How can we strengthen that situation and deal with it?  Does the council see that as a problem in future?</p></speech>

First, I agree with him about the excessive focus on the sum of &euro;2 billion.  It is something that we struggle with because there is quite a lot in the report.  It is what the media wants to focus on and it is an easy message to get across.  One of the benefits of our interaction with this committee is that we can talk more broadly about the report.</p><p>  Deputy Doherty noted that we are focused on following the rules.  It is true that part of our mandate is to assess compliance with the national budgetary rules under the Fiscal Responsibility Act, but we also assess the overall fiscal stance separately from the rules.  While sometimes it may not come across this way, we share the committee's concerns.  Ultimately, it is what all of this means for households in the economy.  The challenge is to have as little austerity as possible.  </p><p>  When the Fiscal Advisory Council first came into being in 2011, the markets were pricing in close to a 90% probability of an Irish default.  That loss of capacity would likely have led to much greater austerity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-19a.695" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1048" speakername="Arthur Spring" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014061900009#J01200"><p>Is Professor McHale saying that 90% was projected in the markets?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-19a.696" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor John McHale" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014061900009#J01300"><p>In mid-2011, the ten-year Irish bond yield was close to 16%.  If one looks at the differential between German and Irish bond yields using a standard formula, one can work out the implied probability of default.  It is based on certain assumptions in terms of how much money investors will get back in the event of a default.  That particular calculation assumes they will get back 50% of their money but the numbers can vary.  The general point is that the markets thought it was highly likely that Ireland would default.  The implications of that would probably have been far greater austerity.  Even if we did get official support, it would probably have come with much tougher conditions than the ones we faced and - depending on how that default unfolded - the possibility that we would not get support at all.  We would have to have immediately closed our primary deficit which at that point in time was still very large.</p><p>  Even thought it may not always seem that way, the goal here is austerity avoidance.  We have been focused on ensuring that we are following a fiscal policy that retains that borrowing capacity and dealing with the trade-off I discussed before with Deputy Kevin Humphreys.  </p><p>  Thinking of the council as just following the rules and being completely divorced from what this means for families in the economy, does not capture what we see ourselves as doing. </p></speech>

It is probably the most critical of the Government's assumptions that I have seen so far.  Even though everybody is fixated on the &euro;2 billion target, when we look at the other targets and projections the council is signalling a note of caution.  My question was more about a structural issue.</p> <p>The Fiscal Advisory Council comes out with a report and the following day, the Minister says we are not doing that because we do not need that level of adjustment.  His argument is that the Fiscal Advisory Council and other bodies do not have the soft data, as he described it here at yesterday's meeting, which are available to him.  There is no point in the council providing that type of report if the data are not also available to it.</p></speech>

We have an excellent secretariat which is absolutely on top of all the numbers available.  It is also fair to say that we get excellent co-operation from the Department of Finance.  There has been no request from us for data which has not been met by the Department.  The reason for the differences in views is not the superior access to data.  It could be different analysis or the political factors which also weigh in with the economics.  The data advantage is a very small part of it.</p></speech>

They are data on car sales, etc.  They are publicly available data of which he is perhaps getting advance notice from the CSO.  I am not sure.  My question related more to a structural issue.

It is something I am very concerned about myself.  The discussion has happened earlier in terms of having no more austerity but an 8% drop comparative with GDP.  What was very helpful in the report was the cross-country comparison which shows that Ireland has one of the lowest levels among comparable countries at the lowest level.  The United States of America is only marginally below us.  No one in the room would want to follow the US policy in terms of investment in public supports.</p><p>  This is a major challenge.  When one puts it alongside the growth rates identified by the Government at 3.5%, which the council says is at the optimistic end of the range, serious concern is raised for the stability of the service.  There is a major issue in terms of the delivery of the service for users but also for the economy itself.  Society cannot take that level of cuts.  This is a real cut in real effect over the next five years.  It puts us in a vulnerable position for any future shock that may happen to the economy over the next five years.  It is only six years ago, which seems like a lifetime ago given all that has happened, that we had the eruption of the banking crisis, which was already under way.  Looking forward, we are looking at no increase in spending despite an ageing population, young people coming forward and huge pressures in education and health.  There will be no increases in social welfare while inflation takes place.  How serious does the council consider this is as an area of concern?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-19a.713" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sebastian Barnes" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014061900010#K01400"><p>The Deputy has done an excellent job of summarising our report.  I am glad he found this medium-term analysis important.  In some ways, it is much more interesting and important than the &euro;2 billion next October while setting a context for that as well.  It is a big concern that we have highlighted.  There is the real cuts element and the fact the economy will be growing.  That means that if one is fixing things that are constant such as welfare rates, those rates will be moving away from wages.  There are demographic pressures, including population ageing.  If one is committed to keeping welfare rates where they are in that regard, extra money will have to be found somewhere else.  Of course, there are some very big parts of spending, which means the margin to adjust outside that is potentially very small.  This is a very major concern.</p><p>  It all fits together with the fact that it is very difficult to live with high public debt.  We are still in a very risky situation with our high public debt levels, which means a strategy must be found to manage that.  There must be very deep thinking about how it is done.  It is not for the council to say whether specific expenditure or taxation or some balance of the two should be followed.  That is a political decision which involves important social choices.  What we wanted to do is bring the matter to the table and highlight it to provide for a more informed public debate about what is at stake.</p><p>  Currently, what we see is that much of the reduction is focused on the expenditure side in the SPU plans leading to the 8.4% as a share of GDP.  That raises real questions about its viability.  In asking whether it makes sense, questions arise as to whether the public and economy will support it.  There is also the question of its desirability.  Even if one can make it all add up, is this the right thing to have?  One area we highlight is public investment.  One can cut public investment for a while without doing that much damage as one can catch up.  After a while, things start to fall apart where one has not had investment for a long time.  Public investment is very important for supporting growth.  If one's roads are falling apart and the public investment is not keeping up, it makes one wonder why people in the private sector would invest here.  These are very serious issues.  The comprehensive spending review in the autumn provides a good place to start thinking about the strategy that will be needed over these next few years and to have this discussion about where the country is heading.</p></speech>

We have that for shorter-term forecasts, even though we do not publish the detail.  We can use past forecast errors to generate those ranges.  It is more judgmental as we go out to the medium term.  We realise that those bands of uncertainty increase as one goes further out in time and it become wider.  That is why even though we felt it looked optimistic and ahead of the most likely outcome for 2017 and 2018, it still falls within the range of reasonable estimates given the uncertainty around growth estimates at that horizon.</p></speech>

How one conducts short-term forecasting is relatively established.  It does not always work, but there is a set approach.  Considering the medium term is much more difficult and on our side is a work in progress to a much greater extent.  Due to the greater uncertainty, we endorse these as being appropriate forecasts for the medium term while noting our sense that they are relatively optimistic.  The question about the assumptions on which one should plan is a different one.  The report says it is a reasonable forecast, but if one is prudent, one might have a slightly lower number aiming off that kind of thing.</p></speech>

Given that compliance with the debt rule is one on which the fiscal council must concentrate, does Professor McHale see any scope in this area?  Yesterday, the Minister said the State will make an application for retroactive capitalisation but it does not figure in the council&rsquo;s calculations.</p><p>  I brought up the issue of the structural deficit with the Minister yesterday.  I understand what Professor McHale said earlier about the convergence towards the structural deficit being met by 2018 or that process beginning then.  The Government&rsquo;s April stability programme update sees the structural deficit being at 0%, basically a balanced budget, by 2018.  The actual target, however, is 0.5%.</p></speech>

Each country gets a specific medium-term objective that depends on several factors including debt level, growth uncertainties and other matters.  It has been set for Ireland at 0% which is our medium-term objective.  One cannot have a medium-term objective that allows for 1% structural deficit which is why the 0.5% comes in.</p></speech>

Those countries with a debt level below 60% of GDP would be deemed to have a balanced budget if their structural deficit were not more than 1% while for countries such as Ireland&rsquo;s it must be 0.5%.

Then the treaty stated the maximum deficit any country could have would be 0.5%.  It has always been the case, however, that each country has its own specific medium-term objective which is revised every three years.  Ireland&rsquo;s medium-term objective had been a deficit of 0.5% but was revised to 0%.  One can separate out what the maximum level that applies to all countries and the actual medium-term objectives which are periodically reset by the country-specific recommendations.</p></speech>

They reiterate constantly that the risks are on the downside and the forecasts are very uncertain.  I agree with that because, particularly, the growth forecasts vary quite widely.  The Government depends on the more optimistic growth scenario to materialise which makes me worry even more.  Even after the &euro;2 billion adjustment in the forthcoming budget, we have to reduce spending by 2018 by another 8%, which does not necessarily require cuts at the nominal level.  This is against a background where demographic pressures and other demands from real human beings in the economy are likely to significantly increase.  However nicely one puts it, this is beginning to look like a bleak and grim scenario.  The circle that cannot be squared will be the big demand on our public service by our growing population when we have to continue to reduce spending.  This looks grim for people living in our society.  It may also be impossible because everything the council says is on the downside.  It is difficult to imagine the scenario where some of those downside risks do not materialise.</p></speech>

I do not believe it is quite as grim as the Deputy describes.</p><p>  One argument we made in our report is that we see the new fiscal framework being put in place, with European and certain national elements including the increased role for the Oireachtas, as a positive legacy of the crisis.  We know from our own past, and from that of other countries, that fiscal policy is often badly managed, excessively pro-cyclical and contributed to boom-and-busts cycles which have done so much damage to the economy in the past.  It is not the only element of good management to avoid these kinds of damaging cycles.</p> <p>Much more must be done on the financial and credit side and so on but it is an important component.  </p><p> The big advantage to having a strong fiscal framework is that it will allow us to guide the debt level down to safer levels.  Part of the risks described by the Deputy really reflect the fragility of the situation we are in when we have these incredibly high debt levels.  We really cannot stay there unless we want to remain in this highly risky situation where domestic or international shocks could knock us off course.  </p><p> The third reason, which could be most relevant, is that if one has a strong fiscal framework in place, it gives credibility and actually gives one more room for fiscal manoeuvre.  One can point to these rules and say they are placing terrible constraints on Irish fiscal policy but the debt markets could impose much greater constraints on fiscal policy and force much greater levels of austerity.  It goes back to the point I made earlier about austerity avoidance.  It is a mistake to view the fiscal framework in purely negative terms as something that is being imposed on us, particularly by Europe.  I see it as something that is in the national interest, not because we like-----</p></speech>

Professor McHale's essential argument is that if we ease up on the austerity, the markets panic and increase the cost of lending to us so we cannot possibly do that.  We must keep them happy so that we keep the cost of borrowing low.  However, if we do that, we effectively strangle any hopes for growth.  Professor McHale pointed out that one can have historically low levels of investment, which we have at the moment, for a short period of time but if one continues with historically low levels of investment, one will potentially destroy the capacity of the economy to recover at any point and do very severe long-term damage to it.  I put it to him that we are at that stage.  We have had a massive retrenchment in capital investment and are at the point that if this continues, we will do long-term structural damage to the economy that will remove our capacity to recover in any serious way and put us at a serious disadvantage.  If one combines that with all the pressures Professor McHale has also referred to, it sounds like a "lose-lose" scenario.</p></speech>

Conditional on starting from a situation of high debt, one of the messages we discussed in the report is that if there was not so much of an attempt to go beyond the minimum fiscal requirements, these pressures would be less.  The choice has been made but as we pointed out in the report, that has a cost - to be more aggressive in the tightening over the coming years than the minimum required under the fiscal rules.  That is a choice that has been made but it is one that costs.</p></speech>

On the one hand, the council is the bad cop when it comes to the forthcoming budget, saying that we must stick to the &euro;2 billion while the Government is saying, possibly for political reasons, that it should be less.  However, Mr. Barnes seems to be saying that over the long term, the Government is arguing for a more aggressive consolidation whereas the council is saying that this is overly ambitious and potentially damaging.</p></speech>

The Government managed to disagree with us on both things.  It comes back to this trade-off framework we have always used for thinking about things.  At the moment, particularly coming to the end of the programme and the 3% target that has been the anchor for a long time, we are very concerned about what happens in 2015.  Having achieved that, things should then be more relaxed in terms of the environment and credibility and this should create the space that would allow less pressure on expenditure in the outer years.  There is a question of how much consolidation is being done.</p><p>  The second question is that it depends how that consolidation is achieved.  If it is done badly, it will obviously be much more damaging to the economy than if it is done well.  There needs to be very careful discussion about how it will achieved - whether it will be on expenditure or taxes - and within that, how it will be achieved.  For example, squeezing something like investment seems like a bad idea for the reasons set out by the Deputy but it also means that there is a very high cost to carrying pieces of public expenditure that are inefficient, of which there are surely going to be some.  There are many important choices to be made to make it less bleak than the Deputy suggests.  </p></speech>

From the council's perspective, it is important that this message is out there.  We are not austerity hawks for the sake of it.  It was a year or two ago when we sat in this room.  Somebody essentially said that we would always call for more austerity.  At the time, we put it in an international context when we said that if we were the fiscal council in Germany or the Netherlands, we would be telling them to do less austerity.  We are not ideologues for the sake of it.  This point is illustrated again with this balance.  It is very important to emphasise that.</p><p>  The Deputy has portrayed a bleak future, which is an interesting perspective.  What the fiscal council is trying to add here is to get away from that phrase we used to have in Ireland where there used to be a sense that one could have it all.  One could have the tax reductions and the additional expenditure.  Part of the role we are trying to fulfil here is to present a clearly based analytical view that, as Mr. Barnes put it, there are choices to be made.  It is up to the political class to make those choices but at least let them be made with clear knowledge and not in the sense that one can have one's cake and eat it.</p></speech>

There are some areas where I think we could change the goalposts and move the parameters of this discussion, which is not the council's job because they must work within existing parameters.  I think we should tell Europe to take a hike for &euro;8 billion in interest but the council cannot say that and cannot step outside those parameters.</p></speech>

I also think that the question of whether one makes this adjustment through taxing the financial services sector, the FTT, wealth tax or taxes on higher earners as against cuts in public expenditure is a political battle we must fight.</p><p>  It is the council's job to flag the dangers and down sides if they are coming up.  I think I was the first Deputy the last time to ask about the area of housing, the potential for a housing bubble and the macro-economic danger that might represent.  Since we had that discussion, at which point the council said it would look at it, it has become more manifest.  Could the witnesses comment on the danger that represents?  What seems to be happening encouraged by Government policy is that the big outside investors who are coming in and buying up all of the property are quickly developing a monopoly and rents are going up.  One spin-off of that is a housing crisis and it will also affect small and medium enterprise.  Given the tax breaks that are available for this kind of activity, much of that money could go out of the economy.</p> <p>We recently held a meeting with the finance committee of the German Bundestag.  I am probably in a minority in thinking our policies <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>multinationals and corporate taxation are dangerous, but there was agreement from our German counterparts in this regard.  We have a big gap between GNP and GDP which is essentially accounted for by multinationals, which appears to make us vulnerable to problems in that sector.  The Bausch &amp;amp; Lomb events suggested we could face real dangers.  An aggressive multinational employer demanded 20% pay cuts across the board and got its way through fear.  If other multinationals were to act in the same way, we could be facing a wave of wage deflation which could pose a serious threat to the capacity of the domestic economy to recover.  This highlights the vulnerable position in which we are putting ourselves by our heavy reliance on this sector.  The Germans advised us to develop our own industrial capacity, including small and medium enterprises.  Given the huge gap between GNP and GDP, do the delegates see our disproportionate reliance on this sector as a structural danger to the economy?</p></speech>

We promised then that we would examine it carefully.  It is something we would have considered carefully anyway in the light of recent trends in the economy, but we took the matter even more seriously after hearing the committee's concerns.  We are constantly looking out for bubbles forming in house prices given the damage done to the economy by the last bubble.  At this time we do not see excessive credit growth; if anything, it is the opposite.  The big spike in prices appears to be partly the result of a bounce back from an initial overcorrection.  There also appears to be severe supply constraints in many urban centres, including Dublin, in particular.  That explains the recent movement in prices.  We are, however, starting to see signs of expectations of house price increases becoming ingrained.  This is at an early stage, but it is something that deserves careful monitoring.  The Central Bank's recent macro-financial review outlined survey evidence that while 92% of respondents expected prices to increase, nobody expected them to fall.  A significant percentage expected a price increase of more than 10%.</p><p>  It is early days and, given what has been happening recently, it is not surprising that people predict the likely trend to be upwards, but it is an early sign of issue about which we need to worry.  Even though initial price rises can be due to changing fundamentals and the last boom began with fundamental demographic and income changes, the price increases created a bubble like phenomenon as people extrapolated forward from past price increases.  We are not there yet, but it bears careful monitoring.  We must make sure we have learned the lessons from the last crisis in order that we use available tools, whether in terms of macro-prudential policy being controlled by the Central Bank or through fiscal policy, including the overall stance of fiscal policy, as well as specific instruments aimed at the housing market.</p></speech>

We previously had a triple bubble, involving a construction bubble, a price bubble and a credit bubble.  Usually a supply response brings prices down, but the underlying pressure was so strong that even the supply response had no effect.  There were multiple hits against the economy, involving the collapse of an overextended construction sector, massive loss of wealth and the ensuing economic destruction.  Given what happened previously, it is the job of bodies such as the Fiscal Advisory Council to monitor developments very closely in order that damage is not inflicted again.  However, we should not overreact by identifying bubbles where they do not exist.  Our analysis does not indicate that a bubble is emerging, but we have to be watchful and there are signs that should be monitored.  We will continue to report to the committee on our analysis of the housing market in our future appearances before it.</p><p>  On corporate taxation, as we are getting into a more specific area, I will not speak for the council.</p></speech>

It was not until the 1950s that we hit on a strategy, as a small open economy at the edge of Europe, that has worked well in integrating us into international production changes and getting global companies to locate part of their activities in Ireland.  On the whole this strategy has served us well and the economy and living standards have improved more than they would have otherwise done.</p></speech>

That is unlikely.  On Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett's specific point on risk, investment is concentrated in particular sectors such as information technology, medical devices and pharmaceuticals, which makes us vulnerable.  However, during the recent recession the net export sector of the economy which is largely driven by multinationals kept the economy from a much deeper recession.  There is a level of diversification in being part of these international production chains, as well as having a strong indigenous sector.  There are, undoubtedly, risks, but they would be greater if we concentrated more heavily.  If we did not have the multinational sector, we would still probably be concentrating on particular industries.  We probably would have concentrated heavily on agriculture, which can be a very volatile sector, and been more dependent on domestic demand, which was severely hit in the recent recession.  In terms of risk, therefore, I do not share the Deputy's view that the presence of a strong multinational sector puts us in a more risky position.</p></speech>

Domestic companies and the public sector are equally capable of asking people to take pay cuts.  We must think through the issue.  To return to the history about which Professor McHale spoke, there is a serious issue regarding SMEs and the indigenous sector in the sense that the idea of many of the development policies instituted in the late 1950s and early 1960s was that they would be stepping stones towards a stronger indigenous policy.  Given that Ken Whitaker is still around, maybe we should ask him about it.  The original idea was that one needed the big players here to develop a managerial, entrepreneurial base, which would carry on from there.  I do not think in the early 1960s Mr. Whitaker envisaged that 60 or 70 years later the policy would still be the same and that we would be out there hoping to recruit.  As Professor McHale said, the idea was always that there would be a blend and a balance.  There has been a failure of the indigenous group to take over.  One often hears this from international visitors.  The Germans were mentioned, but visitors from countries more on our scale, such as Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Israel, often ask where the indigenous Irish group is.  It does not exist, and this is another medium- to long-term challenge for us.</p></speech>

How does one combine house price inflation of 10% with an unemployment rate of 11%?  We should think in terms of rules, as we have mentioned to the Governor during his appearances, whereby no loan should be in excess of 80% of the house price and a limit of two and a half times income should be applied.  As long as house price appreciation remains a tax free form of income with huge leverage, particularly when deposits are low, people will keep buying and selling.  There should be a health warning in property supplements in newspapers, which are increasing to between 30 and 40 pages, as we seem to be set to do the same all over again.</p><p> Dr. Ronan Lyons pointed out our construction costs are still in excess of those in Germany.  The industry, therefore, has not adjusted to eight years of recession.  We still have excessive construction costs.  Is the industry full of restrictive practices?  I recall the rumpus when GAMA built roads in Ireland cheaper than domestic construction firms.  It was demanded that the company build them just as expensively as the domestic construction industry.  If we are going to use construction as the main instrument to change economics in Ireland, we should get a better industry than we have.  Anything the council can find for us in the context of international competitiveness before another booms starts would be appreciated.</p><p> Have we wasted a good recession?  We still do not use cost benefit analysis.  When Professor Barrett was editor of the quarterly economic commentary, we used to always say, "Don't just throw out the cash.  Would you please check back and see has it had any impact at all?".</p><p> I refer to the restructuring issues mentioned by Deputy Boyd Barrett.  If people are rewarded as heavily as we do for entering sheltered sector occupations, there will be a shortage of people interested in investment and, therefore, there will be a reliance on foreign multinationals to develop the economy.  We pretend to be interested in tourism but during the boom people from eastern Europe ran the industry.  We were not interested.  We pretend to be interested in fishing but if a boat goes down, the bulk of the crew tends not to be from Ireland.  Are we going to be serious about entrepreneurship or rent seeking, subsidy seeking, sheltered sector employment?  We have rich doctors and lawyers.</p><p> Deputy Doherty and I attended a banking inquiry committee meeting earlier.  Some of the numbers we heard regarding legal advice would absorb all the funding.  We are, therefore, not changing the structure of the economy to respond the world Professor McHale is describing.  The view that we got back our sovereignty and the troika is gone is bizarre.  We are still borrowing.  Have we learned enough lessons from how we got into trouble, particularly in the context of property and other sheltered sector activities?</p><p> If the health sector continues to be immune from budget constraints, what impact will that have?  The Leader of the Seanad was given figures that he put in the Library regarding the high cost of health insurance.  We have treatments for which patients are kept in hospital for 11.6 days when the international average is 3.7 days.  That adds &euro;10,000 in bed and breakfast cost by keeping every patient in hospital longer because that is what doctors and hospitals are paid for.  That has not been reformed, which means we do not want a competitive health insurance market.  I am worried after three years in the Seanad that apart from the blaming the fiscal council for the &euro;2 billion adjustment, the Government has done nothing to make the economy respond to the world.  The State cannot keep borrowing, although at reduced rates, with the voracious appetite it had previously because we will end up with massively indebted households because of a property bubble and a massively indebted State.  To redress that, I have always felt the fiscal council should have a wider mandate than to be a caste of economic advisors.  If the people doing the economic forecasts are so good, let us give them a few quid to go to Leopardstown and see how they fare picking winners.</p></speech>

Other people in this room have more influence on changes to the mandate than we do.</p><p>  The Senator mentioned policy tools regarding house prices.  Debt-to-income and loan-to-value ratios have to be kept in the table.  Given the current price inflation is not driven by credit growth - the banks are being quite restrictive in the credit they are giving out - they are not the main drivers at the moment but that could change, particularly if bubble dynamics take hold.  It was good to see a nice outline of the Central Bank's macro prudential policy tools in the most recent macro financial assessment.  They seem to be very aware that these tools have to be there and can play an important role if bubble dynamics take hold.</p><p>  Regarding what the Senator said about micro-economic reforms, that goes outside our mandate but certainly an awful lot more needs to be done.  Hopefully, the new Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service will also help in cost benefit analysis and pushing the agenda of structural reform.</p><p>  We are not health experts but, as part of our mandate, we must assess the Government's budgetary forecasts.  As we outlined in this and previous reports, there has been series of missed targets and overspending.  In our previous report, we referred to the phenomenon of a soft budget constraint, which has been used in other contexts but applies here, where the anticipation that budget constraints will relax leads one to act differently in the belief that one will essentially be bailed out in the end.  In the international literature on the soft budget constraint one of the things that is referred to is having career consequences for the people involved.  This is relevant to comments made by the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts.  On the other hand, we have to recognise that the people running the health services are also responsible for the health services themselves and, therefore, it is not just about balancing the books.  We have to recognise the very difficult situations they may face.</p><p>  In a way it comes back to a point emphasised by Mr. Barnes earlier about the importance of advance planning.  This is not just about giving a budget to the health sector that may not be achievable.  One has to think about the consequences and where the savings can be made by raising various inefficiencies.  If one is going to cut spending, it must be done in the right way, otherwise it will have a huge effect on health services.  That requires significant advance planning and, therefore, there must be broaden ownership of the quantum of spending in the health area.  That underlines the broader point made by the Senator about the importance of micro-economic reforms and how they are organised.</p></speech>

One of the things that Professor McHale mentioned earlier is the new fiscal framework.  With that, we should be able to avoid mistakes such as using windfall tax revenues to finance permanent expenditure increases.  We now have a framework within which to identify those dangers and to provide additional analysis.  Additional analysis of the housing market should help to avoid the problems materialising again.</p></speech>

This will be the first year in which there is growth in consumption.  The rate was -0.3% in 2012 and -1.1% in 2013.</p> <p>We are looking at 2% in 2014.  These are Government figures.  Is there a danger that if there are the full &euro;2 billion of cuts this year, and Deputy Humphreys referred to this earlier, it will have an adverse impact on consumption?  There comes a point where there must be a balance between the human and the financial.  We constantly hear from people about the financial pressure on them.  If they are not spending and they do not have money to spend, that must have an impact on growth.  The question is weighing that up.  I know the aim is to get out of the excessive deficit procedure by 2015.   Bearing in mind that 2014 is the first year we will see consumption growth, has that been factored into the council's deliberations?</p></speech>

There is no co-ordination in any of this but we are approaching it from a similar economics point of view.  The analyses of any of the bodies the Deputy mentioned are not factoring in the politics.

Labour Party Deputies talk to the Social Democrats.  If one put it to the Germans or the French that essentially 10% of their population, 6.8 million people, were going to leave the eurozone for the purpose of gaining employment in Anglophone countries or a similar language country, and asked them what would happen in their countries, they would say there would be a revolution or that the country would collapse.  They do not appear to grasp the magnitude of our problems.  I am on the same chapter as every other Member of the House at present.  There was talk at one stage of putting a water charge of &euro;5 per week on a person on &euro;188 per week.  People are really at breaking point and I do not get a sense from the representatives of the OECD, the Commission and the IMF that the committee has met that they see the daily lives or feel it as badly as people do.  One can talk about the political consequences of it, which are as plain as day, but the objective of everybody here is austerity avoidance.  Some people believe it can be abolished or banished altogether.</p><p>  Do the witnesses get a feeling from the Commission, in particular, of awareness of the level of pressure Irish people's lives are under?  When I tell European representatives that there are 400,000 people in negative equity and 130,000 people in arrears with their mortgages, they ask why we own our own property and why we are not renting.  They should look at the model and understand it before they ask those questions.  I do not get the feeling that they comprehend how people's lives are in this country.  Will the witnesses comment on that?</p></speech>

I do not know them well enough to really understand their personal views on these issues but, in general, the people we have met are sympathetic and understand what the implications of the recession and the policy response to the recession have been.  There can be different views about how the economy operates.  One view that appears to be quite influential in the European context is the concept of expansionary fiscal contraction, where one believes the adjustments actually expand the economy.  Unfortunately, it is a view that appears to have a degree of support at the European Central Bank.  Each month it reiterates that doing more consolidation will lead to faster growth, and that is very unlikely to be true in the short term.  Sometimes people's views on things and ideas about how the economy works can lead them astray and potentially to propose policies that can do real damage while not understanding the damage those policies are doing.</p><p>  In terms of the people themselves and their own values, I do not get a sense of a lack of sympathy.</p></speech>

To the credit of the ECB, it has pursued other types of unconventional monetary policies, such as long-term refinancing operations.  That is partly in response to the fact that there is a different type of financial system in Europe.  It is more bank based and quantative easing, which is more focused on market financing, is probably less effective than it would be in the US context or even in the UK context.  It is not that the ECB has been completely avoiding unconventional policies.  My personal view is that it did not do enough and did not do enough early enough, but to say it has not done anything would not be correct.</p></speech>

They say that the world is awash with money trying to find a home, particularly on the bond market.  I was taken aback by this and I asked why Greek and Irish bonds were so low.  It was in the context of the implications for Europe after the European Parliament elections.  They felt that extremism had kicked into the European Parliament in a way not seen before and although they thought there was more instability in political parameters within countries, it did not spike bonds at all because there is so much money available.  Would Professor McHale agree with that?  Second, if that is the case and if there is so much money looking for a home, why are we going to stick to the parameters set by the troika agreement?  Is not everything open for renegotiation?  Is it not the art of politics to make everything possible?</p></speech>

Quantative easing drives down the yields on certain assets.  What happens then is investors, to try to maintain returns on portfolios, engage in what is sometimes called "reaching for yield", where they take on more risk to keep the returns on the portfolios up.  They will look to sovereign bonds which might be considered riskier and offer a risk premium.  However, as there is demand it drives the price up and drives the yields down, so one gets yields falling across a range of assets.</p> <p>Sovereign bond yields in the eurozone have been helped by this.  However, that could reverse if there was a change in quantative easing policies, which are already being tapered in a US context, or if there was a broader reassessment of risk.  This explains, in part, the fall in Irish bond yields which may not be sustainable.  Developing a fiscal policy based on the idea that one will always be able to borrow at a rate of 2.5% would not be wise at this point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-19a.812" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/959" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="16:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014061900017#R00200"><p>My questions are not about the bond yields, although I propose to comment briefly on that issue.  On Professor McHale's comment that the quantative easing programme was responsible in part for the fall in Irish bonds, it could also be argued that it also played a part in the fall of bond yields in Greece.  I do not believe Greece reaching its targets was the result of it being subject to a bigger drop than any other European country.</p><p>  I have a couple of questions for the delegates.  Reference was made to the house price study carried out by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council in which issues such as supply and demand and so on were addressed.  There has been no lending in the economy, yet house prices in certain parts of Dublin are increasing dramatically.  This increase is also starting to filter countrywide.  If there is an increase in the availability of credit, is there a chance it will push up house prices even further?  While it may not create a bubble, it could cause a major problem that would have effects in other areas.  Is that not what we should be concerned about?  Regardless of what we do, we cannot turn back the clock by six years and start building the 7,500 houses per annum required.  We are not at this time in a position to build those houses.  As such, a problem will arise when the banks start to lend.  Is it not the case that we can reasonably expect the banks to lend more into this market and that this will have the automatic consequence of further increasing house prices in the capital?</p></speech>

The policy should be to bring forth as strongly as possible a supply response.  The impediments to that response should be identified and addressed to the extent that it is possible to do so.  Without a supply response, strong credit growth would lead us into dangerous territory, thus returning us to the necessity for the types of instrument mentioned by Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett and Senator Sean B. Barrett, namely, the use of macro-prudential policies such as debt-to-income ratios and loan-to-valuations and so on to ensure this time round credit growth was controlled in a way that it was not previously.</p></speech>

The Government already has a strategy for housing.  One of the areas identified is Government support where loan-to-value ratios are at 95%.  This was criticised by the IMF in its report yesterday.  Is this an issue of concern for the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council?</p></speech>

As I said, the issue in the housing area is one of supply rather than demand.  As such, policies that boost demand would not appear to be the right approach.  As a fiscal council, we are also concerned about the contingent liability associated with any sort of Government guarantee.  We have seen the damage caused in the past by liability guarantees.  This is another form of contingent liability.  For both of these reasons, we would be wary of that type of policy.</p></speech>

It involved other governments putting in money to pay above market values for Irish banks.  I did not see that happening politically in a European context.

I believed the possibilities were low to begin with and have seen nothing since that would make me change my mind.  If anything, given recent statements, it seems even less likely to occur.

As I said, we genuinely value our interactions with it.  As an independent body that reports in the main to the public through the Oireachtas, we see this as an integral part of what we do.  We would welcome particular suggestions the committee might have consistent with our mandate.  While I cannot promise that we will deal with them because we must at all times adhere to our mandate and resources, we will consider them very seriously.  The Deputy's point on capital expenditure is one we could take up in our discussions tomorrow to see if something could be done on that side.</p><p>  In regard to appointments, once the council was placed on a statutory footing - on 1 January 2013 or the last day of 2012 - that was when the appointments officially started.  They were made on the same basis, with one person being appointed for a two year term and the others on a two or four year basis.  Under the fiscal responsibility Act we can, at the discretion of the Minister, be reappointed once.  The first year term is due to expire at the end of the year.</p></speech>

It is a very important protection of an independent body that it cannot be dismissed because it gave advice or stated something not popular with the Government of the day.  In other countries, including Hungary, when fiscal councils have stated something the government did not like, they were dismissed.  The fact a resolution of the D&aacute;il needs to be forthcoming is an important protection.</p></speech>

My first point relates to an issue raised by Deputy Spring and leads towards a suggestion on something the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council could examine, but I do not know whether it will take me up on it.  We spoke about Keynes earlier, and a name rarely mentioned but which should be mentioned more in my opinion is Marx.  Marx made the point that along with the boom-slump cycle, the longer-term problem of capitalism is that the rate of return on investment on aggregate across the economy tends to decline, and when this happens pressure is brought to increase or maintain profit levels by driving down wages and extending working hours, and speculation begins so money begins to rush around places where people think they can make a higher return.  This relates to Deputy Spring's point on huge amounts of money sloshing around in the global economy in relatively few hands, lurching from place to place looking for a higher rate of return.  Generally, because of declining rates of profits in real industry and enterprise, people are risk averse to investing in the real economy.  Why take the risk of setting up an industry when one could make a quick return on buying cheap property in Dublin and jacking up rents knowing there is huge demand for property?  This is exactly what is happening.  To my mind there is over-financialisation of the global economy and the Irish economy.</p><p>  Something which I believe is an extension of this, and which has come sharply into focus recently as it has been highlighted by Mr. Piketty, is growing inequality.  An important point to make is that inequality becomes a drag on growth.  Growing inequality begins to undermine the dynamism of an economy.  Much money is concentrated in few hands, which are risk averse and afraid of real investment.  This inequality and the lack of demand produced among ordinary people who do not have any money to spend becomes at a certain point a significant drag on economic growth.  This is the space we are in and Mr. Piketty is absolutely right to identify it.  Should the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council examine inequality as a macroeconomic question and how it is a structural danger to the economy?  As politicians we are very concerned about the human impacts of inequality, but inequality is actually a serious drag on growth.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-19a.835" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor John McHale" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014061900018#S00900"><p>The Piketty work is extremely interesting and as a professional economist I have found much in it.  In some ways I see it a little bit differently to Deputy Boyd Barrett.  The relatively high rate of return on capital is emphasised.  One gets tendencies towards wealth divergences and greater wealth inequality, particularly when the gap between the rate of return on capital and the growth rate is high.  This is a little different from the analysis of Marx.  For the most part I would say it is not a matter for the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, even though it is something each of us as an individual economist could take on board.</p><p>  On the narrow question of whether inequality affects growth, given part of what we do is examining growth projections, it is relevant to the extent it enters in this way and to the forecast assessment exercise, but this is a much narrower idea than what the Deputy has in mind.  To be completely honest, such a level of discussion would be beyond the mandate of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, but we are all very much paying attention to the debate and it informs our review of the world as economists.</p><p>  We do not necessarily agree with everything in the Piketty book but he does an excellent job in documenting what is happening with regard to wealth inequality.  His basic point on the dynamics of the market economy could lead either to the convergence of incomes, which is done over a certain time period, or to divergence of income.  There is no guarantee a market economy would produce an equal economy and he is absolutely right on this.  There have been many critiques of some of the mechanisms on which he focuses.</p></speech>

This is something towards which he is pointing, and I agree that rapidly growing levels of inequality are a factor of instability in an economy.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, the meetings are much more focused on the mundane.  We listen to these debates and they inform the views which we bring to the more mundane issues with which we deal under a mandate.  This is not a particularly satisfactory answer.</p></speech>

It is a critical point.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council is a very small player but the issue has been raised.  Inappropriate fiscal policy has aggravated the bust-boom cycle, and in our small mundane way, as Professor McHale put it, at least if we can play our role in ensuring this part of the cycle is dampened, it is worthwhile.</p></speech>

I wish to make a point on inequality.  Deputy Boyd Barrett came at it from a demand side analysis, that it is bad for the economy to have many poor people who do not have money to spend.  I see it as more of a supply side issue.</p> <p>In a country where a lot of people are in poverty or in a sense are socially excluded, it means the talent pool represented by those people simply is not available to the economy in general.  One has a privileged group of people who by accident of birth are then in a position whereby they can capitalise on that accident of birth and do particularly well.  I always perceive inequality and its relationship with the sort of economic issues about which the Deputy is talking as having a more supply-side dimension.  One of the frightening things about the current recession is the extent that we have this big build up in people who became unemployed and the worry is that group will now become long-term unemployed.  There is both the human loss and an economic loss of their skills and talents.  Likewise, to the extent that schools and other places are being affected-----</p></speech>

Looking at the data, our best estimate last year was the value of those assets was approximately &euro;11 billion.  We did not make any recommendations on it and that is an issue for the Government.  We are really conscious of the focus on the deficit and the debt and have come back to it today a bit in respect of the &euro;2 billion.  However, there needs to be a broader focus on the Government's stock of financial assets, as well as its liabilities.  The Government has substantial assets, which I believe were valued at approximately &euro;80 billion at the end of last year, of which &euro;30 billion really is cash and deposits in these liquid balances.  However, the banks obviously had a very low value last year.  There has been good news this year and since we did our report, the value of the banks has improved and the Government has been able to make some money through Irish Life and Bank of Ireland.  However, we did not make any-----</p></speech>

However, contrary to some of the discussion, which may seem very negative in terms of where we are going, our basic analysis is that we have made great progress.  We faced very significant risks in the last couple of years and have managed to avoid some disasters and credit to the previous Government and the current Government for getting us to this point.  There are tentative signs of growth returning but there are uncertainties surrounding it.  Our basic message is that we are on the right track but there are a lot of risks and challenges.  It will require careful and forward-looking management, really focused more on the macroeconomics side, as Deputy Boyd Barrett said, as well as very good management in terms of the structural policies on the microeconomic side.  I do not want members to come away from this with a pessimistic message.  Essentially, our job is to worry about stuff and so we do but sometimes, it may sound as though we have only seen the downsides.</p></speech>

The council is proposing macro measures, from which very rich individuals and corporations are exempt, and it all falls on Deputy Spring's constituents, who want to know why.  While I acknowledge the OECD is examining this, it also is a complete waste of money in terms of sheltered sector activities.  This is rent seeking <i>par excellence</i>involving tax lawyers and accountants.  Again, I do not know how they are held to be some kind of heroes creating economic development.  I believe last Sunday's edition of <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>reported on &euro;480 million of tax breaks to make films.  Deputy Spring's constituents may have had many better uses for it, involving much more basic items in their budget.  A long time ago, Kenneth Carter in Canada proposed having a tax system in which a dollar is a dollar is a dollar and in which one does not have all these exemptions, allowances or rent-seeking lobbying in which one does not pay anything if one qualifies.  As the witnesses are aware, tax avoidance is a major industry and it distorts seriously the operation of fiscal policy in the way to which Piketty and others have drawn attention.<br />On the Irish Water issue, part of it was creative accountancy in that were this quango to be created, one could borrow money that would not appear in the national accounts.  It was a factor and I tried to amend the Bill in the Senate loads of times.  Members did not know what was the price or what would be the exemption and the generous free allowance remains unknown.  The best comment in this regard came from Ben Dunne, who stated that if he had a business in which 40% of the stock disappeared, he would not blame the customers.  That simply is what the water legislation was and it was entirely engineer-driven.  A much lower percentage of households in the United Kingdom have meters.  We took &euro;600 million out of the pension fund for metering, for which I believe the comparable figure in the United Kingdom is 40%.  However, ordinary economics in those kinds of resource allocations still does not have any impact, which is rather worrying.  Putting in the meters became the goal, rather than the 40% waste, loss or whatever it is.<br />On housing, I have a brief observation on somewhere close to Professor McHale's area.  In Tuam recently, apartments were sold at &euro;20,000.</p> <p>We know the bubble, if it appears in Galway, will be at Taylor's Hill.  It would not be a bad thing to spend &euro;20,000 and being able to commute to Salthill every day.  One would not be working for a bank or building society by paying inflated prices.  Are we keeping empty houses on ghost estates up and down the country because they look better at asset prices in bank accounts rather than letting the price fall and using low house prices as a way of developing the economy or encouraging people to commute from high-price house zones to low-price zones?  People commute in all other countries, and half an hour would be regarded as mild for a commuting time in New York, for example.  Have we created this position by keeping houses off the market to make bank balance sheets look better?</p></speech>

Somewhat facetiously I could say that legislators make the tax code rather than the fiscal council so members may wish to think about that.  International competition has made it more difficult for legislators, as well as pressure from outside.  Much progress is being made through the OECD and G20 base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, initiative, which I understand is progressing.  There will be significant announcements at the Brisbane summit in November, and I hope that will make legislators' jobs easier.</p></speech>

I will take up Deputy Spring's comments about the realities and aggregates in lever-arch files containing informing and advising documents and papers, etc.  Will the council be more radical, adventurous and courageous in dealing with matters affecting the 4.5 million citizens living in this country, with at least 1.5 million having had their lives ripped apart.  My question is whether the council can be braver and more radical.  Mr. Barnes indicated that we are legislators who make the tax code, and the OECD and G20, among others, are thinking about these matters, moving forward and deliberating on issues.  We are moving into fog.</p><p>  In the immediate interim we can say that companies report profits at approximately &euro;75 billion per year, 10% of which is &euro;7.5 billion and 6% of which is approximately &euro;4.5 billion.  That is a big uplift from what is actually paid.  We are all for debating, discussion and considerations but in the meantime there are 1.5 million people comprised of 390,000 people who are long-term unemployed and 170,000 households or 500,000 people in deep mortgage distress, with an estimated 30,000 households where grandparents are using savings to prevent mortgages going into distress.  I know that is happening.  There are also 90,000 families or 275,000 citizens and souls on the housing waiting list.  Fr. Peter McVerry has stated it is disgraceful that 5,000 people are sleeping on the streets.  This is the stuff that does not appear in the cover letter of the German-Irish Chamber of Commerce, which sent us a book.  It is in both German and English, and it had a self-congratulating cover letter outlining the "marvellous success" of the recovery programme to date.  What country is it talking about?</p></speech>

That is why I put forward my name three and half years ago to become a public representative.  I am not interested in the greasy bowl of politics.  I am interested that today the banking inquiry is kicking off.  It should already have been stated publicly that the committee will examine what happened with bank balance sheets.  That is objective evidence from 2001 to 2008, measured every six months, as every licensed deposit-taking institution has evidence of what its board - forget the executives - has done.  The boards direct the bank and they are the prudential fiduciary custodians of banks' financial engineering.  If railway bridges started to fall in Ireland, everybody would look to engineers to see why it happened, taking in loads and distances between pillars.  The same process should occur with balance sheets, as the evidence exists that banks were out of control.  The domestic banking statistics rose from three times national income to five or nearly six times national income at 2008.  Bank of Ireland had &euro;61 billion of senior secured bonds on its balance sheet in 2008, so it was lending all its customer deposits.</p></speech>

This is the starting point.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council is composed of experts and the red carpet is thrown out to them, with doctors and professors hanging on its words.  There is a simple way for the 1.5 million souls to see the truth of what happened in the building of a massive credit Ponzi bubble scheme, with an asset price getting out of control.  The effect is measurable and, for example, Bank of Ireland is 75% culpable for the overall credit boom it allowed to happen.  That relates to its board of directors and auditors.  AIB is 72% culpable and the overall banking sector is 92% culpable.  One can get the figures, particularly the loan to deposit ratios of the overall sector and individually above the 90% prudential level.  That is measurable culpability but nevertheless, the banks are chasing everybody.  They are chasing the people in 170,000 households into suicide, illness, family break-ups etc., by insisting they collect 100% of the loans.  They created the bubble.</p><p>  All the banks, including AIB, the former Anglo Irish Bank, EBS, Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank and Danske, were licensed deposit takers and they broke the rules.  The people on the boards in 2001 should be assembled with their auditors and shown the evidence from the accounts.  That is not made up as the problem was caused by the banks.  We should see whether they would blush, blink or bow their heads.  That is what is needed.  We do not need any more from KPMG, PwC, Deloitte or Ernst &amp;amp; Young.  They have charged big money for pretty lousy reports.</p><p>  I do not enjoy saying this but the country must wash itself out.  The little Independent group of Deputies over the past few months has shone a light and brought power hoses in for the Garda and the justice system.  When the D&aacute;il met for the first time in 2011, they were laughed at because their fashion is different from the conventional and conservative establishment.  That establishment has caused 1.5 million people to have their lives ripped inside out.  Let us begin with objective balance sheets and by corralling the appropriate people.  At that stage we can look into the forensic bits and pieces.</p></speech>

I am very pleased to discuss the details of the Bill with the committee today.  I acknowledge the support expressed for this Bill on Second Stage from all parties and Independent Members in the D&aacute;il, when we had a very well-informed debate.  Deputies did qualify what they said in articulating some concerns about the Bill, which is perfectly understandable and legitimate.  At core there seems to be good support for this measure and I am grateful for that.</p><p>  The Bill will provide for a general practitioner, GP, service to be made available without fees to all children aged five years and under.  The key features of the Bill are: it provides an entitlement for all children aged five years and younger to a GP service without fees; it removes the need for children aged five years and younger to have a medical card or GP visit card under the general medical services, GMS, scheme to qualify for a GP service; it will also remove the need for many families with children aged five years and younger to be forced into the situation where they need to consider whether their child is &ldquo;sick enough&rdquo; to justify paying for a visit to the GP; it provides that the HSE may enter a contract with GPs for the provision of this GP service to children and provides that the Minister may set the rates of fees payable to GPs for this service.</p><p>  The Government is committed to introducing, on a phased basis, a universal GP service without fees for the entire population, as set out in the programme for Government and the future health strategy framework.  At present, just over 40% of the population can access a publicly funded GP service.  The balance of the population, almost 2.5 million people, must pay the &lsquo;market rate&rsquo; for a GP consultation, which is currently in the region of &euro;55 per visit.  There are a number of consequences of this situation: it deters some necessary medical care because it is generally recognised as unreasonable to expect an individual to make a good decision on what is necessary and what is unnecessary care.  Given the complexity of health issues and modern health treatments, an individual does not have the expertise to make a fully informed decision.  That is why the ability to attend a GP is so important as a gateway to accessing care in the health system.  This situation also works against increasing and enhancing the role of primary care and preventative care.  It is difficult for a person to justify spending money today on a GP visit for an issue that may or may not become serious at some point in the future.  Finally, it impedes the reorientation of our health system from a hospital focus to a primary and community care focus.  When this first phase is in place, approximately one-half of the population will be covered by a GP service without fees at the point of use.</p><p>  As announced in the budget, the Government has decided to commence the roll-out of a universal GP service for the entire population by providing all children under the age of six years with access to a GP service without fees.  It is important, however, to be clear that nothing will change for families who have, or are eligible for, medical cards, including those with children under the age of six.  They will continue to receive all of their medical card entitlements as normal.  There will be no change for them.  They will not be affected in any way.</p><p>  As recently as last Tuesday, the Minister for Health confirmed that the Government is committed to implementing the policy of universal access to GP services.  Additional earmarked funding of &euro;37 million was provided in budget 2014 to fund this first phase.  It is not funded on foot of savings implemented elsewhere in the health system.  The Government also announced earlier this week that an additional &euro;13 million will be provided to the HSE to meet the cost of reinstating discretionary medical cards. </p><p>  The 2013 report of the expert advisory group on the early years strategy recommended providing access to GP care without fees to all children in this age group.  There are good reasons to provide universal access to GP care in view of the health needs of the under-sixes age cohort.  The identification of health issues at an earlier age can mitigate or reduce the impact of ill-health later in life.  We should bear this in mind when the Growing Up in Ireland survey has reported that almost one in four children in Ireland are either overweight or obese, which is likely to lead to significant health issues later in life. </p><p>  I have stated before that I believe that we must move towards a health system based on universality of access, which must be sustainably funded to enable the provision of services to meet health needs.  It is important that we view this Bill as a stepping stone to a universal GP service.  I would like to see the rapid roll-out in successive phases of more GP coverage.  I would go so far as to say that I would not be as supportive of this legislation if the under-sixes' Bill were an end in itself.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and others have raised this issue.  This is a stepping stone; it is the first phase, not an end in itself.  If we, as public representatives, believe that as a society we should organise a universal GP service, I would argue that we should support this Bill as the first step towards the universal service. </p><p>  We should be clear that the policy objective is to have the entire population covered by a State-funded GP service.  A universal GP service is a vital building block of universal health insurance and the reform and restructuring of our health service.  A universal GP service will also complement the existing universal hospital system.</p> <p>The Government aims to achieve this objective by 2016.  Therefore, from an implementation perspective, my concern was to ensure that we roll out the universal service in the quickest and most efficient way.</p><p> Deputies will be aware that the Government originally intended to phase in the GP service, first, to those covered by the long-term illness scheme and, second, to those covered by the high-tech drugs scheme.  However, this did not prove to be the most expeditious approach.  First, a great deal of effort went into developing the proposal to base the first phase of the GP service on the LTI scheme.  On face value, it appeared to be a reasonable approach to say that people on the LTI scheme would get a free GP service.  However, the LTI scheme is somewhat anachronistic in its terminology.  It may have been necessary to clarify in legislation the medical conditions that were to be covered, in which case it would have been necessary to examine that choice of conditions with respect to a GP service.  There was also an inherent difficulty with basing the first phase of a universal GP service on whether a person was taking a prescription drug for a specific condition.  The largest condition covered by the LTI is diabetes.  Therefore, the initial approach would have provided a GP service to persons taking drugs to manage their diabetes, but not to persons who were managing their diabetes, without drugs, through lifestyle measures such as appropriate diet and exercise.</p><p> Therefore, a second approach was developed in which eligibility for a GP service would be based on a person having a particular chronic medical condition to be prescribed by the Minister for Health.  However, as work on a draft Bill was progressed, it became clear that the legal and administrative framework required to provide a robust basis for eligibility for a GP service based on having a particular medical condition was likely to be overly complex and bureaucratic for a short-term arrangement.  Relatively complex primary legislation would have been required in order to provide a GP service to a person on the basis of him or her having a particular illness.  The assessment system for such an approach would have to be robust, objective and auditable in order to have the confidence of the Oireachtas as well as of the general public.  This legislation would have to address how a person could be certified as having such an illness, and who could do this, and how to select the diagnostic basis for medical conditions.  As well as primary legislation, there would be a need for secondary legislation to give full effect to this approach for each condition. </p><p> On my appointment in October 2012 as Minister for State with responsibility for primary care, I examined the progress made in the universal GP care plan.  I was concerned that the first step was proving to be excessively complex and bureaucratic and that, ultimately, there was a significant risk that the entire universal GP plan would be delayed and perhaps delayed considerably.  While it would not be impossible to persist with the chronic medical condition approach, it would have taken several months more to finalise the primary legislation proposals followed then by the preparation of statutory instruments.  In my view, this would have entailed putting in place a cumbersome legal and administrative infrastructure to deal with what is only a temporary first phase on the way to universal GP service for the entire population.  Consequently, I recommended a more expeditious approach, which was approved by Government.  I believe that this current Bill will provide the basis for the progressive expansion of universal GP coverage to other age cohorts if that is the course chosen to develop the scheme.</p><p> I welcome the Government decision to develop a new policy framework of eligibility for health services to take account of medical conditions.  The HSE has established an expert panel to examine the range of conditions that should be considered as part of this process and the panel has been asked to make an early report to the Minister for Health.  While I do not wish to prejudge the deliberations of the expert panel and the consideration by Government, I would expect that a number of conditions will be identified that will further expand the coverage for GP services. </p><p> I wish to advise the committee that the Government intends to table a number of amendments on Report Stage.  The text of section 58C, which relates to the HSE entering into agreements with medical practitioners, is receiving further consideration and I may introduce some small amendments in this context on Report Stage.  It is intended to introduce an amendment to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 on Report Stage.  This is a technical amendment to the definition of "transferred assets" in that Act.  It is also intended, subject to the approval of the Government, to bring forward on Report Stage a number of amendments to the provisions of the Health Act 1970, in relation to residential support services.  The relevant provisions, namely sections 67A, 67C and 67D, were inserted into the Health Act 1970 by section 19 of the Health (Amendment) Act 2013.  The primary purpose of the intended amendments is to ensure that, in addition to those who are both accommodated and maintained by or on behalf of the HSE in the settings currently specified in section 67A, those maintained but not accommodated in those settings will also be required to make an affordable contribution towards the costs of their maintenance.</p><p> It is intended to bring forward an amendment to the Bill that would provide for an amendment to the Opticians Act 1956.  The background to this amendment is the plan, which is well advanced, to subsume the Opticians Board into the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, in accordance with the Government's programme of rationalisation of State agencies later this year or early next year.  The purpose of the amendment to the Opticians Act 1956, which currently regulates the professions of optometrist and dispensing optician, would be to change the election year of the Opticians Board from 2014 to 2015.  This would remove the requirement to hold elections to the board this year.  It would extend the terms of office of the current members of the board for up to one year until the regulation of the professions of optometrist and dispensing optician has been transferred to the amended Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.  The alternative would be to hold elections and appoint a new board in 2014 to hold office for a very short period, if at all.  The appropriate arrangements will be made for the amendments in advance of the Report Stage of this Bill, including an instruction to committee motion under Standing Order 131(2) to allow an amendment to the Bill. </p><p> I thank the Chairman for allowing me the latitude to outline the policy context of the Bill and I am happy to go through the details of the Bill and deal with any questions the committee may have.</p></speech>

I was one of the people who expressed a qualified and nuanced support for the legislation when it was discussed on Second Stage, in view of what has happened with regard to medical cards over the past two years.  While the Minister of State says that GP care for children under the age of six is a stepping stone towards universal primary health care the Minister of State should note that a person using a stepping stone should not put two big feet into the water.  I am afraid that is what the Government did when it decided to go down the road of the removal of discretionary medical cards.  I make that comment in the knowledge that I must outline my position.</p><p>  Universal health care should not be discussed as a Utopian abstract concept.  Universal GP services will cost money and it means that the money must be found from somewhere or else funding must be reduced in another health area.  People who are obese have had their gastric band surgery cancelled.  This is a death sentence for them.  While services and funding of services are listed by priority, we must be conscious that certain priorities need to be addressed before we can broaden the areas of universal health care.  The issue of discretionary medical cards is a case in point but in my view it is a very principled issue.  We cannot tolerate a situation where very old and very sick people are no longer prioritised in our health system.  What is left after looking after them should be disbursed to others.  Resources will always be finite and it will not be possible to fund every strand of the health services and therefore certain areas must be prioritised in a structured manner.  </p><p>  The Bill provides for ring-fencing &euro;37 million but that money is taken from somewhere.  There is no point in pretending that this money can be plucked out of the air or from anywhere other than the national accounts.  It is ring-fenced away from those who currently need it most because the resources are not sufficient to fund the discretionary medical card system.  This was evident in last year's Estimates.  As Fianna F&aacute;il said at the time, the probity exercise was a code for the pillaging and culling of discretionary medical cards.  This has been shown up by the Government's U-turn which I welcome.  It is unfortunate that the U-turn did not happen some time ago when the issue was highlighted by everyone in the House.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, refers to the unintended consequences of the discretionary medical card issue.  The only unintended consequence was that the Government lost a lot of council seats.</p> <p>That was the real unintended consequence, and as a result of it a U-turn was performed.  I am quite certain, however, that if Fine Gael and the Labour Party had enjoyed a good day at the local election polls, the so-called unintended consequences would have been allowed to continue and there would have been no U-turn on the withdrawal of discretionary medical cards.</p><p> We must have a genuine and comprehensive debate on the funding of our health service, including primary care and GP services, and prioritising access to ensure that those who need the services most and cannot afford them receive at least some assistance from the State over and above that afforded to persons who can afford them and do not need them as much.  The whole regime of discretionary medical cards should be expanded in such a way as to incorporate some element of humanity and compassion into our health system.  Where a person or family is visited by an extraordinary difficulty, even where the household in question can generally afford private health insurance and GP visits, the State must step in to offer support in a meaningful way.  That is what social solidarity should be about, as opposed to trying to be all things to all people.  The easiest thing for me to do, as an Opposition spokesperson, would be to say that the provision of free medical cards to the under sixes is a great idea but it should be extended to the under tens.  That is what a populist Opposition would do.  We realise that when there are finite resources, one must prioritise.  However, the fact that we are still counting the number of incontinence pads being given out in nursing homes while in the same breath talking about giving GP cards to people who may be on a huge income is a little difficult to understand.</p><p> A broader debate is required in the context of this Bill.  These proposals feed into the area of universal health insurance and are part of the Government's package to reform how we fund the health services and access to those services.  The difficulty I have is that the words we are hearing are very different from the actions we are seeing.  The Government must accept, just as it should have accepted there was a problem with discretionary medical cards, that there are inherent problems in primary care and with GP services.  The ostrich syndrome can no longer continue in the Department of Health and at ministerial level.  There is an inherent problem in the fact that GPs - highly qualified, professional people - are finding they can no longer contemplate working in this country and are choosing to go abroad.  The solution is not just about offering attractive remunerative packages; there is an array of problems in the system.  I urge the Minister of State not to deny this is an issue when the evidence is so clear.  We do not want to wake up one day and discover that all our GPs have gone to Canada or Australia while we are left scouring the Third World to find replacements to fill the vacuum.  That is not in any way being responsible either to our own people or to the people in other countries who also need GP services.  Why are we taking their best doctors while sending our own to other parts of the First World?  The Minister of State must accept that this Bill is building on a very perilous foundation, because primary care and GP services are in trouble.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-19a.887" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/969" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE12014061900004#C00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White.  The backdrop to our discussion is as inauspicious as anybody could ever imagine.  I have always been willing to accept that the universal roll-out of free GP care should be done in a programmed way.  As I have argued repeatedly, it must be introduced in a timeframed fashion, with a clear understanding by citizens of what is being done, which will, in turn, increase the potential for general population acceptance.  I have been willing to play my part in encouraging that acceptance across the board.</p><p>  However, the timing of the Government's initiatives in this regard has been terrible.  Simultaneous with the proposal for the roll-out of a free GP care entitlement to all children under the age of six has been a very proactive targeting of people with discretionary medical cards based on medical need rather than the simplistic assessment that applies across the board of ability to pay.  The discretionary mechanism is reflective of the fact that particular medical needs impose additional and quantifiable burdens on individuals and families.  The extent of the hurt and anguish caused by this targeting is palpable.  We have reflected it time after time in this committee room, in the D&aacute;il Chamber and by every other means open to us.  Until this week, however, there has been a persistent denial by the Government, despite all the evidence, of what is happening.  I have concluded that we should have elections more often because they are a powerful wake-up call for the parties in government.</p><p>  The situation in regard to discretionary medical cards has made the position of Government in respect of the particular proposition in this Bill very difficult.  It has made it equally difficult for those of us in opposition who are willing to consider and facilitate measures which can ultimately deliver something that will not only be welcome but will most certainly be in the public interest and for the public good.  Free access to GP care is an essential and integral building block towards a universal health care roll-out, which is what I want to see achieved in my time in this institution.  However, I cannot be confident at this point in time that it will be achieved.  The handling of all of these matters has been absolutely atrocious.</p><p>  In his opening remarks, the Minister of State said: "[M]y concern was to ensure that we roll out the universal service in the quickest and most efficient way."  I am up for that, but I need him to say this morning what this statement translates into at this point in time, according to his understanding.  There is nothing efficient about the way in which all of these matters have unfolded.  While the proposition contained in the Bill is laudable of itself, the backdrop - a backdrop created by the Government - has been deplorable.</p> <p>The Minister of State also said "I believe that this current Bill will provide the basis for the progressive expansion of universal GP coverage to other age cohorts."  I am concerned by the fact that the Minister did not say it would be extended to all cohorts.  The use of the term "other age cohorts" indicates that the policy in this regard is piecemeal.  I want to know what will be the final position and I need - and members of the general population have a right - to understand what is the timeframe in respect of this matter.  That is absolutely essential.</p><p> In the context of the backdrop, I have a few short questions.  At issue here are families with dependent children up to six years of age.  Many of those families previously held medical cards and were among the cohort who lost those cards in the course of the discretionary medical card review process.  For a variety of reasons, but primarily because such was the focus of Government intent in respect of probity, they did not fulfil all of the requirements involved and, therefore, they do not tick the box relating to the second criterion laid down by the Government, and articulated yesterday by John Hennessy, director of primary care, on "Morning Ireland", with regard to qualification for the restoration of their medical cards under the decision announced by the Cabinet on Tuesday.  Among the people to whom I refer, there will be those who will not tick all the boxes when it comes to the three criteria and whose circumstances are more gravely serious than some who will have their cards restored.  In other words, their circumstances are going to be compounded by that restrictive decision.</p><p> I wish to inquire about those who applied for discretionary medical cards in the period 1 July 2011 to 31 May 2014.  As a result of the fact that the same criteria used during the review process were applied to them, their applications were refused.  The Minister's apology is fine, as is that of the Taoiseach.  However, those apologies do not correct the serious financial hit and hurt which people were obliged to endure during the period in question.  Cards are due to be restored to more than 15,000 people who previously held them.  However, had matters been left as they were, those to whom I refer would not have been obliged to carry a further financial burden at a time when they had no capacity to cope.  I ask that the Minister of State address these matters.  I am of the view that the reimbursement of those individuals and families must be a critical part of any package to be introduced.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-19a.890" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/960" speakername="S&eacute;amus Healy" time="09:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE12014061900005#D00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his presentation.  If we accept that this is the first step in the roll-out of universality of access to free GP care for the population, we need to know what is the overall plan, what will be the next stage, how many stages will there be and what will be the timescale involved.  The Minister of State indicated that this is a stepping stone to universality.  When one considers what has happened since the Government came to office, one realises the unfortunate and sad fact that we have been moving in full reverse away from universality.  The Minister of State will say that there are more medical cards now than ever before.  That is true but it is due to the fact that large numbers of people have lost their jobs, that there have been huge cuts to people's living standards and that there have been massive wage reductions.</p><p>  It is obvious that there has been a very serious move away from universality, particularly if one considers what has happened during the past two and a half years.  The position with regard to discretionary medical cards is a very good example in that regard.  Huge numbers of people have lost their discretionary cards.  Even with the proposals that have emerged in recent days, approximately 15,000 people who lost their cards are still not going to have them returned.  These are people who, as a result of the massive pressure on them, did not pursue reviews.  Those in question are entitled to have their cards returned.</p><p>  Another issue which arises is that which relates to new applicants.  How will the applications of individuals whose circumstances are similar to those who are going to have their cards returned be dealt with between now and the submission of the new panel's recommendations some time next year?  There is also the question of refunds.  People who lost their discretionary cards have been obliged to shoulder significant costs.  Many have been paying &euro;142 per month for drugs for months or even years and &euro;50 to their GPs for each visit.  These are significant costs for families which are not in a position to bear them.</p><p>  The eligibility thresholds relating to medical cards have been deliberately reduced.  In addition, the Minister withdrew the provision whereby the first &euro;50 in respect of travel expenses could be offset against one's medical card.  The latter was particularly important for people who live in rural areas and who do not have access to transport.  Individuals in many parts of my constituency and others throughout the country are now obliged to pay the first &euro;50 in respect of transport costs.  The Minister also withdrew the offset in respect of home improvement loans.  In the past, if one improved one's home by adding on a downstairs bedroom, shower and toilet for a sick relative or close family member, there was provision to offset moneys in respect of repayments on whatever loan one obtained.  That is no longer the case.  What we have seen in recent times represents a reversal of any progress that had been made towards universality.  Another matter which arises in that regard relates to the huge reductions in the limits - from &euro;1,400 to &euro;900 for a couple and from &euro;700 to &euro;500 for an individual - relating to the elderly during the past three years.</p><p>  As the Minister of State well knows, I and many other Members of the Oireachtas have been raising the issue of the difficulty relating to discretionary medical cards for the past two and a half years.  Our concerns simply were not listened to.  I want the Minister of State to deal with another issue I have been raising on an ongoing basis in recent years with the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and the other Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  I refer to GPs charging for the taking of blood samples.  The Minister wrote to me to indicate that this is illegal and I asked him to pursue the matter with GPs.  A huge burden is being placed on people on fixed incomes who are obliged, on a weekly basis, to pay anything up to &euro;25 for the taking of blood samples.  The Minister indicated that this practice is illegal but he is allowing it to continue.</p> <p>I ask the Minister of State to pursue the matter to the very end because it is a huge burden on ordinary people on fixed incomes, especially elderly people on State pensions of &euro;230 per week.  If it means having the Garda visit GP practices, that should happen.  I hope the Minister of State will respond positively to the suggestion because if he does not take cognisance of the matter, it will become as big an issue as discretionary medical cards.</p></speech>

Putting in good foundations at that age will stand to them for the rest of their lives.  That is the strong reason for supporting the Bill.  I found it very hard to listen to the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson, given the many opportunities Fianna F&aacute;il had to do something about the matter.  There is a very strong case to be made for looking after children up to the age of six years, as it would help to prevent problems arising.  The majority of visits to GPs are made by people with small children and the elderly.  The aim of the proposed change is to look after people's health.  I strongly support the Bill.</p></speech>

The Minister of State indicated in the course of his address that he was considering other amendments to be introduced on Report Stage.  This is a very frustrating process where Deputies endeavour to improve legislation and because we are on the Opposition benches we are precluded from doing so on the basis that a proposed change involves a potential charge on the Exchequer.  I appeal to the Minister of State, in the context of the Minister's momentary acceptance of my amendment which passed all too quickly, to reflect prior to Report Stage on what it is intended to achieve.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-19a.924" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1177" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE12014061900006#E03300"><p>In the context of the amendment that has been disallowed, I urge the Minister of State to examine the matter again in advance of Report Stage.  He has already indicated that it is his intention to introduce legislation within the next 12 months to facilitate a provision similar to that outlined by Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in covering all sections of the population over the age of six years.  The amendment would be restrictive in that it would focus on those under the age of 18 years with congenital conditions or ongoing serious conditions.  The Minister of State recently met the Jack &amp;amp; Jill Children's Foundation and the same argument was made to him.  In light of the fact that such a measure will be introduced for the whole population in the next 12 months - the report will be presented by the expert group in September - will he make provision within the legislation dealing with medical cards - at a minimum for GP-only cards - for children under the age of 18 years to be the first to receive access to the new initiative?  If we introduce the primary legislation, he could introduce such a measure by regulation in September once the report from the expert medical group is available.</p><p>  Will the Minister of State clarify something he said in the context of the section?  He said he would not introduce a medical card based on medical condition because it would be seen as too cumbersome and that there would be no point in introducing it in the short term if, in the not too distant future, universal access was provided for.  Is that not the purpose of the expert medical group that will report in September, namely, to introduce medical cards on a temporary basis, pending the provision of permanent access to GP care?</p></speech>

The Minister of State might clarify that point.</p><p>  Finally, the Minister of State has stated that he intends to bring forward an amendment in respect of the nursing home support scheme.  I also intend to table an amendment on Report Stage in that regard because I believe that where someone is eligible for the nursing home support scheme, he or she should have an alternative to remain in the community, rather than being forced into a nursing home.</p></speech>

It is not a matter for me but for the Chairman.  However, I have considerable sympathy, certainly in principle, for the issue raised by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and commented on by Deputy Naughten.  I have met a number of groups, including representatives of the Our Children's Health campaign with whom I had a very good meeting two weeks ago, at which we discussed and debated this issue.  The Government has decided to develop a new policy framework of eligibility for health services to take account of medical conditions but this pertains to eligibility for health services in the broadest sense and is not confined to free general practitioner, GP, care.  The expert panel and the process to which the Government intends to give consideration will relate to the broad scope of services and will not be confined to GP services.  However, the Bill being debated today pertains to the extension of GP services to the entire community by 2016 in the context of the commitment in the programme for Government.  Whereas the two things are not unconnected - I will not suggest to Deputy Naughten they are completely unconnected - they are two separate strands on which members must be clear.</p><p>  When I told the sub-committee earlier that it became clear that going by way of chronic illnesses would be cumbersome, the point I was making was that if members all are serious about moving as quickly as possible to universal access to GP services, the quickest and more expeditious way of doing that would be to at least start by this interim approach by way of age cohort.  To take it at its simplest, none of this is particularly simple or simplistic, but if the criteria are that one is below a certain age and that one lives in the country, these are pretty straightforward conditions in order for somebody to qualify.  However, if the conditionality is more complex with regard to a condition, an illness and so on, merely on the face of it, that quite clearly is more difficult.  There is no doubt that while it is not impossible, it is more difficult.  It was on that basis that I asked what was the quickest route to achieving free GP care for the entire population and in my judgment, with which the Government agreed, it would be better to proceed in the way that I propose.</p><p>  However, the expert panel that has been established with regard to eligibility for broader health services will report in September.  It is an expert clinical panel to examine the range of conditions that should be considered as part of the process.  I do not wish to prejudge the work of the expert group.  The Government has already stated it will develop legislation as necessary resulting from that expert panel's deliberations and that will take place.  It would be inappropriate and I could not agree to seek to amend this legislation, either now or on Report Stage, because so doing would prejudge the work of the expert panel, which would be inappropriate.  However, I make the point to colleagues that there is more than an understanding of the issue the Deputy raises in the amendment that has been ruled out of order.  I can understand and am full of sympathy for the issue the Deputy raises and it will be addressed in the context I have mentioned.  Meanwhile, what is being developed here is the implementation of a GP service without fees for the entire population.  This is a stepping-stone, as I described it earlier.  This is what it is intended to be and I again emphasise that were it simply just a once-off or a stand-alone measure, it would not have the merit I believe it has as a first phase of a population-wide scheme.  I make this point in good faith through the Chairman to the Deputies.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and the other members have raised this issue before and I say in good faith that I ask them to take my bona fides and that of the Government because this is the intention.  The programme for Government commitment is to implement GP services without fees for the entire population.  As for the future phasing, what will happen next and what are the main components therein, the first step is the legislation I will respectfully be asking the Houses to pass.  The second is an engagement with the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, which now is possible because in recent weeks, I have agreed a framework with the IMO to facilitate a real engagement and negotiation on these matters, which was not in place heretofore.  It was either in 2006 or 2008 when the Competition Authority intervened in this whole area and since then, there essentially has been a stand-off between the State and the representatives of the GPs regarding a basis for negotiation, discussion and so on.  That problem now has been cracked.  While we do not have an agreement on the actual content of the work the Government hopes people will undertake, at least there is now a basis for people to have discussions and hopefully to agree.  This is a further thing that has been achieved in recent weeks.</p><p>  The final aspect about which Deputies Healy, &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and others asked is where does one go after the under-sixes.  This is a perfectly legitimate question that I would love to be able to answer fully today.  I cannot but what I will say - the Government repeated this again this week -  is that by September, a comprehensive paper is to be submitted to the Government outlining the future steps and phases of the roll-out of free GP care.  The Government and I are absolutely determined that the aforementioned paper will be prepared, completed and agreed at or about the same time as the other work that is being conducted with regard to the separate but connected area of the expert panel.  This has been incremental and has been slower than I would have liked.  Many things in the current Government have happened more slowly than many of us on the Government side would have liked but progress has been made in this regard.  It is in that context that I seek the support of colleagues for this legislation.  It is a stepping stone that will be followed by a paper in September with regard to the future roll-out.  It also will be followed, I hope, by meaningful engagement and negotiations with the IMO to actually implement the scheme.</p></speech>

However, there is no doubt but that the initial flagged intention of the roll-out of free GP care for all aged under six years of age in the course of this year is slowly but certainly moving more distant from our grasp.  This is happening to the point that in the media this week, there has been speculation that the moneys set aside in the health budget for the current year as a provision for this particular area of entitlement now will not be employed at all in the current year.  People are linking this with the expected cost of the restoration of discretionary medical cards and the &euro;13 million involved there.  Would the Minister of State like to indicate whether there is a connection?  Is that where his eye is cast with regard to the restoration of the 15,300 medical cards?  He should give members a sense of the position in this regard as from my perspective, that would be unfortunate.  I still hold to the initial premise and still am willing to work with the Minister of State towards a much more concrete understanding of the intended roll-out, which is what I seek.  It is still too unspecific but I will stay the course for now at least.  Nevertheless, I would be grateful to hear whether he has anything to add.  I understand the engagement with the IMO is still pending and I understand the difficulties this might present.</p></speech>

I understand the context of the Minister of State's observations regarding the medical review by the expert group that is taking place.  Surely, however, it would make sense to make provision in this legislation, at least in the short term, for those children under the age of 18 who fall into whatever medical categories are highlighted by the aforementioned expert group.  As an initial stage, they could be given free GP access.  Members could make provision in this Bill that would allow for a statutory instrument to be introduced by 1 October to facilitate this measure in the short term and deal in some way with the hardship it has caused to families.</p> <p>The Minister of State might consider this prior to Report Stage.</p></speech>

For example, if we were to consider in the context of the Bill a provision that referred to a serious illness or a serious congenital condition, we would be immediately embroiled in definitional issues, making determinations as to which illnesses and conditions were and were not to be included and, more importantly, on who should decide and on what basis they should do so.  This is the problem we always have to address, that there is always a selection involved.  That is one of the reasons I am a universalist.  Ultimately, a person should not have to apply for health services and prove that he or she is sicker than someone else or that he or she has a long-term as opposed to a short-term condition, or that he or she will or will not recover.  This dogs services and is one of the reasons I am a universalist.  If we were to go down the road of providing for serious illnesses, serious congenital conditions and addressing the question of aftercare services, the criteria to be used, etc., we would be embroiled immediately in complexities and there is no way we would be able to do this without at least the assistance of the expert panel that we have asked to look at these issues and, ultimately, looking at the legislative basis for selecting some and not others.  I will not be in a position to agree to an amendment to the Bill along the lines suggested by the Deputy, but I hope he hears from me that there is an absolute appreciation of the issue he is raising and the need for it to be accommodated in the system.  I agree completely with him in that regard, but it will not be possible to accommodate the amendment in the Bill.</p><p>  I thank Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in for stating he will "stay the course for now at least."  That is fair and reasonable and I thank him for what he stated in good faith.</p><p>  I emphasise that we cannot spend the &euro;37 million set aside this year until we have the scheme in place.  We must put it in place and then start to pay for services.  That is the way it happens.  We did say it would happen in June-July, but it will not.  However, I see every possibility that it will be implemented by the autumn.  That is a realistic prospect.  We have got the framework for negotiations and consultation with the IMO and I am hopeful they will get under way quickly.</p><p>  The figure of &euro;13 million agreed to this week for discretionary medical cards is separate.  It is not coming out of the pot of &euro;37 million, as I have made very clear.</p></speech>

Under existing contractual arrangements, where it is necessary for blood samples to be taken as part of the normal diagnostic process, the patient should not be charged.  That may not be sufficiently clear in the contract, which means that the new contract we want to agree with general practitioners will provide an opportunity for us to make crystal clear the circumstances that apply in the taking of blood samles.</p><p>  More broadly, Deputy Seamus Healy asked what services would be available.  In January we published a draft contract.  It is probably fair to say it is not something that found universal favour with doctors, but it sets out what the HSE believes should be the range of services provided under the new contract.  "It will be dealt with in the new contract," is the answer to the Deputy's question.  We will seek to reach an agreement with doctors on the services the HSE wishes to see provided under the new contract for which they will be paid a fee.</p></speech>

"Ordinarily resident in the State" is the phrase used for someone under the age of six years.  I ask the Minister of State to look at linking the Department's system with the child benefit system, as well as the database of the Department of Education and Skills and the early childhood care and education, ECCE, database in order that one would have an accurate record of who was resident in the State and we would not end up paying for medical cards for children not normally resident in the State.  There should be feedback between the four systems to ensure that if a medical card is not issued for a child under the age of six years because he or she is not ordinarily resident in the State, child benefit is not being paid for him or her.  There are databases in the Department of Education and Skill and as part of the ECCE scheme which are effective and if the Department had access to them, there would be less chance of failure in the alignment between the systems.  It might require an amendment to the Bill to access that information, but I ask the Minister of State to consider it prior to Report Stage to ensure we will not issue cards for children who are not resident in the State or do not exist.</p></speech>

If I am not mistaken, there were provisions in one or other of the statutes we passed last year for the over 70s, although they were not confined to them.  There should be a good exchange of data and I will consider the Deputy's point.  It would not require an amendment to the Bill to ensure such an exchange continued and was improved.  Sometimes we use terms such as "habitual residence" and "ordinary residence" which tend to be interchangeable, but they have different meanings.  Some agencies deal with issues to do with habitual residence and others with ordinary residence.  We must be conscious, however, that they are not exactly the same.</p></speech>

There is a sharing of data between the other agencies, but to the best of my knowledge, there is no such provision in the case of the medical card scheme.  It is my understanding that it would require a facilitating amendment to allow it to happen.  We are talking about the under sixes.  In the case of the over 70s, the ECCE scheme and the education system do not arise as an issue.</p></speech>

There are a few to which I referred earlier.</p><p>  In regard to GP practices, the emphasis in the 2001 primary care strategy document was on moving as many medical services as practical from the acute hospital setting to the primary care setting - GP surgeries and public health nurses - and providing care in the area where it was least complex at the least expense.  That is the accepted norm and practice, both in the document and among the various professional bodies which represent the medical profession.</p> <p>They would support that.</p><p> I raise this issue out of concern.  We have previously referred to the pressure GPs are under, with rural GPs closing and urban GPs beginning to find things difficult.  This legislation would throw into the mix many more consultations to be carried out under the GP contract for under-sixes.  How does the Minister envisage moving the treatment of chronic illnesses from the acute hospital setting to the community setting?  Although I do not expect the Minister of State to be able to answer this practical question now, has he considered this in terms of the development of primary care policy?  If we are to treat diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, arthritis and many other chronic illnesses in the GP surgery, there must be an acknowledgement that extra resources must be made available, because these illnesses are more complex than colds and flu.  I am concerned that GPs might refer people to the acute hospital setting because they are under pressure in their surgeries around the country.  Could the Minister expand on this?  I do not expect him to give all the details today.</p><p> Last week at a committee meeting, Mr. Liam Doran of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, said many of his members were afraid to report issues.</p></speech>

In the original contract there was the issue of GPs being unable to raise issues that might prejudice the good name of the HSE.  The word "oxymoron" may come to mind.  Why would there be such a curtailment?  While I can understand why a person would not be allowed to prejudice the name of something because they were unhappy in themselves, a doctor in his or her professional capacity could highlight deficiencies in service and support and patient safety compromises.  Has this been fully addressed in the context of the GPs' concerns?  Many public representatives were also concerned about it.  It was interesting that Mr. Doran said nurses on wards were afraid.</p></speech>

It is on the issue of contracts and whistleblowers.  If there is such pressure on people, maybe we should include a clause in legislation that would allow people to be confident if they have concerns, in view of the fact that they have to renegotiate contracts with the HSE at a later stage.  That is what I find problematic.  A GP may see a deficiency in the service and a threat to patient safety.  The Bill states:<blockquote><br />(4) Regulations made under subsection (3) may prescribe different amounts or rates in respect of different services or in respect of the provision of services to different classes of eligible person.<br />(5) Prior to making regulations under subsection (3), the Minister or, at the Minister&rsquo;s direction, the Health Service Executive, shall engage in such consultations as the Minister considers appropriate.</blockquote>The problem is that a GP, a group of GPs or a region of GPs who are in dispute with the HSE over an issue such as patient safety or lack of resourcing are expected to negotiate contracts with the same people.  There could be a conflict of interest on both sides because the HSE could be vindictive if it felt certain GPs were creating difficulties.  We need to explore this area because we should never discourage people from coming forward if they see patient safety being compromised.  Although we ration health on a daily basis in this country, as in every other country, there should be no rationing of resources for patient safety.  I am concerned about it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-19a.954" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1024" speakername="Alex White" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE12014061900009#H00600"><p>One of the things we must do to make primary care work is to provide universal access to GP services.  While I do not want to paraphrase or misrepresent anything Deputy Kelleher said in his earlier contribution, it is not entirely clear to me whether he agrees with a universal health care system.  I am not trying to provoke an argument but to have the debate he said we should have.  There will never be a perfect time for us to begin to implement a universal system.  If we remove fees for people on low and middle incomes it will be good for them because they will not have to pay to go to the doctor, for all the reasons we know about.  However, it has been shown that the barrier of fees prevents even relatively better off people from seeing their doctor.  They have other priorities and do not attend.  I have read lots of material that demonstrates this.<br />If one has a universal primary care system whereby people stay in the community and do not go to hospital, one must incentivise people to use it.  The requirement to shell out &euro;50 or &euro;55 is a fundamental aspect of that.  We want to eliminate the commercial barrier between people and their doctors or the primary care service and ensure they come into primary care and stay there as long as they can, unless they need to be referred to the acute services for a clinical reason.  All the evidence shows that GP services without fees is the fundamental bedrock of developing primary care.<br />Deputy Kelleher and others often raise concerns about equity, comparing, for example, a child aged five whose parent is a D&aacute;il Deputy and can well afford medical bills with other people.  We could have a longer political debate, but equity issues regarding access to services should be determined by how people pay generally into the system, for example through taxation or insurance.  We should have a pre-paid approach to health and we should all pay based on our ability to do so.  Although everybody here should have to pay more into the system because we earn more, the system should be available equally to everybody, and the only criterion for somebody to use the health service should be whether they are ill and need it or not, including the preventative strategy.<br />Sometimes free GP care is presented as a sop or a political stunt.  It is far from that.  It is an essential prerequisite of a functioning primary care system.  We are an outlier in the OECD and Europe in charging people &euro;50 to &euro;60 to see their doctor.  It is a brake on developing primary care, and that is why we should provide free GP care.  Let us deal with equity through the other policy instruments available to Governments, such as taxation or insurance.<br />The other aspect, as Deputy Kelleher will say, is that the services must be there, and he is correct.  We are not resourcing primary care sufficiently and we need to resource it more.  We need to adjust and move the resources as soon as we can into the primary care sector, which will be difficult.  The Deputy's party was in government and saw how difficult it was, but it must be done.  Free GP care is the <i>sine qua non</i>of doing that.<br />Last year we introduced 250 to 260 new posts around the country, and that is critical.  We need more posts, such as speech and language therapists, physiotherapists and all the ancillary support services.  We need our primary care centres, and we are developing and opening them all the time, not just before the European and local elections but also after them.  Recently, I opened primary care centres in Blanchardstown and County Meath.  Last week, I opened one in Schull, County Cork.</p> <p>These are fantastic and really superb services in the community.  They are providing excellent GP and ancillary elements in the community, and in practical terms we are pulling such services into the community and away from the acute setting.  That is what we must do.  Of all the areas of public policy, this is one on which we should co-operate across parties.  The Deputy's party introduced the strategy in 2001 and much of that document is still extremely valid, although it must be updated in some areas and some aspects may need significant work.  There have also been new developments that will help us accelerate what we need to do in primary care.  No matter what party or individuals are in Government in future, there will be no answer to the proposition that a developed primary care system is the only way we can address the increasing demands on health services, the aging population and chronic illness problems.</p><p> Contract engagement was the second issue raised.  There is no way I would stand over any provision in a contract that would constitute a brake on people raising issues to do with patient safety or related matters.  There has been an objection to one aspect of the draft contract, which we will discuss with the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, and resolve properly.  I could not stand over that.  I hope the Deputy did not intend to suggest that people would be vindictive.  Knowing the leadership in the HSE for patient safety and elsewhere as I do, I know it is absolutely a priority for the HSE to maintain and protect patient safety.  I would not for a moment stand over any suggestion to the contrary.  We all want to achieve that goal and there is no question of a conflict between wanting to have a contract in place on one hand and ensuring that people are free to voice concerns they may have about a service they directly witnessed or which occurs across a spectrum of work.  We will address the issue of the so-called gagging clause in the discussions with the IMO and I am confident that we will reach agreement on it.  I agree with the Deputy's sentiment.</p></speech>

I made a point about Mr. Liam Doran of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, who stated clearly at a committee meeting that his members felt reluctant in - and were sometimes fearful about - raising issues of concern in this country's hospitals.  That would be a concern, by extension, if GPs are in negotiations about contracts, as they may be reluctant to put forward concerns as well.  I am just bringing the matter to the Minister of State's attention and I am not making any wild allegations or casting aspersions on individuals or organisations.  We should be conscious of the issue so that down the road we will not have a GP saying to the Minister of State, me or anybody else that he or she wished an issue had been raised but there was a reluctance to do so.</p></speech>
