In other business, I see the committee sought a note in respect of accommodation for a Probation Service project, which is fine, as well as a note on the causes of cases initiated by the special investigations unit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I am unsure what this is about.</p></speech>

The committee was then told that the costs of those cases were being dealt with by the Chief State Solicitor's office.  We have sent a request to the Chief State Solicitor's office to provide us with a breakdown of those costs and, in particular, for those cases that went nowhere but which were terminated for one reason or another.  We then agreed to hear from a number of individuals who had the experience of dealing with the Department in a number of these cases that have been dealt with.  While we have not yet set a date, we have been in contact with quite a number of them and as soon as they are available, on a date that is suitable to the committee, we will invite them in.</p></speech>

Item 3 is correspondence received since our meeting on Thursday, 5 January 2015.  There is correspondence from Mr. Brian Fitzgerald, CEO of St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, regarding allowances paid to senior hospital staff.  It is to be noted and published.</p> <p>  There is correspondence dated 12 December 2014 from Mr. Harry Lawlor regarding Shannon Development, units 6 and 7, County Limerick.  It is to be noted that there is clearly contradictory evidence being given to the committee.  At this stage, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation should be asked to review the complaints made by HL Commodity Foods and provide a note to the committee on the matter.  I had understood when we raised this at the previous meeting, with Shannon Development, that it was to come back to us with a complete breakdown of exactly what transpired between all the parties concerned.  We asked those concerned for a response to the issues raised, particularly the very worrying issues raised by HL Commodity Foods.</p></speech>

That is the issue so I believe we have to get a response and, if necessary, talk to both parties again.</p> <p>  There is correspondence from Mr. Paul Clegg, acting interim CEO of Dublin Docklands Development Authority, giving us an update on the authority.  This is to be noted and published.</p></speech>

This is to be noted and published.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-12a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015021200002#B00800"><p>I will comment on that.  We have had a fairly thorough response from Mr. Waters on the new prison project proposed for Thornton Hall.  Clearly, a very large amount of money - over &euro;50 million - was spent on the project, which never went ahead.  The reason for the project in the first place was that the Department had come to the conclusion that it could not provide in-cell accommodation in Mountjoy Prison.  In the meantime, over the past ten years, the in-cell accommodation has been provided.  The reason for the purchase in the first place was because the Department had come to a conclusion that it could not be provided.  Maybe necessity is the mother of invention.  That in-cell accommodation that could have been provided decades ago had not been provided must be borne in mind.  Now we have a white elephant that cost the State over &euro;50 million.  The reply from the Department is that it is now going to consider the matter and produce a report at some time, maybe in the summer.  It is very unsatisfactory in terms of the quantity of the taxpayers' money that has been spent, to absolutely no purpose.  The committee should reflect that in its response to the Department in relation to how it conducts its business.  There may be similar activities in which it has engaged that we are not aware of.  I put this down as a marker.  I am sure that is what the Comptroller and Auditor General has been doing all this time anyway.  Nevertheless, here is a very major project that really has been a waste of taxpayers' money.  A strong reply should come from the committee on Mr. Waters' statement to us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-12a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015021200002#B00900"><p>What is the Deputy requesting?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-12a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015021200002#B01000"><p>It has been clearly pointed out that, irrespective of the basis for the initiative, it was not progressed effectively to any stage over a ten-year period.  All that was provided was road access, resulting in extra expenditure.  The total expenditure is probably a lot more than &euro;50 million.  It is incredible, bearing in mind the purpose for which the site was purchased in the first instance, that it has now been shown that it was not necessary to engage in the process at all, because the in-cell accommodation has been provided.  Is anybody's hand going to be slapped over this matter?  How do we highlight something like this to a Department and embarrass it into not doing something of this nature again?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-12a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015021200002#B01100"><p>One cannot embarrass it; I found that out myself.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-12a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015021200002#B01200"><p>The Chairman does it pretty well.  I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General for his views.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-12a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015021200002#B01300"><p>My predecessor produced a report on the initial acquisition of the land.  This is probably the most complete description of the expenses incurred since the purchase, including purchases of additional land to provide a dedicated access road from the main road, as I understand it, and expenditure on development of the site.  It is something I intend to come back to at some point but I have no plan immediately to report on it.  It strikes me that if the Accounting Officer were before the committee, the matter could be probed by the committee.  That would be the standard operational procedure in relation to an expenditure line the committee is concerned about.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-12a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015021200002#B01400"><p>In the meantime, would it not be possible for the committee to write back to Mr. Waters to point out the contradictions in the activities that the Department has engaged in, and the total lack of justification for the expenditure of taxpayers' money?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-12a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015021200002#B01500"><p>The total sum is &euro;50.14 million.  Maybe we should go back to the Department as an exercise and ascertain how the decision was arrived at, who took the decisions and how the matter was analysed.  The Deputy asked whether someone will be sanctioned over this.  It is a reasonable question and the Department should be asked how this happened.  We should ask whether it was politically driven.  We know why what was being suggested was suggested but we should ask whether it occurred to no one in the Department that this might be the result.  That is the least we could do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-12a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1008" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015021200002#B01600"><p>I agree with that.  I do not know whether I took up the Comptroller and Auditor General correctly but he said he intends to return to this matter.  I presume there is nothing stopping this committee inviting people to discuss this subject in advance.  In fact, it might be a good contribution to the Comptroller and Auditor General's investigation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-12a.26" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015021200002#B01700"><p>That is correct, and it might obviate the need for me to investigate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-12a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1008" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015021200002#B01800"><p>We now have a white elephant, as people have said.  The Department is obviously figuring out what it will do with the land.  I would like to know the position in this regard.  The land is an asset acquired by the State and it is not being used for anything.  It is serviced land and has cost a fortune.  What is the process in this regard?  Can something or anything be salvaged from the situation?  Who is part of the group?  What kinds of options are they looking at?  The committee could have quite a productive hearing on these points in order to take the matter further from where the Comptroller and Auditor General's predecessor left it by way of his report, and it could establish the extent of further costs and expenditure since that report's publication and the plan from here on out.</p></speech>

We will try to set an early date for that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-12a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015021200002#C00200"><p>At the end of the report there is an indication that they will be producing a report in the summer, so presumably they are doing some research or background examination on the issue.</p></speech>

It would be preferable to have them appear before the committee in advance so we can establish what they are doing, the methodology of what they are doing, who is doing it and how they are proceeding.  That is a better approach, rather than waiting for a fait accompli.</p></speech>

We understand that the Revenue Commissioners have recovered &euro;4.55 million by way of tax settlement.  I am anxious that we contact the Revenue Commissioners to ask them for a detailed briefing on these matters and that we then invite them to appear before the committee so we can examine the matters with them.  I wish to make that formal proposal.</p></speech>

It is a major scandal that over &euro;3 billion in the accounts of over 350 Irish citizens would be in a bank of this nature, which is very questionable in the manner in which it operates.  A similar situation has transpired in Britain, where over 1,000 British citizens were in the same situation.  HM Revenue and Customs have collected approximately &pound;135 million in that country.  The small amount that appears to have been collected is causing major issues.</p> <p>  The Revenue Commissioners would have had access to the information almost five years ago and have operated in private in all the investigations that have taken place.  We do not know the extent of the investigations.  We know the extent of the findings, which is that 22 account holders produced &euro;4.5 million.  That is from 350 clients and over &euro;3 billion in cash.  One is the subject of a criminal investigation.  I understand there is also only one criminal investigation in the United Kingdom.  In addition, this bank, HSBC, has over 500 subsidiaries which are largely in tax havens.  Has that been chased up?</p> <p>  There are major questions to be answered.  I agree that we should get a full and frank report on the matter and that we invite the Revenue Commissioners to appear before the committee on this issue.</p></speech>

Second, before we ask the Revenue Commissioners to appear before the committee we should ask them for the report and then make our decision.  The Revenue Commissioners have proven to be quite adept at dealing with tax evasion and tax avoidance over the past 20 years.  At least we should give them the opportunity to explain the issues.  It might not be the case that there is tax avoidance or evasion in some of these cases or that criminality is involved.  At the very least we should allow them to put together a briefing note for the committee before we make a decision about a public hearing.</p></speech>

They have to make clear to us the number of account holders, the number investigated by the Revenue Commissioners for suspicion of tax evasion, the number who have been prosecuted, the settlements and the amount involved, including penalties, the resources that were dedicated to examine HSBC and include a note on the way in which the information was obtained in the first place.  All of that is relevant information that should be sought by the committee, because there is a need to clarify matters for the general public who have simply read the reports in the newspapers.  It says something about the work of public accounts that the Public Accounts Committee in the UK is meeting to discuss this issue and it has staff from HM Revenue and Customs appearing before it.</p> <p>  I agree with seeking the report.  However, when the news broke initially there might have been a letter from this committee or, perhaps, it should have been a proactive approach by the Revenue Commissioners to say, "This is what we have done.  We know you might be concerned about it", and to set the case out before us.  When the Clerk of the Committee writes to the Revenue Commissioners he should say that we need this information as soon as possible.  The information has been compiled over the last number of years, although it has only become public now, so it should be to hand.  They should send us a comprehensive report on the matter as soon as possible.  If it could be done within a week, which I believe it can, we could deal with it at our meeting next Thursday and decide after that.</p> <p>  Do members wish to raise any other business?</p></speech>

On a previous occasion I raised the issue of economic and social rights and building them into the budgetary and forecasting procedures and value-for-money assessments.  It is something Amnesty International and other organisations are pressing for and it increasingly has currency internationally.  In fact, the Constitutional Convention considered the matter of economic and social rights in the Constitution and looked favourably on the proposal, so it is a matter that is very much in the political mix in this State as well.</p> <p>  It is not on the work programme to have a hearing on these issues but I wish to press the issue again.  The reason is that when we scrutinise spending we do so on the basis of value-for-money considerations and judgments, transparency and so forth.  However, there is another layer of considerations in the spending and allocation of resources and they are binding on a Government in this State.</p><p>They concern economic and social rights and, as a committee, we need to develop an understanding of them.  I reiterate to the Chairman and to the committee that I believe it would be a worthwhile exercise to invite in, for example, Amnesty International and other organisations to familiarise ourselves with those concepts and that approach.  I appreciate that is not on the cl&aacute;r and that it will not happen this side of Easter. </p></speech>

Normally there might be donations that come to a foundation, which could alternatively have come directly into the university.  One normally expects the flows to come from donors into a foundation and then into the college.  What is different here is that the resources of the college were put outside the college into a foundation.</p></speech>

Once it comes into the college it then forms parts of the funds available to it.  As to whether one can say that if there are top-ups, it was the donation that funded the top-up, to me, that is splitting hairs.  If one has moneys in one's general account and expenditures out of that general account, it forms one fund effectively.  All sources of funds effectively then are applied pro rata in the same way.</p></speech>

Many people would give generously to different research facilities and they would prefer not to have the source of such funding made available.  The heads of faculties would be engaged in research and development and would earmark funding from high-tech companies and so on.  Is it the Comptroller and Auditor General's intention to audit those as well?</p></speech>

Very often donations are given for a specific purpose.  It could be that they are ring-fenced for the construction of a particular building.  Sometimes that comes with a requirement that it be acknowledged in the name of the building and or it may be that the donation is anonymous and the donor does not want to be acknowledged.  All that can be catered for in proper sets of financial statements.  One can have restricted reserves when they come in from a donor.  The concern I would have would be that if the members, as legislators, are looking at the financial statements, they should understand what resources the college has available to it.  If it controls the foundation, under the standard accounting procedures, the expectation would be that it would consolidate the resources into the other resources of the university.  If a foundation is not controlled by the university and is independently raising funds to apply or donate to the university at a time of their choosing, then there may be a case for holding them separately.  We look at the situation as it exists in law and we try to ensure that where consolidation is appropriate that consolidation is done and we see the full picture.</p></speech>

The Department and the HEA have made the point that they regard foundations as being something that is very important and we do not disagree with that.  What we are concerned about is that the accounting for it is consistent with standard accounting practice and that is what we push on an individual basis with colleges and in general with the HEA.</p></speech>

In pursuit of those objectives, Enterprise Ireland provides direct financial support to companies in the form of development grants and equity investments.  It also promotes research and development activity in Ireland by funding projects involving collaboration between industry and third level education institutions, and focused on realising the commercial potential of research.</p> <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s main source of income is in the form of Oireachtas grants paid out of the Vote for the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  In 2013, these totalled &euro;279 million - down from &euro;290 million in 2012.  In addition, Enterprise Ireland administered grant funding amounting to &euro;11.2 million on behalf of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Education and Skills.  It also generated &euro;10.8 million in income from refunds of financial support, returns on its investments, rental of industrial property and professional fee income.</p> <p>  In 2013, Enterprise Ireland incurred expenditure of &euro;263 million.  This included &euro;92 million on grant assistance for science and technology development, &euro;51 million on company development grant assistance and indirect support, &euro;35 million on grant funding to the county and city enterprise boards, business innovation centres and the Crafts Council of Ireland, and &euro;81 million on administration costs, including a pay bill of around &euro;58 million.</p> <p>  Enterprise Ireland holds a significant investment portfolio.  At the end of 2013, its equity investment portfolio spanned more than 1,000 mainly unquoted companies, with a net book value of &euro;152 million.  It also had significant holdings managed through its seed and venture capital fund with a net book value of &euro;118 million.  Enterprise Ireland carries out annual impairment reviews on both equity investments and seed and venture capital funds.</p> <p>  The financial statements for 2013 received an unqualified opinion.  Since the balance sheet date, the county and city enterprise boards have been dissolved and replaced with a network of local enterprise offices, based in local authorities.  On the dissolution of the enterprise boards, their assets and liabilities were transferred to Enterprise Ireland.  I plan to examine that transfer in the context of the audit of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s financial statements for 2014.</p> <p>  The primary role of IDA Ireland is to attract foreign direct investment to Ireland, including encouraging already established foreign-owned companies to invest further here.  It does that by promoting Ireland as an attractive location to potential investors, through the payment of grant aid in appropriate cases and through the development of industrial property which is readily available for use by potential investors.</p> <p>  The IDA received State grants of around &euro;129 million in 2013.  Its other income included profits on the disposal of assets, grant refunds and rental income.  In 2013, the IDA incurred expenditure of &euro;147 million, including &euro;88 million in grants to enterprises in support of research and development activity, capital investment, employment and training, just under &euro;32 million spent on pay, administration and general expenses, &euro;9 million spent on marketing, consultancy, promotions and advertising and just under &euro;5 million on expenses related to the property portfolio.</p> <p>  At the end of 2013, the IDA&rsquo;s property portfolio had a net book value of approximately &euro;100 million.  The IDA revalues property based on reviews carried out internally or by independent valuers, as appropriate, where there are indications that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  The impairment charge in 2013 was &euro;4.8 million.</p> <p>  The financial statements for 2013 received an unqualified opinion.  However, my audit report drew attention to ongoing non-effective expenditure, amounting to &euro;1.3 million in 2013.  This relates to rent and associated costs of unoccupied office space in two buildings assigned in 2013 to the IDA from the former Forf&aacute;s when it was dissolved.  Most of this expense relates to Carrisbrook House in Ballsbridge, which has been largely unoccupied for many years.  The committee has previously considered this matter when it examined Forf&aacute;s financial statements.</p></speech>

I have already provided to the committee a detailed briefing note.  In presenting the 2013 annual accounts I will make a few brief introductory remarks.</p> <p>  IDA Ireland, as the committee will know, is the Government agency responsible for attracting foreign direct investment, FDI, into Ireland.  In 2013, the accounts under review this morning, we reported a positive year and this continued in 2014 with a growing number of greenfield investments, expansions and transformations by existing companies.  At the end of 2013, the IDA client base in Ireland in terms of employment was 167,000 jobs and this had increased to 174,488 jobs at the end of 2014, the highest level in the history of IDA Ireland.</p> <p>  There were 164 investments won in 2013 and 197 investments won in 2014, an increase of 20% year-on-year.  There was a notable rise in new name investment, with 88 new name investors in 2014, equating to a 13% increase on 2013.  Among the leading investments secured during 2013 were Deutsche Bank, Twitter, eBay, Salesforce, Novartis, Vistakon, Facebook and Zurich.  First time investments were secured from corporations across the portfolio including from Qualcomm, Airbnb, Tripadvisor, Regeneron, Huawei, and Alexion.</p> <p>  Among the leading investments secured during 2014 were Amazon, Bristol-Myers Squibb, BMS, Fidelity, LinkedIn, PayPal, Ericsson, SAP, Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, West Pharmaceuticals and Adroll.  There were job gains across most sectors but particularly in digital media and content, technology, international financial services, pharma and medical devices and business services.</p> <p>  IDA&rsquo;s strategy, Horizon 2020, which covered the period 2010 to 2014, came to an end in December 2014.  IDA exceeded the key jobs and investment targets set out under that strategy.  For the five years of the strategy, IDA achieved a net increase in employment of 28,242, against a target of 25,000.</p><p>IDA achieved a gross increase in employment of 65,066 against a target of 62,000 over the same time period and this resulted in a total impact of 110,612 against a target of 105,000.  This job performance took place against a particularly challenging European and global economic environment.<br/><br/>IDA is currently developing a new strategy for foreign direct investment and this will be formally announced over the coming weeks.  The strategy will set out the organisation's targets for the next five years including how and where we intend to win the next wave of sophisticated investment for Ireland.<br/><br/>IDA is a key contributor to the Government's annual Action Plan for Jobs process and is responsible for the delivery of key actions therein.<br/><br/>Horizon 2020 set down ambitious regional economic development targets for the dispersal of investments in regions outside Dublin and Cork.  While these have been challenging, 2014 saw a much-improved year for regional dispersal with 37% of investments going outside Dublin and Cork.  That is the best performance over the last five years and up 30% on what was recorded in 2013.<br/><br/>Examples of regional announcements in 2013 include Regeneron, Cook, Vistakon and ACI in Limerick.  There was also eBay and National Pen in Dundalk and Overstock in Sligo, among many others.<br/><br/>In 2014 there were announcements from Jazz Pharmaceuticals in Roscommon, Becton Dickinson in Drogheda, West Pharma in Waterford, Teleflex in Athlone and Clearstream Technologies in Enniscorthy again amongst others.<br/><br/>The committee may be aware that yesterday the Government announced a capital investment programme of &euro;150 million over the next five years to underpin IDA's regional approach which will be announced as part of the organisation's overall strategy in the coming weeks.  Specifically, nine new advanced technology buildings will be constructed over the next three years, commencing with Tralee, Castlebar and Sligo in 2015, followed by Athlone, Dundalk, Carlow, Limerick, Galway and Waterford over the following two years.<br/><br/>Foreign direct investment is an area which continued to perform during the economic crisis and Ireland has been very successful in attracting many of the world's most innovative and sophisticated companies to set up operations here.<br/><br/>FDI has a significant impact on the wider economy with &euro;124.5 billion of exports from IDA clients in 2013, up 2% on 2012.  Some 66% of corporation tax that is paid is paid by IDA client companies.  IDA client companies spent &euro;22.4 billion in the Irish economy in 2013, &euro;8.5 billion of which is payroll.  We estimate 10,000 jobs in construction in 2014 as a result of FDI activity around the country.<br/><br/>The improvement in Ireland's macroeconomic and fiscal situation now provides a positive backdrop for investment.  IDA reinforces Ireland's positive message in boardrooms across the world.<br/><br/>Many aspects of competitiveness have improved over the last number of years and international surveys consistently place Ireland in the top half dozen locations for FDI and pro-business policies.  For example, in the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook 2014, Ireland's ranking has improved from 24th position in 2011 to 15th currently.  In December 2013, <i>Forbes</i>named Ireland the best place in the world to do business.  The IBM global location trends report places Ireland number one in terms of quality and value of foreign direct investment.<br/><br/>Sectors such as technology, pharma, medical devices and Internet investments have performed extremely strongly and will continue to be the core focus for IDA.  Manufacturing and global business services have also performed strongly and Ireland is well positioned to benefit further from investment in these areas.  We are, of course, looking at opportunities in other sectors and also where sectors converge - for example between medical devices and pharma, medical devices and technology and so on.<br/><br/>Our challenge now is to maintain those companies that we have attracted and to attract a new cohort of companies to Ireland.<br/><br/>Ireland's corporation tax offering was enhanced during 2014 with changes introduced as part of budget 2015.  These changes position the country to sustain and win inward investment in the years ahead, and further strengthen what Ireland can offer overseas investors.  Budget 2015 reaffirmed the commitment to the 12.5% corporation tax rate, while also dealing with the issue of our corporate tax residency rules.  The changes to the Irish corporate tax residency rules provided that all Irish registered companies will also be Irish tax resident with effect from 1 January 2015 for new companies and from 1 January 2021 for existing companies.  This change confirms Ireland's international reputation as a country with a stable, transparent and fair taxation regime by bringing clarity to how Ireland's tax rules interact with tax regimes that are present elsewhere.<br/><br/>A roadmap for Ireland's tax competitiveness was published which aims to position Ireland towards maintaining the most competitive taxation offering that conforms with good practice.  In conjunction with the non-tax measures set out in the Government's recent policy statement on foreign direct investment in Ireland, this roadmap will provide the foundations for Ireland to maintain and expand its position as a thriving hub for FDI.  IDA welcomes the new measures including a new best-in-class knowledge development box, a broadening of the research and development tax credit and an improved special assignee relief programme.<br/><br/>The Department of Finance public consultation process was launched in mid-January 2015 to gather views on how the proposed knowledge development box should operate.  This consultation process should ensure maximum constructive input from the FDI sector.<br/><br/>On the 2013 accounts specifically, IDA Ireland's annual report and accounts for 2013 were signed off by the Comptroller and Auditor General on 24 June 2014.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has already outlined that the total Oireachtas funding available to IDA Ireland in 2013 was &euro;126 million.<br/><br/>IDA Ireland had an employment control framework number of 272 staff in 2013 and in 2014, and remained within this ceiling throughout both years.  IDA also commenced recruitment in 2014 of a further 35 team members under the Action Plan for Jobs initiative, called Winning Abroad.<br/><br/>During 2013, IDA managed the integration of functions from Forf&aacute;s and the integration of Shannon Development FDI portfolio.<br/><br/>Performance in 2013 and 2014 proved to be very strong overall, especially in the context of continued global uncertainty and reflects a concerted effort across the organisation focused on business generation, delivery and client service.  The employment results for 2013 and 2014 clearly highlight the keen focus that must be maintained on national competitiveness and the transformation process within client companies in the Irish economy in order to maintain and grow jobs in Ireland.  The immediate pipeline is encouraging, in so far as one can see ahead, across a range of sectors and business models, but we cannot, obviously, take this for granted.<br/><br/>Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the global IDA team for their dedication and commitment to attracting real investment and jobs to Ireland.  Without them, the positive results and impact I have just discussed would not be possible.  I would also like to thank the wider public and private sector support that IDA receives in support of its mandate on an ongoing basis.</p></speech>

As the members of the committee have my opening statement, I will just make a few brief comments.</p> <p>  Enterprise Ireland helps companies throughout Ireland to start and scale, innovate and remain competitive on international markets, now and in the future.  The manufacturing and internationally traded services companies that Enterprise Ireland works with are a vital source of employment in every county in Ireland and are spread across a wide range of sectors.  Enterprise Ireland-supported companies now directly provide employment for 180,072 people, comprising 156,202 full-time and 23,870 part-time workers, and in total 300,000 plus people, directly and indirectly.</p> <p>  EI-supported companies created 18,033 new jobs in 2013.  This resulted in a net increase of 5,442 in the number of people employed.  Total exports exceeded previous records to reach &euro;17.1 billion in 2013.  The 2014 survey is being undertaken at present and is expected to show exports exceeding &euro;18 billion in 2014.</p> <p>  In January 2015 we reported that Enterprise Ireland client companies created 19,705 new jobs in 2014.  As a result they created 8,476 net new jobs - the highest net gain in the history of the agency.</p><p>This employment growth demonstrates the direct impact that increasing exports has had on jobs in Ireland.  This employment growth demonstrates the direct impact that increasing exports has had on jobs in Ireland.</p><p> Enterprise Ireland's accounts for 2013 were signed off by the Comptroller and Auditor General on 27 June 2014.  We support companies both directly through the provision of financial supports and services to our client support network and indirectly by helping to build the wider enterprise infrastructure, for example through our work on technology centres.</p><p> The past two years have seen record employment gains for Irish companies and the highest level of exports ever achieved.  All our key indicators are suggesting that employment and export growth is set to continue and there is a strong pipeline of start-up and expansion projects coming through.  Enterprise Ireland has the most ambitious targets for any three year period in the history of the agency, in terms of jobs, exports and start-ups.</p><p> The active support of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is vital to our ability to execute our strategy with Irish companies.  EI works closely with a range of other Departments, such as the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, to support the growth of Ireland's enterprise sectors, particularly in the context of the Action Plan for Jobs.  Similarly, the close collaboration of the agencies, including IDA Ireland, is critical to supporting enterprise in Ireland.</p><p> Our key focus areas for the coming term will be as follows - driving entrepreneurship and start-ups; scaling Irish enterprise across all sectors and stages of growth; developing Ireland's market-driven research and development capabilities; and accelerating regional enterprise development.  </p></speech>

In fact, the losses for that year were the lowest losses we have seen for any period since 2000 so it has been declining.  The losses were spread across all of the sectors.  There was not any one particular sector that accounted for it.  There was an ongoing churn of companies that are reducing employment and companies going in and out of business.  Most of them are in a smaller sized companies with small losses across a large number of companies.</p> <p>  Much of the work that we have done in order to stem that decrease in jobs over the period has been to work on lean manufacturing with the companies to try to improve their competitiveness to help them to grow their sales.  We also work with them to grow their sales in export markets because there is going to be growth through growth in sales and competitiveness that they continue.  We are not just focusing on the new jobs.  We have a major focus in terms of working on the ongoing competitiveness of the existing base of companies to try to reduce that which is coming through in terms of a reduction in job losses.  It is still a figure which is too high and that is why we are continuing to try to drive the competitiveness agenda. </p></speech>

There is a small number of liquidations.  It is largely through one, two or five job reductions in companies.</p></speech>

Therefore, those have washed through the system reflecting in higher figures in more recent years.  </p> <p>  Another thing which has driven the cost per job up in recent times is a restructure of a number of sectors, particularly the food sector.  There was a beef and sheapmeat fund and a dairy investment fund.  Those funds were really about restructuring those sectors.  Between now and 2020 we will see substantial increases in those sectors.  What we have been doing is putting in place significant capital investment programmes both to restructure the industries and also to build new capacity to handle the dairy sector, in particular, post-quotas coming off next month.  </p> <p>  We have seen some significant capital investments which brings up the cost per job.  We have also seen, in the early 2000s, net inflows from investments disposed of which brought down the cost per job.  It is not really like for like but that is the way the figure is computed.  Also, in the 2008-2010 period there was a significant recession and we spent a lot of funding helping companies to sustain jobs through the enterprise stabilisation fund and reoriented them into new overseas markets. </p></speech>

In the early 1990s, Forbairt, which subsequently became Enterprise Ireland, started investing in venture capital.  The purpose of investments in venture capital was to provide an ecosystem and a funding mechanism to support young, innovative companies.  There was no functioning venture capital sector in Ireland at that stage.  We have gone through a number of phases of investment in venture capital.  Over the 1999-2013 period, we have disposed of those investments.  If one takes the net position for the proceeds from our venture capital investment, we have got &euro;93.7 million back into Enterprise Ireland.  We have invested &euro;55.1 million in those investments, which gives a profit overall on the total portfolio of venture capital based on disposals to date of &euro;38.55 million.</p></speech>

I will turn to Trinity specifically as Deputy Ross asked the question.  We invested in two funds for Trinity Venture Capital.  We invested a total of &euro;19.8 million.  We agreed to invest &euro;22.8 million and it was not all drawn down.  Some &euro;19.6 million was invested in Trinity.  Over a period, we also got approximately &euro;6.5 million back from Trinity and made a profit of &euro;2.5 million on those initial deals.</p></speech>

In 2007, Trinity approached us and indicated it wanted to float the company.  We had to decide whether to remain with the company and float or, alternatively, find a way to carve out the EI bit of each of the investments it was involved in.  A view was taken.  We have a seed and venture capital committee that would be involved in making such a decision, along with our board.  The decision was taken by the seed and venture capital committee, and subsequently endorsed and approved by the board, that it was a better option for the organisation to remain as an investor in the fund and be part of the public company.  That was driven by the view that there would be more funding available for our client base in that circumstance and that we would take a bigger hit if we took our funding out on a bit-by-bit basis for each of those investments.  The decision was taken to remain part of the public company.  That takes us up to 2007.  At that stage, we took a hit on our shares, in that there was a reduction in the value of our investment relative to the value of our shareholding in the public company.</p></speech>

I will give a specific figure on it.  When we invested in the public company, our funds in the company were &euro;16 million and the investment was revalued to &euro;10.3 million.  The write-down at the time of 2007 was &euro;5.7 million.  Subsequently, Trinity went public and the shares collapsed.  In 2012, the shares were at the highest price they had been in four years and a decision was taken within EI.  Trinity had made a couple of subsequent investments, one in UTV and one in Dalata Hotels, which were not core to what we were involved in and we decided because of the collapse in the share price and that it was now in the strongest position it had been in for four years to divest of the shares.  Therefore, a further hit of &euro;4.2 million was taken on those shares.</p><p>We had also made a profit of &euro;2.5 million previously so there was a loss of &euro;7.4 million on that Trinity deal.  Despite that, overall there is a return of &euro;38 million on the venture capital fund to date but that was a significant loss. </p></speech>

What was Enterprise Ireland doing investing so heavily in a company which was basically investing in UTV?  Much of its core value was cash, as the witness is aware.  Enterprise Ireland had a pile of money sitting there for a long time while it was investing in UTV as its biggest investment.  It seems totally inappropriate.</p></speech>

For example, some of the current venture funds in which Enterprise Ireland has invested invest in Ireland and outside Ireland.  If we put in &euro;10 million, we say that one has to invest at least &euro;20 million in the Irish market.  With Trinity and with funds that are investing within our core area and outside our core area, we would have had restrictions stating that one has to double its investment within the sectors in which Enterprise Ireland is interested.  In fact, Trinity's original investments were very much within the core space in which Enterprise Ireland is involved in manufacturing and international trades, largely in the software and services side.  Subsequent to the flotation, its investments in UTV and Dalata were outside our area.  That was one of the key factors, coupled with the collapse in value of the company, that the view taken by the board at that stage in 2012 was to dispose of that shareholding.</p></speech>

It must have been, given the way the share prices were going to move, a very unsuitable investment for Enterprise Ireland to have.  It probably diverted from its original purpose.  Should Enterprise Ireland not have sold those shares a lot earlier once it was not fulfilling its mandate?  It was there in cash and it was there in UTV and it had profits on things likes Dalata and a few other things like that.  Basically, Enterprise Ireland was sitting there and it had millions of euro invested in a vehicle which was basically in cash in UTV.  That is what it was and it took five years to get out of it.</p></speech>

We did not have control over whether they would float or not; we were an investor and we could not control that.  At the time we also had a view that this may be one way in which we were able to get larger amounts of money into our scaling companies.  That was our logic at the time in terms of trying to see whether this was an opportunity.  In the event, as the Deputy rightly points out, it did invest in companies but not in our space.  We had several discussions in which we tried to encourage them to invest in our areas in the sectors in which we are particularly interested.  That did not bear fruit and at that point we decided we had to exit.  Particularly in the context of a very major financial crisis we felt we needed to have those discussions and pursue that direction.</p></speech>

We restrict the amount they have to invest to make sure it at least doubles the investment of the taxpayers' funding.  That is not unusual.  After the flotation of Trinity we did not put any funding in post that flotation.  The share price plummeted and when we exited it was at the highest price the share price had been for the four years.

I will give Ms Sinnamon a break and turn to Mr. Shanahan.</p> <p>  I want to ask Mr. Shanahan about our competitiveness and issues that derive from this building, what the Legislature is doing, how it affects our competitiveness and how he does his job, and our attractiveness or lack thereof when it comes to potential investors in the country.</p> <p>  It is a while ago now, but it was announced in the budget that the double Irish taxation scheme was to be ended, ultimately, at the end of 2020 and, for new entrants, this year.  As Mr. Shanahan will be aware, it would require all companies registered here to be tax resident also.  I will not go into the rights and wrongs of ending the double Irish.  I presume that there were opinions given within IDA Ireland.  I have a strong opinion on the ending of the double Irish.  I do not agree with it, and I never have.  It worries me when law makers in the United States are now talking about further legislation that needs to be enacted, such as the anti-inversion in Congress which would allow addresses to be changed if there was a takeover to allow a company to avail of a low-tax regime.  Everybody thinks this is great, we are civically minded globally and it is a wonderful step forward, etc.  I am not so sure this economy is in a place to be so generous with regard to giving up what Mr. John Sculley, former CEO of Apple, referred to as our "edge" when it comes to attracting businesses.  I agree with him.</p> <p>  What I am asking Mr. Shanahan is how, from this point on, he will gauge what effect the ending of the double Irish will have on companies that potentially would be investors in this country.  How will he find out how disastrous or otherwise this could be?  What kind of a system of communication does he have in place with these companies and potential investors to ascertain the effect that something like this could have on the economy because, potentially, it could be quite damaging?  I will ask Mr. Shanahan that first and maybe get into other competitiveness issues that arise.</p></speech>

To start with, I will comment on our overall competitiveness and tax, and, if there are other questions, on competitiveness.</p> <p>  Ireland's competitiveness has improved dramatically in the past number of years.  It declined dramatically in the 2000s and it was more challenging to attract foreign direct investment as a result.  Costs were too high.  Resources were being supplied to areas which were unsustainable.  Obviously, we know what the result of that was.  Our competitiveness has now improved.  I would say that, at all costs, we need to protect our competitiveness.</p> <p>  Our competitiveness is not just around taxation.  There is probably, in the international debate and sometimes in the Irish debate, an undue emphasis on taxation in that competitiveness is about everything.  It is about the costs, infrastructure, the availability of talent, the attractiveness of the locations to which we are trying to bring companies, etc.  All of the international rankings, as I said in my opening statement, show that Ireland's competitiveness is improving.  The difficulty with international rankings is that they typically lag and they are telling one something after the fact, and we need to be mindful and ensure that they continue to increase and that we stay there.</p> <p>  In relation to the changes that were made in the 2015 budget regarding tax, first, the changes to the residency rules that Deputy Deasy is referring to were not made in isolation.  They were made in a context where other parts of our tax code were improved, particularly - I mentioned some of them in my opening statement in relation to the amortisation of intellectual property - in relation to SARP and, indeed, to personal taxation rates.  Obviously, the budget also announced that the Government intended to introduced a knowledge development box.  I would put all of those in the plus category of making Ireland more attractive to foreign direct investment.</p> <p>  In relation to the change to residency rules, I believe that over the long period that will also be a positive because it was something that was being used to point to Ireland, and causing damage to our international reputation.  The change was well handled.  We had engagement with our clients prior to the changes in the run up to the budget - obviously, nobody knows what the changes will be until budget day but we obviously plan for all eventualities.  Once the budget was announced, we had engagement with our clients about it.  I wrote to every client of IDA Ireland on the day the budget was announced.  We followed that up with engagements through all of our executives on the ground in market, at corporate and in Ireland, and we also had a number of investment marketing missions directly after the budgetary process in order to speak to our clients directly in market.</p> <p>  There are a number of ways one gauges what the impact will be over time.  First, one speaks to the clients and asks them what their response is, and for the most part that response has been positive.  It is not universally positive, as Deputy Deasy would expect, but for the most part it has been positive.</p> <p>  It impacts on different IDA Ireland client companies in different ways.  There is a small number who may have availed of structures.  They now have to find an alternative to that structure.  For those that are operating already, they have over six years in which to do that from the point it was announced.  There are those who may have believed that the existence of such structures was doing damage to Ireland's reputation and was causing them a difficulty in terms of their investment in Ireland, and would have very much welcomed the changes.  There are those for whom this has no bearing at all, which would be a large part of the portfolio, including emerging companies who are still in ramp-up stage and for whom tax does not feature.  There is a whole-----</p></speech>

I accept where Mr. Shanahan is coming from - that competitiveness has improved and it took a dip - and I take what he is saying with regard to these companies.  My opinion is that in talking about tax avoidance, which, effectively, is what this scheme was, I am not bothered too much about what others think of our international reputation when it comes to attracting companies to our shores because other countries do other things to attract companies into their jurisdictions and have been doing so since the year dot.  When one asks a CEO of a company about a tax avoidance scheme, which it has availed of and which brought it to this country in the first place in many respects, he or she may not verbalise the impact of this entirely.</p><p>Moreover, my personal experience has been that while it is something of which such people will avail and use to the full, they will not talk to a journalist and agree it absolutely was why they came here and why they are staying here.  The ESRI carried out a pretty good study on this issue and the analysis it came up with, having surveyed the companies, was that had Ireland a European Union average rate of 22.5%, and the number of multinationals between the years 2005 and 2013 would have been 60, not 130.  The ESRI considered four measures of Ireland's corporation taxation, namely, the policy rate, the mean effective average tax rate, EATR, the total tax rate and the cross-border EATR.  Ultimately, the ESRI's analysis was that even were one to bring the rate down to 15% as opposed to 12.5%, some 20% of those companies that had been attracted here previously under the old regime would not have come.  I do not state that we have a problem and am not getting into the rights and wrongs of it.  I do not really care if commentators say it is wonderful, Ireland is very fair, it is good and so on.  The potential impact here worries me because companies will not verbalise this, although they may do so behind closed doors to a certain extent.  I believe we have a problem and if we identify a problem in the coming months with regard to potential investors, we need to do something about it.</p></speech>

First, I had intended to say there are a number of ways.  One way is to ask them.  Second, one looks at what they do next and where they put their next investments.  Moreover, one looks at where potential investors are putting their investments.  As one of the more obvious items of evidence that this has not had a detrimental impact, I would point to the pipeline of investments since the budget was announced.  I also note that even in advance of the budgetary announcement, there was a high degree of expectation among the international investment community that Ireland would do something in this area and still, we see very large investments coming through the pipeline.</p> <p>  I absolutely agree with the Deputy and equally and obviously, my only interest is in how do we remain competitive.  The statistics the Deputy used with regard to how tax has been an attractive and compelling reason for people to come to Ireland are absolutely correct.  It also was right for the time.  However, if our competitive advantage increasingly is being used against us and is causing other companies not to invest here, this may have been an issue.  It is also more of a question of timing, in that a number of international processes are under way of which the committee would be aware, such as the base erosion profit shifting, BEPS, project through the OECD or initiatives through the European Union and the United States.  One point that is clear from all those processes is the thrust of them is that substance and tax liability will be ever more closely aligned.  Ireland has set out a clear roadmap and has stated what it is going to do over the years ahead.  This has given investors a lot of confidence and clarity, which is not evident in all countries.  It has removed one of the structures that may be causing us a difficulty from a reputational perspective.  I am not just talking about causing Ireland reputational difficulty but about causing difficulty to potential investors.  The Minister reiterated on the day of the budget that our 12.5% rate was not up for discussion and one should remember that the more that these two things, substance and tax liability, become aligned, the more attractive the 12.5% rate becomes.</p></speech>

However, to a certain extent this is conjecture and theory with regard to the impact this will have on the existing multinationals between now and 2020.  We do not know yet.</p></speech>

We are engaged with companies every day of the week trying to work out what will differentiate Ireland.  Increasingly, given the global changes I have outlined, tax will continue to be part of our competitive offering and we should make it as competitive as we can.  For instance, in the context of introducing a knowledge development box, the Minister used the phrase that it will be best in class and aligned with international best practice.  We should go to the very extremes in all of what we do to attract investment.  However, we also need to do the other things that would give us even greater differentiation and more competitiveness in respect of the availability of talent - which is where all the actual differentiation will come in future - having the available infrastructure, having the property solutions and having attractive places in which to live and work.  They are equally important and for a lot of the cohort of companies we are attracting, they want to know that they actually can do things in Ireland.  They want to know that they can set up and they want to scale up quickly before they ever get to the point where they are talking about paying taxes.</p></speech>

Mr. Shanahan has answered the question.  IDA Ireland is obviously thinking about this in terms of communication with the companies involved.</p> <p>  On a similar theme, I have a concern about Ireland's economic position in respect of what happens within Leinster House and what is passed that potentially could affect our competitiveness.  Within the next couple of months, collective bargaining legislation will be introduced in this House.  It is probably good that none of my Labour Party colleagues are present.</p></speech>

I am unsure how wise it is to pass legislation that potentially will have an impact on, for example, a company from the United States.  If such a company did not recognise a union - I acknowledge that mandatory union recognition is not being proposed - it certainly would allow a union to drag a company to the Labour Court.  This is a position that has not existed since the Industrial Relations Act was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court back in 2007.  The general feeling from people who deal with labour law is this probably is not necessary and that the existing laws are pretty robust when it comes to employer-employee relations and in negotiations in the matrix that is there already.  Personally, I do not believe this is the right time for such legislation.  When it comes to something like this, obviously the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland has been involved in negotiations and has an opinion.  It believes - it is not alone in this belief - that in respect of dealing with the Government on this, the process has been good.  Did IDA Ireland give an opinion on the timing of this legislation?  Does it have an opinion with regard to legislation like this and on this legislation specifically, as well as on its timing?  As we have just ended the double Irish, we do not really know what will happen.  The last thing we should be doing is passing more legislation that could put a doubt in the mind of any investor from the United States about coming to Ireland.  It is not rocket science.  I believe the timing is bad and that we should hold off until this economy recovers to the point where consideration can be given to such legislation.</p></speech>

At a high level, I should state, first, that anything the Houses do in respect of legislation should always have an eye to competitiveness.  As people who market Ireland as a location for investment on a daily basis, the more positive things we have in our tool bag and the fewer negative things, the better.  It is important to note that in respect of labour market flexibility, Ireland scores really highly on all international barometers.  It is important to note - so that this is not taken out of context - that we really do well in this regard and I believe it is a tick in the favourable column for companies.  In respect of the specific proposed legislation mentioned by the Deputy, my understanding of it is that it tries to strike a balance between protecting the competitiveness of Ireland as a location for multinationals and indigenous companies and protecting the rights of employees to engage in collective bargaining.</p><p>There has been significant engagement with both employers and employee representative groups during the course of developing the proposed legislation.  The American Chamber of Commerce, AmCham, IBEC and the trade unions have all engaged with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and bilaterally.  The legislation continues the tradition of the voluntarist nature of collective bargaining while seeking to protect employees.  It tries to seek this balance and if it succeeds, well and good.  We have yet to see the drafts.</p></speech>

We need to keep an eye on it.  If it is passed this year, we must be cognisant of the effect it might have on any multinational that might consider Ireland.  This is just one of many issues.</p></speech>

My concern is that we are lining up reasons for them not to come here, and doing so at the wrong time.  It is not the IDA's fault but is done because of political agendas.  I met groups that are involved in these negotiations and they are very clear that in their opinion it is not needed.  Although the process has been good and they have been pleased with the Department and other people involved, everybody to whom I speak asks what we are doing.  While the IDA and Enterprise Ireland are doing an amazing job, the legislation we pass must correlate what their work is about.  There is a danger that we are putting impediments to investors where we should not be.</p> <p>  Yesterday, the IDA with Enterprise Ireland, announced a regional plan.  In the past few weeks I have met Mr. Shanahan, the IDA chairman Mr. Frank Ryan and the new regional manager for the south east Anne-Marie Tierney-Le Roux.  Mr. Ryan told me about a problem he immediately identified when he became chairman.  One of the first things he asked for was data on the companies that had been offered regional aid incentives.  He wanted to know which companies turned them down to move to larger urban areas as opposed to the regions.  The list was extensive.  Mr. Barry O'Leary also noted this during his tenure as chief executive of the IDA.  He identified that no matter how much money we were throwing at these companies, it was not working and we needed to deal with it differently.  We all know it.  Since Mr. Shanahan has come to the job, I feel people are being listened to for the first time.  The fact that there is a regional director for the south east is very significant for us.  For 20 years, the south east, which has seen a 9% decline in jobs, was left without a regional director.  Our area was dealt with from Cork, and it did not work.  I appreciate the consideration Mr. Shanahan has given with this key appointment and I hope it will be worthwhile.</p> <p>  Last night, I spoke to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, about yesterday's announcement by the IDA and Enterprise Ireland.  While it is positive that Waterford has been earmarked for an advanced factory in 2017, it is too far away for us.  The advanced factory that is being competed now is great and I am hopeful that we will get a company into it soon.  Over recent weeks I have engaged with the IDA and the Waterford county manager about putting together a proposal for an advanced factory in Dungarvan.  Mr. Shanahan has the proposal.  Now that the advanced factory in the city has been completed, we need one in the west of the county to service the area.  It would cost little money.  The facility is there in the old recycling plant in Dungarvan.  Could Mr. Shanahan deal with the specific proposal?  How will he deal with the local authorities on such issues over the coming year?  While I have seen broad policy statements on area action plans, there is a need for more engagement with the local authorities as to what assets they have that could be renovated or refitted.  In some cases, they are very ready to engage with the IDA.</p></speech>

I will not discuss individual properties and what we may or may not do with them.  We are happy to engage with all county councils on property, and we do so constantly.  We also engage with other arms of the State that hold property portfolios and with the private sector.</p></speech>

We receive input from all quarters including public representatives, county councils and the private sector regarding building sites and other property solutions.  We will come back to the country manager regarding the proposal he has put forward.  My colleagues are familiar with the building in question and we will re-examine it to ensure we are up to date before determining what, if anything, can be done and in what timeframe.  We continue to market the building, as we do other public and private sector properties in the area.  As the Deputy pointed out, Waterford was in the first round of locations picked for building advanced technology buildings.  IDA commenced the programme last year for the first time in many years and it started in Waterford and Athlone.  The Waterford building has just been constructed and commissioned.  We have had much interest in both the Waterford and Athlone buildings and I hope we will see some activity in this regard soon.</p> <p>  We must go out and market these things.  All this investment is hard-won.  Although there is property available around the country, some of it is not of a standard or in a location that is suitable for the types of investments we are trying to win.  We chose the locations for the nine advanced technology buildings announced yesterday on the basis of critical mass of population, existing enterprise base or cluster and the availability of a talent pool.  In all locations there is a third-level institute, typically an institute of technology and in one case a university.  They are in locations where they are marketable.  This is because property is a key differentiator and having these turn-key solutions available is very important because it often makes the difference between winning and not winning investment.</p></speech>

I am being told that while previously a green field was all that was needed in some cases, they are now demanding that a property be ready for them to move into and it must be arranged before they come, particularly if it is outside the main centres of Cork and Dublin where they are less likely to build.</p></speech>

This may involve acting as a connector and putting them in contact with the right people or acting as a broker.  We market both public and private sector properties.</p><p> In regard to the process of engagement on regional development plans, the Government announced yesterday that regional enterprise action plans would be in place in six of the eight regional locations by July and the other two would follow shortly thereafter.  The proposal is that either an Enterprise Ireland or an IDA senior manager will lead the development and co-ordination of each of those plans at local level.  The individuals for each region have been appointed and we will now consult with local authorities, other arms of the State that have a regional presence and local representatives in order to assess what can be done in each region.</p><p> There were two arms to what was announced yesterday.  One arm is the &euro;150 million made available over a five year period for property solutions for the IDA.  That relates both to the advanced technology buildings, but also to strategic sites and business and technology parks.  The other arm relates to &euro;100 million in competitive funding, which will be operated by colleagues in Enterprise Ireland.  This will allow a bottom-up approach, where regions can bring forward ideas and pitch for competitive funding.</p></speech>

Taking the building in Dungarvan as an example, once the IDA has examined the building and dealt with it, is it possible to use that budget for the purpose of renovation or refitting?</p></speech>

I also acknowledge the role played by Barry O'Leary and Frank Ryan.</p><p>Deputy Ross is not here at the moment, but I am always amazed at how subjective his views are on Enterprise Ireland, not alone here but in his articles in the business section of the <i>Sunday Independent.</i>I am often disappointed immensely with his articles.  The cost of jobs is based on many variables, but I believe many jobs are based on the potential turnover of &euro;18 billion of many Enterprise Ireland based companies.  We can look at the success of the bottom up approach in this regard.  Will Ms Sinnamon explain the role of the service level agreement in regard to Enterprise Ireland and connectivity with local and small enterprise companies?  </p><p>The issue of cross-Border development was raised.  Amazement was expressed at the reference to the shareholding in Northern Ireland based companies, but I am aware from my experience there has been significant development and collaboration with InterTradeIreland and both Northern and Southern Ireland based companies.In my experience, this is par for the course.</p></speech>

We meet a number of times a year with Invest Northern Ireland to discuss how we can work together to help companies on both sides of the Border.  On programmes such as Horizon 2020, for example, we liaise with them in order to help them maximise the draw down of those funds.  In the past two weeks, we had our second trade mission under the Invest Northern Ireland, UK Trade and Investment, UKTI, and Enterprise Ireland banner in the Gulf at the Arab Health Exhibition &amp;amp; Congress.  All sides worked together on this.  This co-operation is valued by companies both in the Republic and in Northern Ireland.  Interestingly, Invest Northern Ireland recently tendered for one of its own development programmes, which was won by DCU which previously would have run programmes for us that Invest Northern Ireland clients win also.  There is strong collaboration between both sides, to the benefit of companies on both sides of the Border.</p></speech>

There is a significant spin-off to other companies.  It is important we get a clear message on the cost of a job and that we balance that with the economic benefit in other spin-off companies.  It is important to clarify that.</p> <p>  In the context of investment, people say, "No problem, no business".  There is always a risk with investment.  Looking at the scale of research and investment, of high tech companies and of high potential start-up companies here, these have been very much the cornerstone of our fantastic success.  Ireland would be entirely lost without work of the IDA and Enterprise Ireland in achieving that.  Now that Deputy Ross has returned, I would like to comment on his subjective view of Enterprise Ireland.  I know from my experience in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, that in the context of  the achievements in the area of cross-Border development, high potential start-up companies and truth of the saying "No problem, no business", there is always a certain element of loss.  However, when we look at the overall result, the jobs created in every community, the LEOs and service level agreement, I believe Enterprise Ireland has done an outstanding job.  </p> <p>  I have visited some of the high potential start-up companies.  There is always a risk involved, but it is important to see young entrepreneurs and young business people encouraged and to take the quantitative risk, not alone here but also in Northern Ireland.  Rather than be subjective about cross-Border investment, we should be objective.  It is important for the economy of the whole island.  We should make this message clear and also clarify that the cost of a job should not be counted entirely in terms of the cost for Enterprise Ireland, but attached to the overall turnover.  In the retail sense, the cost of a job is based at retail, rather than cost.  If we accept that in the case of Enterprise Ireland, we are getting very good value per cost.</p></speech>

One of the specific issues with Irish companies is there is a massive spend in the economy.  Take, for example, some of the recent investment in the food sector.  There might be less than 100 jobs in the company we are supporting, but potentially there are 1,000 jobs in the wider economy through jobs on farms and through the value added services that feed into these.  There is a high level of value added across the economy every time we invest in a company.  I will now ask Mr. Tom Hayes to talk about the service level agreement.</p></speech>

In every constituency in the country, there is potential for the small acorn to grow.  It is important there is a clear level service agreement from incubation of a idea and for how it will work.</p></speech>

Legislation had to be introduced to dissolve the boards of the CEBs.  </p><p> The SLA framework was established.  A significant amount of work was involved in terms of branding because a brand had to be developed.  Finances were required because they had to integrate into the local authorities, and the same was required for IT systems.  There were issues in terms of logistics because people had to move, and five or six are still waiting to move because they are locked into longer-terms leases or are in community enterprise centres which are more appropriate locations.</p><p> There was a national launch and each individual LEO was launched.  We placed a major emphasis on staff training and development because change management meant people were operating in a very different environment.  The functional competencies of the staff were also critical in areas like social media training, marketing, financial analysis, business development, understanding new business models and business dynamics.  We also had to establish protocols.  We now have protocols between the LEOs and a number of other agencies because it is a first stop shop to where anyone hoping to start a business goes.  There are protocols with bodies such as Revenue, the Department of Social Protection, Microfinance Ireland and, as was mentioned, the community enterprise centres which are a significant resource around the country in terms of a property solution for anybody who wants to start a business.</p><p> The service level agreement involves a three year framework and we will review it in the second quarter of this year.</p></speech>

I refer to dairy products and the food harvest 2020 strategy.  An announcement was made this week.  Will a major change occur in manufacturing jobs?  A number of years ago things were very much driven by hi-tech companies.</p></speech>

There are many small production units.  Those are the kind of people which are coming through the LEO network.</p></speech>

We will be starting with the community enterprise centres.  They have been around for some time and we have invested &euro;46 million in them.  There are 117 of them up and running and over 1,200 companies, employing over 6,000 people, are engaged with and operate out of them.  This provides an opportunity, not to provide more of the same, but to provide something quite enhanced.  Deputy Deasy referred to remodification and re-engineering.  It is an opportunity for local communities which work together and come forward.  The programme will be part of that.</p> <p>  A second leg of that involves LEOs.  There will be a competitive call for each of the LEOs.  We want the best in class and for people to come forward to us in a competitive scheme which will involve solutions which can help to create jobs locally.</p> <p>  The third element will be a consequence of the consultation which will take place and has been mentioned.  The spotlight will now be put on six regions up to July, with a further two to follow.  Out of that will emerge ideas, initiatives and areas that we will be in a position to support.</p></speech>

There is very close co-operation between the IDA and Enterprise Ireland on all manner of things.  We work very closely together across the board wherever it makes sense in terms of enterprise development.  There is a very close working relationship when it comes to trade and investment missions wherever our objectives are aligned.  Enterprise Ireland is involved in ensuring that Irish exporters can export overseas.  </p> <p>  We are trying to attract investment.  The locations for both are not always exactly aligned, but where it makes sense we operate joint trade and investment missions.  Where it makes sense we have the Ireland house concept.  Where there are embassies and consulates Enterprise Ireland and the IDA are co-located.  An innovation in recent times has been the development of the export trade council which brings together all of the players around the table, including the private sector, to discuss how that operates.  There are local market plans which the ambassador, together with our representatives in Enterprise Ireland and the IDA, develop each year.  Ms Sinnamon or Mr. Sherry may wish to comment.</p></speech>

We run joint trade missions with it overseas to several locations, in Asia or the US.  In November we ran a trade mission jointly in Ireland where 80 multinational and 150 Irish companies, focused on Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway, were brought together with multinational and indigenous supply companies in Ireland to help them collaborate more closely.  This was done with a view to embedding those multinational companies in Ireland and for the Irish companies to win more business from the spend available from multinational companies.  </p> <p>  We are also, as Mr. Sherry outlined, co-located with them wherever possible internationally and work hand-in-glove with them in terms of the networks we can leverage, as we do with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and other agencies where relevant.  Bord Bia is one such example.  Part of that process involves having a joint senior management team between IDA and Enterprise Ireland in place which drives that activity.  It goes without saying that on the research side in Ireland, the drive on technology centres and collaboration on research are important areas.</p> <p>  Some of the multinational companies coming into Ireland do so by acquisition.  They acquire Irish companies which they see as having leading-edge technology.   The numbers are increasing and we recently conducted a review on the sector.  Over half of the companies we transfer to the IDA on a regular basis are high potential start-up companies, where multinational companies have come into Ireland by acquiring a technology company they regard as best in class, not just in Ireland but globally.  An example is a company called Biancamed which developed technology for sleep apnea.  An Australian company called ResMed saw the technology and acquired it.  It is now a new name multinational company in Ireland which is managed by the IDA, but it was a spin-out company from UCD.  </p></speech>

I compliment the staff of Enterprise Ireland and the IDA on the extraordinary job they do and reports they have furnished today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-12a.285" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1058" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015021200002#P00100"><p>I welcome the representatives from Enterprise Ireland and the IDA.  I go back to an initial comment by Deputy John Perry at the start.  It is only a comment to Ms Julie Sinnamon.  I would certainly not want the message to go out from this committee that I had any difficulty with an investment of &euro;13,000 to create a job that would restore somebody's dignity and give them a sense of wellbeing while removing them from the live register at a minimum recurring saving of &euro;10,000 to &euro;12,000 a year.  It is important to point out that a State investment of &euro;13,000, which was the figure Ms Sinnamon suggested, to create a job is value for money, especially if it gives the person back dignity of which he or she has been stripped.</p> <p>  I refer Mr. Martin Shanahan to the issue of competitiveness.  Mr. Shanahan, a YouTube sensation, is very welcome to the committee.  He handled himself very impressively and defended the Government's decision not to be a part of the United Kingdom very well on the Internet recently.  I ask Mr. Shanahan for his general opinion on the following.  A suggestion has been bandied about lately that an increase in employers' PRSI to 15.75% on incomes above &euro;100,000 would be a good idea.  What does Mr. Shanahan think of that?  What does he think of the suggestion that an increase in capital gains tax would be a good idea in terms of competitiveness and selling Ireland's message overseas?</p></speech>

However, it is a clear-cut answer from my perspective.  Anything that adds to the cost of employment is likely to have a detrimental impact on our ability to attract foreign direct investment and, indeed, on the capacity of enterprise to flourish in the State.  If one increases employers' PRSI, one is adding to the cost of employment here.  It is a policy decision ultimately.  The Government has decided to cut the cake a particular way in terms of our tax profile and other jurisidictions do it in a slightly different way.  Ultimately, one has to make the books balance.  We all understand that, but things that add to the cost of employment are not good in terms of our ability to attract inward investment.</p></speech>

I am not in a position to say exactly what impact an increase in employers' PRSI would have on decisions, but I can tell the committee that the more one increases the cost of employment to employers in Ireland, the less likely we are to be able to attract investment.  It is the cumulative effect of the entire package that we are talking about.  Similarly, the more capital gains tax is increased in relation to productive assets, the less likely people are to invest.  That goes without saying.  One has to take it in its entirety.  If one made that change and made another really positive change, that could help.</p></speech>

The only positive thing that could go with that would be a cut in corporation tax.  Is that not right?</p></speech>

If one was to adjust employee's take home pay by narrowing the tax wedge, that would have an impact also.</p></speech>

There is a substantial tier of towns in the population category of 1,500 to 7,000 underneath that.  Mr. Shanahan told Deputy John Deasy that he was open to suggestions from local authorities.  Is he open to suggestions now or will authorities have to wait until 2017?  Local authorities may have plans, sites and ideas with potential.  I am thinking of my own county of Limerick which suffers from a particular issue.  We have a large urban centre in Limerick city, which sucks all of the activity in but there is then a huge geographical area of small towns and villages with a rural hinterland.  The attractiveness of Limerick and Dublin makes inward investment outside very difficult.</p> <p>  I refer in particular to the IDA taking on the FDI role that Shannon Development previously had without taking on the land bank.  There is an anomaly there and I am concerned that we will be losers yet again in terms of the &euro;150 million provision.  Local authorities may be coming to the IDA with the plans but the land is in the ownership of Shannon Development which is bound by statute to get the commercial value for it.  Is that something the IDA will consider?  This is an issue for the old Shannon Development region stretching from Birr to Tralee.  I would like to see some progress being made to address it.</p></speech>

As I said earlier in response to Deputy Deasy, we work with landowners and property owners in the public and private sector.</p><p>I have met with Shannon Development twice in the past three weeks.  I am saying this to reassure the Deputy that we have a very good working relationship with it.  A significant portion of those meetings would have been given over to a discussion of property.  It obviously now has a commercial remit and we fully understand that but it also has a requirement to market its lands and to develop them for commercial purposes.  Given that it holds that land bank-----</p></speech>

It is no slur on the airport.  It must run its business and make a commercial return.  However, if there is a site for sale in Mallow in County Cork versus one for sale in Newcastle West and one is considerably more expensive than the other, there is an obvious attractiveness regarding where one would go.  There is a feeling that the way in which the transfer of the land asset was constructed may have left us at a disadvantage.  If that is the case, working with Shannon, would IDA Ireland bring forward recommendations for changes?</p></speech>

I would say it is a very good working relationship.  At the moment, I do not see that disadvantage.</p> <p>  In respect of the approach to regional development, the Deputy described a situation where a large urban centre attracts the investment.  I am speaking from a foreign direct investment and IDA perspective.  Enterprise Ireland has quite a different profile in that it is more regionally spread because it is bottom-up and concerns indigenous companies.  That is and will continue to be an issue in respect of foreign direct investment.  We have made huge strides in trying to achieve regional balance but it is a factor that the trend in foreign direct investment is for companies to increasingly make decisions to locate in large urban areas.  That is the international trend, which we are trying to buck.  </p> <p>  We have only one city of over one million people.  Ireland is winning about three and a half times the amount of foreign direct investment that one might ordinarily expect if one went on the basis of our percentage GDP of the 28 EU member states so we are getting a lot of it and that is filtering out to all regions.  We need to bear in mind that this is international competition.  There are approximately 190 cities in China with over one million people.  There are 36 cities in Europe with over one million people.  There are about 50 metropolitan areas in the US which have over one million people.  We are trying to market Ireland which, on the whole, has four million people and one city of international scale, which is Dublin.  Our approach is then to market regions.  For the most part, the regions have about half a million people on average and some of them have far fewer.  That is to put it in context.  Large urban centres are likely to continue being hubs and attractors of foreign direct investment.  Obviously, we will make every effort to disperse further than that but they are our best attractor in the first instance from which we build out.  </p></speech>

I think they work very well together.  I had the pleasure of meeting both sides at a recent event with the Minister in Athlone.  It was great to see the heads of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in the one place working with like-minded people.</p> <p>  I will direct my question to IDA Ireland.  I appreciate that when it is attracting the company, there is a complete package that must be put out there to attract a company to an area.  It includes things like the advance availability of a suitable premises that would cover both office and manufacturing.  Some places would have a third-level institution that would provide talented employees who are ready to go.  Companies nowadays want to see a quality of life for their staff so what a town or city has to offer is very important.  </p> <p>  There is a perception on the ground that IDA visits are very important, some towns are getting more of them than others and some towns are getting none.  I am very fortunate in representing a constituency that has two counties and three very large towns, one of which I have to say from a parochial perspective is doing reasonably well.  The other two towns do not seem to be getting the IDA visits people on the ground would like.  What does an area or town need to do to get an IDA visit and what kind of money is invested by the IDA in a visit to attract people to the town to have a look at it?  </p> <p>  In his presentation, Mr. Shanahan said that there were 148 job losses in the miscellaneous sector.  Could he tell me what this sector is?  I come from the midlands which has become a pharma hub.  In his presentation, Mr. Shanahan said that there are fewer new jobs in the pharmaceutical sector.  Why is there a lack of growth in this sector?  It seem to be doing very well and the perception is that it is doing well but Mr. Shanahan says that there are fewer jobs in the pharmaceutical sector and less growth.  What is the reason for this?  </p> <p>  People think IDA visits are the most important thing and they forget about Enterprise Ireland, indigenous companies and jobs that are being provided.  There is an obsession with getting an IDA visit and getting a factory into a town.</p></speech>

As I pointed out in my opening statement, we are at an all-time high in terms of the number of people employed in multinationals.  The number of IDA site visits fluctuates but it is true to say that it has declined a little.  There are a couple of reasons for this.  First, site visits have probably become less important in a very connected age.  Companies can do a huge amount from corporate head offices in the US, Europe or elsewhere.  They can get to know an area and we can talk to them and show them a lot about an area and a particular building so the physical site visits the Deputy says there is a preoccupation with have become less important.  They will become less important as we try to do more in the space of showing people what Ireland is like without them having to touch down here or having to repeatedly touch down.</p> <p>  People overlook the fact that a significant portion of our investment comes from existing companies who are growing their presence in Ireland either in the locations in which they are located or alternative locations.  Zimmer, which already had a very strong base in Shannon, announced in the first few weeks of the year that it was opening up a 250-person operation in Oranmore.  Obviously, the requirement for site visits where companies already have a good understanding of Ireland and an area declines.  We present companies who are coming in for site visits with proposed itineraries and locations so we get a sense of what they are looking for and what might take their fancy.  They ultimately decide where they would like to visit.  It could be that they have some perception of a particular area, they know another company that is in the area or they have sold well to a particular area.  That changes over time.  Site visits are not the ultimate arbiter or even a good proxy of our performance if one looks at site visits relative to the investment and increases in employment.</p><p>The pharmaceutical sector has performed very well for Ireland over many years.  Obviously the sector hit the patent cliff which resulted in it taking a pause as companies tried to figure out where they sat within that.  Ireland has probably not been as heavily impacted by the patent cliff as was initially thought.  We are seeing further investment in the bio-pharmaceutical sector, with Bristol-Meyers Squibb announcing a $900 million investment in Cruiserath in north Dublin, for example, after last year's budgetary announcement.  We are also seeing a huge amount of mergers and acquisitions activity within the sector, as companies trade different elements of their businesses, merge or divest.  Some of that still has to play out and we will then see what comes through on the next wave of development.</p><p> I will have to double-check to what the reference to "miscellaneous industry" relates, unless one of my colleagues knows.  I will have to double-check which companies are being referred to, but clearly they are companies which we found difficult to categorise under any of the other headings.</p></speech>

As I said, I represent a two-county constituency which has three large towns.  How can local councillors and I, as public representatives, get IDA Ireland to look at the other two towns and try to sell them better than they are being sold at the moment?</p></speech>

As I said earlier, either a senior manager from IDA Ireland or Enterprise Ireland will be charged with developing those plans, but both agencies will be involved in each region in the development of the plans.  That will be about what we will do in each region, from a top-down perspective, but mainly it will be about trying to bring forward ideas from the regions themselves and the towns within them as to what they think they can do.  That might involve a branding initiative, the development of a missing piece of infrastructure and so forth.  For our part, we will help regions and towns identify what we believe are the most challenging areas in terms of attractiveness for foreign direct investment.</p> <p>  It would be very helpful from an IDA perspective for public representatives to talk up their areas and regions.  That is hugely important because our clients can Google. They can Google the proceedings of these Houses and even the proceedings of this committee come up in Google searches-----</p></speech>

Will Mr. Shanahan, by way of a submission to the committee, give us the criteria behind the selection of those areas and tell us what brought them across the line?  I am looking at 2011, 2012 and 2013 in the context of jobs created and am bearing in mind that the IDA proposes to put one of the buildings in Carlow, which is in my constituency.  In Carlow the IDA created 197 jobs in 2011, 132 in 2012, and 91 in 2013, but in the other part of that constituency, Kilkenny, the IDA created only one job in 2011, 125 in 2012 and 80 in 2013.  I do not propose to go through every county but to read the data on a selection.  In Laois the IDA created two jobs in 2011 and none in 2012 and 2013.  In Limerick, which Deputy O'Donovan was speaking about, in spite of the question about the landbank there and how it will be dealt with, the IDA created 253 jobs in 2011, 556 in 2012 and 560 in 2013.  I know that Dublin has a critical mass but when people outside of the capital look at these figures, in spite of the counties being talked up by their public representatives, they see 7,351 jobs were created in Dublin in 2011, 8,464 jobs in 2012 and 6,862 jobs in 2013.  The public would suggest to us that our efforts, our political policies and the efforts of the IDA have, by and large, failed some of the regions or some of the counties within those regions.</p></speech>

Indeed, I think I set them out earlier for one of the Deputies.  We look at places where we believe we may be able to win and attract investment.  Such locations generally have an existing base of enterprise, whether that be IDA or Enterprise Ireland companies that act as a cluster, and a critical mass of population and a talent pool that we can draw on.  Members will note that all of the areas that were identified yesterday have either an institute of technology or a university.  We also look at the extent to which the private sector is stepping up in terms of providing these advance solutions.  Clearly if they are doing so, then the IDA would not step into the area.  Our preference is that the private sector steps up and provides these solutions.</p></speech>

They have not been encouraged to provide even more buildings because they were not sure that they would secure tenants for them.  I am particularly taken by the fact that Mr. Shanahan has said that the IDA would meet county councils and so forth.  One such council wrote to the IDA on 10 October seeking a meeting but it still has not secured one.</p> <p>  I respect the job that the IDA does, by the way.</p><p>I am not in any way being critical of the overall approach, with the exception that the regions have suffered and that county councils have made every effort, with the support of their Oireachtas Members, to highlight the problems in some of these counties.  By and large, they have not been successful.  My political career started in 1979.  I can remember when a then Fine Gael Deputy - a well-respected Deputy - was making the case that a great number of jobs were attracted to centres such as Dublin, Limerick, Cork and Waterford, and I can understand that.  However, the regions have been making representations for a long time, leading delegations to meet Ministers of various political persuasions and, by and large, they have not been successful.  I refer to what Deputy McFadden said this morning.  The councils ask what they have to do to market their county and to make the IDA understand that they are attractive places in which to live.  The information in the table shows a significant imbalance as to where these jobs go and how they are attracted here.</p></speech>

What I am trying to bring to the discussion is some of the reality about the extent to which the expectations can be met, no matter how hard IDA markets a particular area.  In my response to Deputy O'Donovan, I was trying to put in context that a whole region will have a population base of 500,000 people, from within which we have to draw a talent pool.  We are competing with numerous international mega-cities which have multiples of that.  This is the reality of being out in the market and trying to attract companies.  I will be honest with the Chairman by explaining that they are blind to county borders and blind to cities or towns.  They want to know that they can achieve what they need to do in the area, which is to set up and attract the talent.  To attract the talent, locations need to be attractive places in which to live and work and provide all of the other things, such as the infrastructure and public transport.  That is the reality.  It is not within our gift to move these investments around.  They make the ultimate decision.  What we can do and what we will do is to work with the local authorities.  I am surprised to learn that a county council has written to us and has not received a response because it is normal practice in the IDA to respond to all sorts of correspondence, much of which comes from public representatives at local level.  We will continue to work with local authorities and there will be a more structured forum now through the regional action plans.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that the IDA is successful in attracting companies to come to the country.  However, once the companies identify Ireland as a place in which to set up, what happens then and who influences that company?  They may be influenced by the capital and so on, but others are not.  I have been out in the marketplace and I understand the challenges.  This is not meant as a political charge against this Government but looking at some of the factories that located in different places, one would almost believe that a constituency would need a Minister to get a visit or a factory.  They may visit a number of counties.  Politicians and Oireachtas Members, in particular, are often accused of not carrying enough weight even to get a visit.  The criteria for arranging these visits and the background to the consideration of the visits needs to be explained in greater detail to the public at large in order that they understand that we are not sitting on our hands with regard to the counties we represent as national parliamentarians.  We are not allowing it to be sucked into one centre because we want to see it divided fairly throughout the country, regardless of who represents the different counties or constituencies.</p></speech>

Of the 197 investments made last year, 88 came from our new name investments.  The other investments are expansions or other types of investment from the existing portfolio which already have a presence.  I gave Deputy McFadden an example of where a company decided to set up a second site in Ireland but such companies are more likely to expand in the location where they are based.  From where I sit, the best approach to regional development is that we market regions and also the strong urban areas within those regions.  We are not competing within Ireland or even within a region.  We are competing with this project going to another European destination, remaining in the US because the US states have upped their game in terms of attractiveness, or going to a country in Asia.</p></speech>

As I responded to Deputy Deasy earlier, it is part of the arsenal and I believe that there is probably too much emphasis on tax both internationally and sometimes nationally.  For companies to operate here, they need to be able to set up and operate in a business environment that enables them to attract the talent they need.  When I walk into boardrooms across the world, talent availability is the number one thing raised with us.  A competitive tax regime is absolutely a help in attracting companies to Ireland and we should not be apologetic about that.  We need a competitive tax regime to do it.</p></speech>

I have different pictures from Mr. Shanahan and from the multinationals about that, but presumably that is understandable.  I apologise I was not present when Deputy Deasy posed questions.  The double Irish scenario and so on were touched on I am sure and the developments in the US where President Obama is examining the issue of multinationals, some of which are client companies of IDA Ireland, putting their money offshore and returning it to the US.  Is IDA Ireland making efforts to lobby Congress to make sure Ireland is not disadvantaged if there is a change?</p></speech>

We monitor them closely.  I said in response to Deputy Deasy that a number of initiatives and developments are happening worldwide - base erosion and profit shifting under the OECD being one.  There are initiatives at European level and there have been new announcements of proposals and developments in the US.  The thrust of all of them is an increasing alignment between the tax liability of companies and substance.  My belief is, as that progresses, it will be beneficial for Ireland because of our attractive corporate tax rate of 12.5%.</p></speech>

It is an attempt to take tax more and more out of the equation, which, as I said in response to Deputy Deasy, will probably increasingly happen over time anyway and we need to work on the other competitive advantages we have, which influence companies in making decisions.  There are many proposals.  The Deputy has referred to a specific set of proposals made by President Obama but there have been many proposals on tax reform in the US and other jurisdictions.  We cannot respond to everything.  People have opinions and they voice them but they have to go through a process and I do not know what the outcome will be in respect of the current set of proposals.</p></speech>

We go out and we win investment in a competitive environment.  Some of that competition comes because of the way tax rates are structured or because we do not have the critical mass of urban areas or all the talent we would like to have available.  On the other hand, we win more investment than we could probably expect given the size of the country and on a metric such as our share of GDP among the EU28, we outperform other countries.  We do so because we have a competitive tax offering currently and we need to continue to protect that and build on it.  We have probably some of the best talent available worldwide.  Ireland is an attractive place to live and work and we have attractive urban areas, even if they are not international cities of scale.  That is what we compete on.</p></speech>

There was approximately &euro;8 million worth of transactions involved in this regard.  Will Mr. Shanahan provide details of the directors involved and of the companies with which they were involved?  I am referring to instances where grants were provided to companies.  The total amount involved - approximately &euro;8 million - is disclosed, as is information regarding grants awarded and grants paid.  For some reason, however, information is not provided in respect of the directors or the companies involved.  I do not know why that is.  Enterprise Ireland always produces information in this regard when we require it.  Is Mr. Shanahan in a position to produce it?</p></speech>

I do not have the details relating to it to hand.  My understanding is that one of the reasons they are not included in the annual report - I will verify this for the Deputy - is that there would be company specifics involved and that might pose a difficulty from a commercial perspective.  In the context of companies, we do not normally disclose commercial dealings.  However, that is not the case with regard to individual board members who may have been conflicted.  In so far as it does not create a commercial issue, we would obviously be delighted to provide the relevant information.</p></speech>

It has three offices in China in Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong.  The office in Hong Kong has responsibility for Taiwan and we have what we term a "pathfinder" in that market, which is also the case with many other markets.  Pathfinders are individuals who operate in a private capacity and who provide services, as required, to clients of Enterprise Ireland.  The scale of the exports and client demand and interests involved would not warrant us having a office in Taiwan.</p></speech>

Those countries generate trade to and from Taiwan.  They have an immediate market there in view of the fact that the population of the Taiwan is 24 million.  Taiwan has protocols and cross-Strait agreements with China.  Everybody else deals with Taiwan.  In fact, New Zealand, which is in direct competition with Ireland in the context of the food industry, recently concluded a huge deal with that country.  However, we are not represented in Taiwan.  Mr. Sherry may say that Enterprise Ireland has three offices in China.  However, these do not serve the Taiwanese market in an adequate way.  There is a European office in Taiwan which looks after the interests of the European Union in general.  In order to be involved in a market, one needs to have a physical presence in it.  Some 16 other European countries have such a physical presence in Taiwan.  Ireland is ignoring a market of 24 million people.  We celebrated the notion that the market in China has been opened to Irish beef.</p><p>The market in Taiwan is open to Irish beef.  I know that is not Mr. Sherry's specific area.  There are 200 Irish nationals in Taiwan and some of them are employed in some of the biggest American companies.  They cannot understand why enterprise bodies are not tapping into their resources and neither can they understand why Enterprise Ireland ended its presence in Taiwan.  Why do the enterprise bodies not have an office there when 16 other competitors have offices?  It has nothing to do with a One China policy.  We all recognise that, as does Taiwan, yet Enterprise Ireland does not get involved there.  I have been asking the question of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland for three or four years.  Nobody can comprehend why this country, which pins all of its hopes on an export boom, if one likes, to take us out of the recession, would ignore 24 million people in the Taiwanese market.</p></speech>

We service it from Hong Kong.  Our territory director visits there regularly.  We have a pathfinder in place.  We have 32 offices around the world.  Wherever possible, we co-locate with either the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, through the consulate or embassy, or another agency.  We obviously have to make decisions about where we locate the offices, which is primarily driven by a combination of factors.  Those factors are, first, the market opportunity and the capability of Irish companies to service the market opportunity in particular sectors.  The second is the client demand for that particular market.  The third is, increasingly, what we have tried to focus on in terms of the development of our network, in that there has been a change in terms of the requirements of our clients from just a geographic presence to specific domain expertise.  We referred previously to the specific expertise we require as a team and as an organisation to service the needs of our clients, which is more about the specific sector expertise.  We spoke earlier about the pharmaceutical sector with IDA Ireland.  Whether it is medical devices, telecommunications or other areas such as financial services, our clients are looking for us to have specific expertise in those particular areas - to have the Rolodex and the networks and to understand the market dynamics in those particular sectors in order that we can help them access the contacts in those markets, and also to work with them in helping them to develop market strategies where they can penetrate those markets.</p> <p>  The way we operate is that, increasingly, we have moved to having a network where the specialist expertise that we cannot put in every office is developed within certain offices in the region that can provide the expertise across the region.  In parallel with that what we have done is build out our external network of pathfinders who effectively are trade consultants around the globe and we have expanded the network with people who have specific expertise that can assist our clients when required and that we would network them to those individuals.  We constantly review our overseas office network and make decisions based on those criteria about where we should locate offices.  In some cases that will result in us closing offices, which we have done.  To give some examples of that, we have closed an office in Glasgow and Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia.  We moved our office in India from Delhi to Mumbai.  We have also opened other offices.  We opened an office in Austin, Texas and in-----</p></speech>

My question is about Taiwan and a market of 24 million people.  One can go there and be served New Zealand lamb and Scotch whisky but one would find it hard to get anything to do with Ireland.  The complaint being made is that there is no presence.  One cannot work a market unless there is someone in it.  If I am not mistaken, there are 16 other European countries working that marketplace.  How do the witnesses expect to get any share of the market, which is worth &euro;500 million in exports and imports?  How do the agencies hope to exploit the arrangements between Taiwan and China on the protocols and cross-trade agreements that are in place or in the protection of intellectual property rights?  The view has been taken that it is quite safe to do it this way than by going directly to China.  Another issue relates to the movement of Chinese factories into Vietnam and how they are being built.  Yet, we have nobody in Taiwan.</p></speech>

The choice of offices is a response to clients&rsquo; needs.  At any stage if we see that there is a need to open an office, as opposed to just dealing with it from another territory, and with trade consultants in place, we will then decide, as we have done recently, for example, in South Africa where we have now decided to put an office.</p></speech>

The other 16 countries in Europe who are there do not understand why that was done.  That is their view on it.  I am getting the view of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland today.  I believe the agencies should fund an office in Taiwan because of the volume of goods and services being requested and being made and delivered from that location.  There are 200 Irish people there who are connected to some of the biggest companies in Taiwan and, bar one, their expertise and knowledge of the market has never been exploited either.  All of the effort is centred on China and the other Asian markets and Taiwan has been shoved to one side.  I urge that the position would be reviewed.  I have asked Ministers to review the matter previously.  I was told that it has nothing to do with the One China policy.  It is about a market of 24 million people.  I see all the other offices there.  It is difficult to see a market of 24 million people where we are not represented.  The witnesses might say Taiwan is serviced from mainland China but that is no substitute for a greater effort in the marketplace.</p></speech>

I support the Chairman&rsquo;s position.  Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland had a representative office there a few years ago.  The question is whether it is cost effective to have someone based in Taipei.  Opportunities are presented by a market of 24 million people.  Given the visa waiver programme, there are opportunities in Asia and the Chinese market.  I put it to Ms Sinnamon that perhaps an outreach office could be considered if not a fully-fledged one, where a person is located as opposed to having someone go there occasionally.  The Chairman has made the point very clearly.  There is currently investment from the European office and the UK office, which I have seen myself.  There is an opportunity for trade, especially in the context of Food Horizon 2020 with dairy products.  The market is consolidated and is very much English speaking.</p><p>I concur with the Chairman's very clear opinion on it.</p></speech>

They made a huge contribution to the overall well-being of the State in recent years when we were in deep recession.  If it were not for the activities of the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, with regard to exports and bringing in new companies and investments it would have been far more difficult for us to have survived an extremely difficult period.  The success of the IDA and Enterprise Ireland was one of the differences between us and other countries in programmes, such as Greece, Portugal and Spain.</p> <p>  With regard to the specific issue we are discussing, which the Chairman raised, 32 seems to be a very small number of offices for Enterprise Ireland to have abroad.  It also looks strange that Enterprise Ireland will have 55 redundancies.  The question of Ireland house, and the degree to which various State agencies co-operate in co-location, is a live issue.  There is much to be desired.  This would involve the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the entire tourist industry, and Irish multinationals such as ESB International.  Much more could be done to maximise having a type of Ireland house throughout the world.  That Enterprise Ireland has only 32 offices when there are almost 200 countries in the world, not to talk about the number of these offices which are in the United States, means we are spread very thinly.  The end result is that three quarters of IDA activity is in the United States, from where three quarters of investment has come.  The figure for Europe is 19% and it is 8% from the rest of the world.  How is this being addressed to get a better balance?  There is no doubt the United States is an absolute phenomenon with regard to the quality, degree and quantity of inward investment, but it shows up the other side of the coin, whereby the rest of the world is poorly represented.  We have rapidly-growing markets and companies in the far east and Latin America.  I would like to get a response as to why the proportions remain the same.</p> <p>  I do not know whether this question has been asked, but do we market the entire island?  To what degree is Northern Ireland engaged with Enterprise Ireland and the IDA in terms of marketing the island and inward investment?</p> <p>  A question was asked about attracting business from abroad to regional areas.  Under the auspices of the European Union we created a huge necklace of regional colleges which became institute of technologies, including in Letterkenny, Sligo, Mayo, Galway, Kerry, Carlow and Waterford.  Surely it should be easy to put together a cluster of skills from each of these, and include counties which do not have institutes of technology, to market the regions to companies abroad.  The Chairman pointed out certain counties receive little or no inward investment.  Surely they could be attached to an institute of education in the vicinity to create a skill cluster and talent pool which could be marketed.</p> <p>  Is the Irish education system responding adequately to talent requirements?  We are very heavily into the IT and financial services sectors in which many of the skills involved are fairly advanced.  Is the system sufficiently geared to respond to employment needs?  What percentage of people are recruited from abroad to service new investment coming into the country?</p> <p>  How is ethical investment dealt with?  Does the IDA have a specific approach to attract to Ireland companies it deems to be ethical which deal with the Third World and have a particular approach?</p></speech>

I will begin by speaking about our resources and Mr. Sherry will speak about collaboration abroad and how we work effectively on this.</p> <p>  Over the past year we have recruited an additional 20 people to beef up our overseas network.  The recruitment programme was approved approximately a year ago and it has been completed.  More people are in the field working with Irish companies.  As I stated, we have gone through a voluntary redundancy programme in Ireland.  While more than 20 people are being recruited to work overseas, 47 people have agreed to exit under the voluntary programme in Ireland.  We have approval from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to recruit an additional 21 staff.  It is about reskilling the organisation, adding additional resources overseas and changing how we operate.  We have also brought on board a large number of trade consultants - we call them pathfinders - in 55 countries.  While we have 32 offices worldwide, we have trade consultants who help us in countries where we do not have offices.  We constantly review whether we need an office, which is driven by companies responding to clients' needs and constantly examining what is happening in countries and whether we need to increase our resources.</p></speech>

We have 32 offices overseas, 18 of which are co-located with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Typically more than one agency is co-located with Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in those locations, for example, IDA, Bord Bia, and in some cases Tourism Ireland.  In the United Arab Emirates, the embassy is in Abu Dhabi but we are co-located with the visa office in Dubai.  We recently opened an office in Perth and are co-located with the honorary counsel.  We are co-located with another agency in six other offices and in the remaining six locations there is no other agency as the embassy or consulate is located in the political capital.  The Deputy would be well aware that in South Africa the embassy is located in Pretoria, which is the political capital and we are located in Johannesburg which is the commercial capital.  On the east coast of Australia we are co-located in Sydney with the consulate, while the embassy is in Canberra.  In locations where we do not have a physical presence ourselves as our chief executive, Ms Julie Sinnamon has said, we use a network of pathfinders.  We work hand in glove with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.<br/><br/>As the Deputy knows the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has a much more extensive network in Africa.  Last year Enterprise Ireland brought all the commercial counsellors together and set up a training programme for them.  We work hand in glove with the commercial counsellors and get tremendous co-operation not just on trade missions but daily.  Similarly, as I mentioned earlier, we work hand in hand with IDA on overseas trade missions and have access to networks.  <br/><br/>We are able to leverage those networks.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has a global Irish network programme and we operate with a subset of that, we have a global Irish contacts programme, which is a smaller grouping of the global Irish network who are committed to providing assistance to indigenous Irish companies by providing contacts and networks to get in the right doors overseas.<br/><br/>On the question of marketing the island of Ireland, we collaborate and work very closely with Invest NI in certain area.  Ms Sinnamon<b></b>mentioned the skills programmes, which Enterprise Ireland runs and Invest NI has companies that participate on these programmes.Earlier last month Ms Sinnamon together with representatives from Invest NI and UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment, UKTI, led a joint mission to United Arab Emirates on Arab health.  We  meet them on a very regular basis.  We had a joint meeting with the UKTI team in Dublin last week.  They are running a series of initiatives, in which we are involved and we can encourage Irish companies to participate in them.  UKTI runs a programme called large opportunities programme, where they target a range of potential large construction opportunities across the globe.  We have collaborated on a number of programmes where we believe there are specific opportunities for Irish companies.<br/><br/>Most recently we moved our office in Stockholm from what was a stand-alone office into co-locating with the embassy.  Wherever we can co-locate we do.</p></speech>

As the Deputy pointed out approximately 70% of foreign direct investment comes from North America, 20% comes from Europe and 10% from growth markets.  Foreign direct investment from the US has performed over many years and that market is currently experiencing extremely strong growth.  That is encouraging and will be beneficial to us.</p> <p>  In the past number of years Europe has been flat but we would expect to see some growth in the level of investment emanating from Europe in the coming years.  We would like to increase our market share in Europe.  There is a need for investment of resources in offices and staff in growth markets but it will require a longer period to gain a return.  We have to build the relationships.  The Deputy will be keenly aware of the importance of government to government relationships in those markets as well as the commercial relationships underneath.  We are starting to see some returns from both India and China but it will take time to ramp it up.  Our ambition is to achieve a more balanced portfolio.</p> <p>  The institutes of technology, the then regional technical colleges, are key attractors.  I referred to this in my response to Deputy Deasy and the Chairman.  Part of the reason we market regions is that they had institutes of technology which can feed the region.  The ITs are a significant asset in terms of achieving regional development.  Will Mr. Clohessy add to what I have said? </p></speech>

The decisions by IDA are evidence based on the opportunity for Ireland to win some of the business that comes from foreign direct investment from particular countries or regions.  Consequently as Mr. Kevin Sherry has alluded to we keep an eye on the location of our offices to ascertain if they are in the right places.  At a headline level it is based on an analysis of the data of their outward foreign direct investment into Europe and what Ireland can win.  We keep that under review.</p> <p>  The IDA has 21 offices, seven of which are in North America, three are in Europe and 11 are located in the rest of the world.  Our default principle is to co-locate with the embassy or other agencies, where that makes sense.  Some 12 of the 21 offices are co-located with other agencies or embassy and nine are stand-alone offices for specific outbound foreign direct investment.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the marketing of the island of Ireland, obviously when IDA is marketing Ireland for foreign direct investment it focuses on what the whole of the island offers, the sub-supply base, third level infrastructure and the talent base.  The client making a decision to locate in Ireland has a choice of jurisdiction.</p></speech>

I appreciate there is a level of contact and collaboration so I am not asking about that but about the untapped potential.

The IMD or World Bank shows us progressing upward.  The cost base is probably the most significant element feeding into that because the cost base in the early to mid-2000s was much higher as there was significant competition for resources, human, capital and everything else in the State when we were experiencing a property bubble.  Our investment in research feeds into that, creating a talent pool.  Labour market indices show we are improving.  Our business environment and the ease of doing business are seen as extremely attractive and we improve on that annually.  It is one of the main purposes of the action plan for jobs.  We are moving up on that sub-index.</p></speech>

It is all-encapsulating.  Ireland is normally first or second on the indices for ease of doing business.  Companies that come here experience a very welcoming environment.  They do not find a lot of bureaucracy or unnecessary administrative overhead.  They do not find that in Ireland, which does very well in that regard.

The most obvious cost reduction is in property, the demand for and price of property.  The cost of property for companies, whether Irish or international, or the rental demands, fell significantly.  The unit wage cost has fallen in recent years.  That does not necessarily mean that wages have fallen but it could mean they are not increasing relative to other countries.  If they are flat here and increase elsewhere we become more competitive.  In some cases there were wage reductions and the cost of employment fell over the period.</p></speech>

He would not regard that as one of the pull factors.</p></speech>

We market Ireland on the basis of the value added.  While our wages are higher we believe, and the evidence shows, that the employees add more value so we do not market Ireland as a low wage economy.</p></speech>

If the minimum wage were to increase would it make Mr. Shanahan's job more difficult in getting inward investment?  In every budgetary cycle when people put forward their proposals there is an automatic assumption that if anything is done to remedy low wages or to make certain changes to the taxation code the automatic consequence would be that foreign direct investment, FDI, would fall off or disappear entirely, depending on who one listens to.  If the minimum wage were to ratchet up by &euro;1 or &euro;2 an hour what implications would that have?  Ms Sinnamon might comment on that too.</p></speech>

This is a matter of scale.  I cannot say what one thing will be the final straw.  The detail is difficult.  Items that add cost to employment or to employing somebody have a negative impact on investors and potential investment.  Increases in wages, minimum or otherwise, of themselves are not a bad thing in the sense that the ambition of all economies and societies is for people to earn more and have a good standard of living but wage movement should be connected to productivity.  Where we gain more productivity and the increases are justified that is great.  Increases in themselves, not connected to productivity, are problematic because they make us less competitive and make it more difficult to attract FDI.  The last time I considered the minimum wage, in my previous position, my recollection is that it impacts approximately 4% of the labour force.  It sets a floor for other jobs up to a certain point within the labour market.  Movements at that level do have an impact but it is impossible to say what exactly in isolation.  It is a question of the overall package.</p></speech>

The key interaction happens at the executive level.  What we have in the Republic is critical mass in terms of running programmes to develop our companies.  In the North, they do not have the group of companies with the critical mass to run the types of programmes that we run.  All of our programmes for developing our client base in terms of leadership and management development are open to companies on both sides of the Border.  Effectively, at one stage there were small numbers of companies participating.  Those numbers have increased significantly and we share all of that information.  It is a completely collaborative relationship between the two agencies.</p><p> I was saying earlier that, recently, Invest Northern Ireland did tender for a programme and it was granted to Dublin City University, DCU.  That probably would not have happened before they started working with us, with the likes of DCU with their programme.  There is a high level, and out of those programmes the companies form relationships and do business together.</p><p> One of the sectors where the highest growth is happening at present is food.  Lakeland made an announcement last week that at least 50% of the milk from Monaghan and Lakeland is coming from north of the Border.  The investment we are making in companies here is having a positive impact on the community in Northern Ireland and certainly that is important.</p><p> From a research and development perspective, we have been working very successfully and are probably exemplars in Europe on the seventh framework programme, FP7.  We are now charged with responsibility for &euro;1.25 billion targets for Horizon 2020.  Colleagues here from Enterprise Ireland working on that agenda would be collaborating with Invest Northern Ireland in terms of sharing what we are doing and trying to collaborate cross-Border with a view to doing things together on that side.  Again, there is a very open approach to it.  </p><p> In terms of the international education side, that is an area where there is opportunity for us to do more.  Through the UK Trade and Investment, UKTI, Invest Northern Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, EI, engagement, we are constantly working on a number of programmes.  We had the Dubai visit last week, which was three groups of companies.  The biggest event we run, every two years, is MedinIreland, where we bring in 300 or 400 buyers from overseas into Ireland to look at the very strong cluster of medtech early-stage companies that we have.  This year, for the first time, Invest Northern Ireland clients will participate in that in the convention centre with our companies. </p><p> There is a very strong positive working relationship between the two sides.  We do not see ourselves as competing against them.  It is probably in many ways more one-way traffic.  There is more to be gained from Northern Ireland collaborating with us.  Yesterday, I was in touch with Invest Northern Ireland companies who are trying to access the North and asking them could they use their contacts to get companies here into Northern Ireland to do business.  There is a very strong positive view.</p><p> On the issue of low wages, it has more impact in some sectors than others.  In some of the lower-paid jobs within the food sector, it would be more of a problem than in some of the more high-tech areas where people are paid well beyond the minimum wage.  One of the issues we are working on with all our companies - we are working with about 300 companies per annum - is the whole lean agenda, which is about trying to take costs out of the system and be more productive with whatever staff is there, to be able to get better productivity through the companies and be able then to deal with wage rates in that way.  The whole lean agenda is very important in terms of addressing that issue.</p></speech>

They know there is now the possibility of the corporate tax rate north of the Border ratcheting down and perhaps to harmonise with the level in the South.

It is obviously important to the existing base of Irish companies.  The change in the rate in Northern Ireland has less impact on us in that we are not trying to attract foreign direct investment into Ireland, so we are not in that competitive space.</p></speech>

I would hasten to add that our competition is not North or South, it is the entire globe.  Multinationals have a lot of options in respect of their location.</p></speech>

My view as a republican, as the witnesses will not be surprised to hear, is that the relationships ought to be collaborative and harmonised rather than competitive.  It is nuts to have IDA Ireland and Invest NI out state-side or anywhere else competing for the same business.  I know that is just the reality of how things may happen now, but that is why I raised the issue of the potential for wins all around.  I thank the witnesses for those insights.</p></speech>

I hope Enterprise Ireland will keep a close eye on them.  Can you tell me the cost of the new arrangement?  Was there a cost in terminating the CEBs and then a cost of setting up these local enterprise offices?  Will you have direct responsibility for them?</p></speech>

That is about to be reviewed within the next number of months.  The money to the LEOs will flow through Enterprise Ireland - the &euro;30 million or so that will be there.</p><p> In terms of the question the Chairman asked about cost, it was actually quite minimal.  In fact we would hope to have some savings because obviously there will be the integration with a number of the financial, IT systems and that.  Enterprise Ireland did most of the work ourselves - our finance department, our HR people, our legal people and our IT services provided a lot of the supports to help the move from the stand-alone CEBs into the local authorities.  By our reckoning, although we need to lock down these figures yet, we could be saving maybe somewhere in the region of &euro;500,000 as a consequence of the move because obviously one will be running the one payroll, the one IT system, etc.</p></speech>

I think there are six still to move and there are genuine reasons that they have not moved as yet.  One or two would be in community enterprise centres and they would be an important part in terms of the critical mass of that particular centre or a lease has still to run.  However, the vast majority, 25, have moved.</p></speech>

Enterprise Ireland needs to ensure it has a clear line of sight on the audit conducted by the local government audit team so that it gets some sort of report on the money Enterprise Ireland has given to these local enterprise offices so that in turn the Comptroller and Auditor General can look at and we can examine it.  It is all taxpayers' money.</p> <p>  I have a deep concern about the audit of local government and adding to it.  I hear very little public debate about money and I see nothing other than occasional controversies throughout the country about how money was spent and they keep on telling us that is not within our remit.  The taxpayer finds that hard to understand.  I would hate to see another layer of money being given that cannot be dealt with in terms of audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General or by us.  We will be relying heavily on Enterprise Ireland's reporting mechanism from each of those LEOs.</p></speech>

No one seems to trace it after that as accurately as one would like on behalf of the taxpayer.  I hope Enterprise Ireland can set a model in place that could be followed by others where there is transparency right down to the spend of the taxpayers' money and that we can have a clear line of sight on that.</p></speech>

There is an Enterprise Ireland person on every single evaluation committee locally on each LEO.  Projects above a certain amount come to a sub-committee of the board of Enterprise Ireland to ensure that the project or the support is policy-driven and driven on the basis of value for money as well.  I take the point.</p></speech>

To recap briefly on the CEC scheme, there were four schemes.  Some 117 centres have been constructed and built around the country.  As I said earlier, they house over 1,000 companies with 6,000 people employed there.  Three years ago under the business development manager model, we supported 46 of those in a competitive call with a manager.  The evidence suggests that those centres that had a manager performed extremely well.  In fact, I have the figures in terms of how they have increased over the past couple of years.  Many of those have now run out.</p> <p>  Under the regional enterprise strategy announced yesterday, it is now planned to launch over the next number of months a new programme, which will be a three-pronged programme of which one element will be the business development manager, recognising that they play a key role in helping, assisting and supporting the enterprise centre.</p></speech>

The contracts started to run out between 2012 and 2014.  Now there is some urgency about this because there is a question mark over performance, future funding and all of that.

I forgot to mention the number of students who travel from Taiwan to the UK.  It is a huge business.  A few of them end up here in Ireland and they are anxious to promote a student exchange between Ireland and Taiwan.  In fact arrangements are already in place to allow that to happen.  However, given even the spin-off from that, it is important for us to have a share of that market because one is not just sharing the market but sharing an experience of our culture and perhaps a friendship that will serve us in years to come.  I would like to think that both organisations would consider a permanent presence in Taipei and that they will come back and let us know what progress has been made.  Perhaps they might check out what I have just said about the presence of people from other European countries there without any problem from anyone and doing considerable business.  It is hard to drink a Scotch whisky over there when one could have Jameson, but there is none on the market, so I am told - I do not drink.</p></speech>

In fact, under the new strategy now, each of the local authorities will have an opportunity to come forward with innovative ideas they may have in terms of job creation activities, whether it is in terms of building infrastructure locally or providing or further encouraging support to people to start a business.  We will put a certain onus back on local authorities and the supports will be there then in return to help them to fund those businesses.</p></speech>

I welcome viewers on UPC and Sky channels, on which the meeting is being broadcast live.</p> <p>  The joint committee is continuing its series of meetings on what would happen in Ireland if the United Kingdom were to decide to exit from the European Union.  A referendum on this question has been promised by the Prime Minister, Mr. David Cameron, if he is returned to power in the forthcoming elections in the United Kingdom, which are scheduled to take place in May.  The committee has decided to examine this issue now because of the potential impact on Ireland and the many Irish citizens living in the United Kingdom.  Today we will hear from Mr. Fabian Zuleeg, chief executive of the European Policy Centre, and Mr. Roland Freudenstein, deputy director and head of research at the Centre for European Studies in Brussels on the impact on EU decision making should the United Kingdom exit from the European Union.  I welcome both gentlemen.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/><br/>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-12a.557" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Roland Freudenstein" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015021200002#B00200"><p>I thank the Chairman for inviting me for a second time.  The first time cannot have been that bad.  Today I will talk about the possibility, not probability, of the United Kingdom exiting from the European Union.  A BrExit would be a very bad idea for Ireland, the rest of the European Union and Britain.  For Ireland, it would entail economic costs, hinder the free movement of labour and goods and complicate bilateral relations with the United Kingdom. The UK-Ireland border might well regress to an earlier state.  In the European Council voting powers might shift to larger states, the eurozone would become more powerful, while Germany might find itself more isolated.  On content, issues such as free trade, completing the Single Market and a strong transatlantic partnership would receive less attention.  The European Union's budget might come under severe strain.  Efforts to reform traditional areas of spending such as regional funds and agriculture would suffer.  Mr. Fabian Zuleeg will go into more detail on this aspect.  Strategically, the European Union would become much weaker in its global outreach and the eyes of partners.  This is important to all of us.  That is particularly true for diplomacy but also for security and defence policies whereby France would become the dominant power.<br/><br/>I will outline why BrExit matters to Ireland.  As members know, the United Kingdom is Ireland&rsquo;s most important economic partner.  Some 34% of Irish imports and 16% of Irish exports come from or go to the UK market.  The Republic of Ireland has long enjoyed special status for its citizens in the United Kingdom, including the freedom to travel and work without restriction in Britain.  Anglo-Irish political, economic, social and cultural linkages are well established, stable and of great importance to both states.  I am afraid there would be a risk of a detrimental development in this regard.<br/><br/>As for the decision-making mechanisms of the European Union, voting powers in the European Council would probably have to be redefined.  The qualified majority voting procedure would have to be redefined owing to the loss of 29 votes, 8.5% of the weighted votes, which would have a considerable effect on the balance of power.  A BrExit would increase the power of larger states in the Council.  This would happen since the average population size of the remaining EU member states would fall, while the individual power of the larger member states, including France and Germany, would increase.  Germany has very often formed <i>ad hoc</i>coalitions with the United Kingdom on particular issues such as trade and the EU budget.  Given that this would no longer be possible, Germany would be deprived of an important classical ally.  With the coming into force of the new qualified majority vote, QMV, in November 2014, the euro-19 will, in theory, be able to impose rules relating to the EU Single Market on other member states outside the eurozone, making the eurozone much more powerful.<br/><br/>Areas that have always been close to Ireland's interests would suffer as a result of a BrExit.  I refer to trade, completing the Single Market, business conditions and the transatlantic economic relationship, specifically TTIP.  These areas would find fewer supporters if Britain were to exit from the European Union.  Strategically, a BrExit would be a huge blow to the European Union's global standing.  France would be left as the only medium-sized European power with a global outreach and aspiration.<br/><br/>The British parliamentary delegation is the third largest group in the European Parliament and these seats would need to be reallocated or eliminated.  The socialists and democrats group would be weakened, given that the British Labour Party is such an important delegation within it.  While the European People's Party would not lose any member, it would lose a potential partner for <i>ad hoc</i>voting coalitions, given that the European conservatives and reformists in the European Parliament have often voted alongside it.  If the British Conservatives were to leave the European Parliament, there would be one less potential ally for the European People's Party.<br/><br/>The proportion of UK citizens in EU institutions has been decreasing for some time.  In the event of a BrExit, there would be no new employment of British citizens and those who retire would not be replaced by Britons.  Therefore, after some time there would be no British citizens in European institutions.  One consequences of this is that the Irish people would be the last remaining native English speakers in the European institutions.</p></speech>

In Brussels our pidgin English would get worse and there would be a renewed push to place more importance on French in the dealings of the European institutions, depending on the Commissioner and the Director General.  In summary, Irish interests would be affected, largely negatively, by a BrExit.</p></speech>

The European Policy Centre, EPC, which I represent is an independent multi-stakeholder think tank which is pro-European Union and supports the European integration process, although it has no particular political affiliation.  It will not come as a surprise that my general view on BrExit is that it would be detrimental to the United Kingdom and the rest of the European Union.  The costs would be economic and political and the balance of costs would fall much more strongly on the United Kingdom than on the rest of the European Union.  While the European Union could survive a BrExit, it would be costly, particularly for the United Kingdom.  A BrExit is a significant probability.</p><p>The referendum will happen at some point in time.  It is a question of timing rather than whether it happens at all.  It might not happen after the general election, depending on the outcome, but we already have a commitment on the table from the Labour Party that if there is another significant step in European integration, there would be a referendum in the United Kingdom.  The two major parties have committed to a referendum at some point in time and I believe we will see some further steps in European integration in the coming years, including potentially treaty changes.</p><p> It is difficult in this kind of session to be very precise about the impact of BrExit because there are a number of uncertainties, not least the question of where Britain would stand after a BrExit, what would be the access to the Single Market, the implications for freedom of movement, etc.  We cannot say what those would be at the moment because they would depend on an exit negotiation between the UK and the rest of the European Union.</p><p> If a BrExit happens, there is a chance that it will have a contagious effect on other countries but I would think that contagion would be relatively small.  I do not see that there are other countries where it is likely that there might be an exit, not least because we are generally talking about smaller countries which would find it very difficult to survive on their own outside the EU.  What we would also see in the case of a BrExit is significant pressure within the UK.  The question of what would happen to Scotland and Northern Ireland is also relevant at EU level, not least because if Scotland became independent, it would apply immediately to come into the EU.  BrExit and the future of the UK, therefore, are directly linked.</p><p> On the question of whether there will be more or less support for European integration with a BrExit, there can be two scenarios in that regard.  The optimistic scenario is where the EU, without the sometimes awkward partner of the UK, manages to define a common vision, to move forward much more decisively and to be able to make progress on the many construction sites we have at the moment.  There is also a more pessimistic scenario that we will go down the route of euro sclerosis, with very little change and progress.  This is a personal view but my tendency would be more towards the pessimistic scenario because regardless of whether the UK is within the EU or outside, I do not believe we have a consensus about the way forward in the EU.  In the past it has been very easy for member states at times to hide behind the attitude of the EU, be it on a number of different issues such as budget, further market integration or liberalisation.  A number of countries have been very happy to have the UK in front but when the UK is no longer part of the EU, it still does not remove the fundamental conflict between different political directions.  There would be a number of direct impacts of a BrExit on Ireland, many of which have been mentioned already.  </p><p> On the EU budget, clearly the UK is still a net payer into the budget so an exit of the UK would immediately mean we would have some form of renegotiation of the budget.  This opens up a huge political can of worms because as I said, there is no real agreement on the way forward.  A number of countries would see this as an opportunity to reduce the overall size of the budget.  A number of countries would believe the money which is then missing from the budget should be compensated by the existing net payers.  There would be also a great deal of political conflict within the EU.</p><p> The question on what will happen to trade and investment is an interesting one.  I generally would agree that we will have a negative impact but there is also a specific question for Ireland.  Ireland might well become a more attractive place with an exit of the UK, particularly for foreign direct investment.  Having a place in the Single Market which is English speaking and also has the euro could well be attractive for a number of outside investors.</p><p> I was also asked about social policy direction.  In looking at social policy we must examine the question of the process we would go through to get to the BrExit stage because what we have on the table, at least at the moment, is the expectation that there would be some kind of reform package.  That reform package would be heavily weighted in the interest of the UK and my expectation would be that some social policy changes would be in such a reform package, which would be offered to the British people to try to convince them to stay within the EU.</p><p> Overall, what we would see is that in some of the traditional areas of the UK interest would lose momentum.  They have already been mentioned, namely, trade, the Single Market, the transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP, and such areas.  The eurozone would be strengthened but, overall, we are in a position where the EU is not moving forward decisively in any area.  I am not saying it would be a significant change to the situation we are in.  What we have seen with the eurozone crisis is a situation where most member states only want to do what is absolutely necessary at the European level and are not very interested in driving forward integration in any area, regardless of the countries that might have an interest.</p><p> In terms of the decision-making process, it is also important to consider the question of whether the UK is an effective player currently in terms of advancing its interest.  What we have seen in recent years is a significant loss of influence of the UK.  To put it simply, if a country is no longer willing to make compromises at the European level it is very difficult for it to get its national interest to be heard.  A country cannot get its national interest through by putting a gun to the head and asking everyone to jump in the direction it wants to go.</p><p> BrExit is seen far too much as a domestic issue, a British issue.  For me, BrExit is a European issue.  It is something we should be thinking about far more at the European level.  We should be making contingency plans for a possible referendum and the kind of reform package we might be wiling to put on the table.  Such a reform package should be in the interest of the 28 member states, not in the interest of one member state.  We should also do contingency planning for a potential BrExit and decide the kind of deal that would be on the table for a UK outside the European Union and the kind of future of differentiated integration we are envisaging for the whole of the European Union.  </p><p> We should not forget that we are not only talking about the UK but a number of countries in the neighbourhood, the friends and neighbours we have around us, and where we have a pressing need to redefine our relationship.  How far can we have them integrated into the EU, even if they are outside the EU?  What does this imply in terms of market access and the free movement provisions for people?  We are playing some of these discussions through with Switzerland.</p><p>These are the kinds of discussions and considerations we should be looking at to a far greater extent in respect of BrExit.  I will stop there because I do not wish to go on for too long but I am happy to return to any of these issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-12a.563" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1076" speakername="Dominic Hannigan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015021200002#D00200"><p>I thank the witnesses and was glad to hear Mr. Zuleeg's comments about the need for a debate across Europe.  One reason the joint committee is having this debate now is that if the Conservatives win in May, one of the first items on that party's agenda will be discussions across Europe on how Europe can be changed and how the Conservatives can put some proposals to the people in advance of the referendum.  Should that come about in May, we in Ireland certainly would wish to be part of any negotiation.  The witnesses undoubtedly are aware of Cameron's Bloomberg speech a couple of years ago in which he outlined the type of changes he sought across Europe.  All of us are in favour of most of those changes and there is nothing there that is too controversial or with which we could find disagreement.  The witnesses are also probably aware of the review exercise undertaken by the Government of the United Kingdom on the balance of competences.  The review considered what powers might be better transferred back to the national parliaments and my understanding is that after going through a fairly exhaustive exercise across various departments, a limited number of items were found where powers perhaps could be returned to the national government.  In many ways, this was a tribute to the fine scrutiny work the Houses of Commons and Lords do and the joint committee receives reports from their scrutiny committees on a regular basis.  They are extremely thorough and well researched and ensure adherence to the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.</p> <p>  As for the type of requests one could expect to see from the United Kingdom should the Conservatives win the next election, much of the content of Cameron's speeches over the past 12 months focuses on matters such as the freedoms and, in particular, the freedom for movement.  From the witnesses' discussions across member states and from their perspective, what appetite do they believe exists for some sort of deal to be done with regard to the freedom of movement?  I acknowledge it is perceived to be a central pillar to the European Union.  Do they perceive any leeway or scope for a compromise in this regard?  Mr. Zuleeg mentioned that to date, he has not seen much discussion at a European level.  Are many other countries carrying out exercises similar to what the joint committee is doing here?  Obviously, Ireland is greatly affected because of its unique position with regard to the United Kingdom.  However, as he noted, other countries will also be affected, should the United Kingdom leave.  At what stage is the debate in other European countries?</p> <p>  I will ask a couple of other members to come in, the first of them being Deputy Crowe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-12a.564" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015021200002#D00300"><p>Some of my questions will complement those of the Chairman.  I had intended to ask how much concern there is in Europe.  Professor McCarthy appeared before the joint committee earlier in the week and mentioned how the bookies are suggesting it is unlikely they will leave.  While we certainly are waking up to the possibility of such an exit, is the position similar across the European capitals?  In the worst-case scenario in which Britain decides to leave, what would be a reasonable timeframe for it actually to leave?  How long would it then take to negotiate new trading agreements?  While these are huge questions, I seek ballpark figures.  Mr. Zuleeg mentioned the European Union budget and losing the amount contributed by the British State.  How does he reckon this will work out?  He suggested the possibility that the shortfall would be made up by other countries and so on.  While this certainly would cause major problems right across Europe, the difficulty appears to be that we never really have been in this position previously and, therefore, the question is what to do.  While members certainly have a fair idea of the impact it would have on Ireland, what country is next in line in this regard?  I would describe a British exit as being disastrous for Ireland because of the Border in respect of the North and so on.  One also could talk about the impact, were the referendum in the North to go against, or about Scotland going against and the impact it would have on Britain itself.  Where will it go from there?</p> <p>  The British seek reforms and Professor McCarthy spoke about pre-negotiations and post-negotiations.  Have those pre-negotiations already started?  How strong is the hand they have to play?  Mr. Zuleeg spoke of the impression that they have almost disengaged from the process in the context of the lack of compromise and so on.  Has this weakened or strengthened their position for these negotiations?  The view is that if the Conservatives can deliver on some changes, it would have an impact on the referendum itself.  In the context of the referendum, there is talk of what the Labour Party will do.  I note the latest poster produced by the Tories has put the Labour Party leader together with Alex Salmond.  It suggests that if one thinks the Labour Party leader is bad, this would be twice as bad and so on.  The Tories already are hyping it up to secure the support of 5% or 7% of the electorate, which is where the shifts appear to be.  As for the debate on austerity, what impact will this have on austerity within Europe from the perspective of the pro-austerity and pro-stimulus camps?  What future effect do the witnesses think it will have in this?</p> <p>  I have already mentioned the impact on the Border but it also will have an impact on the all-Ireland economy, including the all-Ireland tourism sector.  While it would change the entire dynamic for Ireland, I would be interested to hear what changes will happen.  Mr. Zuleeg also mentioned the transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP, as did Professor McCarthy, who envisaged a move away by Britain towards the United States.  He indicated that it would not have the same impact, as, for example, GM foods would not raise the same concerns in Britain as they would for the rest of us and possibly in Europe as well.  What impact does Mr. Zuleeg think this will have on the TTIP negotiations themselves?</p></speech>

While I am working on bilocation as best I can, it does not always work.</p> <p>  I agree entirely with the paper produced by the witnesses.  If anything, they under-emphasise the importance of the issues facing Europe, the United Kingdom and Ireland in the event of a British exit.  There a number of reasons, including geopolitical reasons that generally are accepted and recognisable from the outset.  It also gives a peculiar and confusing message to the wider world and the global economy.  In so far as possible, a Single Market has been established and the benefits accruing to all member states, and to smaller member states in particular, from having access to a Single Market are known.  While anyone can have individual trade agreements with other small countries and larger countries, there has always been a tendency whereby the smaller operators do not necessarily have the greatest of influence in such company.</p> <p>  As a result of all this, it is utterly ridiculous to find ourselves in a Europe that now is looking around at alternatives.  I do not rule out the possibility of all this happening.  I do not dismiss it at all and believe it could happen.  What one should remember is that over the centuries, the people of Europe have done some very strange things and have taken some very strange decisions, usually culminating in a war, at regular intervals throughout history.  As for the tendency for this to happen again, while people will tell one this cannot and will not happen again, it can and as sure as Murphy's Law prevails, it will.  This is because once we begin to fragment and go in opposite directions, the full implications of what is likely to happen will become known to everybody.  It must be realised that such possibilities exist at this point in the debate as there will be no point in realising it afterwards when it will be too late.</p><p>I sincerely hope it does not happen for the sake of this country, Northern Ireland, the UK and the European Union.  It would be like Texas seceding from the United States.  I know they spoke about that a long time ago, as did other states, but it was deemed not the right thing to do.  They fought a civil war over it, which was not the right thing to do either.  Other issues were involved.</p><p> We are about to achieve the biggest single trading block of 500 million people in a single market, and it has potential to grow even further.  Somebody has had the brainy idea of deciding to go back to the old ways with a loose arrangement of trade agreements which would be better for one or the other as the occasion arises, but I do not accept this concept.  I cannot understand how anybody can justify it.</p><p> With regard to negotiations between the UK and the European Union that may take place, there is a limit to what we can do as a third party and this has been pointed out by other speakers.  Interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state does not go down too well at the best of times in any event.  We do not like it ourselves.</p></speech>

We always say we want to exercise maximum influence in the area of trade.  We export 90% of what we produce.  We export almost everything produced in the agricultural sector, and the IT sector has huge exports.  Access to the single market would be questionable, unless we start going down the road of individual arrangements and agreements, and we know about this from before.  It is a long time since I first studied the concept of a united Europe, and in so far as we have one it has shown one big advantage.  We have had 50 years of comparative peace on the Continent of Europe as a result of the coming together of major powers alongside smaller powers in mutual recognition of each other's position and with the concept of helping each other.</p></speech>

Even though it negated upfront the principle of ever-closer union, another important element which was hardly noticed, even in Britain, was that for the first time a British Head of Government accepted the principle that European integration is an anti-war measure and is geared towards peace among the participating countries.  Politically speaking, this is progress, because the Conservatives in Great Britain had never accepted this as a rationale for integration.</p> <p>  The Bloomberg speech itself still held out the prospect of a very constructive approach as far as reforming the Union is concerned.  Most of the other member states got very nervous when the British Government started questioning mobility.  It has backtracked since then, and has gone from questioning the principle of free movement of people to discussing preventing the abuse of social benefits.  We know that in practice there is an overlap between these two areas, but the line of the other big member states, most of all Germany, in this debate has always been that one can do much more at national level to fight the misuse of benefits without ever coming into conflict with European Union legislation or the principles of European integration.  This is no problem.  For the time being at least this has been understood, and the discourse in Great Britain has moved from questioning the principle of mobility, which is unacceptable, to stating it will do this and that to promote fairness for all the citizens of our countries.</p> <p>  As long as the debate continues in this way, I do not see a major political problem, but there is no guarantee this will happen in the upcoming election campaign in Great Britain.  Knowing UKIP, it may make this topic a fundamental question for the future of Great Britain or it may make EU membership, or rather in this case BrExit, a main campaign issue.  So far this has not happened and the campaign has been all about economics, the National Health Service and education, but the risk is that over the coming months we will see these European questions of mobility on the one hand and EU membership on the other having a much more prominent role.</p> <p>  We cannot say we have any idea at present what the timescale for BrExit would be.  The entry into force of the Lisbon treaty means that for the first time we have a provision for a country to leave, but it is completely impossible to say how long it would take to renegotiate a different status, either along the lines of the European Economic Area or the European Free Trade Association, the Norwegian model and Swiss model as they are called.  It is also impossible to say what would be the outcome.  It would be very important to negotiate some type of status for both sides.</p> <p>  With regard to the impact on the austerity debate, I see fiscal consolidation losing friends to say it strategically.  People would say the European Union would become more southern, which is an oversimplification, but the very principle of solidifying public finances would be weakened through a British exit, which is why Germany would be particularly sad to see it happen.</p> <p>  With regard to the psychological element of British-Irish relations, I am an outsider but my impression is that was extremely important for Ireland to enter the European integration process at the same time and under the same conditions as Great Britain.  If this changes there is a risk that for the first time in a very long time British-Irish relations could regress.  I absolutely agree this is something we need to prevent.</p></speech>

Predominantly this is a domestic UK debate, which is very difficult to influence from outside.  A major question for me which has not been answered in the debate in the UK is what does "out" mean.  What does it mean to state a country will leave the European Union, because very often I hear that "out" means no political integration but maintaining access to the Single Market.</p><p>That underestimates the political negotiations that would have to occur, some of the legal problems and, crucially, the underlying deal.  A Single Market is not a pick-and-choose menu from which one can take some competitiveness measures and exclude some social and environmental policy measures.  These are all part of the Single Market.</p><p> This point leads to freedom of movement.  One of the key points that is not debated in the United Kingdom at present is that freedom of movement of people is not simply a right under the treaties, which I believe is worth defending very strongly, but also a crucial element of the four freedoms of the Single Market.  Arguing against the free movement of people is ultimately arguing against the Single Market, and not for it.</p><p> I am quite sceptical about what could be achieved in any reform package because I do not envisage how meaningful change could be achieved in a relatively short timescale.  If there is an election victory by the Conservatives in May and then a reform package agreed by 28 member states, perhaps with elements ratified by 28 member states, as early as 2017-----  </p></speech>

That is not a timescale that works particularly well in Europe.  We would have major difficulties in doing anything significant in that kind of timescale.  Admittedly, one could produce certain declarations emphasising certain issues but we should not forget that if this touches on some of the fundamental legal provisions of the European Union, there could well be court cases, or a legal challenge to some of the reforms.  With regard to freedom of movement of people, for example, it would depend on what is exactly is in the package.</p> <p>  There is a more fundamental issue to be considered regarding any reform package.  What is happening in the United Kingdom at present is not simply about the content itself but also about who makes decisions on particular issues.  That is far more difficult to address.  I do agree that with issues such as the abuse of social security, be it a real issue or not, one can find European compromises.  What one cannot do is give the right to make decisions about EU mobility back to the national level.  The moment one does that, one is setting the treaty aside, which is not possible.  This is very much going to be the political debate in the United Kingdom.  It is not about the detail of the kinds of reforms that are emerging but about the fact that the United Kingdom cannot independently make decisions on the free movement of EU citizens because it is an EU competence.  This is a far more difficult matter to address.</p> <p>  How concerned is the rest of Europe?  I still believe we are in circumstances in which most people in Europe believe the exit cannot happen because they cannot seriously believe the United Kingdom would vote for it.  If I were to be very unkind, I would say this is wishful thinking.  It is a case of saying we are not going to think about it because it is not allowed to happen.  I do not envisage any serious consideration anywhere.  I am very glad that the committee is engaging in this process because it is high time that many more places, including the EU institutions, started to think seriously about the possibilities.  At present, this is not happening.</p> <p>  This is of concern also because I have very much noticed on the EU side that the mood has changed.  It is changed in two very different ways, both of which are important.  First, the eurozone crisis dominates everything so whatever happens with BrExit is secondary to the euro crisis.  If five or six years ago there had been a debate on BrExit as we are having now, it would have been the biggest issue on the European agenda, without a doubt.  Now, without a doubt, it is not.  Therefore, the question of what needs to be done to fix the problems with EMU comes first.  If the United Kingdom is seen as a hindrance to that process, it has an implication in terms of how people regard BrExit.</p> <p>  The second point is that, for the first time, people can imagine having the United Kingdom outside the Union.  It is very much because of the negotiation tactic of the UK Government.  Imagining the exit was a taboo a few years ago, at which time one would not even consider the possibility.  Now, I hear increasingly often the statement that if the United Kingdom is not going to be constructive or try to find compromise at European level, the Union might be better off at some point without it.  I am not saying this is a majority view but this is the first time I am actually hearing views of this kind, which represents quite a sea change in how Brussels thinks about this.</p> <p>  On the question of the timescale if it comes to BrExit, it is impossible to predict.  The difficulty would very much be on the UK side.  Domestically in the United Kingdom, an enormous number of legal changes would be required.  Independent regulators would have to be set up, in addition to competition authorities.  There are a number of these institutions already but they have different legal functions.  One would have to change a vast part of the legal system within the United Kingdom or, in essence, accept all the EU law without further scrutiny, which seems to defeat the purpose of BrExit at little.  The pressure would very much be on the United Kingdom and UK Government to deliver BrExit.  I do not believe a UK Government could negotiate an arrangement and go back to the people to ask for another vote.  It will be final and there would be an expectation that the process would happen in a reasonable timescale.  It would be a matter of deciding what reasonable meant at that point.</p> <p>  I will address a few of the specific points on the austerity debate.  It will not have much of an impact, predominantly because it is a eurozone debate.  The United Kingdom is not involved in decision making at that kind of level.  I agree on the general point but, ultimately, it will not make much difference.</p> <p>  I do not believe TTIP will make so much difference.  Other trends are having a much greater impact on the likelihood of TTIP happening.  The attitude in Germany towards TTIP is far more important to TTIP than whether the United Kingdom is inside the European Union.  The importance of the UK voice in some of these areas is overestimated in the United Kingdom.</p> <p>  With regard to the question on the impact of a UK exit on Ireland's economy and tourism, it is impossible to predict if one does not know what kind of regime will exist in terms of exchanges.  The key point is that I would expect relatively little to change in terms of trade, especially in terms of manufactured trade.  Most of the latter is WTO related rather than EU related.  It could have an impact on services, and on investment in particular.  The far greater longer-term impact would be on investment.</p> <p>  On the budget, I hope I have covered everything.  I ask members to revert to me if there is something missing.  BrExit would be opening a can of worms with regard to the budget.  We noted the difficulties we had negotiating the long-term budget of the European Union the last time around.  It was not solely down to the United Kingdom.</p><p>It played a prominent role in there but it was a much more fundamental conflict between some countries who believed the budget should increase and those who believed it should decrease.  There were different spending and political priorities.  The immediate effect of a BrExit whenever that would happen would be to reopen that debate.  One would need to renegotiate the entire multi-annual financial framework.  That comes second only to treaty change as a nightmare scenario in Brussels.  We would have a major problem trying to find a compromise between the 27 countries.  I would expect that any compromise would have to be along the lines of some of the net payers paying a bit more and some of the net recipients receiving a bit less.  At the margin, it could turn some net recipients into net payers because of the arithmetic involved.  All of that would need to be negotiated and it would be a very difficult negotiation.  </p><p> The additional difficulty here would be that there is now a mechanism for dealing with a breakdown in negotiations but the mechanism for a breakdown in EU budget negotiations relies on continuing the previous budgets.  You cannot do that if a major net player is missing so you could have a complete breakdown in the budget negotiations which would be very detrimental to the functioning of the EU but it is possible.</p></speech>

I had other things to attend to, including speaking in the Chamber.  I have read the briefings we received and the earlier reports.  There were some very interesting points.  If the UK does leave, will this lead to instability in the EU and increased tensions in other countries regarding exit?  If the UK stays and certain reforms were initiated to sweeten the deal to keep it inside the EU, would this lead to other countries requesting changes in certain areas they might not be happy with?  Would this pressure arise?</p> <p>  Mr. Zuleeg mentioned the fact that the UK is our English-speaking ally and an exit would increase the role of Germany and language issues because French and German would be more to the fore.  Is that realistic in terms of a change?  Mr. Zuleeg also mentioned the fact that an exit would mean one less net payer to the budget and mentioned the impact on the budget and oversight.  How would it affect oversight in terms of how the money is spent?  We have the Court of Auditors and various methods to ensure that money is spent correctly.  </p> <p>  Mr. Freudenstein mentioned the EU civil service in terms of the British population and that the British population makes up about 12% of the EU population.  In 2004, they made up 9.6% of the people working in the Commission.  This has dropped to 5.3%.  Does Mr. Freudenstein think that this had an impact in terms of taking in the views of the British people or some of the things they might be more concerned about because they do not have as many senior people working within the Commission?  </p> <p>  Mr. Zuleeg mentioned that he has heard the view that countries will not believe that life will end if the UK leaves.  Does he believe that if the UK was of the part of the euro, the consequences would be far more dire?  </p></speech>

As a number of other people have said, it is of major importance to Ireland not just from a practical point of view but also from an emotional point of view in that the UK is our closest neighbour and we have a very significant and extensive shared history.  Let us say the euro continues to be under severe pressure and eventually collapses following the exit of the UK.  Might this scenario suit Ireland better?  Might it suit Ireland to move with the UK out of the EU?</p> <p>  In the paper furnished by Mr. Zuleeg, he said that there is a high level of distrust of the EU among British policy makers and a tendency for disengagement, they are inflexible and their demands are unilateral and are constantly backed by the threat of exit.  Even if the BrExit referendum does not pass, to what extent will the UK effectively continue with one foot in and one foot out of the EU?  To what extent can this process be reversed even if a referendum is not successful?  </p> <p>  Who cares?  Who among the member states really actively wants the UK to remain given that the speakers make the point that it will actually weaken German power within the EU?  Many countries might not find that to be such a disadvantage.  </p> <p>  In respect of contagion, the UK is a significant player in the European economy.  It is my understanding, although I may be wrong, that a significant portion of European countries trade mostly within Europe unlike Ireland which has more trade outside the EU.  Who needs who more here?  Does the UK economy need Europe or does Europe need the UK economy as a market?  If the UK economy is more important to Europe than the other way around, might we end up in a situation where the UK has all the access to the market but none of the costs?  If that was to happen, what impact might it have on the future of the Union as a free trade union, which was one of the founding principles of the EU?  </p> <p>  The speakers mentioned that a British exit would strengthen the power of the euro countries.  Might that not strengthen the euro and be more beneficial in the longer run?  A question was posed about whether a reform package could be positive for all 28 members.  Why did we not do it before now?  It leads to the question that a reform package that would be negotiated by the UK would be more likely to be negative around matters such as social protection and ideas like a common European minimum wage and be more negative towards a social Europe than towards an economic Europe.  Perhaps I am wrong here.  </p> <p>  Do the speakers think a British exit would move the UK more towards an Atlantic axis in terms of foreign policy?  I know they said it would weaken overall EU political strength in the world as a whole but is there any way in which it might encourage Europe to move more strongly towards a common foreign policy platform?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-12a.583" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Roland Freudenstein" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015021200002#G00500"><p>In respect of contagion and the reform process, there is the fear that if we think of this in terms of British opt-out, other member states would then demand their opt-outs.</p><p>Other member states would then demand their opt-outs.  Obvious candidates would be the Czech Republic, Hungary and, possibly, Denmark.  One of the strong arguments in the Brussels institutions and member state capitals against a fundamental renegotiation of Britain&rsquo;s status in the European Union has always been that it would not be Britain alone, but that the whole edifice would unravel.  This would result not only in a multi-speed but multi-status European Union.  That has had a very limiting effect on the number of issues that Britain&rsquo;s partners would be ready to discuss.</p><p> As much as Great Britain has already distanced itself in the Union, it has always had one leg in, one leg out.  It was never as involved in the European integration process as some of the continental countries for fundamentally political reasons.  On topics such as the EU budget and completing the Single Market, however, Britain has always been an ally of Germany.  Even though it was outside the eurozone, on overall topics of economic governance, as well as recently on issues of subsidiarity and bringing decision-making procedures closer to the citizens, there was some kind of German-British alliance in the European Union, spoken or not spoken.  There has been a certain closeness in that regard.  I can say with some confidence that the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, would personally consider a BrExit a detrimental event for Germany.  As I said in my opening statement, Germany would get numerically more powerful but, at the same time, become more isolated in the European Union by losing an important ally on some very crucial issues.</p><p> Why has the reform process not happened before?  It is because some of the demands that the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, made in his Bloomberg speech go beyond Great Britain, striking a chord with political forces and citizens in other member states.  Germany is not the only one.  The Dutch Government has produced a list of issues on which there should be no further transfer of competences to the European institutions in the future.  It is not the same as a renegotiation bid by the British Government but there are other member states in which the rise of populism and popular discontent with the way politics is made in Europe and in the European Union has led to some rethinking and re-evaluation of the principle of subsidiarity.  That is not to talk about the southern tier where, as a consequence of the euro crisis, there is a strong anti-EU sentiment in the population.  There is a feeling, however, in member states such as the Netherlands, Germany and some of the Scandinavian countries that if the British Government did not dramatise this issue so much, they would have something in common about which to talk.  The desire to rethink some decision-making procedures is not isolated to Britain.  That is why it is happening now and, to a certain degree, some of the British demands sound reasonable to other governments and certainly to some of centre-right parties in the European Union.</p><p> Would a BrExit be beneficial for Ireland?  Would it lead to happier faces on the Continent?  This is all speculation and I certainly do not want to answer the question about Ireland as that is for members to contemplate.  As Fabian Zuleeg already said, some people in European institutions, continental member states and French-speaking countries would be actually happy about a British exit.  That is not secret.  That is not true, however, for the majority of citizens of the European Union.  It has been increasingly difficult to make progress in European integration in every respect with a Britain that feels more disaffected.  It must be remembered, however, British public opinion has been going up and down when it comes to Europe.  In 1975, 67% of British citizens voted in favour of continued membership of the European Economic Community, shortly after its entry.  There was a strong majority against EU membership, 70% or so, in the 1980s.  The most pro-European moment in British public opinion was in 1991 when Margaret Thatcher left office.  Since then, it has been going downhill.  Britain has always been a difficult partner.  However, when it comes to issues such as completing the Single Market, being an advocate of free trade and strong transatlantic relations, Britain has and continues to play a positive role.  It depends on which areas are important to one, which country on the Continent to which one belongs, as well as political affiliation, if one considers a BrExit a more positive or more negative development.  In the final account, a BrExit is considered vastly more negative than positively.</p><p> Regarding the eurozone versus the other currencies, on the surface it might look that decision-making will be easier after a BrExit.  The rest of the currencies would become weaker.  Sooner or later, Poland will also join the euro.  Sweden and Denmark then will still remain outside the euro and probably not for long.</p></speech>

Whether there is any economic rationality to these countries leaving the European Union is a big question.  I do not see it happening but there would be an emotional and psychological push.</p> <p>  What would be the effect on social Europe?  Even the British Labour Party has been playing a rather cautious role in advocating social Europe.  Within the Socialist and Democrats Group in the European Parliament, British Labour has been a free trader as a party.  If Britain drops out, then one can imagine the logical consequences.</p> <p>  Would the UK become more Atlanticist in its foreign policy?  To put it cynically, it may well try but it takes two to tango.  The United States has made it abundantly clear - this goes far beyond the US President, Barack Obama, and the Democrats - that Britain is of value to the United States only if it is a strong part of the European Union, not outside it.  There are some fringe elements in the Republican Party that might dream of a renewal of special relationship outside of Britain&rsquo;s EU membership.</p><p>These are nothing more than fringe elements.  As someone who works in the think tank that is affiliated to the European People's Party, the centre right group in the European Parliament, I am especially familiar with debates taking place in the Republican Party in the United States.  I know for certain that conservative Americans who think in international and transatlantic terms are not interested in a Britain outside the European Union - they want Britain in the European Union - and that is without speaking about the Democrats and President Obama.  Some conservative politicians in Britain may not be fully aware of this, but they are missing reality if they do not take it into account.  It is a pipedream to believe Britain would be of any value to the United States outside the European Union.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-12a.588" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fabian Zuleeg" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015021200002#J00200"><p>I fully agree with the Mr. Freudenstein's final point which also applies in the trade sphere.  A number of countries have made it abundantly clear that a country of the size of the United Kingdom, with its economic weight, would have a very different negotiating position from that of the European Union in international trade negotiations.  To put the matter simply, the United Kingdom would be a price taker in such negotiations.  There have been clear signs from the United States signalling strongly that a transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP, is a far more attractive proposition if it is with the whole of the European Union, including the United Kingdom, and the United States is more willing to negotiate on that basis.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, I do not believe a UK exit from the European Union would strengthen the Common Foreign and Security Policy because the differences between countries in this area are too great.  If we were thinking about longer term horizons, we might imagine changes in this area.  However, the kinds of foreign policy position being taken by France and Germany, the other two big countries, are very far apart.  It is difficult, therefore, to see how one would get more than co-ordination of foreign policy, which is what we have. </p> <p>  I will pick up on a couple of the points made concerning tensions in other countries.  It is true that there could be difficulties in some smaller countries in terms of increased anti-European sentiment.  In general, however, albeit not necessarily in every single case, there is a significant difference between the attitude to the European Union in the United Kingdom and attitudes in other countries.  Most people outside the United Kingdom cannot imagine being outside the European Union, even in countries where there is considerable dissatisfaction.  While they may have many grievances and want many changes made in certain areas, the idea of being completely outside the European Union is unimaginable for most.  This is not the case in the United Kingdom where there is much more of an accounting view of the European Union, by which I mean that people ask what are the costs and benefits of membership.  If the former outweigh the latter, they take the view that perhaps it would be better for the country to be outside the European Union.  I do not believe the costs outweigh the benefits.  On the contrary, the benefits of being inside the Union far outweigh the costs.  A discussion of the benefits must form part of the debate around a British exit.  We should emphasise that these are political as well as economic benefits.</p> <p>  One issue that must be taken into account is that a vote to leave the European Union in a referendum could have a very destabilising effect on Britain.  For example, if different constituent parts of the United Kingdom were to vote differently in such a referendum, it could well result in its disintegration.  The political costs and uncertainty arising from such a vote would be high.  </p> <p>  On the issue of trade, the European Union does not need the United Kingdom more than the United Kingdom needs the European Union.  When we consider the logic of markets, it is clear that the European Union is the big market and that the United Kingdom the small one.  The small market needs access to the big one.  It would be a disaster for the United Kingdom if it could not sell its manufacturing products in the rest of the European Union.  For example, most of the UK car industry, one of its major industries, and the pharmaceutical industry are based on exports.  All these types of industry would have major problems if market access were to become a problem.  The balance of the economic weight is clearly in favour of the European Union.  As I stated, however, a British exit from the European Union would cost both sides and is not, therefore, a positive scenario.  In terms of negotiations, the United Kingdom would be in a weaker position.</p> <p>  On the effect of a British exit on decision-making, we would clearly move towards a scenario, at least in the medium term, in which the European Union and the eurozone became the same.  While one or two countries could hold out, economically, they would have very little autonomy of movement if one had major blocs.  In terms of monetary policy decisions, Denmark, for example, must watch extremely closely what the European Central Bank is doing.  If only some small countries which do not have economic weight remain outside the eurozone, a cohesive eurozone will emerge, although this does not mean that it would be any better at making decisions because making decisions on the way forward implies agreement on what should be the way forward.  There is nothing to indicate that the eurozone is cohesive in terms of its opinions.  </p> <p>  On the question of who wants the United Kingdom to remain in the European Union and who wants it to leave it, while one could discuss in some detail whether a British exit would be in the interests of certain countries, the general tenor which still comes through from all member states is that none of them wants the United Kingdom to leave the Union.  Despite the fact that in some cases one could argue it might be in the interests of certain players to have the United Kingdom outside the European Union, none of the institutions or member states wants the United Kingdom to leave.  Notwithstanding that the United Kingdom sometimes appears to believe the European Parliament should not exist, the Parliament also believes the United Kingdom should stay in the European Union.</p></speech>

A UK exit would not change anything in that respect, as we would still be stuck in a number of areas of decision-making.  That issue will not be resolved either by the United Kingdom leaving or staying in the European Union.</p> <p>  There is an important lesson to be learned from the Scottish referendum.  Simply arguing that people should fear uncertainty and the economic impact of being outside a union is not enough to change hearts and minds.  While it may win the vote in the immediate term, the longer term issues will remain.  I expect we would still have the same issues in the case of a UK exit from the European Union.  This is not just a UK issue but a question of what kind of future we foresee for the European Union and what we want to do together at European level and in which areas it is absolutely necessary for the European Union to work together.  This is one of the reasons we have not seen the types of reform which might be presented as a package for the United Kingdom.  Part of the reason is that the United Kingdom has always been a special case.  Some countries are more equal than others and the fact that the United Kingdom has always had the threat of exit has meant that it has been far more easily accommodated in terms of opt-outs, etc.</p><p> The larger question is that we do not have agreement across Europe on the direction the European Union should take.  We do not have a common vision on a way forward for 27 or 28 countries.  Unfortunately, whether the United Kingdom is in or out,  this is not going to change, but it is something we must address.  Perhaps not in a particularly positive way, but the debate on a BrExit might finally force us to face some of the questions about what kind of European Union we want for the future.</p></speech>

I am glad that the Chairman explained that the Minister hopes to be here later when I am sure he will be anxious to address the joint committee.  </p> <p>  I thank the committee for the invitation to attend.  I am joined by officials from the Department, including Mr. Jim Breslin, Secretary General; Ms Treacy Conroy, assistant secretary - acute hospitals; Ms Grainne Duffy, disability services division; and Mr. Barry Murphy, services for older people division.  I am also joined by Mr. Tony O'Brien, director general of the HSE, and his colleagues.</p> <p>  Members have been informed that the Minister has experienced a flight delay on his return home from a meeting at the European Parliament.  He will try to join us as soon as possible and will speak about some wider issues.  I will cover those within my brief.</p> <p>  The budget for the health service in 2015 shows a modest increase &ndash; the first such increase in a number of years.  As acknowledged by the Minister and the director general of the HSE, it will not allow us to address every priority in the current year, but it will allow us to make a start.  As we see the fruits of the rebuilding of the economy emerge, I look forward to further sustainable increases in the health budget in the years to come which, together with reform, will allow us to address the deficiencies in key services.</p> <p>  The Minister and I have published our priorities for 2015 which set out an ambitious but achievable set of goals.  They include introducing universal GP care for children under six years and older people over 70.  Detailed discussions are proceeding with the Irish Medical Organisation with a view to rolling out these initiatives in the second quarter of the year.  It will be a matter for individual GPs to agree to provide these services.  I cannot presume agreement, but I hope the main body of general practitioners will see this as an important opportunity to secure more investment in primary care services and introduce a more preventive focus, in particular in children's earliest years.</p> <p>  The budget provides an additional &euro;10 million for the fair deal scheme.  These resources have already allowed waiting times for funding under the scheme to be reduced from 15 weeks in October to 11 now.  This is an important initiative for those awaiting a placement from the community, but it has also contributed to a reduction in delayed discharges from hospitals, with numbers down by more than 100 since December.</p> <p>  Demographic factors mean that there is significant ongoing pressure on the fair deal scheme.  A review of the scheme is being finalised and I will bring the findings to the Cabinet.  As well as improvements to the operation of the scheme, it is likely to highlight the ongoing funding requirements to further reduce waiting periods and the need to simultaneously invest in community supports to avoid older people having to be placed in residential care, where at all possible.</p> <p>  Other priorities for 2015 include reducing the cost of medicines to patients and the taxpayer, building on price reductions and a successful introduction of reference pricing.  I will also publish a review of the Mental Health Act which will contain recommendations on how this ground-breaking legislation can be further improved to support the rights of those suffering from mental illness.  Before the end of the year, subject to planning permission, we will commence work on the new national forensic mental health service campus at Portrane.  The Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum has a very professional body of staff, but its facilities are from another era.  Their replacement has been long promised and we will embark on making this a reality with the new development.</p> <p>  On disability services, the national service plan provides for a planned approach to school leavers and emergency placements.  We will further implement the registration of facilities with HIQA and the comprehensive change programme to modernise services and ensure standards of care are consistently of high quality.</p> <p>  The director general will now make his opening remarks to the committee.</p></speech>

We will obviously be happy to deal with further issues that arise.</p> <p>  The service plan for 2015 was published by the HSE on 27 November last, following ministerial approval.  The budget to which it relates provides for the delivery of health and social care services within a funding allocation of &euro;12.13 billion, plus an additional &euro;35 million for mental health services.  This represents a welcome but modest increase of &euro;115 million in funding.  It is the first time in seven years that there has been an increase, not a decrease, in funding.  This has allowed the health service to allocate more realistic budgets to hospitals and community health care organisations which puts the health service on a more sustainable footing.</p> <p>  The allocation of more realistic budgets brings with it a requirement for greater accountability to ensure services are delivered within the budget provided.  To help to achieve this, we have put in place an enhanced governance and accountability framework which set out clearly the responsibilities of all managers to deliver on the targets set out in the service plan against the balance scorecard.  There are a number of core requirements under the accountability framework, the most notable being the introduction of a formal performance agreement with me, as director general, and each of the national directors and cascaded throughout the system.</p><p> Emergency department attendances have increased by 5.6%, at 63,123 attendances over the past five years, standing at 1,182,842 in 2014, and with 2014 alone seeing a rise of 2.5% over the previous years.  In addition, patients attending emergency departments are now generally more unwell and more likely to require admission than in the past, which is due in part to an increase in the number of frail elderly patients attending.  In 2014, there were 6,614, or 1.7%, more admissions from emergency departments compared to the previous year, which equates to 550 more admissions each month.  That does not include the cohort of 52,437 patients who presented at acute medical assessment units and medical assessment units during the course of the year.</p><p> As previously discussed with the committee, the pressures on emergency departments over the past number of weeks are not new or unexpected.  Based on the trends I have outlined, significant action was taken prior to and after the Christmas period to plan for a surge in attendances and admissions.  Some &euro;25 million was provided to alleviate the problem of delayed discharges this year and an additional &euro;3 million spend in 2014 was fast-tracked in November and December as part of the winter pressures plan.  This enabled the early release of an additional 300 Fair Deal approvals in addition to the routine 700 places each month.</p><p> In addition, the following actions have been taken.  During December, 165 additional transitional care beds were funded and targeted at hospitals in the greater Dublin area to facilitate egress from acute beds.  A further 424 transitional care beds were commissioned nationally up to 27 January in order to move patients whose acute episodes of care had finished.  All short- and long-stay public beds are being prioritised to support discharge from acute hospitals.  A further 173 short-stay beds are being opened on a phased basis in identified locations during this time of peak demand.  Additional home supports were provided, with a specific focus on supporting acute hospital discharge prior to the Christmas period, allowing the discharge of 87 patients from acute hospitals.  </p><p> The total number of additional home care packages provided to date is 400.  Of the &euro;25 million provided, &euro;2 million was allocated to community intervention team services, which are very effective in preventing people from having to attend emergency departments in the first place and allowing for early discharges.  The scheme has managed more than 200 patients in the community each day during this time of peak demand.</p><p> During December and January, 1,239 people whose acute episodes of care were completed but who remained in acute beds were provided with alternative care more appropriate to their needs.  However, a further 1,176 people have been added to the delayed discharge list, which means that the perceived net benefit is small.  The number of additional delayed discharges being added to the total weekly list is exceeding the usual intake rate of 100 by a factor of about 1.6, which makes it extremely difficult to sustain improvement.  As such, the number of delayed discharges remains high and very challenging, at 745.  </p><p> The overall position, therefore, remains challenging.  The HSE is maintaining a daily focus on this area and is an active partner in the emergency task force set up by the Minister to find long-term solutions to overcrowding.  We are also working on developing a detailed plan specifically to address emergency department issues, with a view to a significant reduction in trolley waits over the course of 2015.  This is a priority for the HSE and the Government.</p><p> On patient safety at Portiuncula Hospital, the review will involve a thorough examination of the delivery of maternity services at the hospital and will include a review of the perinatal care provided to the seven women who were the subject of the preliminary review completed in January 2015.  The draft terms of reference for the review have been finalised and are currently being discussed with the families concerned.  The investigation team is currently being established, to include two obstetricians - one national and one international - one of whom will act as investigation chairperson, two senior midwives - one national and one international - a patient advocate, a consultant neonatologist and an expert investigator from the national incident management learning team.  I can also confirm, in respect of the cases highlighted in the media recently, that the chief clinical director of the Saolta University Health Care Group will meet the families concerned, has met some of them already and will meet others again, with a view to agreeing with them how best a review of those cases should be progressed.  </p><p> Sometimes, in the midst of the challenges such as those I have described, we can overlook the many things that are improving.  During 2014, significant parts of the health system worked very well, with notable improvements over previous years.  We continue to meet and exceed our targets for specialist palliative care, with 97% of patients accessing a specialist inpatient bed within seven days of referral and 89% of those receiving palliative care in their own homes.  The number of persons in receipt of home care packages is 13,199, 21% above the 2014 target.  The numbers waiting more than 12 weeks for a physiotherapy assessment continue to fall and there were 7% fewer people waiting more than 16 weeks for an occupational therapy assessment.  With regard to the ambulance service, in 2014, 76% of ECHO calls and 65% of DELTA calls were responded to within the target response times.  This compares with 69% and 64%, respectively, in 2013, and comes against a backdrop of an increase in call volume in the order of 4%.  </p><p> A dedicated GP support line commenced in September to allow closer working between GPs and the HSE, aimed at supporting patients in regard to medical card applications and renewals.  The implementation of the expert reports on medical card assessment and processing continues to be a high priority this year.  A senior manager has been appointed to lead the process and a number of measures are now under way, as outlined in more detail in the response to question 17 from Senator Jillian van Turnhout.  The recent appointment of the clinical advisory group chaired by Dr. Mary Sheehan, who is a GP, represents a significant development in this process and one which adds senior clinical and patient representation to the governance and oversight of assessment of medical card eligibility.</p><p> With regard to eculizumab, or Soliris, the HSE has taken a decision to extended access to it to sufferers of paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, PNH, and atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome.  Due to the exorbitant cost of this drug, which is approximately &euro;430,000 per patient per year, its provision for patients will be on the basis of clinical need.  The opportunity cost of the inordinate price demanded for this important drug will inevitably be felt over time in other parts of the health services and will have an impact on our ability to fund other important service developments.  We will continue to pursue a more reasonable price for this medicine.</p><p> As it is now 18 months since the health service directorate was established as the HSE's governing body to take forward reform, in that time we have made a significant start on re-fashioning the health service to ready it for a post-HSE era.  Significant progress has been made towards consolidation of the hospital groups.  CEOs were appointed by the directorate in October despite a challenging recruitment backdrop.  The community health organisations were designed and progressed, with chief officers appointed to seven of the nine before the end of last year.  Health business services have progressed on the journey towards a contemporary shared service platform for the entire health service, providing for the most effective use of resources.</p><p> Clarity and transparency on funding and service planning has been brought to each of the five core service domains.  Significant progress has been made, as I outlined, in the reform of the operation of the medical card service in the aftermath of the probity debacle.  The quality and patient safety enablement programme has been established, as outlined in the service plan, with a distinct and appropriate focus on quality improvement, on the one hand, and quality assurance verification on the other.  We are learning from the past in this regard.  </p><p> A confidential recipient has been appointed as a means of empowering workers, service users and family members to highlight the most serious shortcomings in health services and to rebalance the power relationship between the health service, its users and their representatives.  These are important steps in the right direction and the directorate is committed to building upon them, working with Ministers, to ensure that the health service is fundamentally reformed and improved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-12a.607" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/983" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015021200002#G00200"><p>I welcome Mr. O'Brien and the officials.  I would like to ask Mr. O'Brien and Mr. Breslin about an article in <i>The Irish Times</i>today which refers to the &euro;1.4 billion increase sought last year in the allocation for the budget to provide safe clinical care in our health services.</p><p>Reference was made to the debacle associated with probity and medical cards and many other dysfunctional areas.  I refer to the budget allocation in the Estimates for previous years, which we knew almost immediately was unsustainable.</p><p> I ask Mr. O'Brien to say whether the clinical pressures are generally across the health services or whether there are key areas of major concern.  I assume we are talking about patient safety as well as the clinical pressures.  When did Mr. O'Brien become aware that this would create significant problems?  For example, is he referring to emergency departments or to the Fair Deal scheme?  Due to the shortfall in funding, what other areas of health services were identified?</p><p> At previous committee meetings Mr. O'Brien stated that while he always sought more funding, this year's budget was realistic.  As today is 12 February, how realistic is the budget looking so far in the profiles that are being done?  Mr. O'Brien stated that &euro;200 million to &euro;300 million is required for demographic proofing annually.  In view of the fact we have &euro;115 million extra, is that before or after demographic proofing of &euro;200 million to &euro;300 million?  If it is not, it means we are in a negative situation before we even start the year.  Does Mr. O'Brien envisage significant difficulties in the future?</p><p> Mr. O'Brien referred to the winter pressures plan.  I do not think that plan - if it exists - has really covered itself in glory.  It was a reaction to an issue as opposed to a plan.  A total of 601 people were on trolleys in emergency departments earlier in the year.  As I said at the previous committee meeting and as everyone is talking about, our emergency services are chaotic at the moment.  This is not just Billy Kelleher making it up; it is a fact.  The HSE's own statistics verify the situation regarding the number of people on trolleys.  Clinicians are telling us every day that patient safety is being compromised constantly in emergency departments throughout the country.  How does Mr. O'Brien envisage the current budget providing the funds to address this issue?  He referred to delayed discharges and the number of people that would have to be moved from the acute hospitals into step-down facilities or home care packages.  There has been a slight improvement in the waiting time for approval for the Fair Deal scheme, from 15 weeks to 11 weeks.  However, there remain significant pressures on our emergency departments and, as a result, patient safety is compromised and clinicians and front-line service providers are under pressure.  How will this translate over the next number of months into an improvement in the situation?</p><p> Is the Secretary General permitted to speak?  An Acting Chairman indicated-----</p></speech>

I have a question for the Secretary General, Mr. Breslin.  Is universal health insurance still being actively assessed, costed and verified?  What is the Department doing to address and consider that central Government policy?</p> <p>  I have a question for Mr. O'Brien.  The terms of reference for the review of Portiuncula Hospital indicates that seven cases are to be investigated.  Would it be worth revisiting the terms of reference, considering that more than seven people have come forward expressing concerns about the service in Portiuncula Hospital?  Is is possible to expand the terms of reference to cater for other families who have also expressed concerns?  I suggest that any investigation should include all those who have expressed concerns rather than holding a subsequent review.</p></speech>

It is not often I get a chance to ask questions with such a group of people in front of me.</p> <p>  I have a question for Mr. O'Brien on the more focused issue of consultants' pay and the need to fill a large number of vacant posts.  I refer to the remuneration package in the context of attracting or retaining consultants compared to other countries.  We are losing some consultants and not attracting others to return.  How will this be addressed in the short term?</p> <p>  I refer to free GP care for under-sixes and over 70s and the intensive negotiations with the IMO, which is the GP representative body.  The Minister said that not every GP is obliged to take up this contract.  The National Association of General Practitioners represents approximately 1,200 GPs, which is quite a substantial number of doctors.  Why is the HSE not engaging with an organisation that represents a large number of people who will be to the fore in implementing this policy by delivering the services?</p></speech>

I refer to those who are not only suffering from mental illness but have had a challenge in terms of their mental illness.  The reference to suffering from mental illness suggests a problem that I believe is in the minds of many - the notion that there is no recovery.  The reality is that people get better.  That is a very important point which is not clear there.</p> <p>  A number of cases have been brought to my attention recently in which people are being clearly discriminated against in terms of their former, existing or prospective employment because they have been open and forthcoming about their experience.  I want to know if the Minister of State will include address of that issue in order to further the rights of people who have suffered or are suffering from either depression or some other challenge with regard to their mental health.  It is a very important area and I will be addressing it to the Minister of State by other means in the time ahead.  I ask her to indicate whether that is something she hopes to focus on in the review of the Mental Health Act.</p> <p>  I have a question for Mr. O'Brien on two matters arising from his opening statement on the subject of the emergency departments.  I recognise the range of actions that have been taken to respond to the difficulties that have presented over the past period of many weeks.  He referred to actions including additional transitional care beds, a further number of short-stay beds and additional home supports.  In my view, there is a glaring omission in this list of actions - which are all essential, and more besides, I would say - but there is no mention in the list of the initiatives taken, or to be taken, with regard to additional public long-stay residential beds.  I believe this is crucial in terms of addressing the delayed discharge issue.  Many of those in delayed discharge are not able to return home because they are either incapable of looking after themselves or they do not have the familial support or backup necessary for them to cope.  They are looking for access to long-stay residential care.  Dependence on the private sector is not good enough.  We have a bounden responsibility as a public health service to ensure that we are providing as best as budgets will allow, and I accept that.</p><p>I mean no criticism of HIQA's observations but it has produced a series of reports which resulted in a reduction in the number of beds in some of our older institutions.  Are plans being prepared to increase the number of public long-stay residential beds at settings across the State?</p><p> In regard to Portiuncula hospital, the review will include an examination of the perinatal care provided to the seven women concerned.  Since we first learned about this cohort of seven women, a significant number of additional individuals have presented with differing degrees of concern about their experiences in Portiuncula.  I am told the figure may be as high as 40, although I cannot confirm it.  Will the review include those individuals who have since come forward and will the review team have the power to take on board other cases that may present in the course of its work?</p><p> I inquired in question No. 7 about consultant posts across the various specialties in our acute hospital network.  These posts do not include psychiatry but they do include paediatrics, pathology, radiology, surgery, anesthesia, emergency medicine, intensive care medicine, obstetrics and gynaecology.  To cut to the chase, there are a total of 2,314 posts across the board but 325, or 14%, of these are not permanently filled.  I acknowledge that a number are currently filled by temporary locum or agency placement but a significant number are still vacant.  What steps are being take to address the need for permanent appointments to these posts and what is the expectation in terms of an increased number of posts in the course of 2015?  I note that 40 additional posts are signalled but we need many more if we are to put in place a real and attractive career path for those we wish to retain in or attract back to our health system, so they can deliver their specialties and experience to Irish patients.</p></speech>

Ireland is going to be examined before the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in January 2016.  The NGOs, including the Children's Rights Alliance, will come before the committee in June, along with the Ombudsman for Children and the Human Rights and Equality Commissioner.  Article 24 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child states:<blockquote><br /><br />States Parties recognize the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health and to facilities for the treatment of illness and rehabilitation of health.  States Parties shall strive to ensure that no child is deprived of his or her right of access to such health care services. </blockquote>My question referred in particular to children with life limiting or life threatening conditions.  All of us are aware of the work being done by the Jack and Jill Foundation, LauraLynn and many other organisations.  I meet parents who are fighting to get a medical card at a time when they should be with their children.  I was particularly distressed and shamed in recent weeks after hearing about the case of nine year old Lucy, who is battling cancer.  As a society we are not providing the cards that would allow parents to focus on their child.  Lucy's case is illustrative but I am sure there are other such cases.  Why are we not systematically upholding the right to health care  of children in this situation by ensuring they are not deprived of access to treatment?  I am not happy with the response to my question because I do not think we are going far enough on this issue.  I hope it is not a case of waiting until Ireland goes before a UN committee before we make any progress but that is usually what happens.  Instead of waiting for people from outside of the country to make us do what is right, we should just do it.</p><p>In regard to question No.18 on early supported discharge, I have raised this issue on several occasions, most recently under the committee discussions on emergency departments.  Everybody seems to agree it is what needs to be done but we do not seem to have any plans to extend it.  I will be following up separately on the issue with the Minister for Health. </p><p>Question No. 19 pertains to the budget for disability services.  The question that arises for me is why it is not being implemented.  The programme for Government proposed to allocate 5% for this area.  Some 50% of the current budget in disability services goes to five organisations and 80% goes to 50 organisations.  The reality is that three quarters of the current budget is being spent on services that are no longer appropriate.  We are back to doing what we used to do even though we know more about what we should be doing.  Everybody agreed that the situation in Aras Attracta was not on its own.  We have to do much more in respect of congregated settings.  The answer I received to this question was unacceptable.  If it is in the programme for Government and a political priority, why are we not allocating 5% to 8% of the budget to support innovative approaches?  The word &quot;innovative&quot; may be a misnomer because I am simply referring to bringing us to the current practice that has been developed in other countries.  Why are we not creating a momentum for change so that people have the services they want?  I know of one family who adapted their home but because we do not have the necessary systems, they are basically captive in the congregated setting.  It is a question of dignity and equality.  The best way to deal with the issue is to apportion 5% of the budget for a new way of doing things in order to create momentum over the next three years.  I think we would see a huge difference.  It is unacceptable to keep delaying.  The closure of congregated settings was due to take place from 2018 onwards but that target will not be met unless we do something radical.  It makes common sense to allocate 5% to 8% of the budget towards this.  I would like a stronger commitment but I think the issue is being blocked in the HSE - I am sorry to say that to Mr. O'Brien.  It is a Government priority but I think it is being actively blocked.  I do not know what hold the services have, especially those which currently receive 50% of the money, but it is unacceptable.  These are people's lives.  I would like clear answers on this.  I would prefer shorter answers rather than the cut and paste replies I have repeatedly heard on these issues.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-12a.621" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015021200002#K00200"><p>I will try to be as brief and clear as possible.  Deputy Kelleher mentioned the fair deal scheme, which I will deal with.  Others will speak about the Portiuncula hospital issue.  Both the Deputy and I agree that orthopaedic treatment is a serious pressure point as it keeps people mobile etc.  We must deal with it.</p> <p>  We have managed to reduce the fair deal backlog with additional funding, although I fully accept it is not enough.  I will continue to pursue the idea that the fair deal scheme should be demand-led and that element should ensure a more structured and planned mechanism so people do not continue in hospital where it is not necessary.  I dispute all the time how we deal with ourselves and our needs as we age.  It should not just be about long-stay care.  It always strikes me that in the three areas where I have responsibility - mental health, disability and older people - I am charged with taking people out of institutions with two areas but with older people, I am almost charged with putting them into institutions.  I will get to Senator van Turnhout's point, as I agree with her substantially.  There must be a balance but the fair deal scheme must be demand-led.  That will take substantial resources, although the country does not have them at this stage.  We will have those resources in future.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in mentioned the mental health legislation, which I received approximately four week weeks ago.  We had other issues to deal with and we will publish it very early in March.  The Deputy will be very happy with what the group has formulated.  There was no interference and it is a very independently minded group.  The work it has produced is incredible.  With regard to employment, education and stigma, we must remember that the Mental Health Act is really about detention and treatment, so the new legislation cannot deal with what the Deputy mentioned.  We can consider stigma and education of the people in general, rather than people with a difficulty with mental health, as something separate that needs to be enhanced.  We need to put a greater focus on such matters.  Each and every one of us has done a substantial job with mental health issues and there is no disagreement.  Perhaps we need to start having a clearer focus on removing the stigma.  We always perceive mental health to be at the extreme end with a "no recovery" model but we all know there is the possibility of recovery.  People can have poor mental health and good mental health at different stages in their lives.  This will be a substantial improvement.  The process is human-rights based and it is geared towards ensuring that when the capacity legislation is published and enacted, it will dovetail with that work.  The Deputy will be happy enough when that happens and we will have briefings for the Opposition at that time.</p> <p>  Senator van Turnhout commented on medical cards and the only way we will get to the point where we will not have the hard cases is when we all have medical cards.  I understand perfectly where the Senator is coming from and the specific cases which she raised and which we have been working on.  The legislation is written not in terms of the convention but family circumstances.  If people want to change that, it is a different campaign entirely.  Even two specific and recent reviews still tell us that we should not move to a condition-specific process or from the realm which stipulates that it must be based on financial means.  These were independent studies.</p> <p>  Senator Crown may know more about this than anybody.  The members can take my word, although we may not have said it aloud, that there is no barrier to treatment for cancer in this country, whether one has a medical card or not.  It is one great service that has emerged over the past number of years.  I give credit to both the previous Government and its predecessor in this respect.</p> <p>  When we have a serious look at medical cards, we know it is not always about medical access, as there may be issues with aids and appliances.  We have separated that sector and aids and appliances will not be given according to clinical need.  That is important to note.  There is a GP card, long-term illness card and the drugs refund card.  We are managing to deliver to people who are in the greatest need, although they do not fit criteria.  We are managing to deliver to these people a comprehensive medical system, as far as possible without fees.</p></speech>

I accept that fully.  Somebody with a GP card and a long-term illness card is better off that somebody with a medical card because there are no prescription charges.  There are facts, and it is not about me making stuff up, as Deputy Kelleher argued.  Numbers for discretionary medical cards have gone from over 50,000 to over 70,000.  We are using discretion and doing our very best to ensure we help people with significant difficulty.  We can all only imagine what it is like to have a child in those circumstances.  We are working within the legislation and I am not certain that at this point in the Government's lifetime, that legislation will be changed.  Both expert groups that examined the matter have indicated that cards should not be allocated on a condition-specific manner and the process should not get away from the finance element.</p> <p>  It is not that the system is unsympathetic, as it is very sympathetic.  We are doing our best.  Taking the aids and appliances out of the realm of the medical card is a major improvement.  There are people who could not change a prosthetic leg before, as it would cost &euro;3,000 or &euro;4,000, if they did not qualify for a medical card.  We must separate such issues and having the medical card as strictly facilitating access to medical services will give us a major advantage.</p> <p>  Senator van Turnhout also spoke about congregated settings.  I may be looking at her with a smile on my face because only yesterday I had two meetings about the issue.  There is new funding for social housing which is a substantial sum.  Senators may think I get annoyed about everything landing in the Department of Health but this is very much an issue related to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and its delivery of housing.  We are in discussions with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, and he is anxious to formulate a proposal for housing that would be delivered through funding from his Department.  The support services, which are in the residential settings as we speak, must come out with a person into that setting.  It is not a matter of having a house down the road for four people.</p><p>It is a bit more delicate and nuanced than that.  We are now talking to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government about congregated settings, on how we start to de-congregate and bring people into communities with the types of support that they will need.  The guy who carried out the Winterbourne investigation told me that the one big worry he had was that people coming out of congregrated settings into communities would become quite isolated and alone.  We do not want to make that same mistake.  We are in negotiations with the Department.  We believe that, although it will not be revolutionary, there will be substantial movement very shortly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-12a.629" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015021200002#L00200"><p>I will start by talking about Portiuncula Hospital, because a couple of members commented on the mention of the hospital in my statement.  The final paragraph on the matter also confirmed, in relation to the cases highlighted in the media recently, that the chief clinical director of Saolta, Dr. Pat Nash, is meeting, has been meeting and is continuing to meet with other families with a view to agreeing with them how best a review of their cases can be progressed.</p> <p>  While the first draft of the terms of reference refers to the seven cases - there has been consultation with the families involved - it is not in any way the case that, based on discussions with those families on the most appropriate way to address their concerns, they are precluded from being part of the review, if appropriate, although it may not be appropriate.  For example, it is possible that two of the families of the seven may not wish to take part in this review, and that is their choice.  It is also possible that there may be other families who would be included in the review.  Some of the cases, or some of the individuals who have come forward, have been involved in losses that go back as far as 35 years, so it may not be appropriate in all cases to include them in this review.  Dr. Nash is proceeding sensitively and carefully to make sure the review is comprehensive and appropriate to the individual circumstances.</p></speech>

He will do that in consultation with the families.</p> <p>  There was a two-part question on consultants, one part from Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and the other part from Deputy Kelleher.  The conclusion of the recent talks, and the substantial reversal of the additional pay cut that consultants were subjected to in 2012, is a key contributor to our ability to resume the effective recruitment of consultants.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred to vacancies.  There will always be a certain number of vacancies due to churn, which I think is understood, but that number is abnormally high at present.  However, although there have been several hundred competitions that have closed after selecting candidates, in many cases it was not possible to get them into employment until this recent pay issue had been resolved.  A significant number of these posts will now be filled on the basis of competitions that have already been completed.  In addition, we are now proceeding to advertise other vacancies.  There are 30 posts to be advertised this week, and there will be further waves.  My expectation is that while there will always be some level of churn-type vacancies, we are now going to see a significant change in the pattern of vacancies.  That will bring us up, over the course of the year, to the position that we would wish to be in.</p> <p>  As the Deputy correctly stated, with population change and increasing demands and so on, there are always cases in which we might wish to create additional posts.  That will be dependent upon an assessment of priorities, the availability of resources and then the process of a competition.  We are limited by the fact that there is a scarcity of supply of specialists in some disciplines.  It is not a universal issue, but this is true of certain disciplines.  The situation, I think, will change quite significantly in the next short while, and the recent pay agreement is critical to that.</p> <p>  In regard to the broader issue, the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, has already referred to her assessment that the Fair Deal scheme should be regarded as a demand-led scheme.  In fact, in many ways it is perfectly set up to be a demand-led scheme.  The problem with it is that there is lots of demand and insufficient resources, and that is a direct result of demographic change within society.  Let us be clear that it is a good and positive thing that more of us are aging and that we are living longer - none of us should ever characterise that as a problem - but it does create a need.  That need is best exemplified by the fact that as at 29 November there was a 15-week waiting period, beyond the process of financial assessment, to gain access to a Fair Deal bed, and the number of people in that queue stood at 1,937.  Due to the measures that I referred to, by the 5 January that waiting period had been brought down to 11 weeks.  That does not sound so dramatic, but the dramatic change was that the number waiting had been reduced by 759 to 1,188.  Today, the number stands at about 1,234.  That is partly because, as I outlined in my opening statement, we are seeing more people going on the list than coming off, even though we are taking off more people than ever.  The funding we have applied will sustain the 11-week waiting period until approximately the end of this month.  In the absence of additional resources to be applied to that scheme, our concern is that by the end of the year we will reach a waiting period of between 18 and 20 weeks and see 2,200 people on that list.  While I do not wish to be alarmist, in many respects, when we look at what is happening in the acute hospital system right now, it could be said that the funding mechanisms and the arrangements for the Fair Deal scheme, as welcome as they are in terms of the benefit it brings to those who gain access, has become the Achilles heel of the acute hospital system.  There is a direct correlation between the increase in waiting time and the increase in numbers on the waiting list for scheme, the numbers of delayed discharges in hospitals and the numbers recorded as waiting for admission on hospital trolleys each day.  Unless we solve that problem we are going to be in for a very difficult year in 2015.  That is not to say it is not already difficult, but it will be more difficult.</p> <p>  In regard to the question of where I see clinical risk, I see clinical risk arising as a consequence of that.  This is the direct result of demographic change.  In most Western societies which did not experience the type of economic implosion that we experienced a few years ago, when they talk about health cuts they talk about bending the curve of increase of expenditure on health.  In Ireland, as of necessity, we have had to contemplate actual reductions in expenditure on health.  We need, as quickly as we can - hopefully, the signs of economic recovery will facilitate this - to get back to a point at which the demographic impact can be reflected in a demographic allocation.  We have not been there.  I regard the service plan as realistic in that it said there would be enough money to hold services as they were but not necessarily enough to meet increasing demand. </p> <p>  The other consequence is that, when faced with the number of people on trolleys that we have, it is an inevitable and unavoidable consequence that access to hospitals for non-urgent elective procedures becomes curtailed.  While something may not be urgent, that does not mean it is not chronic.  It does have an immediate adverse impact on the person whose admission is delayed and it can mean that over time the person's condition deteriorates, meaning that he or she needs a greater intervention than he or she otherwise would.  That is essentially what was referred to in the bones of the question.</p></speech>

I apologise to the Deputy but I should has answered his question.  Although the matter is ringing alarm bells, it is something that we have known for some considerable time.</p><p>The difference is that we do now know what we need.  The difficulty is that we do not have the resources to supply it.  For the first time ever we have a very good handle on the situation, what the need is and what the increasing need will be.  We have 124 public sector bed units.  We are determined that we will not lose any of them and we have a programme in place for refurbishment and for new builds.  Mr. Pat Healy could perhaps give more details on Waterford, which is getting a new 50 bed community nursing unit, CNU.  That type of development is ongoing and it is not all in the private sector.  We cannot afford to lose beds in the private sector either because of the demographic demand.  For the first time ever, we know what we need and we know where we need it.</p><p> Another factor which comes across from time to time, which I find very disturbing, is that not everyone in a bed awaiting another bed in an acute hospital is an older person.  We must get that into our heads as well.  The argument takes place that somehow or other we are concentrating on the public sector and at other times on the private sector.  The beds are needed and what we should concentrate on is the quality of care.  It will be a different type of care for each person.  There will be step-down intensive rehabilitation and all the other treatments that are required.  We are working very hard to find a solution.  It is correct to say that we cannot afford to lose any bed in either the private sector or the public sector.</p></speech>

His question was on universal health insurance, UHI, and the extent to which the Department is working actively on it.  We have staff assigned to that area and they continue to work on it.  The commitments the Minister published two weeks ago for 2015 include a number of deliverables in that area, which we are working to try to achieve.  A major one is to complete the initial costing exercise on UHI and to revert to the Government with a roadmap for the next steps.  As part of that, we have available to us the consultation exercise that was undertaken by the Department on UHI.  We are working at present with the ESRI on an initial costing analysis.  When we get those two things in place, we will work on a roadmap that will look at a number of steps which have been taken, and a number of further steps that would need to be taken.  The Minister will go back to the Government on the matter.</p> <p>  Other relevant aspects of the priorities to that policy are the Minister&rsquo;s package of measures to increase the numbers with private health insurance as a step along the road and also, as the committee has debated, the universal access to GP services, the first steps which relate to children aged under six and people aged over 70.  In short, we continue to work on the policy.</p></speech>

The barriers to entry to the GMS system have been removed substantially and more than 300 additional GPs have been recruited into the system in the past year.  It is unclear how many people are represented by each organisation.  The other difficulty is that we are at a very critical point in the negotiations with the IMO.  We are discussing fee setting, which comes at the end of the negotiations.  I will not be making that call and perhaps the Deputy could put the question to the Minister when he comes.  I do not believe it would be useful at this stage to have another organisation involved because it is so late in the process.  Even though GPs are represented by two organisations, they will make up their own minds on an individual basis on whether they wish to participate.  If they decide not to participate, there is very little we can do about it.  They are sole traders and they will make their own decisions on the matter.  It would not be helpful to get involved in the negotiations at this late stage.  The group clearly represents GPs, but it is unclear how many GPs are represented by either the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, or the National Association of General Practitioners.</p></speech>

The average length of stay has been cut very dramatically.  Day-of-surgery admission has increased very dramatically.  The throughput in the acute medical assessment units and medical assessment units, the numbers of which I provided in my script, show that there is a huge change in the way substantial cohorts of the population are cared for.  Despite of the extraction of so many staff, the level of activity is up.  The absence rates are down significantly in recent years.  They now stand, on average, at below comparators for the National Health Service in the United Kingdom.  There are very significant improvements.  That is not to say that there is perfection, because of course one never gets to that wonderful state, but this is not the health service that it was seven years ago.  What we are describing in relation to the fair deal scheme - we must recall that the legislation was not in place back then - is that it is a self-contained process.  The only mechanism by which the health service can provide long-term care for those who have been assessed through a very rigorous process as requiring it, is through a prescribed process from a set amount of money.  Even if we had the money, we could not do it outside of that constraint, and should not.  In fact, it would be unlawful to do so.</p></speech>

It is the same question that I submitted last September and it is unfortunate that it took six months to get the information I wanted on consultant vacancies.  It appears that there are 325 vacancies in real terms.  My question relates to subsection (f) of my question which is about the number of retirements expected in 2015.  Again, similar to October, I have received an inadequate answer.  If one takes it that there are 2,300 posts, one can assume the average consultant will work in the system for approximately 20 years and that there will be 100 retirements in any one year.  The details on who is retiring and how we are planning are causing problems.  If one offers a job in the morning to someone who is working in the UK, Australia or Canada, the likelihood is that they will not be able to take up the job in Ireland for 12 months.  Therefore, we appear to be advertising jobs when the vacancy arises.  I ask that we would get a report on how we are going to deal with the matter in the future.  I note that in the reply to my question it was indicated that someone will be appointed to put together all of the data.  Could we put together information on who is retiring in the next 12 months in order that we can advertise the vacancies long before they arise?  It has taken six months to get a response.  That is the type of change we need in terms of planning.</p><p> One of the other questions I have - I think it was question No. 26 - concerns the appointment of people without interview.  I am referring to managerial and administrative staff.  In real terms, approximately 1,527 people have been appointed over the past five years without interview.</p></speech>

Has a review been carried out in respect of those appointments?  The HIQA report on the ambulance service clearly identified that a number of staff appointed did not feel they had the skills to do the job.  I do not accept the reply here that 1,527 people were appointed without interview, and that none of them has been identified as not having the skills.  I ask that we get a detailed report about what training processes were put in place for those people.  We also have 184 people who went up not one, but two grades or more, in that period without interview.  We need a detailed response on this matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-12a.656" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1075" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015021200002#N00400"><p>I have two smaller questions before I talk about question No. 16.  I welcome the announcement this morning from Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda about the 88 new nurses and the 25 new beds.  Is extra money being allocated to pay for those or are they coming out of the specific budget already allocated to the hospital?</p> <p>  I want to publicly thank Mr. O'Brien and the team that was involved in the negotiations for the drug Soliris last week.  The outcome must have been fiercely frustrating under the circumstances, but the gratitude of the people directly impacted is enormous.  In his statement, Mr. O'Brien described being frustrated by the amount of money that had to be paid and the negotiations with the particular company.  It might have been lost in translation but it appeared that his frustration was pointed to the patients, as though they were the cause of potential reduction of other services, and I know he did not mean that at all.  He might just clear up the record because it caused a little bit of hurt to some of the patients.</p> <p>  The main thing I want to talk about is the response to question No. 16.  I say this with respect, but I am sorry that Mr. O'Brien has to answer it because I would have preferred the Minister to answer the question.  This committee had six full sessions on end of life and palliative care and bereavement in Ireland the year before last.  The discussions spanned 32 oral and 44 written presentations.  It involved a substantial amount of work and commitment from this committee to put 37 recommendations to the HSE and to the Minister.  With the greatest of respect, the response we got back was far from reasoned, in my opinion.  It did not do justice to the commitment, energy and sincerity not just of the people around this table, but of those involved in the area.  I genuinely felt it was a cut-and-paste response, which did everybody a disservice.  There were one or two things in it regarding the children's palliative care policy which were very welcome.  The medical cards for children and adults who have terminal illnesses are, again, very welcome.  However, it did not show any strategic thinking or vision whatsoever in this area.  </p> <p>  I want to talk specifically about recommendation No. 15, that palliative and end-of-life patients be given a special patient status to co-ordinate the care.  This was rejected on the basis that other medical specialists or patients' groups might want the same thing and therefore we might run into difficulties.  We all know the vast majority of money that is spent on care is spent in the last year of patients' lives so it is already costly.  Some of our initiatives and suggestions were going to save money.  With respect, can I ask the Minister - in his absence - and the officials who are here to come back another day and give the work done due respect by going through the 37 recommendations and discussing them with us logically?  There may be reasons some of them cannot be done, but I respectfully ask the Minister to give due regard to the ones I know can be done and to put in place some plans for how we will achieve them together.</p></speech>

I realise it is hard to recruit senior decision-making doctors in some hospitals, and that junior doctors are less experienced when making decisions.  What are Mr. O'Brien's plans to deal with this problem of delayed discharges when he has already allocated 300 additional fair deal places and 400 additional home care packages?</p> <p> The HSE and the Department are working on getting another 200 beds open across the State in the next two weeks.  Where is this happening?  I believe 500 transitional and community beds have been opened or re-funded.  What are their locations and what funding was given?</p> <p>  I also welcome the news this morning about the 88 nurses and 25 beds in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  Can Mr. O'Brien give me the plans to deal with the serious overcrowding in accident and emergency units and the trolley situation in the Lourdes hospital in Drogheda, which is one of the worst in the country?  Has the HSE got a strategy in place to raise awareness of number of clinics currently available in Louth County Hospital?  As far as I and people in the area are concerned, there are still too many people visiting the accident and emergency unit in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital when they could have gone to the minor injuries unit at Louth County Hospital.  I have met with the manager of Louth County Hospital, Louise O'Hare, and with Louth County Council.  We are trying to put up signs on both hospital sites, stating what is available and the opening hours, and hopefully that will help.</p> <p>  At the last meeting, we talked about enhancing the services of Louth County Hospital, including the policy on ambulances, extending opening hours, etc.  Has there been any progress made on these matters since the last meeting?</p> <p>  I agree with the Minister of State that a medical card is a point of access to medical care.  In his report today, Mr. O'Brien stated that he has appointed a manager, which I welcome.  Nearly every query I have in my clinic at the moment is to do with discretionary medical cards.  We need something done urgently over the medical cards.</p></speech>

I apologise if the first issue I raise was dealt with while I was out of the room.  Could I have an update on the situation regarding the cost of drugs and advances made in reducing that cost, both for the country and for individuals?  Second, I have been asked to raise the issue of meningitis by a group involved in this area.  Apparently a meningitis B vaccine is available.  Could I have an update on the situation regarding the introduction of the meningitis B vaccine to Ireland?  Apparently it is two years since it received its European licence.  Given that it is an illness that can lead to loss of life, it would be very useful if the vaccine could be provided around the country.</p></speech>

The Chief Medical Officer has just received a recommendation on whether the vaccine should be available on the broader remit.  It is not done in other countries to any great extent but we are assessing that recommendation and there will be a decision very shortly.  It is not just life threatening, as the Deputy knows, but can result in very severe disabilities, including brain damage.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-12a.664" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015021200002#O00100"><p>Mr. Woods will address issues relating to Our Lady of Lourdes hospital and Mr. Hennessy will address the palliative care and cost of drugs issues.</p> <p>  On the 200 beds referred to by Deputy Fitzpatrick, these are opening on a phased basis.  Some of them are already open and others will open within a week or two, all based on recruitment profiles.  There will be 16 beds opened at the Clontarf unit; 25 at Cuan Ros; 25 at St. Vincent's, Fairview; 25 at Ballinasloe; ten at Farranlea Road, Cork; four at Heather House community nursing unit; five at the Ballina District Hospital; six at Sacred Heart, Castlebar; two at Ard Evan, Carndonagh, eight at Killybegs; five at Merlin Park Hospital, Galway; five at &Aacute;ras Mhic Dara; 12 at the Hospital of the Assumption; five at St. Ita's, Newcastle west; and 20 at the Royal Hospital, Donnybrook.  I should emphasise that these beds are provided as responsive measures and are not permanent openings.</p> <p>  On the issue of senior decision-makers, there is no real relationship between senior decision-makers and delayed discharges.  At the point at which a person is classified as having a delayed discharged, he or she has already completed an acute phase of care and a decision-maker has signed off that he or she is fit to be discharged.  The issue of senior decision-makers is more a front of house one.  In certain locations where it has proven more difficult to recruit senior consultants and there is an excessive reliance either on temporary consultants or on more junior staff because of the absence of senior decision-makers, this tends to result in a higher than typical admissions profile from emergency department presentations.  This means that patients who might otherwise have been discharged by a senior decision-maker are listed for admission, which adds to the number of people awaiting admission and, therefore, increases the number of people on trolleys.  The senior decision-maker issue is key in terms of trolley counts but only in a small number of locations where there are typical or patterns of difficulty in recruiting staff.  This is often the case in some of the smaller hospitals on the western seaboard.</p> <p>  On Senator Burke's questions regarding vacancies, the vacancy profile is likely to have been changed significantly by the announcement by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform of a further extension to next year of the grace period for retirements.  There are likely to be consultants and senior nurses who but for that announcement, because it is persons above a certain income threshold who stand to benefit, will not now, we hope, be retiring but will continue their working careers.  The Senator is correct that we need to ensure that we accelerate the pace at which we recruit known future vacancies.  However, in that regard we must take into account the fact that an individual is not obliged to give us significant notice of their intention to retire.  In other words, until an employee has actually formally indicated his or her retirement, we would not be at liberty to proceed to recruit to replace him or her.  I am certain there are ways we can improve the position.</p> <p>  On the issue of appointments without interview, it is important to stress that these are not persons coming in off the street into jobs.  Rather, they are people who had previously been through a recruitment process and were already employees of the relevant health entity, be that the HSE or one of the agencies.  The process of moving people from one role to another was a by-product of the employment moratorium at a time when certain grades of staff could not be recruited while at the same time more senior personnel were being encouraged-persuaded to leave the system via incentivised exit processes.  This is one of the reasons there are so many people accounted for in this way, in addition to the regularisation process, which was broadly speaking provided for under the terms of the Haddington Road agreement.  During the same period, one of the hardest cuts to the training budget in the health service was imposed.  It is something that during my time in the HSE we have sought to reverse significantly.  It is undoubtedly a by-product of that period that some people were promoted more rapidly than might otherwise have been the case because more senior staff were exited from the system and that they could not be supported in the way that one would wish when people are promoted.  There are now significant programmes of development in place through HSE learning and development, funded external training programmes, funded third level training, action research and so on.</p> <p>  An internal audit is under way.  We have been in correspondence with the Committee of Public Accounts in relation to that audit and in relation to the consistency of the application of the regularisation protocol to ensure it was done strictly in accordance with the terms of the relevant circular.  This process is, as I said, currently under way by the HSE internal audit function. </p> <p>  In regard to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, I will pass over to Mr. Woods to comment on that.  Mr. Hennessy will then comment on the drugs issue and I would like to come back in again after that.</p></speech>

In regard to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, we are looking at a set of arrangements to support the hospital, including the provision of 24 private nursing homes in the short term.

In the context of the Department of Health, it is a critical service that has a huge bearing on the operation of the overall health service.  It is acknowledged that the palliative service countrywide is uneven.  However, as evident from the responses we are attempting to address that in a systematic and strategic way and to bring consistency and standards into place.  This takes the form of addressing gaps where inpatient specialist units are concerned.  There are some examples about which I can speak in detail to the Deputy, including in relation to additional consultant posts and clinical nursing posts.  There is a very strong focus in our service plan 2015 on addressing this issue and on working closely with voluntary providers and the hospice foundation.  I accept the point that there is a wider dimension to this that involves multiple interests, including other Departments.</p> <p>  On Deputy Dowds' question regarding the cost of drugs, I will forward a precise response to that question to the Deputy.  In approximate terms, current reimbursement costs are &euro;1.8 billion per annum.  That encompasses drugs provided under the medical card scheme, drugs payment scheme, long-term illness scheme and hi-tech medicines.  On reductions, the approximate reductions over 2013, 2014 and 2015 will be &euro;400 million.  This is part of a concentrated and ongoing programme of cost reduction on drugs and medicines designed to bring us more into line with our European neighbours.  Drug components, in terms of reference pricing, and preferred prescribing initiatives, are significant issues.  The process of seeking to achieve the outcome required while ensuring continuity of supply continues.</p></speech>

I believe that a small group of people should meet with the Department and the HSE in relation to the framing of the type of strategy that we need in relation to end-of-life issues because this is not only about hospice care.</p><p>We all know that from the hearings.  It would be a very worthwhile exercise to sit down and decide not just why this or that was not recommended but on a framework for delivery.  The Department and the HSE would be quite willing to engage in that process.</p></speech>

The purpose of the process was to try to reduce the cost of the drug.  The statement I issued could not reasonably be interpreted in any sense as being critical of the patients.  How it is reported may affect how it is interpreted.  How it is written does not lend itself to that interpretation.  All the adjectives were directed at the drug company, not the patients.  The reason given for the decision was to ensure that patients were not caught in the crossfire of the disagreement between Alexion and the health service. </p></speech>

It does to some extent affect the negotiating position that the company takes.  Anyone involved in a negotiation will take a view as to where the strength of the argument lies and who will have to blink first.  Ultimately we blinked, because it got to the point at which we were satisfied that the company would not change its position and that to carry on would render no benefit.</p> <p>  I do not resile in any sense from the comments I made.  While it is reasonable for drug companies to seek to recover the money they invest in development and some element of profit, I believe in this case we are seeing excess profitability.  It is not only reasonable but essential that we draw attention to that and seek to secure a reasonable cost for drugs, given that ultimately the overall budget is limited.</p></speech>

In this situation there was a very small group of people whose families and communities were, quite rightly, extremely anxious that they get this drug.  That is a particularly invidious situation for everybody.  I include Mr. O&rsquo;Brien and the team in the HSE in that.  I know how difficult it is for the family, but for any of us to make a decision where known individuals are at stake is really hard.  That has resource implications, just as the question about a vaccine for meningitis B has resource implications.  The only difference in the case of meningitis B is that we do not know who will be affected by not having that vaccine.  It is yet to emerge, if we do not implement that, who will get meningitis B who might not have caught it if we had used the vaccine.  It is a more anonymous process, but we have to weigh up its costs and benefits.  We make decisions all the time on investment, whether in accident and emergency departments or on home help services, where we do not know the individuals involved.  The particular flavour of the recent matter which the committee might consider in its deliberations is how much more difficult it is when it involves a very small, defined group of people.  We are trying to avoid playing God in those circumstances.  It is a very difficult place for everybody to be.</p></speech>

This time last year the waiting time for the fair deal scheme was approximately six weeks.  In the meantime it went up to 16 weeks, but now, because of the resources put in, it is down to 11 weeks.  It is quite alarming to hear that by the end of this year it is projected that the waiting time will be between 18 and 20 weeks.</p> <p>  Several families are borrowing money to get a loved one into a nursing home.  The application takes approximately four weeks and they then apply to various nursing homes.  If a place comes up they are afraid to lose it, so they borrow the money.  After they have done that and settled their loved one, they panic in case the money will run out before the fair deal place is secured.  Has the HSE received applications from several families wanting to waive the fee for one or two weeks because they cannot borrow any more money and are afraid their loved ones will lose the place and they will go back to square one?  How will the HSE deal with this in the future?  As soon as a place comes up families will borrow money, but it is not a bottomless pit.  A family who came to me recently said the most they could borrow was &euro;6,000.  If the waiting time goes up to 18 or 20 weeks they might have to borrow &euro;20,000, and even with that they would not secure their loved one&rsquo;s place.</p> <p>  Are we any closer to making Daxas and fampridine available on the medical card scheme?</p> <p>  Mr. O&rsquo;Brien said 97% of patients access specialist inpatient beds for palliative care within seven days.  That is good, but is it in their area of choice?  Is it suitable for families?  Is it in the patients' home towns or is it miles away?</p> <p>  Mr. O&rsquo;Brien said the number of discretionary medical cards had gone from 50,000 to 70,000 in the past year, but I presume most of that is the returning of cards that had been taken away.  There are some very sick children with life-limiting conditions who are financially outside the medical card bracket.  I know of a case which is so rare that there are only four people in the world on the special trials.  The family has been refused a medical card.  The child will undergo numerous operations.  The mother has had to give up work to care for the child.  Where does discretion fit into this?  I am sure there is no one in the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, who can assess how much that rare disease will cost the family.</p></speech>

Would Mr. O&rsquo;Brien guide me with regard to whom I should send them to?</p> <p>  It is a pleasure to have the witnesses here, particularly the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.</p><p>I thank the Minister of State for her honesty.  She is always up front and does not beat around the bush.  I left the room - I had to go upstairs for a while - but I have listened to what the Minister of State said about the fair deal scheme, which is in crisis.  The unfortunate part about it is that it is the people who are in crisis as well, the families who are dealing with it on a daily basis with loved ones they cannot manage.  I was interested to hear the Minister of State say that a new community was opening somewhere - I think it was Waterford.  I hope it does not end up like Hollybrook in Inchicore.  Two years down the road, it is still a step-down facility for St. James's Hospital, although it was supposed to be a new 50-bed unit for people who needed nursing home care.  We are now left without extra beds.  It is an awful shame, because there are many people living in the Dublin 8, 10 and 12 districts who were promised that a percentage of the beds would facilitate them, and this is still not the case.  I hope that the unit the Minister of State is opening, wherever it is, does not end up the same way.  I have one question, which the Minister of State might not be able to answer now.  When will the Hollybrook care centre open up to the community again?  When will it actually take people who are living in the community, rather than being a step-down facility for St. James's Hospital two years on?</p><p> I thank Mr. O'Brien for his report, which is always informative.  It is probably covers too much to get in at any particular time.  Could Mr. O'Brien send us some information about the palliative care response for people who are dealing with very ill people at home?  What exactly is the role of the palliative care staff  who come in and visit them at home?  What service do they actually provide?  Is it just changing a drip?  More information would be very helpful.</p></speech>

The national rare disease plan launched last summer - July, I think - was universally welcomed.  It is an interesting initiative in that such work has not previously been done.  It is one of the reasons there was such a positive attitude among politicians, medics and so on.  Apart from saying it seems to be a good plan, which seems to be the accepted view on it, since it was launched last July there is the issue of funding, which is always difficult given our financial position.  Is there any expectation that some funding will be initiated to at least make a start in implementing a very good plan?  Is there an expectation that we could begin to move it along?</p></speech>

When will construction works begin and, more importantly, when might they finish?</p> <p>  I have heard people talk about crowding in accident and emergency departments.  I heard the Minister speaking in the Seanad last month and he talked about a minor injuries unit in Smithfield, Dublin.  We have one in Loughlinstown hospital, which is also very under-used.  How can you get that message out to people - to go to the minor injuries units rather than ending up in some other very crowded accident and emergency department?</p> <p>  Could the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, talk to her colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, about the difficulty regarding speech therapy for young children, especially those with Down's syndrome and, within that cohort, those who are diagnosed as mild?  This is also the case for children with autism.  If children go to an ordinary primary school they do not get speech therapy, whereas those who go to special schools do.  It is very unfair.  Perhaps the Minister of State could talk to the Minister for Education and Skills about whether speech therapy could be delivered in a primary school setting rather than in health centres, because at least the teachers know who the children are and they are in school every day.  Many of them miss appointments in the health service, and months go by without the children receiving that therapy.</p> <p>  Finally, I congratulate the Minister on the public health (alcohol) Bill.  We have been talking so much here about overcrowding in hospitals.  We know that 2,000 beds are taken up every night in our hospitals by people who are addicted to alcohol.</p></speech>

I have a few quick questions.  I am sorry I did not have an opportunity to submit questions.  Would the Ministers and the head of the HSE acknowledge, in light of the recent coverage of concerns about obstetric services, that we had a big warning several years ago with the Galway tragedy ?  If we just adopted a policy of aiming for an entirely consultant-provided obstetric service, with trainees there to be trained and not to provide services, many of the problems we encounter on an ongoing basis would no longer occur.  This would save money.  At the moment we are spending quite a bit of money on obstetric indemnification.  The simplest way to reduce the indemnification cost associated with obstetrics is to reduce the risk, and the simplest way to reduce the risk is to increase to 100% the proportion of patient decisions made by fully trained obstetricians and not trainees.  This is the standard that many of us who have dealt with the private sector are used to, and I believe it is the one that should be applied.  Not only is it humane medicine and logical public policy, but it will also save money.</p><p>With respect to the ongoing crisis, I am very sympathetic to the fact that emergency departments sometimes get crowded in an unexpected way in response to flu, severe winters and different things that can happen, but we do not have all our ducks in a row on this yet.  I have had occasion several times in the last few weeks to see patients of mine in the emergency department of St. Vincent's hospital<font color="#FF0000">, </font>and it is as overcrowded as I have ever seen it.  One patient of mine is an elderly gentleman who was admitted to St. Vincent's private hospital with a chest infection, who needed to be admitted not for cancer treatment but for antibiotic treatment.  His very supportive family wishes to take him home, will pay most of the costs of his support at home and will pay for their own carers, but they are aware that they are entitled to a certain level of HSE support.  During the last week, for some reason I could not quite understand, the planned discharge with HSE coverage suddenly evaporated.  We were told that the HSE had decided, because he was so dependent, that he needed more care than it had originally budgeted for, which is reasonable.  It then stated that it was not prepared to give that care, which we can discuss, but inexplicably it said that if he was transferred back to the public hospital he would be entitled to a higher level of HSE support than he would get coming from the private hospital.  At a time when our emergency department should consider issuing stilts to people coming in so they can pick their way through the trolleys that are blocking most of the floor space because we cannot get people out of beds on the other side, it is illogical that this would occur.  Clearly, this is no one's fault; this person is dealing with their budget and their rules.  However, there is a complete lack of joined-up thinking on this.  I thank Mr. O'Brien for taking my inquiry personally.  I will make the details available to him on a personal basis afterwards.</p><p>With respect to the consultant hiring crisis, those of us who tried not to wallow in <i>schadenfreude </i>have to say, &quot;I told you so.&quot;  Over the years, multiple attempts were made to change the conditions of employment of consultants, and we saw what this resulted in - a decline in appointments.  There is one quick, simple fix, which would go a long way towards reducing the burden.  Why do we force healthy, fit, intellectually capable, highly skilled people who do not want to retire to retire at 65?</p><p>Can anyone explain that to me?  We do not make our politicians retire.  A few of us are in the process of trying to get a test case together for the courts on this, which will be heard by judges who do not have to retire at 65.  The decision is being made by Ministers who do not have to retire at 65.

The average age at death of a German who is still alive at 65 was 67.  On average, people lived two to three years after retirement.  A woman who is alive at the retirement age of 65 now will live well into her 80s, as will a man.  The average age at death is approximately 80 for a man and mid-80s for a woman.  At a time when we cannot sustain the burden of pension debt, why are we forcing people who do not want to retire to do so?  I do not get it at all and it makes no sense.  I have seen very healthy and fit people.  A particular surgical colleague of mine who was running a clinic, operating, teaching students and running a research lab one day was told the next by the State that he had to become its dependant.  By the way, the same State subsequently hired him to a very full administrative role in which he is doing a very good job.</p></speech>

Mr. Tony O'Brien's comments to the committee this morning have already caused a stir locally.  They were broadcast on the news and I have received many phonecalls on them.  They appear to be directed at the patients.  This type of comment does not appear to be placed before other resource issues.  The Supplementary Estimate-----</p></speech>

One could easily apply the same logic to the Department of Justice and Equality, which the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, said in his Supplementary Estimates speech was responsible for &euro;52 million of extra cost last year on foot of delays in periodic payment legislation for catastrophic medical accidents.  Why is the Department of Justice and Equality not being targeted in the same way?  We are talking here about three or four patients, one of whom had to answer questions on this very point last week on radio.  While I have not discussed the matter with him since, it appeared to be very difficult for him from what I heard on the radio.  Mr. O'Brien should withdraw the statement and get back on board with whatever negotiations he is having with the drug companies.  It was an extremely unfortunate thing to say.  When I received the e-mail from the HSE last week announcing the provision of Soliris, which is already being provided to ten people and was just being extended to three or four others, I refused to send it on to the individuals who had been in touch with me as they would have been very hurt had they seen it.  Of course, they saw it eventually.  It was very unfortunate and seemed to be a spanner in the works of a good news announcement extending a drug that was already available to other patients.  Mr. O'Brien needs to withdraw those comments.</p></speech>

It goes to the issue of a number of investigations which are under way.  If someone is working in a hospital as a locum and an error is made, nothing prevents that person from being re-employed in another hospital.  There is no mechanism to record issues.  There is an issue arising where a hospital is short a doctor on a Friday, for example, and rings up to find that the only person available is someone who may have had difficulties in other hospitals but is put in to a job for the weekend.  There is no record within the HSE on this issue.  I ask for something on that.  Is there a mechanism for dealing with this issue?</p></speech>

I was in Strasbourg at the European Parliament and my flight connection was late.  I hasten to add that while the flight was late; I was not.  I was perfectly on time, but these things happen sometimes and ministerial air transport is not as available as it was in the past.  I had to get a later flight.  Thanks to modern technology, I have been able to tune in on my iPhone for most of the morning and have followed the proceedings.  I will touch on some of the questions and Mr. O'Brien and Deputy Lynch will want to come back on others.  There is probably no point in making my opening statement at this stage.</p> <p>  On the national rare diseases plan, I am very keen to see a national rare diseases office opened this year, if at all possible.  It will not require a huge spend this year.  People can often be very frustrated when a great deal of work is done and programmes, statements and strategies are produced and agreed which are not followed up on.  It is important that we at least make a start on that one in 2015.</p> <p>  Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor asked about the children's hospital and satellite centres.  The planning application for the children's hospital on the St. James's campus will be lodged in June.  The design is being finalised and is hugely exciting.  It will be an iconic building.  It is really impressive and even has its own football pitch.  At the same time, the planning applications for the satellite centres at Blanchardstown and Tallaght will also be lodged.  While it will then depend on An Bord Plean&aacute;la providing planning permission, there have been extensive pre-planning negotiations.  Assuming it gives permission within 18 or 36 weeks, as the case may be, we can certainly commence site works by the end of the year with tendering and construction commencing in 2016.  There has been a great deal of talk about what we are going to do in 2016 and how we are going to commemorate the centenary.  I am very enthused by all the different plans for 2016, but there will be no better testament than to begin the construction of our national children's hospital on the site of the South Dublin Union, which, of course, was one of the sites of the Rising 100 years ago.  It will be to recall the commitment in the Proclamation to cherish all the children equally.  Construction is to start on the satellite centres next year and they can be open to see patients at Blanchardstown and Tallaght in 2017.  It will be 2019 before the main hospital at St. James's will be fully constructed and it will start to see the first children then and be fully commissioned over a period of months after than.</p> <p>  The Deputy is completely right about the minor injury units.  There are units at Loughlinstown, Smithfield, Cork, Dundalk, Roscommon and Monaghan.  They are not open 24-7 but they are open a great deal of the time.  Mr. Tony O'Brien and I have discussed ways in which we can advertise that a bit better in order that people know these services are available, use them a bit more and are not waiting in emergency department waiting rooms when they could be seen elsewhere.  The downside is that the HSE will no doubt be criticised for spending money on PR again, but this is an occasion when spending money on a bit of advertising and public relations makes sense.</p> <p>  I thank Deputy Mitchell O'Connor for her comments on the public health (alcohol) Bill.  We have a lot of problems in our health service, not least issues such as overcrowding in emergency departments and long waits for treatment.  We can address that in the short term by-----</p></speech>

I do lose time from time to time, so maybe I have had a pacemaker put in.  It is Jerry and the pacemakers.</p><p> Alcohol, obesity, smoking and inactivity contribute to a significant number of problems in our emergency departments and I am very keen to start doing things in that space.  I know members are engaged in pre-legislative scrutiny of the public health (alcohol) Bill and I welcome their input.  Nothing is set in stone and I am very keen to hear members' views as to how the Bill might be improved.</p><p> Senator Crown had a query regarding maternity services.  We have been paying a great deal of attention to maternity services in the past year or two.  It is important to reiterate that maternity services in Ireland are safe.  In Ireland some 60,000 women are pregnant at present, and for many this is their first pregnancy.  These women do not need to be worried unnecessarily about concerns about our maternity services.  That is evidenced by the fact that our maternal and perinatal mortality rates are on a par with anywhere in the western world.  We have more consultant obstetricians and midwives than ever before.  Although we do not have enough of either, we have more than ever before at a time when our birth rate is falling, not increasing.  That is not to say that mistakes are not made.  Medicine and midwifery are judgment calls.  One will visit a patient, examine and conduct investigations, talk to her, put all the information together and make a decision.  Sometimes the decisions that are made are wrong, but that does not mean that the standard of care is poor or that doctors or midwives are not competent.  Sometimes there is malpractice, and when it occurs, it is important that there is open disclosure.  It is important that hospital management, doctors, nurses and midwives are honest with patients and their families about what happened and engage in full and open disclosure.  It really bothers me that this is not always the case, even though that is the policy.  It will become the law in the future if I have anything to do with it.</p><p> Senator Crown has suggested that midwifery services be entirely consultant provided.  I do not agree with that.  The Senator and members will agree that we always need doctors in training but perhaps the ratio of doctors in training to the number of consultants is wrong.  Perhaps we need more consultants and fewer doctors in training, but one always needs a stream of doctors in training coming through in order that we have consultants.  We have a very good community midwifery service and some very good midwife-led units in the country.  There are many models in other parts of the world, from Finland to Holland, where many of the maternity services are midwife-led and not consultant-led.  We are working on a maternity strategy this year and I want to have it completed this year.  Some aspects of it may turn out to be politically controversial, but I am not bothered about that as I am more concerned about high quality maternity services than votes.  Part of what will have to be considered in the formulation of the strategy is the appropriate ratio of consultants to doctors in training and whether there is scope for expanding our midwifery-led services as well.  Perhaps the consultant-led medical model is not the correct model for all maternity services in Ireland.  I cannot answer the question regarding patients and perhaps a member from the HSE can do that.</p><p> I agree with Senator Crown's comments on the retirement age of 65 years.  The new contracts do not require that doctors retire at 65.  However, some existing contracts do and a contract is a contract.  I have no personal objection with doctors staying beyond the age of 65 years.  Quite frankly we need them, so if they are willing to stay on, we should be very open to it.</p><p> I read the statement and I heard Mr. O'Brien's comments on my way in on the issue of Soliris and it is very clear that any criticism was directed at the company and absolutely nobody on this side of the table or anyone under any circumstances wants to be or intends to be critical of patients.  We will be critical of vested interests on occasions where it is necessary.</p></speech>

The Deputy raised a real issue in respect of the fair deal scheme and the times when we have extended waiting period beyond financial approval for access to the scheme itself.  We know it results in some families going to extraordinary lengths to care for their loved ones, as is perfectly understandable.  Unfortunately, access to funding is governed by the legislation which requires that it is done in chronological order, which means places are allocated in the order in which people applied and were approved.  We are not in a position to provide financial assistance outside of that.  I will ask my colleague, Mr. Pat Healy to comment on people asking for exemptions.</p></speech>

The guidance we give to our local offices is to be sensitive to the needs of people and help them to understand very clearly where they are on the waiting list.  We try to give them the likely waiting time of, say, ten or 11 weeks, depending on where they are, and by and large it arrives around that time.  One cannot be absolutely exact as it is fluid, but we try to provide as much information and guide people as to when they are likely to get the formal place and to expedite it as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

The one thing it will tell us is that the fair deal scheme is unsustainable in its present form.  The idea that a person with means would pay in the range of &euro;250 to &euro;290 per week for a service that is costing anything up to &euro;1,200 to provide is unsustainable.  I take on board the point made by Deputy Catherine Byrne.  In my view people who never owned their own home, always rented a house from the local authority, and have no other income other than the State pension should be protected in terms of access to the fair deal scheme, but there will have to be changes.  It is an incredible scheme.  It is called a fair deal for a very good reason, because everyone has access to it.  We have to take a serious look at the additional funding that will be needed.  Some of the funding will have to come from the public purse but equally we have to look at other sources of income.  I am not going to pre-empt what is in the review but if it does not deal with the funding element of it, it will have done a very poor job.  There are other elements and I hope it will allow people in the community access to fair deal while still being able to remain in their own home.  We have to step back and take a serious look at the scheme.  I hope that people who have an interest in it would come together with us and take a look at how it can be achieved.</p></speech>

I think the sort of referral may go some way to answering the question.  For those gaining access to palliative care as an inpatient, 49% are referred from their home, 47% from an acute hospital, from which we infer that it is geographically proximate, 2% from a care home and 2% from a non-acute intermediate care or private bed.  The primary diagnosis breaks down at 88% cancer and 12% non-cancer .  In the age breakdown, less than 1% are aged up to 17 years; 30% are aged 18 to 64 years; and 69% are 65 years or over.  Access is reasonably timely.</p> <p>  Deputy Catherine Byrne asked a related question about palliative care in the home.  That is comprehensive care and I can provide the Deputy with the detailed answer but it would include infusions, pumps and dressings.</p></speech>

We will provide her with the detailed answer.  I will ask my colleague, Mr. John Hennessy, to come back to Deputy McLellan on her question on discretionary medical cards and on Daxas and Fampridine</p> <p>  I am sorry if we have not correctly identified the information that Deputy McLellan wanted.  Sometimes we do not always fully get it.  I will ask Mr. Ray Mitchell, who is here, to engage with the Deputy to ensure we have a proper understanding of what she requires and that she gets it.</p> <p>  We have discussed the issue of Hollybrook before.  It is currently in use for a specific purpose.  I understand, although I do not have the data, that many of the patients who are in it for its current purpose would be from the geographical area but it is not being used for its intended purpose.  This is a transitional use linked to development of the national children's hospital.</p> <p>  In respect of the matter raised by Senator Crown, of which he was kind enough to give me advance notice, we will look into it.</p><p>It is clearly not intended for it to work in that way.</p><p> On the broader issue of obstetric services and emerging issues, we are in the process of putting in place a specific office in the National Hospitals Office to deal with this.  It will be somewhat along the lines of the national organ donation and transplantation office and the national cancer control programme to bring a specific focus to how we manage the improvement in obstetric services.  More will follow on that in the coming weeks.</p><p> I do not have access to the statement I made in writing on Soliris but it was made carefully.  I will listen back to the comments I made this morning but I do not believe any reasonable person could construe it as a criticism of the patients in question.  I have to be in a position to express a view about any drug company that seeks to charge more than what I consider reasonable for a particular drug.  The reason we were commenting on it was because in this instance we were required to make a decision on it.  In the other instances to which the Senator referred to, we were not required to make a decision.</p></speech>

We could spend the day discussing how the discretionary medical card system works.  Due to confidentiality reasons, I will not be able to speak about specific cases.  These applications are treated extremely carefully as it is a statutory scheme.  The decision-makers and medical assessors involved in the assessment take account of the impact of medical conditions.  That is done by medical staff and includes ensuring children have access to the health services they need without undue hardship.  The figures the Minister referred to earlier speak to that too, namely, that the number of discretionary medical cards has increased by 25,000 over the past six months.</p> <p>  Discretion is stretched to the limits available under the scheme.  As the Deputy knows, a series of reforms are under way with the General Medical Services scheme.  The first meeting of the clinical advisory group was held this week which will continue refining the discretionary medical card system further.</p> <p>  It must be borne in mind that the expert panel, when it considered this issue last year, could not distinguish between one medical condition and another where access to medical cards is concerned.  In the end, it reverted to means as the only appropriate way to deal with it.  As the Minister outlined, it must be remembered that people have access to health services regardless of whether they have medical cards.  That includes hospital care, definitely cancer care, as well as the long-term illness scheme, the drugs payment scheme, grant support for the supply of equipment based on clinical need and therapy supports.  Community intervention teams, which have been very active over recent weeks, are available to the entire population regardless of medical card status.</p> <p>  Medical officers have regard to the reality of medical conditions when doing their assessments and the impact of those conditions.  The issue of hardship will always be a difficult one.</p></speech>

When local people telephone me asking why people living in the area cannot access the unit, I have to tell them it is a step-down unit for St. James&rsquo;s Hospital to facilitate the national children&rsquo;s hospital.  When this unit was first opened, I stood on a platform as a local public representative telling people the facility would be used for people living locally.  I welcome the fact the children&rsquo;s hospital will be located at the St. James&rsquo;s Hospital site.  However, the Hollybrook facility was to provide new beds for the local area.  This did not happen.  It has left me in a very vulnerable position as a public representative locally.  I attended all of the meetings for the planning application for the Hollybrook facility.</p> <p>  I have been promised numerous times at this committee that Hollybrook will return to being a nursing home care unit for respite but it has not.  I want an answer on this because I cannot tell people lies.  I am obliged as a public representative to tell them the truth when they come into my office and ask me why they cannot get an elderly person living in Inchicore into Hollybrook for respite care, even for a week, when it is on their doorstep.  It is not acceptable they are told to go somewhere else.  I will keep on bringing up this issue until Hollybrook returns to its original designation as a nursing home, not a unit to facilitate St. James&rsquo;s Hospital.</p></speech>

Is it realistic considering what was stated this morning?  As Mr. O&rsquo;Brien stated this morning, if we are to continue with the existing profiling, the fair deal scheme will be under serious pressure by the end of the year, hospital waiting times could be up to 20 weeks with 2,000 people or more waiting for the cancellation of elective surgeries.</p><p>Will there be a requirement for a further injection of money into the health service to alleviate the pressures forecast by the HSE?  It is clear that a review of the fair deal scheme is necessary because it is unsustainable at present.  If it is demand-led, it needs to be underpinned by funding on a continuous basis.  I recall when the scheme was first published that the fear of God was put in people that their homes might be taken.  I assure the committee I was not spreading those rumours.  It is important that the terms of the review be published in order to allow a debate on how we fund the scheme.  This is about the future as well as the here and now.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-12a.726" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015021200002#U00300"><p>I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to respond to the question on the fair deal scheme, and the HSE will deal with the question about recruitment in Beaumont.</p> <p>  I listened to Mr. Breslin's answer to the question about universal health insurance on my trusty iPhone.  That is the position.  We are pressing ahead with the first concrete step, which is to provide free GP care for those aged under six years and over 70 years, and we continue to widen discretion for medical cards.  I do not like the term "private health insurance" because it is just health insurance.  We do not have public health insurance in Ireland.  I want to make health insurance more affordable, and this initiative is already showing good results, with an increase in the number of people with health insurance in the last two quarters.  I expect to see a significant increase this quarter and next year with the introduction of lifetime community rating.  When we receive the findings of the work from the ESRI and the Health Insurance Authority in the next couple of months, I will bring a roadmap to the Cabinet on further implementation of UHI.  It will then be a matter for the Government to decide whether to proceed on the basis of that roadmap, but I think it is the way to go.  However, the issue is much more complicated than anyone appreciated at the outset, not least because we do not even have a basic patient identifier for every patient in the country or a single financial system across the hospitals.  A considerable number of building blocks need to be put in place before we proceed further.  If we have learned anything from Irish Water, it is that we should not set up new entities in a hurry.</p> <p>  There are various ways of measuring the health budget, including outturns, Estimates and income from different sources, such as insurers, car parks and payments received from patients.  This is the first time in seven years that we have increased the budget, which is a considerable achievement.  The increase is approximately &euro;150 million, or 1.5%, which allows us to end the cycle of cuts and make targeted improvements in a number of areas, including mental health, primary care, hepatitis C drugs and the extension of BreastCheck.  Money is still tight, however, and the 1.5% increase in our budget is reflected in the 1.5% increase in the budget for the fair deal scheme.  If there is a backlog or an increase in demand, the money is not available to deal with that.  The Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, the witnesses from the HSE and I are in a similar position to everyone else working in the health service, whether they are managers or working on the front line.  We are trying to deal with a wide range of problems and a huge level of demand on the basis of constrained resources.  We are spending &euro;1.5 billion less than we did seven years ago and we have 15,000 fewer staff.  Not many other countries are in that boat.  I assure the committee that we are doing our best within these limitations, and we will continue to do so.</p> <p>  On the issue of discretionary medical cards, members will appreciate that I cannot comment on individual cases.  I do not have access to patients' information or financial details and I do not make decisions based on individual cases.  I have some responsibility for the rules, however, and we have made a number of reforms.  Terminal illness cases have medical cards for as long as they are needed.  Random reviews of discretionary medical cards are no longer carried out.  Discretionary card appeals go to medical officers for adjudication.  This is important because it means it is not just a financial decision made by a computer or an official.  Local health officers can make a visit if an issue arises, and can offer other supports including aids and appliances or a doctor visit card.  Supports are now available which were not available in the past.  For example, the cost of wigs for children undergoing cancer treatment is reimbursed regardless of income.  A number of changes have been made in that regard.  The number of discretionary medical cards is now 75,000.  Approximately half of these are restored medical cards and the other half are new cases.  Including doctor visit cards, the number of medical cards is 108,000.  I expect the number will continue to increase, because it is my view that we need to widen discretion further.  This will be done with the assistance of the clinical advisory group that was recently appointed.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and I will be meeting the group in the next couple of weeks to see how we can widen discretion to take in more of the hard cases we hear about from time to time.  However, as I said last November when we announced the ten-point plan to reform the medical card system, as long as there is a threshold, whether that is a means test or a sickness test, there will always be people who are just above the threshold.  All of us know cases of elderly people who are &euro;5 or &euro;10 above the threshold.  If we raised the threshold by &euro;10, there would still be people who were just above it; they would just be different people.  The same issue would arise for any kind of sickness test or medical needs test.  The only solution to this is universality, which would mean individuals and families were not required to submit reams of information about their finances and health.  This is why it makes sense to provide medical cards to those aged under or over 70.  It is the first step towards no longer making a distinction between people based on means or sickness tests.  I hope I can make the argument more strongly in the next several months that the solution to unfairness and anomalies in the system is to get rid of means tests and sickness tests and replace them with a universal system, beginning with the youngest and oldest in society.</p></speech>

The two most successful programmes for delivery of health in this country were in primary care and mental heath, because everyone bought into what was planned for the future.  That is the way we should proceed.  When the review is published I hope everyone with an interest in the issue will get together to discuss it.  The review might tell us that people in the community should be able access the fair deal scheme or to get home help and enhanced home care packages to allow them to stay in their own communities.  The scheme is based on the individuals concerned contributing 80% of their income, but that clearly would not work in a community setting because the individuals would still have to buy their own food and pay their bills.  These details need to be hammered out, but we have to consider the issue carefully.  The scheme is fair in that it allows people to access care on an equal basis.  However, times and needs have changed.  We need to consider the issues arising in a broad context, as well as ensuring those who cannot pay are protected.</p><p>I hope when the review is published that we will be able to get together, sit down and take a serious look at how to deliver this care into the future.</p></speech>

It is not correct to say that there is a risk associated with our being a net exporter; nor is there any threat to the programme.  That is important to say for people who are waiting for transplants as well as for the committee today.  Two issues were raised.  The first was the issue of transplant surgeons, and we have some vacancies in that regard.  One vacancy has arisen through retirement, and we might take on board some of the comments that were made here today on retirement age.  One vacancy arose on foot of a personal decision by a person to go back overseas.</p></speech>

Last year, there was an increase on the previous year in terms of the number of donors under the living donor programme.  What we are looking at is both short-term and medium-term solutions.  Positively, there has been very good collaboration between Beaumont and St. Vincent's at two levels, one of which is retrieval.  One of the reasons transplant is not an attractive discipline is that people are up at night.  A surgeon gets called in to retrieve organs and then has to transplant them.  We are looking at what happens in other countries where there is a shared rota around retrieval.  It will help immediately.  The other issue is the pancreatic programme which Professor Hickey was involved in.  We are looking at ways for St. Vincent's and Beaumont to collaborate.  The important message is that the programme is stable right now.  Some immediate actions are being taken to deliver on the transplant complement.  The other thing we are looking at is that transplant surgeons also do urology work.  We are looking at developing urologist posts, which has happened.  The post holders have been appointed and will take up their duties.  That will ease the burden of the workload.</p> <p>  The other question raised was on donation.  It is fair to say that last year donation levels dropped.  It is not always understood why that happens.  What we have looked at is what works well in other countries.  The Spanish model is one under which consultants are appointed who promote the concept of donation actively within their hospitals.  I think that is what was referred to in Cork.  Six posts have been approved, one for each hospital group.  The role of the post holders will be to advocate actively with families to donate organs.  The posts have been approved and the recruitment process is under way.  We are also changing the model of co-ordination for procurement, which will also enhance donation rates.  The last thing is that we have put nursing staff in who will promote organ donation on the ground.  A number of immediate actions are happening in respect of both the short term and the medium term.</p></speech>

We might consider meeting in private session to discuss how we can advance all of those reports.  We seem to have got little or no feedback on some of them.  In the case of end-of-life care, it has been disappointing to the members.  We might liaise with Mr. Jim Breslin and the HSE on that issue.  I think we are finished.</p></speech>

He challenged the notion that people suffering chronic pain were being written to on the closure of outpatient appointment waiting lists.  In fact, the Minister himself challenged <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>on the affirmation that sick people were being written to across the State positively confirming that there were no referrals being accepted across many of the pain clinics and other specialties in our hospitals.  I have collated hundreds of letters from sick people who have received correspondence to say that as a consequence of resources, no new referrals onto waiting lists for outpatient appointments are being accepted.  One of those letters concerns a referral to a pain clinic in Dublin.  The letter states that as a consequence of the lack of resources, the clinic will not accept any new referrals onto outpatient appointment waiting lists.  I have a catalogue of correspondence to people, families and GPs expressing concern with respect to the stockpiling of sick people who cannot get onto a waiting list.  I would like Mr. O'Brien to comment on the status of people who are not on a waiting list for urgent attention for pain relief or in respect of other disciplines.

The principal reason I am here is to give the joint committee an opportunity to ask me questions.  I introduce Mr. Finbarr Griffin who is required to be with me under takeover panel rules.  He is my chaperone, but I also acknowledge the fact that the takeover panel has extended some latitude to us to appear before the committee.  I hope to be in a position to answer most, if not all, of the committee&rsquo;s questions.  There are some areas where I will be restricted in what I can say.</p> <p>  By way of introduction, I will say a little about International Airlines Group, IAG.  It was created in 2011 as a result of the merger of British Airways and Iberia.  It is one of the largest airline groups in the world.  In terms of market capitalisation, it is the number one airline in Europe.  Our market cap exceeds the combined market caps of Air France, KLM, Air Berlin, Aer Lingus, Lufthansa, SAS, Turkish Airlines and Finnair.  If one adds their market caps together, they come to the same as ours.  We are a significant player in the airline industry; we are approximately number four or five in the world.</p> <p>  Ours is a multinational, multi-brand airline group.  Our goal is to facilitate consolidation where we can identify strong airlines with strong brands and allow them to operate under the umbrella structure of IAG, benefiting from the scale we can provide.  While we have three principal airline brands, we actually have six airlines: two in the United Kingdom - British Airways and British Airways City Flyer; Iberia, Iberia Express, Vueling based in Spain and OpenSkies based in Paris.  We also have a cargo business, one of the top ten in the world, with an annual turnover of approximately &euro;1 billion.  We serve 250 global destinations.  We have a frequent flyer loyalty programme, which is the number one airline loyalty programme in Europe and one of the biggest in the world, with 6.3 million active customers.  IAG airlines flew 77.3 million passengers in 2014, serving 250 destinations.  We have over 460 aircraft and a turnover of approximately &euro;20 billion.</p> <p>  We are interested in acquiring Aer Lingus because we believe it will fit very well with IAG.  It has a very strong brand, particularly in Ireland; on the east coast of the United States of America where it punches way above its weight, and in the United Kingodm.  We admire what the Aer Lingus management team has done in recent years, particularly in the restructuring of the airline and the exploitation of Dublin as an international hub serving transatlantic routes.  Aer Lingus is an efficient airline operating in a competitive market.  It is well run and we believe it represents a growth opportunity for IAG.  We are interested in acquiring it because we believe we can facilitate, accelerate and expand its growth plans.</p> <p>  I am sure it has been noted before that I am a former employee of Aer Lingus, of which I am a deferred pensioner and shareholder, holding 10,616 shares.  It is also known that I am Chairman of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, and, as such, declared a material interest to the NTMA board.  That has been disclosed.  I have, however, no access to any information in the NTMA, any discussion or participation in any debate within the NTMA on Aer Lingus.</p> <p>  I recognise that there have been many questions and a great deal of concern expressed by members of the committee and others about our proposed acquisition of Aer Lingus.  Our intentions are completely positive.  We believe we can bring to Aer Lingus strength and support that it cannot have as a stand-alone airline.  We believe we can facilitate the expansion of the network, benefiting Aer Lingus, the airports it serves in Ireland and the Irish economy.  We are committed to maintaining the Aer Lingus brand and have given guarantees to do so.  We are committed to maintaining the Aer Lingus head office in Dublin.  We are committed to maintaining ownership of the Aer Lingus Heathrow Airport slots within Aer Lingus.  We are prepared to give a cast iron, solid, legally binding guarantee to ensure the ownership of these slots rests with Aer Lingus and to extend to the Irish Government not just the ability to express, with the support of other shareholders, a block in terms of the disposal of these shares but also to strengthen that position and in a fully legally binding way.  We have also given an assurance, a guarantee that we will continue to utilise the Aer Lingus slots to serve the Ireland-Heathrow market.  That is a guarantee that does not apply today and it goes beyond what is in place today.  We believe we are uniquely positioned to give these guarantees.  I do not believe there is any other party that might be interested in acquiring Aer Lingus, if there are other parties, that would be prepared to give the guarantees we are prepared to give.  We are prepared to give these guarantees in a way that will not be challenged.  In other words, they will be legally binding.  I have heard people say they are not worth the paper on which they are written.  I can assure the committee that we have smart lawyers who have been able to identify a structure that will secure them in a legally binding way.</p> <p>  We believe Aer Lingus has good opportunities ahead and that we can support these opportunities.  We want to bring it into IAG in the same way as our other airline brands, where it will have an independent brand that can be invested in and control over its own operations run by an Aer Lingus management team but fully participate in the advantages it will have in being part of a larger group.  We believe this is an exciting opportunity for Aer Lingus.  It represents excellent value for current Aer Lingus shareholders and all of the stakeholders involved in Aer Lingus.</p></speech>

As Mr. Walsh has said, questions and concerns were raised at those meetings.  We met representatives of various trades unions, IBEC, chambers of commerce, tourism interests, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and so forth.  They raised questions relating to jobs, connectivity, the possible impact on the regional State airports at Shannon and Cork and on tourism, as well as the future of the Heathrow slots.  I am setting the context for the questions from members which will come later.  There was talk about the need for guarantees.  Some groups saw some positive aspects to the proposed sale if guarantees could be given.  While Mr. Walsh made reference to that in his presentation, to what degree can any guarantee be guaranteed?  </p><p> Up until today there was an absence of information on the proposed bid which is why Mr. Walsh is very welcome.  I hope he can answer the questions posed today.  I have a number of questions myself and then I will hand over to committee members.  My first question relates to Aer Lingus Regional, which is a subsidiary of Aer Lingus employing 400 people in Ireland.  If this sale were to go ahead, what would be the impact on Aer Lingus Regional down the line?  I ask Mr. Walsh to address the knock-on effects that this would have for regional airports in Ireland.  We have talked about Dublin, Shannon and Cork, but what about the regional airports like Knock and others?  I am from the west of Ireland and chaired a study group on the potential of the airport there.  Aer Lingus flies 70,000 passengers into Knock Airport every year.  The airport has 700,000 passengers at the moment but wants to grow that figure to 1.3 million.  Would the IAG bid for Aer Lingus help or hinder that?  Finally, I heard Mr. Walsh in a radio interview this morning saying that what some politicians have said in recent weeks could be potentially damaging for Aer Lingus and I ask him to expand on that point. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-12a.752" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Willie Walsh" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015021200002#B00200"><p>The first point to make is that Aer Lingus Regional is not a subsidiary of Aer Lingus but a franchise carrier operating on behalf of Aer Lingus.  There is no Aer Lingus ownership in Aer Lingus Regional.  My understanding is that it is owned by Stobart Air and operates under a ten-year franchise agreement that was signed in 2012.  We believe that it is fundamental to the success of Aer Lingus and the airline's strategy to feed traffic into Ireland principally from the UK provincial airports.  We also believe that the franchise arrangement should continue and we would be committed to maintaining that relationship, subject of course to the owners of Aer Lingus Regional-Stobart Air, being prepared to continue to do so.</p> <p>  It was suggested by some people who appeared before the committee that there is no evidence or history of such arrangements with IAG but that is not correct.  Iberia, one of our companies, has a long-standing relationship with Air Nostrum in Spain, which operates on a similar basis.  It is not owned by Iberia but operates as an Iberia franchise carrier.  That arrangement has been in place since 1997.  British Airways has a franchise operator in South Africa called Comair.  British Airways is a small shareholder in that business and has had a long-standing relationship with it and anybody who has visited South Africa may have seen a lot of BA branded aircraft there.  That is a franchise operation.  British Airways also has a long-standing franchise relationship with Sun Air in Scandinavia.  We have a history of operating with franchise operators and our understanding of the Aer Lingus-Stobart Air relationship is that it is a positive one for both parties.  Therefore, we believe that the franchise arrangement should continue.  </p> <p>  On the question of Knock Airport, Aer Lingus operates a service from Knock to Gatwick Airport and our understanding is that it is a profitable operation.  We think that through the relationship with British Airways at Gatwick we can enhance that service.  British Airways has a network to Europe from Gatwick Airport that is actually more extensive than our network from Heathrow.  We serve more European destinations from Gatwick than from Heathrow and believe there is an opportunity to feed traffic to and from that Aer Lingus service.  Therefore, we believe that our bid, if successful, would enhance the value of that.</p> <p>  My remarks on damaging Aer Lingus related to some comments that were made about what the Irish Government can do to influence decision-making in Aer Lingus, which would have come as a surprise to investors in the debt and capital markets.  It was clear to people external to Aer Lingus that the Irish Government is a 25% shareholder and can have board representation but other than its ability to block a sale, with the assistance of other shareholders holding a minimum of 5%, it cannot exercise any other influence over the active management, development and strategic direction of Aer Lingus.  Statements were made that suggested that the Government could and would interfere.  I do not believe the statements necessarily meant that but the interpretation relayed to me by some people was that such suggestions were not helpful.</p></speech>

We will have party spokespeople first who will be given three minutes to ask questions.  We will get a response to those questions and then they will be given one minute to respond.  We will call all committee members first and then Deputies and Senators who are not committee members.  To get the maximum benefit from this meeting, I ask members to confine themselves to asking questions rather than making speeches.  I will be as fair as I can and try to give everyone an opportunity to speak.  That said, I want to use the time we have wisely.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-12a.754" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015021200002#B00400"><p>I welcome Mr. Walsh and Mr. Griffin.  It has been a while since Mr. Walsh was here with us and clearly his career has gained altitude since then and we wish him well with that.  The concerns that I and others have expressed in recent weeks have been in response to industry sources, that is, people who are responsible for employing large numbers of people in Dublin, the mid-west and in the Cork region who are supported through foreign investment and who see connectivity and access to Heathrow - which provides access to a global network of cities - as being vitally important for retaining jobs.  We also heard from representatives of the tourism sector and concerns were also expressed to us by Aer Lingus staff who are concerned about their employment prospects.</p> <p>  Mr. Walsh spoke about the positive aspects of this deal for Aer Lingus.  What is in the deal for IAG?  What are that company's expansion plans at Dublin, Cork and Shannon?  Is IAG committed to retaining the British Airways and Aer Lingus slots at Heathrow which are currently providing access to Dublin?  Is IAG further committed to retaining the slot access from Shannon and Cork?  Mr. Walsh said in his presentation that the issue is Ireland's slots into Heathrow, rather than slots designated to the three airports.  I ask him to clarify that point.  </p> <p>  Mr. Walsh also spoke on the "Today with Se&aacute;n O'Rourke" radio programme this morning about some job losses and I ask him to quantify those and clarify where they might occur.  On the same programme, he also spoke about giving cast-iron guarantees and I assume that was in response to the Taoiseach's remarks approximately two weeks ago where he said that the Government would need cast-iron guarantees around connectivity and other issues.  Mr. Walsh went further today when he said that not alone would they be cast-iron, but they would be set in concrete as well.  That is critical for all of us; it is certainly critical for me.  However, when Mr. Walsh says that he has smart lawyers preparing this, that concerns me greatly.  These are IAG lawyers and I would much prefer to hear the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Donohoe or the Taoiseach saying that they have smart lawyers who could stand over the kinds of guarantees and assurances that would need to be put in place.  Mr. Walsh does not give me any sense of security because it is his lawyers who are providing the information.  I would welcome any further information from Mr. Walsh which would help us to understand more definitively and clearly how those guarantees might be put in place and how they might be litigated at a later stage in the event that IAG changes ownership.  Qatar Airways, for example, currently owns 10% of IAG but what happens if it decides to take over the entire company?  </p> <p>  Mr. Walsh also said this morning that there would be changes to the articles of association or the memorandum of understanding of the company.</p><p>If they can be changed in this instance, I assumed they could be changed at a later stage by chairmanship.  Finally, could Mr. Walsh talk to us a little about how he could achieve all he wants to without owning the State's 25% shareholding?  Could a strategic alliance be developed that would allow IAG to share the potential benefits Mr. Walsh sees in acquiring a stake in Aer Lingus and that would allow Aer Lingus to benefit from its association with IAG without a share transfer from the State?  Is there an arrangement that would give the State continued representation on the board, thereby retaining some level of control in respect of the operation of the company?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-12a.756" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Willie Walsh" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015021200002#C00200"><p>First, let me address the concern expressed on Qatar Airways.  The airline has taken a 10% stake in IAG.  As with many companies in the airline industry, there is a limitation on the allowable amount of non-EU ownership.  Qatar Airways holds 10% but we currently have non-EU ownership extending to approximately 36% of our stock.  Under our articles, the board has the ability to limit the amount of non-EU ownership so long as that limit is not less than 40%.  Therefore, there is no prospect whatsoever of Qatar Airways being able to gain control of IAG.  It is not legally possible.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked many questions and I will try to recall them all.  With regard to Shannon and Cork airports, the Deputy and I have exchanged views on the former.  The last time I was here was October 2004, more than ten years ago.  Some of the issues we are debating today were debated then.  I believe the Deputy is the only current committee member who was a member then.  On Shannon and Cork, I can understand the concern that has been expressed, particularly the concern expressed in Shannon because of what happened with the Shannon&ndash;Heathrow service in 2007.  It might be helpful for members to understand what was behind the Aer Lingus decision back then.  A couple of points arise in this regard.  I have some information on Aer Lingus that has been provided to us under non-disclosure arrangements.  I have not been directly involved in the due diligence process but my team has been.  Separate to that, let me talk about what I have said publicly about Shannon and Cork historically.  I would genuinely be very shocked if I discovered the operation of the Shannon&ndash;Heathrow and Cork&ndash;Heathrow services was not profitable for Aer Lingus.  I know Dublin is profitable because we operate on the route.  I know from my history with Aer Lingus what the situation was in the airline, but that was a long time ago and many things have changed in the interim.  The services are profitable on a stand-alone basis.</p> <p>  One of the advantages of the current relationship Aer Lingus has with British Airways &mdash; it has other relationships &mdash; is that we feed traffic to one another on the services.  We feed traffic from Heathrow on to Aer Lingus flying to both Cork and Shannon, and Aer Lingus feeds traffic from Shannon and Cork on to British Airways services, principally long-haul services.  We are the number one partner that Aer Lingus has in respect of its transfer traffic.  Not only are those routes profitable in isolation, but the value of the transfer traffic we provide to one another is extremely valuable also.  Therefore, the commercial reality is that there is no reason for anybody to be concerned about the operation of the routes because they are profitable in isolation and have significant additional value because of transfer traffic.</p> <p>  In 2007, Aer Lingus terminated the Shannon&ndash;Heathrow service.  I watched that with great interest because the principal reason for it was that Shannon Airport made a deal with a competitor of Aer Lingus to facilitate its entry into the Shannon&ndash;London market.  The competitor was receiving free services or low charges in Shannon and Aer Lingus was paying the rack rate for services.  Aer Lingus was being significantly disadvantaged as a result of a competitor being given much cheaper access to Shannon.  Commercially, it is madness.  I cannot understand why Shannon Airport did what it did at the time.  I expressed that view to the people running Shannon Airport when it happened.  I was pleased to see the issue was resolved and that Aer Lingus subsequently went back into Shannon.</p> <p>  When I look at the traffic flows between Cork and Heathrow, and Shannon and Heathrow, I note the flows from both Cork and Shannon airports are what I have described as very good.  This is especially the case with Cork, where the volume of traffic has remained steady.  It has actually grown in recent years but, significantly, remained steady through the recession.  This was unique given what happened everywhere else during that period.  The traffic out of Shannon to Heathrow has declined in recent years.  I am not clear whether there is something in the scheduling behind it.  It is a matter we can certainly examine in much closer detail.  The routes are sustainable in isolation and I assume they continue to be very profitable for Aer Lingus.  We would want to retain them but also we would want to examine opportunities to feed additional traffic on to them, thereby continuing to enhance not only the profitability and viability but also the attractiveness of the destinations.</p> <p>  It has been stated by people who have appeared before the committee that the only reason British Airways is flying between London and Dublin is because some unknown UK regulator &mdash; I do not know who it is &mdash; has forced it to do so.  That is complete nonsense.  There is absolutely no requirement from any regulator for British Airways to serve the Heathrow&ndash;Dublin route.  British Airways serves the Heathrow&ndash;Dublin route because it wants to.  Not only has British Airways continued to serve Dublin by building on the service that BMI used to provide, we have actually started additional services into Dublin with a service from London City Airport.  We are one of the biggest operators.  Obviously, there are two very big operators in the form of Aer Lingus and Ryanair at Dublin.  Number three is Aer Lingus Regional, and we are number four in terms of the number of services we provide to Dublin.  We provide the services because we want to.  There is absolutely no obligation and no regulator requires it.  Whoever suggested there is such a requirement is talking complete nonsense and does not understand the rules.</p> <p>  We would continue to serve the market in question because we want to.  Ireland is an attractive market for us.  It is particularly attractive because we believe it represents growth opportunities.  The development of the transatlantic services, principally over the Dublin hub, represents a real growth opportunity.  We can support that better than anybody else because we can bring the strength of IAG, at one end of the route, and the strength of our joint business partner, American Airlines, at the other.  Instead of having Aer Lingus operate with a small sales team in the United States, we would harness the full strength of the British Airways and American teams selling that service in the US and of the IAG sales team selling it in Europe.  That is something Aer Lingus cannot access in isolation.  As a stand-alone airline, regardless of the number of partnerships it seeks to develop, it cannot get that amount of support.  We are the only people who can provide it.  We want to provide it to Aer Lingus because we see this as a fantastic opportunity to grow the traffic out of Ireland on the transatlantic routes, which would have direct benefits in terms of jobs in Ireland and significant indirect benefits through tourism and indirect job creation in the Irish market.</p> <p>  I said we have smart lawyers working on this.  I am sure the Taoiseach and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport will have smart lawyers working with our smart lawyers.  We believe there is a legal framework in existence that can provide the Government with a guarantee.  It is not a case of my giving the committee some nice words about a guarantee over Heathrow slots but of my telling the committee we have tested this.  We are very confident a structure can be put in place to give a cast-iron, wrapped in concrete guarantee that the control of those Heathrow slots will remain with Aer Lingus management in Dublin and that the Government can intervene.  Without explicit support, Aer Lingus would not be able to sell any of the slots.</p> <p>  The issue of jobs has been mentioned.  I fully understand the concern over jobs.  I have heard people saying 1,200 jobs would be lost.  That is utter nonsense.  The example that was given to support the statement was what happened with Iberia.  One must realise that where Iberia was during the period of reconstruction and where Aer Lingus is are two completely different places.  Aer Lingus has gone through the restructuring.  Aer Lingus is an efficient airline and could be more efficient but Iberia was an inefficient airline that got trapped in a really deep recession that hit Spain in the way it hit many countries, including Ireland.</p><p>Iberia required serious and immediate restructuring.  Aer Lingus is not in that position.  Will there be rationalisation as a result of Aer Lingus being part of IAG?  Yes, there will be because we have centralised certain activities with procurement probably being the best example.  We do procurement for everybody in the group through a central source.  That generates huge value.  We can negotiate with every supplier in a way that is much stronger than any airline can do individually.  Aer Lingus can tap into the value of that, which is immense.  I am not talking about millions.  I am talking about tens of millions and potentially significantly more than that.  </p><p> The real story behind what we want to do is growth.  It is all about growth.  It is about growing the Aer Lingus network and with that growth comes growth in jobs, which are quality jobs that would be based in Ireland.  The rule of thumb is that the addition of long-haul aircraft would typically mean an additional 100 direct employees - plus or minus ten.  Every long-haul aircraft that gets added will add jobs.  Every long-haul aircraft that gets added at a hub requires short-haul aircraft to feed traffic into that hub for it to be efficient.  The committee can see that with the direct addition of long-haul aircraft, we will get the indirect benefit of a growing short-haul network feeding more traffic which is the ambition of the Irish Government under its draft aviation policy, the DAA under its stated policy and Aer Lingus.  We can support that in a way nobody else can.  </p></speech>

He has still not really told me what is in it for IAG.  Aer Lingus has been performing very well in the north of England hubbing transatlantic passengers through Dublin.  Has that been a concern to British Airways?  Has Aer Lingus been raiding the north of England at the expense of British Airways and is IAG's response to go and take it over?  Mr. Walsh has not said whether a strategic alliance with the State retaining its 25% interest might be a better way of getting around the legal complexity.  This would offer ownership and board representation and would retain a level of control notwithstanding company law and the articles of association.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-12a.759" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Willie Walsh" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015021200002#D00300"><p>Aer Lingus is not taking traffic away from IAG in the north of England because it is principally serving airports that IAG does not serve.  We see this as complementing the IAG model and that is what is in it for us.  We see Aer Lingus as a growth model and being able to grow faster and in a more extensive fashion simply because it would have the support of IAG, particularly on the transatlantic routes.  It is not taking business away from us.  Some people might have the opportunity to fly from Scotland over Heathrow to North America or from Scotland to North America via Dublin but if one looks at the performance of our transatlantic routes, one can see that our seat factors exceed those of Aer Lingus.  It is well known to be a very successful part of the IAG network, particularly so given that we have a joint business.</p> <p>  Our approach is subject to an irrevocable undertaking from the Irish Government and Ryanair to major shareholders to sell their shares.  That is what we are seeking.  The commitments we give are based on IAG acquiring ownership of Aer Lingus.  We are not prepared to give those commitments in the absence of that.  </p> <p>  In respect of our growth plans, we have had access to the Aer Lingus business plan.  We think it is credible.  It has an element of risk.  We think that this stated Aer Lingus growth plan, which would involve the additional of four long-haul aircraft between now and 2019, can be better achieved through the support IAG can provide.  We believe there is an opportunity to enhance and accelerate that growth plan.  Anything that grows long-haul aircraft will have an immediate positive effect on direct jobs and the amount of traffic feeding into that.  </p> <p>  I love Cork.  It should be remembered that by the time I left Cork, we had started more direct services from Cork to continental Europe that Aer Lingus operated from Dublin in 2001 when I took over at Aer Lingus.  I know the opportunity that exists there.  I have been surprised to see a decline in traffic at Cork Airport and I strongly believe that this can be reversed.  </p> <p>  Shannon is perfectly located for growth on the transatlantic routes.  It has the advantage of customs and border pre-clearance, which is also enjoyed by Dublin.  It is a particularly attractive market from the US into the west of Ireland.  We see that as a growth opportunity.  There is the potential to feed traffic into Shannon to connect on to those transatlantic services as well.  </p></speech>

I represent the constituency of Dublin North East where many Aer Lingus employees and retirees and their families live.  Many of them have expressed concern to me about their future in the context of a bid by IAG to take over Aer Lingus.  I have a number of questions arising from that.</p> <p>  Do Mr. Walsh and IAG accept that Aer Lingus staff have made many concessions and efficiencies that vindicate the use of direct labour at Aer Lingus in the past number of years and will they commit not to outsource further the functions there?  Would Mr. Walsh and IAG be prepared to enter into a legally binding collective agreement which would support the current flexible nature of existing agreements for staff at Aer Lingus which would give Aer Lingus workers certainty over their future?  Are Mr. Walsh and IAG aware of the residual discontent among former Aer Lingus employees who are now classed as deferred members of the IASS scheme?  I think Mr. Walsh said he is a deferred pensioner himself so he is probably in that category.  They have concerns following pension arrangements passed by the EGM of Aer Lingus before Christmas.  Would IAG have strategies for addressing those concerns?  </p> <p>  When Mr. Walsh was CEO of Aer Lingus between 2001 and 2004, he discontinued all cargo services except those services to Frankfurt and the US.  I am informed that those cargo services were not unprofitable at the time.  These services were put back and built up again by Mr. Walsh's successors.  Would Mr. Walsh do the same again?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-12a.769" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Willie Walsh" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015021200002#D01300"><p>I have heard the statements by representatives of the employees in Aer Lingus about the efficiencies they have generated.  My view has always been very clear.  If what they say is true, there is no reason to be concerned.  I recognise that changes have taken place in Aer Lingus and am fully aware of some, but not all, of those.  We do not look to outsource business as a strategy.  We only look to outsource business as a solution when no other solution exists.  My preferred solution has always been to operate as many of the services as we can within the business because that is the area where one can exercise most control.  If it can be done internally, that has always been my preferred choice.</p> <p>  If people look back at my time in Aer Lingus, they will see that while outsourcing was often talked about, it was never done.  We did not engage in outsourcing.  We restructured the business to make it more efficient and secure the jobs directly within Aer Lingus.  I understand that this has continued to happen.  I listened to Owen Reidy from SIPTU.  No disrespect to the other people but I thought he was probably the most sensible of the people who appeared before the committee.  He made very clear what had happened to make Aer Lingus more efficient.  That is what I am about - the efficient operation of a business.  If it can be done internally, I am all for that.</p> <p>  In respect of legally binding collective agreements, I spent a long time working in industrial relations in Aer Lingus and am very familiar with collective agreements.</p><p>I am very familiar with the fact that they are not structured as legally binding documents and, as I see it, they would have to be completely rewritten and restructured in order that they could be understood legally.  They were never drawn up with legal enforcement in mind.  It was a free collective bargaining process whereby these agreements were open to negotiation, interpretation and resolution between the parties.  I am not clear on the dispute resolution procedures that have been put in place in Aer Lingus.  I understand there was a move to put such procedures in place in an effort to resolve any difference.  I am in favour of systems under which any dispute around interpretation can be resolved amicably within the business.  Where this cannot be done directly, it should be done through mediation or arbitration.  That system has generally worked well for Aer Lingus.</p><p> In the context of the pensions issue, I am a deferred pensioner.  My pension has been reduced by 20% in line with those of many others in Aer Lingus.  IAG would honour the agreement in respect of the IASS reached by Aer Lingus with its shareholders at the EGM in December, but we would not be doing anything other than this.</p><p> The Deputy is correct.  During my period with Aer Lingus we stopped providing cargo services on short-haul flights.  The principal reason for this was that we were pushing to improve aircraft utilisation and accelerate the turnaround of aircraft in order to make better use of them.  It was deemed that the contribution cargo made on short-haul flights was insignificant relative to the benefit that could be achieved in being able to rotate aircraft more rapidly.  I am pleased that this policy has been reintroduced because Aer Lingus has not lost any efficiency as a result of it.  We are one of the biggest cargo operators in the world and we can bring a great deal of value to Aer Lingus and the Irish economy in terms of cargo services.  Both Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland have highlighted cargo services as a critical issue.  We are leaders in cargo transport and also global specialists in carrying high value cargo, particularly pharmaceuticals.  We believe we can assist Aer Lingus in developing its business in this area, especially in the light of the importance of the pharmaceutical industry to Ireland.</p></speech>

That legislation is expected to be passed before the summer recess.  Would Mr. Walsh be open to converting existing agreements at Aer Lingus into registered employment agreements, thereby guaranteeing the futures of the company's employees?</p></speech>

However, we will respect the terms and conditions of the employees in Aer Lingus.  Management of industrial relations issues would rest with the management team at Aer Lingus.  We do not have a group human resources, HR, function at IAG.  All HR-industrial relations issues are, therefore, managed within the operating companies.  We do not participate in that regard and that would continue to be the practice with Aer Lingus.  If the company were part of IAG, responsibility for managing the relationship with the trade unions and the workforce would continue to rest with the Aer Lingus management team and would not be moved to IAG.  That is the structure we have in place and we believe it is the most efficient model.  It also respects the cultures, histories and legacies of the individual companies in the context of how they operate.  We would use the same model in the context of Aer Lingus and it would be for the company's management team to continue to conduct industrial relations.</p></speech>

The committee invited the various stakeholders to come before it and members heard all of their views.  We were aware that the Government's shareholding of 25.1% in Aer Lingus was not going to be a game changer and that support was going to be required from elsewhere.  I do not believe the committee created an impression in that regard and I certainly did not get that impression.</p><p>A number of major issues arise in respect of this matter, of which connectivity is the first, particularly in the context of Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports.  This matter was touched on in the context of the guarantees was IAG prepared to give in respect of Cork and Shannon airports.  Mr. Walsh has indicated that IAG is prepared to provide a five-year guarantee regarding the 23 slots at Heathrow Airport.  In May 2014 he gave an interview to <i>The Independent</i>in which he complained about not having enough slots to service the developing Far East, African and South American markets and also the transatlantic market.</p></speech>

He was also reported by RTE as arguing that "it would be crazy to extend a guarantee that Aer Lingus's Heathrow rights would only be used to service Irish routes beyond the proposed five years, as this would affect its bargaining power with suppliers and airports."  In other words, IAG would guarantee the slots for five years, but the impression is not given that he could guarantee them beyond this.  I do not know how the lawyers will tidy up that matter.  </p> <p>  Mr. Walsh has stated he is a shareholder in Aer Lingus.  I do not know whether he would benefit if the company were to be sold off or whether his shares would be transferred to IAG and combined with any interest he may have in the group.  Does he have shares in IAG?  If he does have shares and if they were combined with his shares in Aer Lingus, I do not know what overall influence he would then be able to exercise.  I do not know what his position is, but I would like to obtain an indication of it.</p> <p>  Mr. Walsh has also indicated that he is a deferred pensioner.  This is an extremely contentious issue.  We are all aware of what has happened at Aer Lingus, but will Mr. Walsh indicate whether he has plans to address this issue even further?  I understand issues relating to pensions also arose in respect of IAG when the merger took place in 2011.  When Iberia and British Airways came together, there were plans to reduce the workforce by over 2,500 and the fleet.  On the one hand, Mr. Walsh is stating the group is going to expand if it takes over Aer Lingus but, on the other, it is clear that there will be job losses in a number of areas.  It is also possible that the size of the fleet will be reduced.</p></speech>

They have principally been on the expansion of capacity at the airports in the south east of England.  In the past, I supported the development of a new runway at Heathrow Airport.  I do not support this or argue against it anymore because a decision on the matter was made by the Conservatives-Liberal Democrats coalition Government when it came to power.  I do not get involved other than to say the decision of the British Government to stop the development of the third runway in 2010 was wrong.</p> <p>  To place the matter in context, I will speak about British Airways.  A perception seems to have been created that this is all about taking the 23 slots owned by Aer Lingus, transferring them to British Airways and then using them to expand its network.  Slots vary from the summer season to the winter season.  I carried out an analysis of British Airways's operations at Heathrow Airport yesterday.  The company operated 314 flights - 314 slots - of which 49 were domestic and 180 were to European destinations.  This means that 229 of our slots were devoted to short-haul activities.  That is ten times the number of slots we are talking about in the context of Aer Lingus.  Anybody who believes we need Aer Lingus's slots to expand our network need only consider the fact that we have 229 such slots being operated for short-haul services.  Many of these slots could be converted to provide long-haul services.  When we acquired BMI, we gave a commitment that 14 of the slots we took over would be used for long-haul service expansion and that the remainder would continue to be used to support our short-haul network.  The reason for this is that in order to operate a long-haul network with transfer traffic, it is necessary to have a short-haul network to feed it.</p> <p>  We have more than enough slots to expand British Airways's long-haul operations.</p><p>Our competitors cannot do that.  In terms of the UK plc, it is a restriction on the development of the British economy; it is not any restriction on BA.  We have loads of slots.  We can expand our long-haul network for the foreseeable future without any issue from the slot pool we have.  A total of 27% of our slots are used for long haul and 73% for short haul.  We have tonnes of them.  We have the slots available within BA to expand our long-haul network as and when we want.  What facilitates the expansion of the long-haul network is efficient new long-haul aircraft.  We have quite a number of those on order but we have plenty of slots for all the expansion plans we have.  None of the slots Aer Lingus operates is being looked at in any way for the expansion of the BA network and that is why the ownership of the slots will rest in Aer Lingus.  The company will continue to own those slots and will determine how it uses them.</p><p> Deputy Dooley said he would take it as a "No" but I did not say "No".

Nobody operating in a commercial would say, "I guarantee to give you all of my work regardless of the quality of service you give me and regardless of the cost of the access you provide me with".  That would be mad and anybody in business would say that giving all one's bargaining power over to a supplier would be a crazy thing to do.  Naturally, we want to have the ability to be in a position to ensure the people who provide us with services provide quality services in a cost efficient way.  That is perfectly sensible.  It is what everybody would want because nobody wants to believe that there is a locked-in service and the quality of that service can be completely unacceptable simply because we have given a commitment.</p> <p>  With regard to pensions, I have been very clear.  It would be unfair for me to suggest otherwise.  We will not do anything other than what has been done.  We will support and honour the commitment that was given by Aer Lingus and its shareholders at the EGM in December but we will not do anything in addition to that.</p> <p>  I hold 10,616 shares in Aer Lingus.  If this deal goes ahead, I will sell my shares.  They cannot be transferred.  It is not a material figure for me, though it is a material figure.  I hold approximately 730,000 shares in IAG out of just over 2 billion shares.  Clearly, I am the CEO of the group and that has, I hope, significant influence on how the company is run.</p></speech>

That would be important because it is an iconic brand through which the country is recognised throughout the world.  However, I still worry about engaging with the unions.  There has been mention of approximately 1,200 job losses.  I do not know how accurate that is but that is one of the figures that has been given to us.  The airline is profitable and is modern by standards with the fleet being reasonably up to date.  The State has only 25.1% of the shares and I do not see why the Government should sell this off.  If there is opposition from the State and that 25.1% is not on IAG's side, will that stop the company from proceeding?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-12a.785" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Willie Walsh" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015021200002#F00900"><p>I agree with the Deputy that the brand is incredibly strong.  That is why we are attracted to it.  We are unique in the industry in that we enable brands to continue to operate side by side unlike other airline groups where there is a dominant airline.  The Lufthansa group is dominated and owned by Lufthansa while Air France KLM is owned by Air France.  IAG is controlled by IAG; it is not controlled by BA, Iberia or Vueling.  The influence, therefore, rests with the individual operating company.  Aer Lingus fits perfectly into that structure because it is a strong brand, which we believe can be developed, particularly in the context of transatlantic.  It is a profitable company that has gone through restructuring but it can be more efficient.  It is not covering its cost of capital and it faces significant expense in respect of the fleet plans it has.  It is a good company and its profitability and margins are improving.  We will respect the work that has been done.  Our proposal is based on receiving an irrevocable commitment from both the Government and Ryanair to sell their shares to IAG for this to proceed.</p></speech>

I refer back to the cast iron embedded in concrete guarantee because there is still an unanswered question.  The committee's narrative will be that Shannon and Cork airports continue to face a question mark over connectivity.  For the benefit of trying to push this forward, could Mr. Walsh give a commitment that this connectivity will continue?  I am from the Shannon region in the mid-west.  Is he open to considering an extension of the timeframe for the slots?  Five years is the offer on the table.  Would he be open to considering an extension to, for instance, ten or 15 years in that offer?  If one looks at this from our point of view and from the shareholders point of view, a leap of faith is being sought in respect of the State's stake and there is uncertainty.  From a policy point of view in the context of delivery into the regions, there is a temptation in the media narrative, especially on the part of the national broadcaster, to focus on Dublin Airport and that was the main thrust of what I heard this morning.  From the rest of the country's point of view and from the Government's point of view, Mr. Walsh would do himself a great deal of service if certainty could be provided regarding Cork and Shannon airports and if consideration could be given to a longer timeframe than what is proposed because it is a considerable leap.</p> <p>  How is Ryanair responding to IAG's offer?  Is the company amenable to the proposal?</p> <p>  Reference was made by one of the participants at the stakeholders' meetings to the impact BA had in Scotland.  I will paraphrase what was said but in his role as CEO, Mr. Walsh may be able to enlighten the committee.  The suggestion was made at a previous committee meeting that Scotland has been forgotten about, it is an outlier and it gets bog standard service.  The concern was expressed to the committee that Aer Lingus would become an outlier of BA with a bog standard service.</p> <p>  Mr. Walsh mentioned one of the contributors at the last meeting.   Another contributor referenced Dublin Airport's capacity to deal with what IAG envisages, which would be good for the country in the context of a transatlantic hub, but he called the airport a shopping centre on a runway because of the difficulties associated with taxiing, the apron and so on.  How will that be resolved?</p></speech>

I have been impressed by Dublin Airport.  The management at daa is way superior to anything I experienced during my time at Aer Lingus.  They recognise the value of a hub operation and are facilitating the development of a hub in a way that Aer Rianta did not.  When Aer Rianta restructured the terminal buildings, it stopped people from being able to transfer air side and anybody who wanted to transfer from one flight to another had to come land side and then go back through security.  The current management recognises that there is a huge opportunity for Dublin Airport to develop as a respected and credible transatlantic hub and I admire them for that.</p><p>I believe we can work with the management team at daa.  Dublin Airport is not a perfect airport, I do not know one that is.  There are always opportunities to improve the efficiency but I would not be critical of Dublin Airport.  We operate to over 250 airports globally and Dublin Airport is one of the better airports.  I see that as a positive.  </p><p> As to other shareholders, we have not had any engagement with Ryanair.  All I can tell the committee is what has already been said publicly and previously.  There have been some statements from Ryanair where it said it hoped the Irish Government would be pragmatic about this issue.  I think Ryanair previously said it would not sell if the Irish Government was not selling and the Government said it it would not sell if Ryanair was not selling, so there is a bit of a stand-off.  I do not know what Ryanair's position is but I expect the board of Ryanair would, at the appropriate time, give very careful consideration to what we propose.  </p><p> Reference was made to Shannon and Cork.  I can appreciate there is some concern being expressed but I think it is misplaced.  I am a business person.  I believe the fundamental benefit one gets is from operating those in a profitable way.  I believe they are profitable today and will continue to be profitable and continue to provide valuable feed.  The Deputy asked if I would give a guarantee specific to Shannon and Cork rather than just the general commitment we have given in relation to Ireland.  My advisor might not allow me to say this but that is something that I would be prepared to do.  I see no reason why we would not operate services from Shannon and Cork to Heathrow, maintaining the four daily services from Cork and the three daily services from Shannon.  I have not heard anyone express concern about Dublin.  Dublin-London is the busiest international route in the world so of course we are going to be there.  I can understand the concern but I genuinely think the concern is misplaced.</p></speech>

There is nothing the Irish Government can do today to stop that happening.  Zero, absolutely nothing, other than all of the committee here to jump up and down and criticise the management team at Aer Lingus.  There is nothing can be done.  We are offering a guarantee that does not exist and which nobody else who might be interested would be prepared to give or capable of giving - and I have not seen anyone else interested in Aer Lingus other than Ryanair.  We are the only airline which gets the benefit of feed from those destinations into London Heathrow, nobody else would get that.  That is why all the concern about Cork and Shannon is completely misplaced.  If people believe it would be better for me to say "Yes we will continue for a period to operate Shannon-Heathrow and Cork-Heathrow with the three from Shannon and the four from Cork", yes I would be prepared to do that.  I would not be prepared to go beyond the five years for the reasons I have given.</p></speech>

That contract is in place.  It is a ten-year contract and would be honoured by us.  At the appropriate time we would engage with the supplier to see if it had an interest in continuing.

The idea that anybody would operate a monopoly while Michael O'Leary and Ryanair are on one's doorstep is nonsense.  One will never see that situation.  Dublin Airport is a highly contested and competed airport, as are all the airports we operate into.  I cannot envisage that changing.  Competition will continue to be strong.</p> <p>  Reference was made to Knock.  I said I think the Knock-Gatwick service can benefit from potential feed into the British Airways short haul network at Gatwick in particular.  That does not exist today.  We do work with Aer Lingus on the Heathrow service but I see no reason why we would not also work with Aer Lingus on the Knock-Gatwick service.</p></speech>

As he has said, the IAG brand is very strong but he also recognised the Aer Lingus brand is extremely strong and recognised worldwide.  We are delighted to hear that if there was a successful bid IAG would maintain the Aer Lingus brand.  Two main issues remain, namely, jobs and connectivity.  Mr. Walsh has spoken about job losses and job creation but the extra aircraft and jobs created appear focused on Dublin.  While we are in recovery mode, the recovery generally begins in the capital city but other regions need to feel it too.  Mr. Walsh feels the Cork and Shannon routes are viable and operating at a profit, would he see plans to expand at Cork and Shannon? He mentioned Gatwick, can he expand a little on that? Does he mean specifically for Dublin or could this be brought also to Cork and Shannon?  Aer Lingus has 11 flights from Dublin to Heathrow and BA has eight.  Can he see these 19 flights maintained daily? He has said he does not need to get rid of short haul flights in order to expand so would he maintain the 19 flights there?  Would this increase prices for consumers?</p></speech>

I am in the business of growth.  People want to focus on restructured businesses.  If we look at Vueling, an airline that joined IAG, it has grown at a significant pace.  When we acquired Vueling it flew about 14.7 million passengers.  Last year it flew 21.5 million.  We have a growth target of between 12% and 16% for that business this year.  We are in an industry that benefits from growth, sustained by the demand that exists in the market.  We are sensible in how we approach it but our reason for being attracted to Aer Lingus is our belief that there is growth opportunity in the Irish market.  Ireland has come through a deep recession and is growing at a significant pace.  It is one of the fastest growing economies and I believe that growth can be sustainable.  There is a direct benefit to the number of people travelling into and out of this country.  I believe Ireland represents a huge opportunity for tourism, particularly with the restructured cost base.  That is what attracts us to it.  We are open to looking at any prospect for growth at Dublin, Cork, Shannon or anywhere else growth may exist.</p> <p>  In relation to the Heathrow-Dublin services, there may be some rationalisation of the schedules so we do not overlap with one another.</p><p>When British Airways and Iberia merged we continued to operate the same number of services but just moved some of the services around so that we had a schedule that stretched right through the day rather than having certain flights operating on top of one another, which clearly would not make sense.  What I would see is that Aer Lingus would continue to operate into terminal 2 at Heathrow and British Airways would continue to operate into terminal 5, which gives opportunities to customers.  Operating into terminal 2 is a very good service and probably marginally better if one is making a point-to-point journey, in other words, if one is flying to London and that is one's destination.  It is probably better going into terminal 2, T2, whereas if one is connecting at London, terminal 5, T5, is a better option.  We would look at how we manage the flights through the day to ensure that we have a good selection of services both into T2 and into T5.  We believe that is the sensible thing to do.</p><p> Gatwick is a good airport.  We have a strong presence there through British Airways, Iberia operates into it and Vueling are also operates into it.  We see no reason we cannot have Aer Lingus operating in there as well and working together where it makes sense to feed traffic to one another if we can do that but to support one another to sustain and potentially grow the network we operate.</p></speech>

We concluded that we were prepared to offer five years following significant internal debate.  Given that no guarantee and no commitment exists today, and the Government has no influence over that issue today, we believe this is a significant concession and commitment that has been given by IAG to make an effort to appease what I consider to be unnecessary concern about the operation.  A number of members of the committee have challenged me to give a specific commitment and I have said that I am happy to give a specific commitment for Cork and Shannon, which I have now given publicly, but I think the five years is more than adequate.  I would hope and expect that through that five-year period people would be able to see what has happened, would be able to witness the commitments being delivered by us, would be able to see the security that exists through those services and would be delighted to see how we are succeeding and retaining those services.  That commitment does not exist today.  You do not have it and you cannot get it and we are the only people who would be prepared to give it.  I would go so far as to say that I do not believe the Aer Lingus management could offer that today because it would have other shareholders today who would say: "Why are you doing that?"  We can give it by virtue of the fact, as I said, that our approach here is to acquire 100% of the airline and having direct control of it being able to give commitments that nobody else could give.</p></speech>

Many figures have been bandied about ranging from &euro;400 million up to &euro;1 billion in the past number of weeks.  What would be the projected growth in percentage terms for Aer Lingus within AIG over the next five years?  Can Mr. Walsh give an appropriate growth percentage for the airline?</p> <p>  It is imperative that our regional airports, in particular Cork and Shannon, and also Knock as has been stated, would be kept up to standard and that connectivity, if anything, would be expanded for those airports.  Due to the fact that there are in the region of 70,000 foreign direct investment jobs in those regions, it is essential that they would be maintained and there would be the possibility of the creation of new jobs.  </p> <p>  What will be the resultant impact on our regional airports from the point of view of peripheral areas such as Kerry and Donegal where there is a public service obligation already in place for those two regional airports?  How will the viability of those airports be affected?  The tourism industry is most important for those regions.  Kerry is at the southern tip on the western seaboard.  We have a huge tourism industry and those regional airports are important for attracting businesses to those regions and for retaining existing businesses.</p> <p>  If Mr. Willie Walsh was to move on in the next number of years, as anybody can, to another venture and another company, what guarantees would there be for Aer Lingus after he left?  Deputy O'Donovan mentioned cast-iron guarantees.  Can we tie that down and have a guarantee that everything will be in place if there is agreement on a takeover?</p></speech>

Significant opportunities would arise for Aer Lingus, particularly in it piggy-backing in on many of the marketing links that IAG has established across Europe and the US.  However, clearly there are many concerns and they have been expressed here today.  They all surround the issue of the nature of Mr. Walsh's guarantee and the guarantees that it would give to Shannon and Cork in particular.  He has been helpful.  In his response to Deputy O'Donovan, he used language to the effect that he is prepared to consider extending the guarantees.  My understanding all along was that what one had one held and in terms of connectivity, for example, from Shannon into Heathrow and the transatlantic routes out of Shannon, that at a very minimum, his guarantee could cover those.  He did not really answer Deputy Dooley when he questioned him on those, but in terms of his response to Deputy O'Donovan, he suggested that he would be prepared to consider that.  In order to bring people on board, he might need to go a bit stronger on that again and offer a firm commitment that this would from part of his guarantee.  I think if he did that, he would bring people on board.</p> <p>  In terms of the five-year guarantee, Mr. Walsh did not become one of the pre-eminent airline executives in the world without having some strong negotiating skills.  His opening gambit is a five-year guarantee.  Would he be prepared to consider something further?  He said he had exhaustive conversations with his board about this, but would he be prepared to consider extending that and come back to us on it?</p> <p>  In terms of the future of Aer Lingus, in the absence of this deal, what future does he see for Aer Lingus?  We have had considerable turmoil in the airline industry over the past decade.  If we are to see a repeat of the downturn in the airline industry, what future would Mr. Walsh see for Aer Lingus?</p> <p>  I have a final point, and I thank the Chairman for his indulgence.  In terms of the Dublin slots, we have, as Deputy McEntee said, 19 at present.  Mr. Walsh could give a guarantee that he would maintain the Aer Lingus slots, the 11 slots that we have, but, in doing, that the group could reduce its overall number of slots?  Will his guarantee provide that the Dublin-Heathrow slots will be maintained at 19?  I have other questions but I have run out my allocated time.</p></speech>

To be honest, I cannot answer that because the market value depends on having a willing seller and a willing buyer.  I am not aware of anybody suggesting that Aer Lingus should sell slots.  In fact, I am not aware of Aer Lingus ever attempting to sell slots at Heathrow.  Some of the speculation in the press has resulted from a reported slot deal that has taken place recently where it is reported that an airline, yet to be named, paid $60 million to acquire a slot from SAS and, therefore, they are assuming that all slots of Heathrow have a value of &euro;60 million.  That is nonsense.  Quite honestly, there are slots available at Heathrow today that people have not taken up.</p><p>That is mainly because they are at times of the day and days of the week when they do not want them.  Without question, some slots do have value.</p><p> There is only one airline that has ever put the slots on their balance sheet, and that was BMI in 2008, when they had 77 slot pairs and they put a value on those slots of &pound;770 million.  IAG acquired that business for &pound;172.5 million in 2012, at a time when it had 54 slots.  The implied value of &pound;10 million per slot in 2008 certainly did not hold to 2012 when IAG bought the airline.  That &pound;172.5 million was the gross figure.  The net figure we paid was actually considerably lower then that.  Slots can have a value, but the value changes.  It is dependent on somebody being willing to sell and equally on somebody being willing to buy.  Slots have traded in Heathrow for less than &pound;1 million, they have traded for &pound;10 million, and they have traded for &pound;5 million.  There is not a fixed price.  Typically, the early morning slots have more value than the midday slots, which in turn are more valuable than evening slots.  There is a sliding scale.  Many slots that come on the market do not get sold because nobody is interested in buying them.</p><p> With regard to the PSO for Kerry and Donegal, I am assuming that is a Government decision.  Interestingly, it is a five-year Government commitment.  I am assuming that will continue, but it is something that Government will have to determine.</p></speech>

This is not Willie Walsh making a bid to acquire Aer Lingus; this is IAG making a bid to acquire Aer Lingus.  IAG is a significant company with clear governance rules.  The board of IAG has unanimously supported the bid to acquire Aer Lingus.  It was not a decision taken by me; it was a decision taken by the board.  The analysis was carried out by a team that reports to me.  This was not driven by me.  This is not me on a solo run trying to acquire Aer Lingus.  This is IAG, the business, with the full, unanimous support of our board, seeking to acquire Aer Lingus.  The commitments that are given are not commitments from Willie Walsh; they are commitments from IAG, the entity.</p> <p>  Deputy Walsh referred to the five-year commitment.  He is correct in that I may have said "consider," so allow me, then, to harden that and say "Yes, I would give a commitment in the same way."  I have considered it and I will do that.   It is not my opening gambit.  Let me be honest; I am not prepared to go beyond five years.  People who have negotiated with me have sometimes come to realise that when I make an opening offer my second offer is actually worse than the first one.  Do not believe that because I make a proposal I am ready to improve it.  If my proposal is rejected I may remove the proposal or I may reduce it, but I can tell you for definite that I am not prepared to increase it.</p> <p>   I was asked about the future of Aer Lingus.  I spent 25 years at Aer Lingus and I had a fantastic time.  I loved every minute of it.  I wish Aer Lingus well.  When IAG approached the board of Aer Lingus we were very clear that we wanted to do this in a friendly way.  We made clear to the board that if it did not welcome our approach, that would be the end of it.  We had negotiations on price with the board of Aer Lingus, and the price we finally suggested was on that the board felt represented value.  It was a significant premium on the price that Aer Lingus shares were trading at before IAG made its approach.</p> <p>   What will the future be?  I think Aer Lingus has done a good job.  It has opportunities to grow, and these opportunities will be secured if it becomes part of IAG.  There is significantly less risk to anything that Aer Lingus would want to do as a result of its being part of IAG, and there is a massive upside opportunity.  I wish the company well, and if we do not succeed with our bid I will continue to wish it well.  I will not say anything that might undermine that other than to say that we are operating in a very competitive industry that is consolidating.  Aer Lingus is a small carrier on a global scale, which punches way above its weight because of the brand.  Its opportunities will be much more interesting and will be significantly better as part of IAG than they will ever be if it remains alone.</p> <p>   With regard to Dublin Airport, IAG would look at rationalising the schedule to ensure there is an even spread.  The commitment that IAG is giving is for the Aer Lingus slots.  IAG does not believe there is a competition issue, but I cannot prejudge what the competition authorities would say about it.</p></speech>

Mr. Walsh said that Ireland is a great market.  I would say, "Please come in, but do not take over an existing producer."  If it is a great market, IAG can come to any airport in Ireland that it wishes to.  We will be delighted to see them.  My concern is that an existing producer will be removed.</p> <p>   Deputy O'Donovan spoke about the performance of British Airways in the UK regions.  Does it not contrast with what IAG is promising in Dublin?  I do not see this in Belfast, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester or Birmingham.</p></speech>

The Senator and I discussed the airline industry many years ago, and I respect his views.  He has been a very strong advocate for competition and deregulation and is a strong supporter of Ryanair and an admirer of Michael O'Leary, as I am.  What I can say to the Senator is, yes, IAG has opportunities to grow organically, but we also have opportunities to grow inorganically.  That is the nature of business.  When a business is looking at growth, it can see an opportunity to work with another entity and acquire it as part of a group.  I believe IAG will bring fantastic value to Aer Lingus because of the structure within IAG.  I understand some of the concerns that have been expressed, which would be valid if this was British Airways trying to acquire Aer Lingus.  It is not.  This is not BA seeking to acquire Aer Lingus; it is IAG.  BA does not have any direct influence over the running of IAG.  There is no BA representative on the board of IAG.  The CEO of BA is part of my management team, just as the CEO of Aer Lingus would be reporting directly to me.  They would have equal weight and equal votes around the management committee table.  Aer Lingus would be in a position to influence the development of a global airline group in a way that it cannot do today, and would get all the benefit of the strength of that group behind it and working with it to enhance the growth plans that it has.  While Senator Barrett sees it as taking out an existing producer, I see it as working with an existing producer to make that producer more efficient, to give it scale that it cannot access in isolation and to help it to grow in a way that it could not do otherwise.</p> <p>  IAG operates significant services into the UK regions.  We fly to Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Newcastle, Manchester, Leeds Bradford, and Belfast.  It is one of the biggest operators in some of these airports.  Senator Barrett was correct when he highlighted the number of airlines.  Some of the figures he quoted are different from the figures provided by the airports in terms of the number of routes they have.  While the Senator may suggest that IAG operates only one service, we fly 6 million passengers in the UK domestic market.  We are probably the biggest operator in terms of movement in places like Glasgow and Edinburgh, where we have a significant presence.  We operated flights from Glasgow and Edinburgh into London Heathrow, London Gatwick, and London City airports.  I assure the Senator that these airports love the British Airways presence.  They beg for more services from British Airways.  They do not in any way criticise us for what we do, and would be distraught if there was any suggestion that we might withdraw any of the services we provide.  What we give them is connectivity to a global hub that they cannot access without the frequency of services that we offer.</p><p>Yes, they are connected to Amsterdam, albeit not with the same frequency of service.  Similarly, they are connected to Paris and Dubai, but not with the same frequency of service.  We offer connectivity - about which everybody present has expressed concerns - to these airports in a way that nobody else provides.</p></speech>

Mr. Walsh is suggesting that what he did in the United Kingdom regions, that is, linking them all to Heathrow, will not be repeated in Dublin and we will not be left with the small presence on the north Atlantic that Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Belfast have.  In its own jurisdiction, British Airways is not doing it for the regions.</p></speech>

Most countries have one hub although some countries try to develop a second hub.  We operate the international hub, the value of which is hugely significant.  I am sure the Senator has heard the debate in the United Kingdom about the value the hub brings to the economy of the United Kingdom.  By operating a hub, one can serve destinations that cannot be viable in isolation from other airports because they require significant traffic feed.  That is particularly true for flights to what normally are labelled developing economies, which are huge economies today.  One also gets the opportunity to operate greater frequency of services, which is extremely valuable to business.  We actually generate huge value to the United Kingdom's economy by operating the hub at Heathrow.  I can tell the Senator the airports he talks about are delighted to be connected to the British Airways network.  We have 55 Heathrow slots assigned to the United Kingdom domestic market.  If one wants to put the value of that, it is nearly &euro;3 billion if one wishes to use that average.</p></speech>

I refer to a comment the Senator made, when he stated that British Airways was being outshone by both EasyJet and Ryanair in the domestic market.  That is incorrect.  According to the CAA statistics, British Airways flew 39.9 million passengers in the United Kingdom, whereas easyJet flew 34.8 million passengers and Ryanair flew 29.4 million passengers.  While EasyJet did fly passengers from France to Italy and perhaps from Denmark to Spain, not all the passengers it flies are in the United Kingdom market.  British Airways also is the carrier that provides 62% of all cargo capacity in the United Kingdom, whereas EasyJet and Ryanair provide zero capacity.  Members should consider the presentations made before this joint committee about the vital importance of cargo to Enterprise Ireland and the IDA to secure support investment in Ireland, and neither EasyJet nor Ryanair provide any of that.  In the United Kingdom, British Airways provides 62% of it.</p></speech>

However, in light of all the popularity Mr. Walsh suggests British Airways enjoys in respect of its statistics and passengers, I do not understand why it simply does not come in to Dublin.  Why does British Airways not operate transatlantic flights?  Why must it take over Aer Lingus in order to develop its business out of Dublin?  In the context of the guarantee, I acknowledge Mr. Walsh has stated that he will have a bank of lawyers and the Government will have the same.  However, I suggest to him that the five-year rule is not legally enforceable.  Does he not agree it is not legally enforceable because there are governance issues?  The airline business is cyclical in any event and if it went through situations in which the board of IAG was obliged to revise its position, I suggest it would be legally obliged, because of governance issues, to so do and to work and act in the best interests of the company.  Consequently, I suggest to Mr. Walsh the guarantee is not legally enforceable.  Perhaps Mr. Walsh might have an opinion in this regard.</p> <p>  In the context of cost, Mr. Walsh has stated the existing flights out of Dublin into London would be retained.  Again, I cannot see how Mr. Walsh can guarantee that because it has been proven time and again that where consolidation takes place, changes to trading patterns are inevitable.  For example, costs rise, not fall, because there is less competition.  As Mr. Walsh is aware, the Dublin to Heathrow route was one of the most expensive in the world at one point because of a cartel operated between Aer Lingus and British Airways.  Mr. Walsh should answer in the context of what will be the plans for IAG on the Dublin-Heathrow route.  Why would IAG continue to operate the same level of flights when it now would be in a position to reduce the number of those flights, while still controlling the Dublin to Heathrow route through the ownership of Aer Lingus?  This could result in an increase in costs for passengers that would not be in the best interests either of passengers leaving Ireland or - of more relevance - those coming into this country.  This is a real concern and of all the issues, the possibility that cost would increase is one of the two specific issues about which I am most concerned.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. Walsh to refute that view and indicate this would not happen.  I also refer, of course, to the inevitable job reductions in a company Mr. Walsh has acknowledged is highly successful.  It actually has increased its workforce in recent years by almost 1,000.  Why then, if the consolidation primarily is being led by independent airlines rather than by legacy airlines across the world, particularly in Europe, is there any advantage to the Government in allowing IAG to take over something for marginal financial interest?  There is absolutely no financial advantage in this regard.</p></speech>

We can continue to fly the same number of services with smaller aircraft and can continue to look to feed traffic in and out.  That is the beauty of being part of a group.  It gives one flexibility in a downturn one does not have in isolation.  Members should picture the scenario in which Aer Lingus operates these 23 slots and gets into a global recession in isolation.  It will face a huge decision in which it either continues to operate those slots, potentially unprofitably, or it gives up the slots for no consideration.  If Aer Lingus does not operate them, under the rule known as the 80:20 use-it-or-lose-it rule, the slots would be lost and would go back into the slot pool to be distributed to other airlines.  Why did Aer Lingus continue to operate those slots during the deep recession?  It was for two reasons.  First, they were profitable and could sustain margins going through that recession.  Second, if Aer Lingus did not operate them, it would have lost them for no consideration.  Why would we do anything different?  Does the Senator honestly believe we would look at it in a different way?  Does the Senator think we simply would stand back and give up slots everybody states have huge value?  We would continue to operate them because we would wish to continue to operate them in the long term.  We are a long-term player in this business and we wish to provide additional support to Aer Lingus that will give it comfort through a recession.  That was absolutely critical to the survival of Iberia during the recession it faced and the restructuring it needed.  Everything we are talking about is positive for Aer Lingus in good times and is especially positive for Aer Lingus in bad times.</p> <p>  On costs, I disagree with the Senator because if one takes the London to Madrid route, where British Airways and Iberia operate together, fares did not rise.  Costs did not increase for the consumer.  They did not increase because it is a competitive market in which one has other options.  Were we to try to drive up the prices, the Senator can be damn sure that Mr. O'Leary would be in to offer services to fly one to plenty of other airports in London and to provide one with connectivity that would force us to compete. It is a competitive market in which one does not have that ability.  If we did, we would not operate with the margins we have today but would be operating with significantly higher margins, like other businesses.</p><p>It is a brutally competitive business and will continue to be so.  That competition will always benefit the consumer.  The consumer has much more choice today than they ever had in the past.  That is great credit to Michael O&rsquo;Leary for being the revolutionary he is in changing the airline industry.  The Senator&rsquo;s concerns are not valid because we would commit to continue to operate those slots.  We would be crazy not to.  If we did not operate them, we would lose them.</p></speech>

Will he expand on growth opportunities at Shannon Airport, particularly exploiting the pre-clearance facility there?</p> <p>  The fundamental question for people in the mid-west is connectivity.  Mr Walsh gave a commitment here today to a five-year deal for both Cork and Shannon.  This is not a run-of-the-mill deal as he is negotiating with the Government.  Connectivity is key to the regions but the mid-west has had the experience of once bitten, twice shy in that regard.  Will he go further than the five-year commitment to ten or 15 years?  The mid-west needs that type of commitment because it will be cut off from the world if it is cut off from the hub at Heathrow Airport.</p></speech>

It seemed clear to me that he intends to develop a hub in Ireland, which is good news.  However, he also said something contradictory earlier today.  He said most countries have one hub and most businesses would be crazy to give a guarantee to one service provider of all of their work, regardless of cost and quality.  Since Mr Walsh was at this committee last, one of the things that has not happened is that a cargo hub has not been developed at Shannon Airport.  One of the things that has happened is that Shannon Airport is a 24-hour international airport which is State-owned but is in a position to compete with the Dublin Airport Authority.</p> <p>  I appreciate Mr. Walsh does not want to talk about Shannon specifically but I do.  He is here on behalf of his board and shareholders.  I am here on behalf of my constituents.  Does Mr Walsh envisage that a cargo hub could or would be developed at Shannon?  Does he envisage that a hub could or would be developed at Shannon?  Could a hub realistically be developed in five years, given Mr Walsh&rsquo;s suggestion that he might guarantee five years?  Will he look at connectivity from Shannon to European hubs other than Heathrow because, unfortunately, that has not been arrived at by the new board and management at Shannon Airport?</p></speech>

If the bid was successful, how would he follow through on this?  I take his point about Cork being the pharmaceutical capital of this country, making the airport a suitable location for cargo.  Up to now, IAG has not capitalised on these opportunities.  How can we get a guarantee that this will happen if the merger goes ahead?  Cork Airport is centrally linked to Heathrow, as it is to Paris and Amsterdam.  What guarantees will Mr. Walsh give for connectivity to those hubs?</p></speech>

My answer is no.  Five years is what we would be prepared to offer.  I do not need to remind members that this is a commitment that does not exist.  There is no commitment on the hubs today.  Aer Lingus has never been prepared to give a commitment on them.  I would question whether the board of Aer Lingus could give a commitment.  I recognise there are concerns that this changes the environment in which we operate.  It is on that basis that I am prepared to give a commitment that we would continue to operate the Shannon-----</p></speech>

In those five years I would expect to see the people in Shannon give a commitment to the service that is being provided.  It is there to be used and we want to make it work.  The more people that fly on it, the more successful it will be.  It would be great to see that there was demand that exceeded the capacity in order that we would have to look at putting on additional services.  It is not a one-way commitment.  I am giving a one-way commitment saying we will be there for five years and continue to operate the services.  That is a commitment that is not in place today.</p> <p>  I am aware of some talk about the development of a cargo hub.  IAG does not operate any dedicated cargo aircraft.  All of the cargo we fly is carried in the belly hold of the aircraft.  We used to lease three dedicated 747 freighters to operate on our behalf.  We have an arrangement with Qatar Airways, a big cargo operator, which provides us with the capacity to supplement the direct passenger capacity that we have.  We do not have the equipment, and therefore are not in a position, to develop a cargo hub at Shannon.  It would be great if there was one developed there.  I am absolutely sure that our cargo team would want to connect into that somehow.  However, we do not have the dedicated cargo aircraft necessary to develop such a hub at Shannon.</p> <p>  Can one develop a hub in five years?  It is very difficult.  While Heathrow is the main hub, we do have a presence at Gatwick where we have both long-haul and short-haul services.  We feed traffic from one to the other.  It is not structured in the same way as Heathrow is structured as a hub.  One can have a situation where one has passengers transferring but it is not a structured hub necessarily.  There is no reason one cannot fly passengers into Shannon to connect on to transatlantic services.  To develop it as a hub, however, one would require a lot more services.  I do not believe there are enough direct amounts to support all of those services.  I am sure there is capacity to fly services, particularly from the UK and UK provincial airports, possibly through the arrangement with Aer Lingus Regional or Stobart Air.  That is something we can look at but, credibly, I do not believe one could develop a second hub in Ireland given that it is only now that they are setting about trying to develop Dublin as the first hub.  Up to 750,000 passengers transferred in Dublin, which is a small figure, representing less than 5% of the overall number of passengers who went through Dublin.  One can make it easy for people to connect.</p> <p>  On connectivity to other hubs, I am not sure whether there is demand for such services.  The smallest gauge of aircraft that Aer Lingus will have is the A320 with 174 seats.  With that gauge of aircraft, one needs quite a lot of traffic to make it sustainable.  It may be possible with smaller gauge aircraft but Aer Lingus does not have those types of aircraft.  It has some A319s which are on lease but will leave the fleet in the next year.</p><p>I do not know whether there would be sufficient traffic to support the operation on a viable basis of flights from Shannon into other hubs.</p><p> My experience of Cork, Shannon and Dublin has been great.  Given that I have been to Knock Airport only once, I cannot comment on it.  Cork has always been a vibrant city with a very strong business focus and attitude and I am surprised at the decline in traffic in Cork Airport.  It contradicts the reported growth in traffic from Cork to Heathrow.  I know from the traffic we get from Cork to Heathrow and the transfers that they are going all over the world.  Some of it is pharmaceutical related.  We will carefully study Cork Airport to see if the loss in traffic can be recaptured.  I do not know where it has gone to, whether Cork people are not travelling or it is something else.  I remember when it took two hours to drive from Shannon to Cork.  It does not take two hours today.  With the improvement in the road network, there is more competition.</p></speech>

We want to grow the business.  We do not want to buy a business and shrink it.  There would be no sense in it.  We are paying a very healthy premium to acquire a business because we believe we can grow it.  Our objective will be to grow the business wherever we can, and whether it is in Cork, Shannon or Dublin, I will be delighted.  I have no bias or preference of one over the other.  DAA and Aer Lingus are working together to develop Dublin as a hub and have been very successful.  It represents a great opportunity.  It does not mean we are not seeking opportunities for Aer Lingus to grow at Shannon, Knock, Cork and anywhere else.  If Aer Lingus is part of IAG, Aer Lingus will be a more efficient company because it can tap into all the benefits of the scale we would give.</p></speech>

Mr. Walsh is very welcome.  It is good to get an airing of his views.  It is the first time we will have heard them publicly.  I live in Shannon town and there are fears.  In the Aer Lingus debacle of 2007, we lost 368,000 customers in the region and there was devastation.  I do not see an issue with the Shannon Heathrow slots, because the three we have carry a 76% to 78% load.  There is a need among the business community for an earlier morning slot out of Shannon to Heathrow, Dublin or another major hub.  Given that Mr. Walsh has guaranteed the Heathrow slots, my fear is about the transatlantic business, and Mr. Walsh might able to echo it.  Many of our business people on the west coast travel across the Atlantic.  I fear that instead of New York-Shannon-Boston-Shannon we will have New York-Heathrow with a back feed to Shannon, or New York-Dublin and people travelling to the west by bus.  Would Mr. Walsh guarantee the transatlantic business that exists during the summer?  It is critical.  While the Shannon-Heathrow flights are busy, I am very concerned about the transatlantic business.</p></speech>

Mr. Walsh has been CEO of BA and then IAG for the past ten years.  During this time, what changes have there been in the regional airports out of which his airline operated on the north transatlantic routes?  What has his model been in the airlines he has taken over, particularly in the UK over the years?  Could he tell me the number of regional airports that were flying transatlantic and how many are now going through the London routes?  Mr. Walsh spoke about the five-year commitment.  He is answerable to a board and has referred to the best legal minds.  The devil is in the detail.  How can he give a legal commitment?  Mr. Walsh has spoken about profitability, but it is relative.  Two flights may go out of Heathrow, one more profitable than the other, but both profitable.  What is the determining ingredient?  In an interview with the <i>Irish Independent</i>on 16 October, Mr. Walsh said he still had no designs on Aer Lingus at this price despite its valuable slots at the congested Heathrow Airport.  Little more than a month and a half later, he put in a bid for Aer Lingus.</p></speech>

I had the same debate at the committee with then Senator, now Deputy, Timmy Dooley.  This has not reduced but increased and is likely to continue to increase.  Aer Lingus should continue to serve this market and I would want it to.  As part of IAG, looking to build on it and feed traffic into it as part of our transatlantic joint business with American Airlines, Finnair, Iberia and BA will enhance the amount of traffic that could flow through it.  It is a good business.  It was always profitable.  While the seasonal variation between winter and summer in Shannon is very strong, Aer Lingus has come up with a very smart way of dealing with it, which has been very successful and would continue.<br/><br/>Aer Lingus has done some very smart things in recent years.  When I left Aer Lingus in 2004, we were flying 1.2 million transatlantic passengers.  We are now celebrating the fact that it has reached 1.3 million.  Aer Lingus went through a long period during which it was not fully developing and exploiting the market and I am delighted to see that it is now doing so.  There must be great potential to move it beyond where it is and the potential would be significantly enhanced if one could put Aer Lingus into a joint business with American Airlines selling at one end of the route to its massive customer base.<b></b>It has 100 million frequent fliers in its programme.  Being able to tap into the American sales presence, the BA, Iberia and Vueling frequent fliers in our programme, our sales and marketing team and our presence goes way beyond anything Aer Lingus can afford to do in isolation.  I do not think BA operated any regional services from-----</p></speech>

That is possible.</p> <p>  Let me tell the committee of the experience.  As members may be aware, BA operates a business-class service from London City to New York that stops off at Shannon.  These are very high value customers.  Most of them were not aware of Shannon or the facilities that existed at Shannon until we showed it to them.  They love it.  They ask for more of that.  Last week, I was with one of our biggest shareholders in London who has a big operation in Los Angeles.  What the shareholder said to me was, "If you succeed in acquiring Aer Lingus, we will fly with Aer Lingus on the transatlantic because we love the ability to do pre-clearance", rather than clearance when they arrive.  This is something that we can bring to the party that is not there in isolation.  That is a significant potential.</p></speech>

First, we would bring Aer Lingus into the oneworld alliance.  Aer Lingus was in the oneworld alliance previously.  I believe there is very significant benefit to the Aer Lingus customer base and to existing oneworld customers by Aer Lingus being part of that.  I understand the reason Aer Lingus left the oneworld alliance was because there is a cost associated, particularly related to the cost of IT, which has since been addressed by oneworld.  We would also bring Aer Lingus into the transatlantic joint business with American Airlines, British Airways, Iberia and Finnair.  Those are two massive short-term developments that would have huge value to Aer Lingus customers, the Irish economy and Aer Lingus stakeholders.</p></speech>

What Mr. Walsh has to do today and in the coming days is to convince the Government and us to troop into the D&aacute;il and vote to dispose of the 25.1% shareholding.  When the privatisation took place in 2006-2007, there was a specific amendment put in place for a particular purpose, that is, to prevent the entire privatisation of Aer Lingus so that we would protect the jobs, the slots and the connectivity.  It is difficult to see how a five-year guarantee has changed that.  In that respect, why should IAG not consider the Government as a shareholder remaining part of the Aer Lingus shareholding process and should Mr. Walsh not be looking for guarantees from the Government shareholding rather than he giving the Government guarantees?</p> <p>  As far as I know, and perhaps Mr. Walsh will tell us, both the offer from Ryanair previously and the one Mr. Walsh has made were unsolicited, or was the offer solicited by any body or entity?  Mr. Walsh attempted to buy Aer Lingus previously by way of managerial buy-out and perhaps he can explain that.  At this point in time, Mr. Walsh is the chairman-----</p></speech>

I want to ask Mr. Walsh whether he would consider now, even if he has not previously, looking at taking transatlantic flights out of Ireland West Airport Knock.

I ask Mr. Walsh for his initial evaluation of that as a possibility.  In the future, is it something he would look at for the west and north-west region, which is crying out for transatlantic connectivity for many reasons?</p></speech>

I have a few quick questions.  One relates to projections, which, I am sure, Mr. Walsh has done.  He stated earlier that Aer Lingus carried 1.3 million passengers last year.  If that figure is correct, what would he see as the corresponding figure in three years' time?</p> <p>  Moving to the regional issue, I will focus on Cork.  My colleague, Deputy Buttimer asked similar questions.  On the connectivity to Heathrow, Amsterdam and the United Kingdom, can these links be guaranteed?  The big business issue for Cork, which has suffered considerably in the past 12 months - for example, in January alone, it lost 16.5% of its business - is connectivity to Dublin.</p></speech>

We fully understand that and I understand the reasons it was put in place.  However, it is important to point out that the 25.1% does not in any way give the Government a voice over how the Heathrow slots are operated - there was a misunderstanding at the time that it may have.  All it does is allow the Government, with the support of other shareholders holding 5%, to block the disposal of a share.  That is it.  We are going well beyond what is available to the Government today by giving commitments to continue with the ability to allow the Government to exercise its voice over whether any Heathrow slots would be disposed of.</p></speech>

This was an approach made by IAG to the board of Aer Lingus in December - I cannot remember the exact date.  It was not that we had been approached by Aer Lingus with a view to us making an offer.</p> <p>  I was asked whether I should be looking for guarantees from the Government rather than offering guarantees to it.  I have the experience of having been the CEO at Aer Lingus at a time when it went through a crisis.  It was clear at the time that state aid rules would have prevented, and did prevent, the Irish Government from supporting Aer Lingus, hence the reason Aer Lingus had to undertake significant restructuring through its own resources.  A separate investor investing does not prevent a Government from investing alongside it.  With all respect to everybody, I am not sure about the idea that in an environment such as this, the Irish Government might be called upon to provide capital along with other shareholders.  If there is a question to be asked about the Government selling then the Government spending money on an airline in an environment such as this would be quite controversial.</p> <p>  Our approach is to seek an irrevocable commitment from the Government and Ryanair to sell their shares to us.  We recognise it is probably in the best interests of Aer Lingus that both major shareholders sell.  It would provide certainty and clarity to Aer Lingus which do not exist today, and there will probably continue to be a bit of uncertainty with regard to Ryanair holding a stake.  This would give the best opportunity to provide clarity on this.</p></speech>

I state categorically yet again that I was never involved in a management buy-out nor was I working with my colleagues to pursue one.  We clearly asked the then Minister for Transport for permission to develop an investment proposal for Aer Lingus.  No work was done on anything because no permission was ever given.  We had withdrawn our request for permission before certain individuals, who I will not name, made references in D&aacute;il Eireann to what we were trying to do.  There was never a management buy-out, and there was never anything, because all we did was ask the Minister for Transport if we could start some work on developing an investment proposal, but the Minister never gave us permission and we gave a commitment that we would not do anything unless permission was granted.

I considered this would not be something which would be classified under the legislation, but I made the declaration to put me in a position where I would not participate in any discussion on Aer Lingus.  When I first started with the NTMA, the value of my shareholding in Aer Lingus fell below the &euro;13,000 limit, but I declared it anyway.  I have been completely upfront and spoken about this publicly.  I do not participate and do not seek in any way to participate in or influence the debate.  As I stated, other than respecting the decision of Aer Lingus shareholders on the payment of &euro;190 million to address some of the shortfall in the scheme, we will not do anything other than honour the commitment already made.</p> <p>  On Knock airport, I am not aware of what happened previously in terms of transatlantic services.  I am very familiar with the market size that would be required to support scheduled transatlantic services.  I understand there are some transatlantic charter flights from Knock-----</p></speech>

The debate seemed to centre on the Heathrow Airport slots, the area we have examined.  I have no problem if Aer Lingus believes it can operate a viable service to Amsterdam and Paris, which we would continue.  British Airways flies to Amsterdam, Paris Orly and Paris Charles de Gaulle.  We are not trying to say Aer Lingus can fly to Heathrow Airport and nowhere else.  Vueling and Iberia fly to Paris Orly and Paris Charles de Gaulle.  All three fly to Amsterdam.  We serve these cities and if there is business, we have no objection to it.</p></speech>

He stressed all of the points I have heard made today.  I have not heard anything that he did not raise with me yesterday.  He pushed very hard on a commitment to operate services from Shannon and Cork airports.  It is not the case that these issues were raised during this meeting only; the Minister pushed me hard on them.  The points made have been reinforced by the committee and I am pleased to be able to respond.  I hope this will be seen as a positive response to the issue of the Shannon to Heathrow and Cork to Heathrow slots.</p><p> The next move is really in the hands of the Minister and the panel that is investigating on his behalf, whom we met yesterday.  They have sought some additional information from us.  We will provide that as soon as we can.  As I understand it, it will ultimately be for the panel to make a recommendation to the Minister, the Minister to make a recommendation to the Cabinet, the Cabinet to make a decision and then if it all flows through finally for the Minister for Finance to make a proposal to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann which would require a vote.  So it is in the hands of the panel and the Minister.  He would probably be able to give the committee much more clarity on that.</p><p> Normally if one can grow Dublin, one will grow Shannon as well on the transatlantic.  What we have seen historically is that there is very strong demand from the US.  It is not that there is not demand outbound from the west of Ireland, but there is very strong demand inbound.  There is an Irish diaspora of 40 million to 50 million people, principally on the east coast.  I see no reason for that not to continue and grow, particularly with the strength of American Airlines in that market, the brand presence it has-----</p></speech>

I apologise, Chairman.  What we have clearly seen is that Aer Lingus is seeking to develop a hub at Dublin.  We support what Aer Lingus is trying to do in developing a hub at Dublin.  That creates very significant value over just having a direct flight because, as I said earlier, one not only gets the value of the traffic that is fed in from a transatlantic point of view, one also gets the value of the additional services that are required to feed in.  That is specifically for Dublin.</p> <p>  I am not for one minute suggesting our focus is only on Dublin; it is not.  Aer Lingus has always had a strong presence in Shannon and in my view will always have a strong presence in Shannon because there is always a strong demand for transatlantic services into Shannon.  We are in the business of providing capacity where demand exists.  So we will continue to provide all the capacity that is required and hopefully more as we seek to develop Aer Lingus and grow its presence.  That is not restricted to Dublin; it is in Ireland where we see Ireland being a growth market.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-12a.984" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Willie Walsh" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015021200002#R02800"><p>I am delighted to be serving Belfast.  I made a personal commitment in my time at British Airways to do everything I could to restart BA services from Heathrow to Belfast.  I honoured that commitment and will continue to honour that commitment because it is a great market for us and we get great traffic feed.</p> <p>  I would like to see the British Government build on what it has done with devolved APD because without question what is damaging Belfast is that the British Government has a very high passenger tax that the Irish Government has seen the sense to remove.  The removal of that tax has been the source of significant growth in the Irish market.  I am hopeful that the British Government will look to remove the air passenger tax in Northern Ireland as well because that is damaging the Northern Ireland economy and damaging the ability of Belfast to attract new business.  We love serving Belfast; I know Aer Lingus does.  We get great direct traffic and great feed out of Belfast as well.</p> <p>  I thank the Chairman for inviting me to attend this meeting.  I want to explain something that I may not have done at the beginning.  Because of takeover panel rules, I have been very restricted in what I can say.  So I was not able to engage publicly and do media interviews, but the panel has been flexible in giving me the opportunity to do some press interviews and appear before the committee today, subject to my financial adviser making sure I did not do anything to breach the rules.  I acknowledge that the panel has done that.  I equally thank the Chairman and members of the committee for giving me the opportunity to outline what I think is a fantastic opportunity for Aer Lingus as part of the International Airlines Group.</p></speech>

Mr. Walsh's contributions have obviously brought a different perspective on what we have heard in previous meetings.  However, as I said at the beginning of the meeting, there as a need for the information Mr. Walsh has provided today.  Obviously this will feed into the decision that will be made.  It was of great interest to the committee, the Government and the people of Ireland.</p></speech>
