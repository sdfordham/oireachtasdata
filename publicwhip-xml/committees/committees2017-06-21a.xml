In 2016, Tusla received over 47,000 referrals.  Only 43% of these proceeded to initial assessment following preliminary inquiries.  This highlights that a large amount of social work activity is occurring in screening and initially assessing cases that do not always require ongoing social work intervention.  However, many of these cases may require access to lower-level family support services.  The latter are sometimes led by our own services in Tusla and sometimes by other relevant agencies and supported by Tusla.  A key objective for Tusla is to ensure children and families receive the right service at the right time and in the right measure and that we maintain statutory social work input only for those children who require that level of intervention.  Later, I will discuss Tusla&rsquo;s recently developed child protection and welfare strategy that will underpin this work and also our plans to introduce risk-sophisticated practice in the way we intervene in people&rsquo;s lives.</p> <p>  Regarding the provision of foster care services, there were in total 6,300 children and young people in care at the end of the first quarter of 2017.  Of these, 92% were in foster care with both general and relative carers.  This means that each of those 5,819 children and young persons who, for one reason or another, cannot live at home is being cared for in a family setting, often by their own extended family and within their own community setting, with all of the associated benefits of educational continuity, access to their friends and regular social activities and so on.  Ireland's performance in this area compares extremely favourably with that of jurisdictions such as England, for example, where only 75% of children in care are in family settings.  The figure for Northern Ireland is 80%.</p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, Tusla was established in 2014 following a recommendation made by the task force.  It was established on the back of some 29 inquiries and reviews and 551 recommendations contained therein.  We always endeavour to be open and transparent if we make mistakes, and we do make mistakes.  We are not dealing with an exact science.  A number of cases have recently been the subject of media attention - a matter to which I will return later - but there is evidence that children are now safer as a result of the establishment of Tusla.  I will set out some of the evidence for that.</p> <p>  We have established a child protection notification system, this is known in some jurisdictions as a child protection register, which contains information about children who may be at risk.  This means that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, emergency hospital staff and out-of-hours GPs who have concerns about children presenting to them have access to information on vulnerable children and families.  They will have information about what category they are registered in - whether it is neglect or abuse - and they will also have information regarding whether the child was previously on the notifications system.</p> <p>  Since the establishment of Tusla, we have reduced the number of unallocated cases by almost 30% and those in the category of high priority have reduced by 70%.  All of those children and young persons who have had their cases managed and who have now been allocated a social worker or referred on to appropriate services are safer.  These reductions are in the context of a significant increase in the number of referrals.  Between March 2016 and March 2017, there was an increase in the number of referrals of approximately 35%.  That fluctuates throughout the year.  The average increase of referrals during the year to March 2017 was in the region of 10%, but there was a very significant increase in the first quarter.</p> <p>  Last year we introduced and amended our special care processes and ensured enhanced governance of the special care services, including an ongoing reduction in the number of children approved and awaiting special care intervention.  When I first came here, typically a dozen people were waiting for special care and the High Court was becoming very frustrated with that situation.  As of today, there are no children waiting for special care in Ireland.  Those who require special care beds get them when they need them.  We have extended coverage of our emergency out-of-hours service and we believe this will enhance the safety of those children and young persons presenting outside core office hours.</p> <p>  During 2016 there was an increase of approximately 51% in the number of early years services inspected by Tusla.  These services were inspected by Tusla to ensure compliance with early years services regulations and to enhance safety of children who attend them.</p> <p>  Close to 4,000 children accessed and were supported by our educational welfare service.  We hope they have been assured better outcomes as a result of our interventions.  Over 24,214 children and nearly 17,000 families received family support services in 2016.  This work is part of Tusla&rsquo;s prevention, partnership and family support work.  Hopefully, it prevents children having to enter the care system and provides the supports required to maintain them safely in their own homes, schools and communities.</p> <p>  I will comment on the national approach to practice.  I do not deny that gaining consistency of approach across the country has been a challenge.  One of the things we are trying to do as part of what has been the most comprehensive reform of child protection and early intervention ever taken in Ireland is the launch of the State's first child protection and welfare strategy.  I will not go into all the details but the signs of safety approach to practice is intended to be in place by the fourth quarter of this year.  It is an innovative, strengths-based, safety-organised approach to child protection casework grounded in partnership and collaboration with children, families and their wider networks of support.  It is quite a significant change from what was perhaps a rather paternalistic way in which the State would provide services and interventions to families as though it always had the answers.  This approach is very much based on helping families to come up with their own solutions in conjunction with professionals support.  It is very much about giving power, control and choice, wherever that can be given to families in order to maintain their dignity when we have to intervene in private family life.  All the qualitative and quantitative evaluation and research and the administrative data from jurisdictions around the world that have implemented this signs of safety approach consistently indicate the following outcomes: families feel more empowered and are able to understand and address the concerns of child protection authorities to keep children safe; the number of children removed from families reduces relative to the numbers who are helped to build safety around the children at home; and, importantly, practitioners report greater job satisfaction due to the clarity of the approach, the usefulness of the tools and the impact for the children and families and professionals spending more time in direct, face-to-face work with children and families, which is what they were trained to do.</p> <p>  As I mentioned earlier, it is about risk-sophisticated practice.  Tusla operates in an environment of uncertainty.  It is often uncertain about what has happened to the child and the impact this has had on the child.  It is also uncertain what will happen when we intervene to try to protect them.  We also operate in an environment of risk and risk management and when things go wrong are unforeseen or could not have been prevented or predicted, of course an emotional response is provoked among the public.  We understand that and have to take account of that.  As part of our reform programme, we hope to work with our key partners to develop risk-sophisticated practice and help to define the agency&rsquo;s and the State's risk appetite.  Through this work we hope our Departmental colleagues, our politicians, our partner agencies and our regulators to engage with us to ensure a collective understanding of what an intelligent response to risk management looks like.</p> <p>  We have no problem in being held accountable but we need to move away from the any notion that risk management means risk eradication.  There will always be children at risk.</p><p>We need to change the rather unrealistic expectation that all children will be safe all of the time.  We need to move away from a blame culture that resulted in defensive practices where people start to hide behind processes and procedures for fear of making a mistake.  That does not lead to intelligent interventions and protection of children.  It also creates recruitment and retention difficulties as well.  While my staff and I accept accountability, we should be judged by reasonable standards and not blamed because hindsight has a distorting effect and makes it seem obvious later that a child was in danger.  Furthermore, if we collaborate in risk sophistication with those who make referrals to our service then perhaps we can start to address the more than 27,000 referrals received each year that are screened out of our service, all of which need time and the associated capacity and resources to be checked and screened.</p><p> In terms of foster care in Ireland, as many as 92% of all children in care live within a family setting and compares favourably with other jurisdictions.  I acknowledge at the outset my respect and admiration to foster carers who open their homes, families and lives.  Some of them dedicate their entire adult lives to caring other people's children.  As in other jurisdictions, foster carers are the backbone of our child protection and child in care system.</p><p> The provision of foster care is part of a continuum of services provided to children and young persons.  Tusla strives to adhere to the national standards for foster care that were developed in 2003.  Given that it is now 2017, I contend that the standards require to be updated at this juncture.  There are particular challenges in delivering foster care, some of which have been highlighted during HIQA inspections.  I shall outline two particular challenges.  First, allegations that are made against foster carers, which are quite tricky situations to deal with.  The other challenge that HIQA highlighted was the assessment of relative carers.</p><p> On the first challenge, Tusla is developing a clear national policy to deal with allegations against carers in order to have a consistent approach across the country.  We are also developing a shortened assessment for relative carers.  We do not believe necessarily that relative carers need to go through the full assessment process that general carers must undergo because relative carers are looking after their blood relative.  We think a differential approach is required in terms of the assessment of relative carers and we are beginning to put that in place.</p><p> Keeping children in their local communities is a challenge.  Sometimes moving a child to a relative means he or she must be moved to another community.  Such a move sometimes results in discontinuity in education and social networks and so on.  These are difficult judgments to make but we try to do so in the best interest of the children.</p><p> In respect of private foster care, the committee asked a number of other questions that we have answered.  Suffice to say that foster care provided by private agencies is governed by the same range of legislation, standards and regulations as statutory care.  In Ireland, 6% or 384 children in foster care are placed with private providers.  There are a range of factors that give rise to private placements, only one of which is the availability of foster carers.  When placing a child or young person in a private placement, consideration is given to the level of support required by the child.  It is often the case that in complex cases, additional levels of therapeutic support are required that are not always available directly from the State.  Furthermore, private providers often have the capacity to provide 24-hour helpline support to their carers, respite services and additional therapeutic services.  It is worth noting that 10% of the 384 placements in private care are separated children seeking asylum, while another proportion of them are young people over 18 years of age who Tusla continues to support and there are some children with a disability who require specialist care.</p><p> Earlier I mentioned services out-of-hours.  Since November 2015, we have established an emergency out-of-hours service.  I wish to clarify that there have been dedicated out-of-hours teams in the greater Dublin area and Cork for a number of years but the rest of the country was not covered.  Since November 2015 Tusla has provided an on-call service that covers the rest of the country.  It is available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in order to provide specialist guidance, advice and information should the Garda request when it seeks to invoke section 12 of the Child Care Act, which is an emergency intervention.</p><p> Inter-agency collaboration is the cornerstone of Tusla's child protection work.  It includes collaboration with doctors, teachers, public health nurses, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, mental health services, disability services and so on.  I would like members of the committee to note that I am personally on record as calling for a duty to co-operate clause in terms of a review of the 1991 legislation.  I want agencies to be duty bound to co-operate with one another.  I mean not just referring matters to Tusla but to stay involved and be part of the support plan for children and families.  A duty to co-operate clause is not uncommon in other jurisdictions.  </p><p> With respect to liaising with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na specifically, at a local level there is regular liaising between Tusla staff and the force in terms of discussing individual cases.  At a national level there are quarterly liaison meetings between Tusla officials and senior garda&iacute;.  As a result of this work, a joint working protocol on arrangements during office hours and out of hours is being finalised in line with the new Children First guidance.  Ultimately, we plan to have joint child protection teams across Tusla and the Garda and again, such teams are evident in other jurisdictions.  We are currently assigning senior managers to work closely with the Garda to help develop proposals in this regard. </p><p> Tusla works with other State agencies and our partners in the voluntary sector to keep older teenagers out of residential care.  Many of them are in private residential care where the outcomes are not always good.  We try to provide intensive flexible support into the evenings and weekends in order to keep them connected with their homes, schools and communities.</p><p> Members have asked questions about recruitment and retention so I shall briefly comment on both aspects.  For the first quarter of 2017 we have begun to recruit social workers at a much faster rate than we are losing them.  I shall give some specific data and numbers, if requested.  The retention of staff remains a challenge.  Tusla must compete for social workers with the Health Service Executive, the private sector, hospitals, and the probation, community and voluntary sectors because, unfortunately, there are only so many graduates per year.</p><p> As someone who has managed services in all of the care groups, I can state that child protection social work is by far and away one of the most challenging roles for a social worker.  We are examining creative ways to recruit graduates from our own universities, as well as from other jurisdictions.  We are also in discussions with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to scope creative ways of recruiting and retaining social workers, including examining terms and conditions and the rolling out of senior practitioner status to keep experienced workers in front-line practice.  </p><p> Media coverage is particularly challenging for Tusla.  For confidentiality reasons Tusla cannot go into details about individual cases and sometimes that gives rise to stories in the media that lack context.  Tusla needs to stop simply saying that it does not comment on individual cases because I think it is not particularly helpful to the media, the public or politicians.  We cannot comment on the detail of individual cases but I think, much more, we will have to get into giving general messages about the circumstances in which children find themselves and the decisions we make about these circumstances without necessarily going into details about an individual case.</p><p> As I have said already, Tusla has been criticised for leaving children in a placement or at home and sometimes we have criticised for removing them from home.  It is extremely important to realise that there are no risk free decisions.</p><p>Removing a child from home or a foster placement can inevitably cause significant trauma and loss.  Therefore, the need to protect children needs to be carefully balanced with the loss they may experience by removal.  There was a particular case where two foster children were in the same placement, one allegedly harming the other.  It is not a reasonable proposition at all to protect one child by damaging another.  We have a responsibility to both children and their needs and best interests need to be balanced.  There are extremely complex and difficult judgment calls around these kinds of issues.</p><p> There has also been some commentary in respect of children returning home following their removal by the Garda under section 12, which provides for emergency interventions.  It is important to understand that a range of factors contributes to a decision about whether a child can be safely returned home.  A significant proportion of these children, approximately 60%, are in the 15 to 18 years age bracket and often present with complex behaviours, including addiction and mental health issues.  It is not always safe for these young people to be placed in a foster home or even a residential home.  Sometimes, immediate medical treatment is required.  However, returning a child or young person home, once the crisis has been dealt with, can be an extremely positive outcome.  We want children to return home where it is safe for them to do so.  As an interim exercise, the chief operations officer conducted between January and May 2017 an audit of section 12 cases where Tusla had become involved in the follow up.  We can report that in the particular county in question, there were 14 occasions where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na invoked section 12.  In all of those cases, we provided very robust social work support and follow up, even where the children were returned home.  We do not just return children home or see that they have returned and forget about it.  We follow that up with intensive support.</p><p> I have alluded to the Shannon report once or twice throughout my statement.  I confirm that the report was commissioned by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that no member of Tusla staff was interviewed as part of its production.  However, I also confirm that the findings of the report, when completed, were discussed with Tusla.  Tusla has requested An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to provide identifying details, if possible, for all of the cases where section 12 was invoked in order that we can follow up and make a judgment as to whether the way we followed up in those cases was appropriate and satisfactory.  We have offered to do that.</p><p> I thank the committee for inviting myself and my colleagues to appear in front of it today.  Hopefully, it has provided some clarity and context to the work that we do, specifically around foster care and associated issues.  We are, of course, happy to answer any questions.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. McBride for his presentation.  I have read carefully through the documentation he provided to the committee in advance of the meeting.  While we can all acknowledge that children are safer, if one looks at the broad numbers for the last couple of years, and while we understand the pressure Tusla is under, I have some concerns.  I accept there is always risk in these situations but I must express some concerns and ask questions on the presentation.  We have all noted in the committee the importance of recruiting social workers and the fact that while targets were set, they have not been reached.  In particular, the ISPCC has expressed concern about the out-of-hours service and the limited availability of support for the Garda when they have to intervene.  The ISPCC has referred to the need for a comprehensive out-of-hours service in which social workers are available.  Tusla has told us that there are difficulties recruiting people, which we understand.  Even though Tusla says and we agree that children are safer now, we need to ensure that they are as safe as possible and that we have the best possible service.  That is what the committee wants to achieve.</p> <p>  The Signs of Safety programme was discussed by Mr. McBride.  Over 70% of section 12 interventions by the Garda were repeat interventions.  It was the same families and children as I understand it from the programme.  There are some 680 interventions per annum by the Garda under section 12.  It happens frequently.  Can Mr. McBride explain the relationship between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla in respect of children at risk?  I understand that more than 50% do not get screened out at an early stage.  The ones that really concern me are those where children are genuinely at serious risk, which is why I want to ask about the Signs of Safety procedure.  Mr. McBride said it would be introduced in quarter 4, but I understand it is already in use in some cases.  Is the Signs of Safety programme already in use in some cases and, if so, have social workers and other professionals like garda&iacute;, public health nurses and teachers been trained in respect of it?</p> <p>  I am concerned about language like "risk sophisticated practice" and the agency having a "risk appetite".  There are some children and situations where it is extremely risky for them to return to or stay in their families.  Mr. McBride should give the committee an assurance that the Signs of Safety procedure will not be used according to this sophisticated language such that children are left with or returned to families where they are at risk and the information garda&iacute; and others have suggests they are at risk.  Is there an escalation or appeals procedure available to the Garda where there are serious concerns about case management and has Tusla received any escalation of complaints about cases in respect of which the Signs of Safety system is in use?  If so, how has it dealt with them?</p> <p>  I am pursuing this in detail because I have done some research.  "Panorama", the UK series, did a programme on the Baby P case and Signs of Safety was part of the management of that case.  That child died.  This is coming in and is implemented in some cases so my questions are specifically around the particular methodology.  While I can understand its use in low-risk situations, I would be very concerned if it were used in high-risk situations.  Can Mr. McBride answer the specific questions around that?</p></speech>

I reassure the committee that the Signs of Safety approach is not some naive, soft approach.  This is very much about a detailed examination of risk factors and the capacity of a family to put a safety plan in place around a child.  It does not mean we will not remove children from high-risk situations.  Indeed, the approach is used where children are already in care and already separated from their families.  This is a detailed examination of the capacity of the families to receive those children back into their care.  It is not always applied when the children are at home.  It very much means we will still have to remove children from risky situations.  I offer that reassurance.</p> <p>  There are aspects of it that have been used in practice in Ireland but it has never been used as a whole-system approach and a whole-system change.</p><p>That is the approach we are now proposing.</p><p> My colleague, Mr. Cormac Quinlan, will speak to the level of training that has been taking place in Tusla.  We will subsequently reach out to partners to provide training.  The reason that we alighted on this particular approach is that there was or is a cohort of social workers in Ireland who are broadly familiar with some of the tools and practice approaches and while we are using parts, we are not using the whole approach.  I apologise for the jargon but we are planning integrity to the whole approach as part of a whole system change.  It is not just about front line social work practice but about aligning all of our policies and procedures with that approach.  It is, therefore, a much wider and deeper change.  Perhaps Mr. Quinlan will give us an indication of what is involved in this as he has been leading out the training around this.  We are using experts from abroad who designed this whole approach.  They are currently living in Ireland and working with us intensively as we roll out this approach.</p></speech>

Signs of safety is a way of working with families and a rigorous assessment process and very effective way of engaging with parents and children right through the process of assessment and intervention in addressing critical concerns about harm to children.  In terms of training, we will start signs of safety in what we call our front door service or our duty intake service and it will extend right through to what we call child protection conferencing.  We will train 2,800 staff across the organisation.  All of our front-line staff will engage in a two-day training course, with many having already completed it.  All our practice leaders, which includes our team leaders, principal social workers and area managers have been included in a five-day training programme, which also has an additional two-day introductory piece.</p> <p>  We have committed to implementing the signs of safety approach in the next couple of years.  Its implementation will not be achieved by training alone.  One of the key goals of the child protection and welfare strategy is to develop a learning organisation, which is what we are trying to achieve.  Over the next two years, we plan to develop a learning trajectory for all our practice leaders.  We will bring them back and reflect on how they are using the approach, how effective it is for them and what are the challenges we face in implementing it.  We will also address the issues and questions they have and support them throughout that journey in the next three years.  </p> <p>  We have engaged a number of strong experts in the field to achieve this, including for the next two years Dr. Andrew Turnell, the co-creator of signs of safety.  Dr. Turnell is delivering the majority of our training across the country.  We have also engaged two other consultants, including Professor Eileen Munro, with whom members may be familiar.  Professor Munro did a comprehensive review of the child protection system in the United Kingdom and will partner with us.  We will evaluate the use of the approach over the duration of its implementation.  The consultants will carry out an evaluation and we will seek to commission an independent evaluation of how successful the child protection and welfare strategy has been.  One cannot evaluate something until it has been implemented, however, and the evaluation will be done at a later stage.  </p></speech>

As I stated, at local level, area managers and principal social workers regularly liaise with the Garda to examine individual cases where things may not have gone as well as they should have done or joint working has not been effective.  Senior garda&iacute; regularly call me or the chief operations officer if they are concerned about a particular case that has not been dealt with appropriately.  As I stated, the chief operations officer, director of policy and I attend quarterly strategic liaison meetings with garda&iacute; at assistant commissioner level.  Mechanisms are in place to escalate cases if something goes wrong or if something is not as effective as it should have been.</p></speech>

We have children and young person services committees, which are multi-agency and involve local authorities, health services and the community and voluntary sector.  These are county-based committees that examine the needs profile of the local area and how they will develop services to match these needs.  Particular issues and problems can be raised at that level and these can be escalated up the management system if necessary.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-21a.28" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Gibson" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017062100002#F00700"><p>I think it is also important to highlight the processes that are defined in our child protection systems.  Social work practitioners at an area level engage with liaison sergeants in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and hold strategy meetings with each other.  More high risk cases where it is deemed that children can remain with families in the community are governed by our child protection case conferences.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is good at attending this forum and participates in professional discussions about child safety and specific child protection plans.  There are also built in forums for professionals from other agencies to contribute to the overall discussion because child protection is everyone's business and the best plans are arrived at using this collaborative approach.  This also includes cases where it is not right or proper to return a child to a specific situation and the child then remains in care.  Those assurances are built into the system.  As Mr. McBride stated, other liaison meetings are also held.  For example, area managers meet Garda superintendents meet to raise and discuss issues.  There is a robust and comprehensive governance structure in place around that.</p> <p>  I will introduce one concept that is valued by all of us who are involved in social work.  Every individual has the potential to change and it would be remiss of us as an agency or a professional group in the agency not to continuously consider the potential of parents to make changes.  We engage with parents to examine the possibility of their children returning home.  For example, where the care of a child is neglectful and tied into the alcoholism and addiction of parents, and the level of neglect leads to the child going into care, if dad and mum recover and prove their sobriety over a sustained period, it allows us to engage with the family and consider the possibility of reunification.  This is central to best practice and it is similar to a scenario where a person commits a crime and goes to prison.  In such circumstances, the hope is that there will be some rehabilitative programme in place that will allow the person to return from prison without re-offending.</p></speech>

The number of children in care is a good example of how seriously we take our business of protecting children.  As Mr. McBride stated, more than 6,300 children were in the care of the State due to a protection matter.</p></speech>

A gap in the number of social workers has been identified.  How can this gap be closed?  Has an analysis been done of the recruitment process to identify where the logjam lies or what is the reason for the failure to attract more social workers to take up vacant positions?  Has sufficient funding been sanctioned for social work positions?  Where are things falling down in the recruitment process?</p></speech>

This whole process started with the recent publication of a report on foster care in Dublin South Central where I live which showed shocking and significant failures.  Tusla has many questions to answer.  We must try to separate the media frenzy that occurred in response to the cases of Grace and Mary from the facts.</p><p>Tusla has the most difficult job to do in protecting and child-proofing our society and the risk to children.  That said, I think the witnesses have failed.  I do not say that lightly.  I have a professional background in mental health and I know how difficult the job is.  I understand there are no risk-free decisions.  The protection of children is the most challenging of services.  Tusla seems to be firefighting constantly.  I come away from my interactions with social workers on the ground in Dublin South-Central with extreme disappointment and anger because I am faced with a complete culture of defensiveness.  It is a defensiveness based on telling people to move along, that there is nothing to see, and that Tusla will deal with the evidence, but there is much more evidence in what I am trying to report but I am being asked to move along.  That is unacceptable.</p><p> I wonder about the culture that is endemic in Tusla.  There are so many people leaving and joining and Tusla seems to be a shambles.  I regret having to say that.  I do not think Tusla is fit for purpose.  There needs to be a root-and-branch analysis and there must be challenge and change to it to protect children.  Tusla was seen as the bad boy of the service.  I do not want to fall into the media frenzy trap.  I have said that repeatedly.</p><p> Reference was also made to section 12.  It is great that the Garda is seen to be responsive, understanding and sensitive.  Training is required for that.  Foster care and the failures of governance identified in the report kick-started the concerns for me.  Will the witnesses comment on the culture within Tusla?  Is it an unhappy, unhealthy working environment?  What makes it so defensive when the ordinary Joe Soap tries to access it or for elected members to try to access help when they have serious concerns regarding children.  I reported two such incidents.  I ask the witnesses to focus on the culture of the working environment within Tusla and whether it is fit for purpose.</p></speech>

That has been challenging, but as I said in my presentation in the first quarter this year, we are recruiting significantly more people than have been leaving the service.  That is probably the case for the first time.  I can give the Deputy figures in that regard if he wishes.</p></speech>

We have tried some very creative approaches.  We have been targeting third level institutions both in Ireland and in other jurisdictions such as Northern Ireland and in the UK.  We have been trying to incentivise coming into Tusla.  Previously we had been heavily dependent upon the national recruitment service, NRS, through a memorandum of understanding with the HSE, and we have now begun to build our own capacity within Tusla where we have our own recruitment section.</p></speech>

The gaps the Deputy refers to are more to do with speed.  The national recruitment service system was simply not quick enough for us.  We were unable to recruit social workers quickly enough to fill the gaps and now we have developed some of our own capacity to do that.</p></speech>

We began to develop our own capacity through Tusla to recruit both social workers and management and administrative staff as well.  The process is happening much more quickly.  That is part of the reason.</p> <p>  I have been travelling around the country.  Perhaps this plays into the comments made by Senator Devine.  She might say that I would say that, but as I go around the country and speak to not just a few but hundreds of staff, in particular around the work we are doing on signs of safety, I hear nothing but enthusiasm for what we are attempting to do.  We do not have everything in place yet, but people are enthusiastic about what we are attempting to do.  When Mr. Quinlan and I addressed 250 people recently in Dublin about the signs of safety approach, which does involve very much a culture change as well, they said to us that we should not wait but that we should get on with it.  That was their response.  I have been around the country at up to 11 different local events and I hear nothing but enthusiasm for what we are attempting to do.  Social workers are not slow in coming forward to tell us the problems, issues and deficits.  Of course that is the case.  We hear that, but they are also extremely enthusiastic about how we are trying to address that.</p> <p>  If we have an environment where people are constantly blamed and pilloried in the media and by other sources and commentators, of course they will slip into a defensive mode to protect themselves.  Eileen Munro said in her review of the child protection system in England, in the aftermath of Baby P, which a member mentioned, that there is very strong evidence that a number of things happened, for example, the number of children coming into care went through the roof.  It was thought in England that if one just proceduralised everything, nothing bad would ever happen again.  That was a really bad mistake.  Social workers and others went into a defensive style and way of thinking and that was found not to be in the best interests of children.  People followed process and procedure and got bogged down in that to the detriment of people spending time in front-line, face-to-face contact with children and families.  If we do nothing else, let us avoid that happening here.</p></speech>

If there is an increase in retention, what is that percentage measured against the parameters Tusla is setting down?  Mr. McBride is working on the front line and he is dealing with the nitty-gritty of recruitment.  If he is finding discrepancies within the NRS and the HSE and he is finding ways to address them, it would be wise and prudent for them to be shared throughout the HSE afterwards to demonstrate how recruitment can be done better.  The HSE is facing challenges recruiting nurses, doctors, etc., and some of those are down to process.  Salary is an issue at times.  I worked in recruitment for years and people often accepted roles for softer lifestyle reasons such as where they wanted to live, starting a family and so on.  Salary is important but it is not the only reason.  We need to get into the nitty-gritty of that.  I welcome Mr. McBride's contribution in this regard.  If recruitment is working and we can find the specifics of where it is working, that should be shared across the system.</p></speech>

We have come out of a long period of austerity.  We are expanding services.  There is Government investment in our services and in other social work-dominated practices in other agencies.  There is a strategic development initiative group within our agency.  It is like a health check stocktake for each area of Tusla.  It will come to Dublin South-Central as well and we will engage with Senator Devine about the concerns there.  This helps us to examine the reality of what we need, which is to be more innovative in our recruitment and retention practices.  We need to front-load the most experienced practitioners from social work and social care in the front-line intake and be more innovative in using other disciplines such as functional family therapists and public health nurses to provide a collaborative approach.  We have moved forward and increased our senior practitioner grades across our service, particularly on the front line.</p> <p>  Through the strategic development group, we are sending messages and themes that emanate from areas into the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  It is clear there are not enough places in universities for social work training and the clear message to the Department is it needs to increase social work training programmes in order that we can look down the pipeline and have more graduates.  The content of the courses also needs to change dramatically because we find that newly qualified social workers are not prepared for the reality of front-line child protection work.  Recently, we conducted an audit in an area where we noticed a high rate of unallocated cases.  We analysed that and what happened was we had mature, experienced workers being promoted or moving to another organisation being replaced by newly qualified social workers who did not have the experience, knowledge and confidence to make key professional decisions.  They played safe and put them up as unallocated cases when they could have gone to family support intervention.</p></speech>

We have engaged with communities around Dublin.  Recently I was in St. Andrew's Terrace and I met a young person from the area who had attended Trinity College.  I asked whether many young people in that community had the capacity, intellect and ability to participate in third level education and would be interested in social care and social work for our organisation, and that answer was "Yes".  I am meeting a group of these young people and we are looking to be more innovative with regard to employing young people who do not have the financial capacity to attend a third level institution.  We will take a good look at them to see if they have the potential during a period of employment with us as a family support practitioner and allow them to think long and hard about whether this is a good career opportunity for them.  We want to consider secondment.  We want to support these young people, but we also want to say to the colleges that we would like to develop a course with block releases because there would be huge benefits to that.</p></speech>

It is clear from my interaction with our staff that they thoroughly approve of that culture and feel it is engaging and produces good outcomes for young people and staff retention.  The majority of our staff are young women who get married and go on maternity leave, which is a major trend.  It is difficult to keep up with that in a competitive recruitment market.</p></speech>

The signs of safety approach is not just about a practice model; it is about culture change as well.  We are trying hard to give people the confidence and the practice tools.  We are trying to encourage openness and transparency in how they practise.  Part of the approach is about opening up their practice to other practitioners and agencies, outlining what we think is the right decision in a case and asking them what they think.  It is about how we can share ideas, knowledge and experience about the right decision.  Some of these decisions are very challenging and they are very much based on a balance of judgment.  We try to gather as much as evidence and information as we can to make these decisions.  Sometimes the information is partial, ambiguous, conflicting, or old.  There is a challenge in trying to get the balance of judgment correct.  On most occasions we get it right, but there will be times when we do not.  Part of the culture we are trying to create is to make staff aware that they will be judged by reasonable standards, and not by the distorting effect of hindsight, which can make them feel extremely exposed and frightened of public criticism.  We are trying to create a management system and culture that supports people.  Of course, people will have to be held accountable if something goes wrong.  Ultimately, I will be held accountable and I am happy for that to happen provided we are judged by reasonable standards.  That is part of the culture we are trying to create.</p></speech>

I went through the opening statement.  I agree with much of what Senator Devine said.  I have zero confidence in Tusla.  The Shannon report took up a mere paragraph in Mr. McBride's opening statement.  What follow-up has taken place in respect of the children referenced in the "Prime Time" programme?  Has someone visited them?  Are they safe?  What follow-up has been done with the social workers who made the decisions?</p><p>If a garda makes a decision under section 12 to remove a child, how can anyone, trained as a social worker or not, make a decision two to three days later to place those children back in those homes?  I honestly do not know how Tusla can stand over those decisions.  I do not accept the point about people being afraid.  If they are doing their jobs correctly, there is nothing to be afraid of.  The majority of people who are not trained in social work can tell someone it was the wrong decision to return many of those children to their homes and keep a child in foster care when the birth mother made numerous complaints.  We have failed children throughout the history of the State and we are doing it again.  I thought when Tusla was created it would address many of these difficulties, but far too many children continue to fall through the cracks.  The constituents I deal with give me much of the same feedback, unfortunately.  This is that Tesla can be heavy-handed in certain cases but it does not seem to care in other situations.  There does not seem to be any uniformity of approach.</p><p> Are members of staff involved in the Grace case still employed by Tusla?  If so, why?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-21a.77" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1231" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017062100002#J00200"><p>I apologise for being late.  I will not ask any of the questions already asked.  I will wait for answers to what Deputy Funchion has asked.  Earlier Deputy O'Sullivan spoke about the various parties with whom we engage and we spoke about the Garda.  I assume we engage with the Department of Education and Skills, the teaching profession and preschool officers because they have a huge role.  I would like to hear how we engage with them.  I have a particular experience of a case in my constituency where a teacher was not included in a decision involving four children in foster care and they ended up being removed.  There were siblings among them and they ended up being divided.  Special resource hours had been in place.  It was a catastrophe for the children.  How do we engage with teaching staff, who have a huge role to play?</p> <p>  What supports and services are available for grandparents in Ireland who take their grandchildren from the UK into care?  They do not fall under fostering in Ireland, but they are given an allowance by the UK to mind children here.  How do we support these families who take in children from the UK?  How will this continue after Brexit?  The Department supports children, but given the sterling differentiation where an allowance is paid from the UK, how do we give a wrap-around service to support these grandparents and the staff on the ground?</p> <p>  Tusla has received much criticism this morning.  What can the committee do to support it?  If it finds the Department or a committee is falling down and we could help, I would like to hear how we could be proactive in helping and supporting it.  I welcome the fact Tusla is speaking about apprenticeships because we have a recruitment issue.</p> <p>  Five years ago, the advocacy group in Galway, Youth Advocate Programmes, YAP, had a budget to manage 60 or 70 cases.  Three years ago, this decreased to 30 cases because of funding through the Tusla budget.  At present, it manages only 25 cases.  If it drops to fewer than 25 cases, YAP in Galway will not exist.  It is in an ideal position to look after level 1 and 2 children and support the role of Tusla.  It has the experience and is crying out to do more work.  Why do we not use more of these groups?  They have a wealth of knowledge.  One does not need to be a social care worker to be very good advocate.  How do we engage with professional people such as those working in Sugru, which is non-profit?  We have to reach out to be able to look after the 5,400 children who do not have social care workers.  The different levels demonstrate the amount of care we need.  How do we engage with groupings in order that we can sieve through the cases very quickly to give support?</p></speech>

The chief operations officer and I had a look at the cases on "Prime Time".  One of them is still in a court process and is subject to the highest level of scrutiny.  We are in constant discussion with the court on the management of this case, and I will not say any more other than this.  We have a close eye on these cases.  I will also not go into the details of the other case that was mentioned.  I mentioned an example of two children in a foster care placement, one of whom was allegedly harming the other.  We do not just remove one of the children and potentially cause huge damage to that child to protect the other child.  It is much more complex than that.  We have an obligation to both those children and some solution needs to be found.  I said in the media recently that if one sibling in a family was harming another, the family would not throw out one of them.  It would find a solution.  The family would increase supervision, have a safety plan and talk to the children.  Removing a child is not always the answer, especially when it can create significant lifelong trauma and loss.  The notion one child can be protected by seriously damaging another is not a notion with which Tulsa holds any truck.  We make much more complicated, complex and sophisticated decisions than that.  An extremely simplistic way that some of these things are presented in the press does not help in this situation.</p> <p>  Deputy Rabbitte asked whether there is anything the committee or others could do to assist and support.  One thing I would say is committee members should not believe what they read in the media and should not take it as face value, because it is usually much more complex than how it is presented in the media.</p></speech>

In some circumstances we might have to.  It is not always as straightforward as it is sometimes portrayed.

We would monitor it.  All children in care have to be allocated a social worker, who visits regularly.  The foster carers should have a link worker, who is their own social worker, to help support them, and regular reviews of care plans take place every six months at least.  People visit the household regularly, speak to the child and foster carers, review whether the safety plan is working and, as far as possible, try to ensure the child or children are as safe as possible.</p></speech>

Just to explain my question, I am asking about situations where the family network is in another jurisdiction but the grandparents, for example, are living in Ireland - a situation where a care order has been given in another jurisdiction for those grandparents to care for the children, resulting in the children moving here.  While they are getting a small allowance from another jurisdiction, it might not be an awful lot with which to maintain and support the children.  What support does Tusla provide to them?  I know that Tusla is supporting them, but they are not getting enough financial support.</p></speech>

Where children are in care in another jurisdiction and there is an agreement to move them here under a formal care arrangement, we will look at those cases.  There are bilateral agreements with countries under Brussels II, EC Regulation No. 2201/2003, so that a proper transfer is arranged.  Those children could potentially come into formal care under our system and be supported through formal payments.  There is another category of cases to which I believe the Deputy is referring, in respect of a kind of special guardianship.  This is in place in the UK, but it is not in place here.</p></speech>

The children are not technically in care in Ireland so they are not able to access the foster care payment.  They are however able to access our meitheal support services and our family support services.

They can access any service available through us, but financial payment would be a matter for social welfare because the children are technically not in the care of the State.</p></speech>

I am talking about a specific case here so I apologise.  It is something I have come across only very recently.  While the case is exactly as Mr. Quinlan has described the second category of cases, we are talking about grandparents doing their very best with four kids but, because of the currency exchange rate at this moment in time, they are falling short by an awful lot.  While Tusla is giving all those supports that Mr. Quinlan has spoken about, they are still falling short financially.  The people in Tusla are looking for supports, trying to support the family and trying to keep the whole unit together, because it is working.</p></speech>

It is worth saying that Ireland has a very unhappy history in respect of child protection.  Generationally, we have failed children and there is no doubt that Tusla came into a very difficult situation.  At the time that Tusla was being established and the legislation to do so was passing through D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, our position was that we favoured the idea but we were concerned that if the resources were not going to be provided and the social workers and recruitment were not going to be up to scratch, it would not be able to succeed in achieving what it was intended to achieve.  To a considerable extent that has unfortunately been borne out.</p> <p>  I accept the point that people need to be judged against reasonable standards and not with the benefit of hindsight and that individual cases are useful in terms of getting a sense of the kind of considerations that might be involved.  What concerns me most in the reports from HIQA, the Shannon report, a number of other reports and the information we have received through parliamentary questions, are the structural weaknesses that exist.  This is not something that can be contextualised by missing information.  It is almost an objective fact that there are structural weaknesses.  </p> <p>  Tusla was initially invited before the committee in the context of foster care, although wider issues have since emerged.  In the last fortnight a report into south Dublin and Wicklow stated that 84%, or 188 of 223, foster care households in that area had not been subjected to a performance review in the past three years, despite child protection concerns being reported in a number of those settings.  Some of those foster parents were not even familiar with what that process involved.  It is structural issues like that which create significant concerns for people like us and weaken our faith in Tusla to deliver.  </p> <p>  I accept that there are recruitment issues, but it is also an issue that there are still - according to the last statistics I have seen - more than 1,000 high-priority, unallocated cases.  There are always individual cases and considerations to be considered, but even in the opening statement returning a child home was mentioned as a positive outcome.  In a number of these cases, including one particular case featured in the "RTE Investigates" show, somebody was returned to a person against whom allegations of abuse had been made.  Perhaps the witnesses can enlighten me, but I cannot think of a single mitigating circumstance in which that could be acceptable.  It seems there are structural issues, issues with recruitment and perhaps there are management issues, but some of it also seems to be cultural.  I publicly welcomed the new child protection strategy and I believe there is a lot of good in it, but there are still significant cultural issues as far as I can see.  Certainly, I have received a lot of feedback to that effect. </p> <p>  On recruitment and retention, I do not need a comment back on this, but I want to briefly relay suggestions that social workers have made to me.  They have suggested that there not be the same difficulty in recruiting administrative staff and that doing do should assist in freeing up social workers.  It appears that recruitment has now surpassed the issues with retention.  Does that specifically refer to the child protection social worker category?  Are there more child protection social workers being recruited than are being lost?  People also felt that central recruitment was not working and that local recruitment was more effective.  There was also a sense that the applied social work practitioner grade, which has essentially lapsed, is something that should be considered.   </p> <p>  I express my continued concern at the issue of outsourcing.  The level of reliance on the Five Rivers agency is still very considerable.  It is even mentioned in the statistics the witnesses provided today.  I am particularly concerned that  cases under section 12 will inevitably become a very serious category of incident.  Five Rivers apparently reserves the right to refuse children with difficult behavioural issues.  That potentially means people will end up in Garda stations when that is not necessarily the right place for them to be.  I express my continued concern about the reliance on outsourcing.</p> <p>  The issue of inter-agency co-operation has been touched on and perhaps there is improvement on the way.  The Shannon report continued into 2016 in respect of the focus groups.  At that stage there were a number of comments.  The audit into section 12 found that there were "low levels of meaningful communications between agencies", that co-operation and co-ordination were largely dependent on good personal relationships, that a critical theme of notification not being communication was emerging and that there was a lack of feedback to Garda members.  As far as I understand those focus groups continued right up to 2016.  I would still be concerned about that particular issue.</p> <p>  The out-of-hours service was also touched on in that report.  There is progress in certain areas but it is stated in the report that there continues to be no comprehensive social work service that is directly accessible to children and family outside of office hours.  That is also a concern.</p> <p>  My last questions are relevant in the context of what the witnesses have said happened after the Baby P case in Britain, when an overall review of social services found that there has perhaps been an overreaction and things had became very process-oriented.  Geoffrey Shannon's report, which has been valuable, focused on a very discrete area of child protection issues in terms of section 12.</p><p>Does Mr. McBride believe there is a value in a similar audit being taken of the full remit of Tusla's responsibility and child protection structures in order that we can get a full picture of where the structural and perhaps cultural deficiencies are?</p><p> Mr. McBride said of the Shannon report: "In respect of the Shannon Report I can confirm that this was commissioned by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and no member of staff was interviewed as part of the methodology for conducting the review or writing the report."  In the context of the publication of that report a press release was issued then withdrawn with the intention of dispelling any doubt about whether Tusla was trying to undermine the report or making adverse comment on it.  I would be slightly concerned that this comment is a restatement of that first press release.  It seems to be very carefully worded when it reads "no member of staff was interviewed as part of the methodology for conducting the review or writing the report".  Was the rapporteur, Geoffrey Shannon, in contact with Tusla seeking data and information while compiling that report and was there ongoing communication between the rapporteur and Tusla? </p></speech>

We were trying to be clear about the fact that none of our staff was interviewed as part of the process.  He was in discussion with our director of policy about the findings.  Once that was done he may have requested some information for the purposes of the report but at no time were we interviewed about contributing to the substance and writing of the report.  I was just trying to set the record straight on the facts of that.  I have since written to Dr. Shannon saying we absolutely accept the process and have no difficulty with it and in no way were we trying to undermine it.  We accept the report as produced.</p></speech>

No staff were ever interviewed about what was the follow up on any of those matters from a Tusla perspective.  He met us on 2 November and read segments of the report but did not go into any detail of the 91 cases.  He was more focused on some of the issues he touched on in his report in respect of legal issues around use of section 12 and how it fits within our structures and services and particularly in respect of the use of Five Rivers and some clarifications on that.  He sought some information from us on the contract we have with Five Rivers and some data and information about the current emergency out-of-hours service, which we provided to him.  That was the extent of the engagement on that issue.</p></speech>

We gave a commitment to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs that we would review the 91 cases outlined in that report.  We have communicated on two occasions with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with regard to seeking the identifiers and the geographical location of those section 12s.  That allows us to undertake an audit of all the cases that were in the report to satisfy ourselves that the contacts and the professional decision making did occur.</p> <p>  As chief operations officer I took it upon myself to do a snapshot audit of one county in Ireland that Mr. McBride mentioned earlier.  There were 14 cases, which were quite interesting because they showed the span of cases that arise out of hours.  I needed to assure myself that staff were following up on section 12s.  All of the 14 cases in the county were responded to and some children came into care.  Some young people who fell out with their mum and dad because they were drunk at home and were put out of their homes were placed in the local hospital by the garda&iacute;, and were returned home the following day but with a support plan and an intervention plan.  To give a real idea of how we would do that and would like to mentor young people who have a difficulty with drugs or alcohol, instead of placing them in residential care where they do not have a good outcome, we coach parents in how to engage with that young person who is full of drugs or alcohol, and to wait for the appropriate time to deal with those issues.  For example, in the north west a member of an organisation in the voluntary and community sector is contracted with us to do intensive parenting coaching for adolescents.  If there is a pattern of the young person arriving home drunk every Friday night and having an argument with his mother, who might be a single mother, kicking the TV in or ripping the door off, then being told to leave and wanting to come back because he has nowhere to go, we coach a social care or youth worker type of individual to come into the family home to show the mother how to parent the situation.  The mother is told to get the young person to bed when he comes home, get him to settle down and not to confront him or create a scene which might give rise to verbal or physical aggression and then to make a nice breakfast in the morning.  The youth worker will come and coach the mother in how to engage with her son and raise the issues of concern to her, that he is drinking, that he is with the wrong crowd and so forth.  Creating those supports works really well.</p> <p>  That is outlined in the documentation which we will give to the committee.  It details Tusla's initiative on creative community alternatives which is building an integrated approach to the multiple issues that young people and children experience.  As one agency we cannot resolve those.  We need an integrated response.  Many young people known to our service are also known to the garda&iacute; for petty crime or to the Probation Service because they are on an order in the youth diversion scheme, or to the mental health services.  By creating a team in communities we can collaborate with other agencies to put a wrap-around teamin place to intensively help that young person and family get a better outcome, as opposed to removing the person from the family and community.  That is the very important work we need to get on with, promoting and engaging with other key agencies in and around communities.</p></speech>

We are an organisation of more than 4,000 people.  We have embarked on a broad and deep transformation for just over three years but we cannot fix every structural weakness in that time.  It takes longer.  I accept there are areas where there are some structural weaknesses, for example, reviews in foster care.  Some of those children are with relatives, they are settled and we believe they are safe, or as safe as they can be.  There are not necessarily any immediate risks.  There are some mitigating factors there.  I do not deny there are structural weaknesses and changes we need to make after three years.</p> <p>  I accept some of the Chairman's points about recruitment and we are doing something about that.  We accept that recruitment of administrative grades is equally important so that we can support social workers and free them up to do the work they need to do.  We have an ambition to create a senior social work practitioner in every social work team in the country.  We plan to roll that out as soon as possible.  Inter-agency communication remains a challenge.  As the chief operations officer has said, we have some mechanisms in place such as child protection case conferences that several professionals attend.</p><p>We need to get better where a teacher, public health nurse or garda refers the matter to us and wants to hear back about what we have done with it.  We are not always good at doing that.  Often, we deal with a referral and do not give sufficient feedback to the referrer to let him or her know what has happened.  Interagency communication is an ongoing challenge.</p><p> The outsourcing of foster care was mentioned.  Only 6% of children in care are with private foster carers.  Private foster carers have entered the frame because of a deficit in direct State provision.  They have been with us in this and many other jurisdictions since the 1990s and much earlier in others.  They have become a reality, a fact of life and a fact of the range of provision that exists.  Inevitably, they will be used when some of our foster carers are unable to take particularly challenging youngsters.</p><p> A question was asked about whether we needed a full-blown out-of-hours service covering the whole country.  We have a full team in the greater Dublin area and Cork and the rest of the country is covered by an on-call service.  We undertook a demand analysis before we set up that service.  There is not usually a demand in rural areas for a permanent team of social workers or others who are sitting around waiting to be called.  It could be argued that, if there was a team, people would use it.  That is probably a fair point, but if we were to have a full-blown out-of-hours service covering every area in the country, it would require significant further investment and we would have to ask whether it would be fully used.  That would have to be analysed and tested.</p><p> Regarding a full audit of Tusla, we are subject to five or six separate scrutiny processes.  HIQA is investigating nine of our areas and we are participating in the Charleton commission of inquiry and the commission of inquiry into the Grace report, which is covering many years.  The Data Protection Commissioner will examine our data protection systems and processes.  A large number of substantial scrutiny exercises are under way simultaneously.  That said, if a decision was made that a full audit of Tusla's current position and where it needs to reach should be undertaken, I would be happy to participate in such an exercise provided that it did not detract from our day-to-day business of protecting children.  I have made the point publicly that there is a real risk that the level of scrutiny that is being visited upon this agency - five or six different processes simultaneously - is beginning to draw time, attention, resources and social workers away from practice.  We are happy to participate in audits, but we need to keep the service going.</p></speech>

We welcome that because it reaffirms our assessment of some of the situations.  Some of the main themes that have come through the HIQA reports include relative assessments not being completed within a timeframe that was set ten years ago by way of regulation, Garda vetting not being on file, the reviews of foster carers after a period of three years and the management of abuse allegations.  I will categorically state that we take on board that commentary and have responded to it.  We have ready for sign-off a new assessment framework for relatives because there is a distinct difference between going around the corner to stay with an aunt or uncle with whom one has a good relationship and attachment as opposed to a stranger in general foster care.  Garda vetting has been an issue.  We have let ourselves down, in that we had the Garda vetting but we did not have it on the file in the area.  With e-vetting now in place, we are confident that we have set up a procedure with the Garda vetting bureau in Thurles to process applications more quickly.</p> <p>  Regarding the management of allegations of abuse, the main finding by HIQA was that there were inconsistent practices.  It did not necessarily say that we never dealt with those complex issues.  I issued an interim protocol that brought consistency to the area and my colleague on policy and strategy is working on a more comprehensive policy document.</p> <p>  We respond to the findings and themes that emerge from HIQA reports.  We do not nonchalantly ignore them.  We have identified reviews that need to take place, mitigated against risks and put a plan in place to undertake the reviews.  As chief operations officer, I am involved with service directors and area managers on ensuring fitness for purpose.  Under one of the initiatives deployed in areas where HIQA identified difficulties, we set up a governance performance and oversight group to ensure that the action plan that we agreed with HIQA was thoroughly and exclusively dealt with in that area.  There are fine examples within our agency of serious and benchmarked improvement.</p> <p>  I welcome Deputy Rabbitte's query about providing an opportunity to showcase some of the good stuff that we do and to remind the committee that, when we were established, we set ourselves the target that every child in care would have an allocated social worker.  We have hovered around the 90% to 95% figure of children in care having social workers.  As the chief operations officer, that is an exceptionally good standard to achieve internationally.  The other 5% figure relates to the recruitment and retention issues that we have been experiencing.</p> <p>  We have numerous young people in foster care who are at university, abroad, on sports scholarships and so on.  They comprise the silent majority whom we never get the opportunity to showcase.  I receive correspondence from children in care thanking me.  When one young person who left care in a city in this country got married to his girlfriend, his foster carer asked him whether he would like to buy a house.  She could buy a house for that young chap because she had kept the maintenance payments for 15 years.  These are the positives.</p> <p>  I asked the area managers to give me a portfolio of all of the good occurrences in foster care because the level of scrutiny of past events is impacting on our capacity as an agency to recruit and retain foster carers.  I told Ms Catherine Bond of the Irish Foster Care Association when we met to discuss recruitment that, given all of the bad publicity and loose comments about foster care, it might be about marketing foster care rather than recruitment.  We are forgetting about the silent majority of children who are doing exceptionally well in families and communities, attending school and having a good outcome.  I welcome the opportunity for us to showcase to the committee the good, positive elements of foster care.</p></speech>

A specific question was asked about an audit and I welcome the comment in that regard, but the question was on whether the retention level of child protection social workers had surpassed the departing number.</p> <p>  Regarding the cultural issue, the Shannon report made a specific point about social workers supposedly leaving the reporting of cases until late on a Friday evening.</p><p>That resonated very strongly with all of us.  Perhaps the witnesses will comment on that also.</p></speech>

Fred McBride has touched on this already.  The child protection and welfare strategy which we have talked about, and obviously signs of safety are a part of that, took almost two years to develop.  We conducted a very extensive review of all the reports, inspections or otherwise.  It was a thematic review and analysis of all the critical challenges and the things that were working well in the system to allow us to build what I believe is a very effective strategy for the next five years to deliver real change.  In addition, it meant that Fred and I met hundreds of our front-line staff throughout the country.  We visited many areas to talk to them about what they considered to be the particular challenges the agency was facing, what they believed was working well for their practice and how they wanted to see the agency change.  That also included engagement with key stakeholders.  We met with officials from our Department, the HSE and the Garda.  We carried out a comprehensive analysis and engagement with all staff.  The staff told us that they wanted to work in a much more creative and collaborative environment, and we are modelling that.</p> <p>  I have also been at the front of rolling out this training programme with staff around the country.  We have exceptionally skilled and enthusiastic staff who wish to work in this agency.  They do not believe they are failing people, and certainly we do not believe we are failing people in that context.  There are challenges and issues, but all the information we have presented today highlights that there is a huge amount of positive work taking place in this organisation.  There are problems but the nature of child protection and welfare work is problematic, and we are seeking over time to address those difficulties.</p> <p>  With regard to the comment around culture, it would be absolutely inappropriate for staff to engage in a process where they would try to bypass the responsibility.  That would not be the intent of the organisation.  If that was a concern, we would address it with staff to prevent it from happening.  Our work is to try to collaborate as effectively as we can with the Garda to get better outcomes for children.</p></speech>

That is where we are prioritising our recruitment.  We have not broken down the numbers coming in the door by team, but we are recruiting social workers across the system - intake, which by its name and nature is where initial referrals are made, child protection, children in care and foster care support social workers.</p></speech>

I wish to pick up on the culture issue.  Mr. Gibson has rightly told us about the large number of placements and so forth that are good, where the children are being well looked after.  We know that is the case with most of the children who are in care in one way or another.  My initial questions were focused on where that is not the case and where there is a serious risk.  That is why I asked the questions around where there is an escalation when somebody expresses a concern from the outside.  Will Mr. McBride give us an undertaking that he will, and does, respond in those situations?  That is the reason I raised the issue of training as well.  The witnesses spoke about a collaborative approach with the Garda, education, the community, families and so forth.  That will only work if people feel their concerns are receiving a genuine response.</p> <p>  Deputy Funchion and Senator Devine spoke about people feeling closed off when they raise these matters.  They are being told, "we are handling it so go away".  I wish to pursue that point with the witnesses.  Where there is genuine concern, and it is nearly always a genuine concern although there might be very occasional situations where it is not, that decisions might be putting children at risk or leaving them in risky situations, there should be an openness that complaints will be followed up and responded to and an openness to engaging with the people who express those concerns.  That is what concerns me.  I acknowledge the good work we have heard about from the witnesses this morning.  However, we as public representatives have a duty to ensure that there are no children falling through the cracks and being put into serious situations.  I seek an assurance that the witnesses will respond where there are concerns from outside sources.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-21a.118" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1231" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017062100002#N00700"><p>I will continue in the same vein with regard to the escalation, where if the schools have an issue that they wish to raise they will not be shut down straight away.  They must feel that the door is open.  They are minding children for seven hours per day and they know the foster parents who are coming to the school.  If they want to lend support or to be engaged, they do not need teachers getting a telephone call in return telling them that they could lose their job for referring something to a politician.  That is not what we need to hear.  We are talking about people who are looking for help and who feel they are doing a very good job.</p> <p>  According to a reply to a parliamentary question I tabled last March, there are currently 5,200 children in need of a social worker, social care worker or a level of intervention.  Of those, 20% are priority cases.  How many staff have to be recruited?  I am aware there will be a shortfall, so what is the plan for engaging with advocacy groups to get through it as quickly as possible?  Finally, there is a fear factor for people who want to become part of the team.  That fear factor is that the tools are not in place.  In mentioning tools, which are totally outside of the witnesses' control, I refer to the computer database system and how there can be reference from county to county.  I have raised this numerous times with the Department.  Does the fact that social care workers do not have the tools to do their job feed into the fear factor of them not being able to document correctly?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-21a.119" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fred McBride" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017062100002#N00800"><p>I thank the Deputies for their questions.  I said earlier that we need to get better at ensuring that people who refer matters to us are kept in the loop so they know what is happening with that referral, even where they do not perhaps have an ongoing role to play.  When teachers, public health nurses or garda&iacute; refer matters to us we often want them to continue to be involved in supporting the child and the family.  We do not want them to just give us a piece of information and then walk away.  We want them to stay involved.  That is the reason we invite them to a range of multi-agency discussions, child protection case conferences and child care reviews if the child is in care.  I am very open to these other agencies playing a full part where it is appropriate in the ongoing care of these children and families.  However, I have acknowledged that we need to get better at keeping people in the loop.  If we do not see that there is a further role for them we do not always keep them informed of what we are doing about the situation, and there is scope for us to do that.  I accept that.</p> <p>  We take concerns from outside sources seriously.  I can give an assurance, as far as an assurance can be given, that where we deem a situation to be high risk and a child in some type of imminent danger we will remove that child.  The HIQA inspections across the piece relating to child protection and welfare have all said that where a child needs an immediate protective response they get one.  All of the reports have said that.  I can offer that level of reassurance.</p><p>However, as I said, there are many decisions which are not at all clear cut in regard to balancing risk against the damage that might be caused by removal.  These are delicate balances of judgment.  We have to weigh up evidence, information and the impact on the child.  An independent judgment has recognised that if a child is at immediate risk, we take immediate action.  That is reflected in HIQA inspection reports.</p><p> In regard to how many staff we would need to clear the unallocated list, we have a caseload management system which tries to keep social workers' caseloads at a manageable level.  If we were able to recruit all the social workers we could recruit within our current investment level and do something about the retention issue, we could reduce the unallocated cases very significantly.  I do not know whether the list would ever get down to zero because there will always be a time gap between a referral being made and its being responded to.  However, we are confident that if we address those recruitment and retention issues within the investment that we have, we can get those unallocated cases down significantly.  We have introduced a further category of case which we are calling being actively worked on duty.  The duty team or intake team, which the committee has heard us mention a couple of times, is the team that deals with initial referrals.  Of the 5,000 cases Deputy Rabbitte mentioned, between 1,500 and 2,000 are being actively worked on and we have criteria to define what that means.  To that extent, I could argue that they are not unallocated.</p><p> The children in those may have more than one social worker visiting them, which I accept is not ideal, but there is not nothing happening with these cases.  People are monitoring, visiting and working to progress the safety plans.  If one took that 2,000 as a separate category, then the figure of 5,000 unallocated cases would come down to 3,000.  Therefore, we are already beginning to make inroads into that.  There has been some recent evidence that the number of unallocated cases was beginning to go up after about two and a half years of constant reduction and we are trying to diagnose the reason for that.  It is in the context of increased referrals, as I mentioned earlier, which means more business is coming in our front door.  However, we are considering how we prioritise these cases and, as I said, a significant proportion of them are being actively worked by a team rather than an individual social worker.  We have been slightly unkind to ourselves by calling them unallocated as they are being actively worked.  I am not trying to play silly with the figures, I am just trying to be absolutely clear and honest with you about the reality for some of those children's cases.</p></speech>

Technology in Tusla began from an extremely low starting point.  The infrastructure was not there.  Several of our areas are still largely paper-based with bespoke databases in operation.  However, I am pleased to report that we are making very significant progress in the rolling out of the national child care information system which will contribute to some of the issues we have been talking about today such as consistency of practice, sharing of information, ensuring that if a child moves from Dublin to Donegal, the information will follow him or her accurately and in a timely manner and so on.  We are making significant progress in rolling that out.  It is currently beginning to be rolled out to a number of areas.  Again, it is work in progress but our experience of undertaking a transformation reform programme of this scale is that one cannot pull it off in three years.  It takes a long time.  My colleague reminds me that the NCCIS is due to be fully functional by March 2018, approximately nine months away.  I am not sure if I have missed any other questions.</p></speech>

We hugely value the role of Atlantic Philanthropies, AP, Extern Ireland and various other organisations.  Mr. McBride mentioned initiatives he is trying to develop to consider more creative community solutions to see if young people who may currently be in residential care could be supported in a more robust way at home or in the community setting, and those organisations may have a role to play in that.  We have to be careful because a concern has been raised by the committee that Tusla not pass on its statutory responsibilities to other organisations.  Therefore, we still have to lead those interventions and a social worker or social care worker may still be needed to lead that intervention with the support of an advocacy group or others.</p></speech>

We want to make sure we are keeping grannies, grandads, uncles, aunts and so on wrapped around children as best we can to ensure effective safety and then bring in relevant services or otherwise to support those situations.  However, the people who see children on a day-to-day basis are the most important people for keeping children safe.  Services are really important but they do not tend to stay involved in children's lives indefinitely and therefore we must ensure that we are building effective safety around children by connecting them to the naturally-occurring networks around them.</p></speech>

The committee has had representations from Empowering Children in Care, EPIC, the ISPCC, the Irish Foster Care Association, IFCA, and the Children's Rights Allowance.  The gender balance is quite striking.  I want to make that observation today.</p> <p>  Is there clinical supervision of social workers?  I am not ignoring the children but I am ignoring the whole foundation of Tusla and its capabilities and competencies.  Is there clinical supervision?  Is it mandatory and regular or, as can happen when one is fire fighting, does it go onto the back burner?  Can the witnesses comment on the paucity of care received by six children sent outside the State to St. Andrew's in Newcastle where control and restraint techniques such as prone restraint that are banned in Ireland are regularly used.  There is also the over-use of antipsychotic medication, leading to physical illnesses, obesity and diabetes.</p><p>These children are sent there for specialist care.  Is there oversight of the care - or lack of it as appears to be the case - they are given in St. Andrew's hospital?  I would like a comment from the witnesses on that.  What level of communication is there between the children and their parents who are separated by countries?  </p><p> It must be a priority for Tusla to provide 24-hour services in whatever shape that may be.  The Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, ISPCC, did a fairly indepth research on this area.  It found that in the North, the Six Counties, there is a budget of &euro;4 million to provide 24-hour care, which includes phone contact and home visits.  Much of it can be dealt with over the phone and 15% of it requires home visits.  To think outside the box and about inter-agency actions, we need 24-hour mental health services.  Unfortunately, the reigning Government does not believe that or it fights against it.  Such interaction could serve communities and there could be community-based initiatives to develop mental health well-being hubs in our communities that would have child protection personnel, social workers and community staff who could answer questions and who would be able to provide the necessary mental health services.  We need the knitting of those supports more closely together to provide those services. </p><p> I do not know if it is possible but can we commission or ask for a report on Tusla's working environment?  I know we are examining what the priorities are.  Child-proofing society is an important tool that Tusla needs to develop.</p></speech>

Mr. McBride said that he is hopeful that the budget will provide for Tusla to deal with most of the unallocated cases.  Can he put a number, even a rough figure, on what net gain Tusla would require at the start of the year?</p></speech>

We have a target recruitment number of approximately 360 staff this year and a number of them would be social workers.  The point was also made that we need administration and support workers to free up social workers to do the work they need to do.  Some family support workers, social care workers and some of our management capacities would have a contribution to make within that as well.  That is the overall figure we are trying to recruit this year.  It is an ambitious target but we are making some progress towards meeting that figure.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that Mr. Cormac Quinlan dealt with the aspect that if there was an issue of people leaving it the very last minute that it would be dealt with.  Is Mr. McBride confident that this is not an issue?</p> <p>  Mr. McBride dealt with the issue in respect of  Five Rivers Fostering.  Will he agree it is unacceptable that it is in a position to turn away people which it considers are difficult and, consequently, those people end up in Garda stations?</p> <p>  With regard to the recommendations of the Shannon report, and many of which apply to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but of those which relate to Tusla, would Tusla be satisfied to implement them?</p></speech>

As it is the subject of a commission of inquiry, I will not say too much about it other than that I spent a long time during the past year of so on many occasions trying to get clarification about the specific identification of the staff mentioned in that report in order to discover whether they were still working for us and whether we needed to do anything about it.  It was only relatively recently that we managed to get the identification of these people and we have implemented appropriate and proportionate human resources processes.  I will not say any more than that given that the inquiry is ongoing.</p> <p>  The answer to the question about clinical supervision is "Yes", we have a supervision policy.  We would expect front-line practitioners and the different levels in the system to receive supervision on a regular basis in terms of looking at the practice and helping them to reflect.  The science of a safety model is fundamentally based on clinical supervision, not only on a one-to-one with the supervisor but also in groups.  There is a policy in place around that and my answer to that question is "Yes".</p> <p>  Senator Devine mentioned well-being in terms of the community and having local hubs.  My colleague can say something about that but we are currently trying to develop our own therapeutic services.  Again, we are still largely reliant on the HSE for services such as psychology services, which are still fairly thin on the ground.  We are trying to develop our own therapeutic teams on a local basis in terms of looking at the children who have been sexually abused, children who are potentially exhibiting sexually dangerous behaviour as well as other youngsters who require therapeutic support, not only psychology services or psychiatry services, but other forms of therapeutic input to help them to recover from abuse and neglect.  That is a work in progress and I welcome the support around that.</p> <p>  In regard to the Acting Chairman's question about Five Rivers Fostering and its refusal on occasion to take in a young person, our carers can refuse to take a young person as well.  A foster carer cannot be obliged to take a difficult youngster who is completely out of control on alcohol or substances.  If there are other children, especially younger ones, in that foster placement, it would not be appropriate for a youngster in that condition to go into that foster home.</p></speech>

The point at issue is that these children are ending up in Garda stations as opposed to anywhere else.  Obviously, it is not appropriate for them to be placed with a family against their will.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-21a.150" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fred McBride" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017062100002#P01100"><p>We certainly do not want youngsters to be inappropriately placed in a Garda station.  If it was children who were completely out of control, I might well want them to be in a Garda station or a hospital, if they were full of alcohol and drugs, as I would want the hospital to have a look at them to see whether they were okay before placing them anywhere.  These occasions are relatively few and far between, and in most instances where the Garda invokes a section 12 and we decide that the youngster needs to be in care, a placement is found for them.  We are also increasing the number of emergency residential beds we have across the country in order to try to deal with those youngsters who would not be suitable for a foster placement but who may well be placed in a residential bed.  We are trying to increase that capacity.  I agree with the Acting Chairman's point that we do not expect the Garda to have to look after children all evening in a cell but, likewise, there are some situations where youngsters are so out of control that perhaps the Garda or a hospital needs to have a look at them.</p> <p>  A question was asked about the St. Andrew's facility which is located in Northampton.  Tusla has certainly reduced the number of children it sends there on care orders.  The vast majority of them are subject to mental health legislation and some are subject to both mental health legislation and care orders.  It is a mental health facility and where children in that facility are also subject to care orders as well as mental health legislation, we visit them on a regular basis.  They are subject to child care reviews and we try to facilitate parents to visit them wherever that is appropriate.</p></speech>

There is an absolute process involved.  We have psychiatric assessments, we are before the High Court and there is a whole process to be gone through.  It is not just Tusla making the decision to send a child out of State for a very specific treatment-----</p></speech>

I satisfied myself, as the chief operations officer, that the units that were subject to the equivalent of a "Prime Time" programme in the UK were not ones in which Irish children were placed.

I am also confident that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would bring to our attention any concerns they might have.  As I said previously, we have very good, strong liaison with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at a very senior level in the organisation so I would be very confident that they would bring those matters to our attention to have them addressed immediately.</p></speech>

It is building new services.  In Deputy Funchion's area a pilot project has commenced with a therapeutic, community-based team in partnership with strategic partners, namely a family resource centre and Tusla.  We have in place a psychologist and an array of therapists to meet the overall needs of children in our care or children who are known to our child protection services.  They can have assessments and engage in play therapy.  Deputy Funchion is more than welcome to meet those involved.  I can arrange for her to have an engagement with the local team if she so wishes to see the set up of that project, which we would like to replicate across the country.</p></speech>

The staff who were involved in the Grace case, going back a significant number of years, are facing into one of the most robust processes of a tribunal and they have a right to fair procedure and to put their case forward.  It would be ridiculous for us to make comment on this.  We have adopted a position that is grounded in legal advice.  We have been told by the tribunal that we cannot discuss these matters any further.  That is the basis upon which we have come before this committee.

I do not need a response from the witnesses but simply wish to pass on a point that was made to me by social workers.  They have told me that there are significant geographic gaps in terms of placements and consequently, children are placed quite significant distances from their families, which is difficult for them.  I do not need a response on that.  I am simply passing on that observation.  I thank all of the witnesses for their contributions.  It is important to stress that there are many children who have a very happy experience of the care system.  I would like to acknowledge the work of Tusla, front-line social workers and particularly foster carers, without whom the system would collapse.  I want to acknowledge that good work.  I am sure that the witnesses will accept that there is public expectation that we will hold Tusla to account and raise the questions that are occurring to many people on the street and highlight the issues about which our constituents are concerned.  This has been a useful engagement and we look forward to continuing our work with further hearings.  I thank the witnesses for their attendance and participation today.</p></speech>

Deputy Haughey will be needed in the Chamber for the next couple of hours so we understand that he must be excused.  I remind members to ensure that their mobile phones are switched off.  This is important as they cause serious problems for broadcasting, editorial and sound staff.  Today, we have an engagement with Mr. Gerry Kiely, Head of the European Commission's Representation in Ireland about the White Paper on the Future of Europe.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Kiely and Mr. Andy Klom to today's meeting.  The White Paper presented by the European Commission on 1 March sets out the possible paths for the future of Europe.  Europe faces many great challenges from globalisation, the impact of new technologies on society and jobs, security concerns and the rise of populism.  Of course, Ireland faces the challenge of the impact of Brexit and an EU without the UK.  The debate and engagement across the EU on what Union we all want in the future is very important.  This committee intends to engage with this subject in depth and hold a series of meetings after the summer to engage with citizens and organisations about what Ireland and Irish citizens would like to see.  It is very useful for us to look at the white paper and consider it in detail as a starting point.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite Mr. Kiely to make his opening statement following which we will hear questions from members.  I thank him for taking time out from his busy schedule to be here.</p></speech>

I want to cover the White Paper from the following perspectives - why now, what is in it and what comes next?</p> <p>  We are facing a new political reality across the European Union.  As members know, on Monday of this week, Brexit negotiations between the EU and the UK formally began in Brussels.  This is a key challenge for our continent as a whole.  Brexit poses a high degree of risk for Ireland politically and economically.  Elections in the Netherlands and France in recent months have seen the democratic majority decisively reject the far right offerings in favour of more centrist alternatives.  However, despite these democratic triumphs, it is imperative that we respond to and engage with the significant minorities across the European Union which feel disenfranchised and alienated by the political system.  There are a number of other elections due to take place across the EU in the months ahead - in Germany and Austria, for example - and similar challenges will have to be faced in each case, although all the evidence to date is that the far right challenge in these countries is waning.  However, with 27 member states, we will always have an election in some country in the near future so there is always the risk.  Even if the much-heralded great upsets that were predicted by the media did not materialise, it is important to deal with the factors that facilitated the rise in nationalistic, Eurosceptic, xenophobic and racist support</p> <p>  As members know, this year marks the 60th anniversary of the signature of the Treaties of Rome, which are the main building blocks of the European Union we know today.  To mark this, on 1 March, President Jean-Claude Juncker first presented the European Commission's White Paper on the future of Europe to MEPs at the European Parliament in Strasbourg.  Making the announcement, the President said that it was "time for a united Europe of 27 to shape a vision for its future".  That day, President Juncker encouraged all of us not only to look at what has been achieved in the 60 years since six European countries set up the European Communities but also to look at the reality of today's world and to think about how we want to move forward together.  It is not prompted by or a reaction to Brexit, as many have suggested.  It was under consideration and in preparation long before the UK referendum.  </p> <p>  In recent years the global environment has seen some dramatic shifts.  The EU's economy accounted for 26% of the world's GDP.  By 2030, it is forecasted to account for less than 20%.  On the other hand, China's share of the world's GDP tripled between 2004 and 2015.  While the euro is a currency with global weight, other players are increasing in strength.  Europe will be the "oldest" - if I may used that word - region in the world by 2030 with an average age of 45, which will, of course, have an impact on social welfare systems, health systems, the labour force, etc.  In 1900, Europe accounted for 25% of the global population.  By 2060, it will account for 4%.  </p> <p>  In respect of global stability, the EU continues to have considerable soft power but this is not enough as we are confronted by an increasingly uncertain and aggressive world.  The US spends &euro;500 billion on defence, a figure that is set to double by 2045, while the combined spend by the EU member states comes to &euro;200 billion.  This is compounded by the reality that the efficiency of EU spending is only 12% to 15% of that of US.  China's expenditure on defence is expected to increase more than fivefold by 2045.  Global stability is also a function of development aid where the EU is already the largest donor in the world.  It is also a function of the fight against climate change so it is not just about defence.  However, defence is important.  </p> <p>  Post-Brexit, it is clear that the EU must remain a source of resilience, stability and forward momentum for its 460 million citizens.  The world around us is changing at speed, from globalisation to the rise of populism, racism and xenophobia, as I mentioned earlier, to the impact of new technologies on society and jobs to security concerns.  While the increasingly digital nature of our society, for example, is having a positive impact, new technologies and digitisation also represent a challenge as traditional jobs are replaced.  Robots have arrived in the workplace and they are now common there.  Artificial intelligence is developing rapidly.  We have to ensure that technological developments benefit society at large and not just the few.  </p> <p>  The recent successive security threats throughout the EU have focused attention on borders and on the need for anti-terrorism co-operation.  They have also focused attention on the flows of refugees crossing the EU's borders.  The EU must continue to work collectively to reduce the negative threats we face while upholding our shared principles and values.  Climate change represents another serious risk to our habitats and societies; ultimately, to the future survival of the planet; and in the immediate term, as a driver of migration.  The EU will continue to be the driving force behind global action to deal with climate change - even more so now in view of President Trump's position regarding the Paris Agreement.</p><p>The challenges we face are many and it is clear that the EU cannot now afford a period of paralysis as it adapts to these new realities.  We have two options.  Either we let ourselves be swept along by global trends, or we look at them through the prism of opportunity and set about embracing and shaping them.  <br/><br/>Last month, the Juncker Commission reached the mid-way point in its five-year mandate.  Some 70% of the initiatives President Juncker pledged before taking office have already been launched, including in the areas of an energy union, a security union, the digital Single Market, the capital markets union, and of course additional initiatives under the umbrella of the economic and monetary union.  This Commission's clear objective from the outset was to improve the lives of EU citizens and to boost jobs and economic growth.  So far, the Commission has committed &euro;138 billion in new investment supporting more than 130,000 new jobs under the Juncker investment plan, formally the European Fund for Strategic Investments, EFSI.  This is in addition to all the other job creating funds such as structural funds, the CAP, research expenditure, etc.  Over 9 million young people are now in work, education or training because of the youth guarantee.  Economic reform and recovery has been prioritised.  The eurozone has now experienced 15 successive quarters of economic growth and the level of employment is higher than it was before the economic crisis, which one might find hard to believe considering the commentary on the poor state of the eurozone and EU economy.  Some 15 successive quarters of growth is not to be sneezed at.  The Paris climate agreement has been negotiated, signed and ratified, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2020.A European border and coast guard has been established and mobilised.  More than &euro;15 billion has been made available to deal with the refugee crisis, to tackle root causes, save lives, manage our borders and provide humanitarian support.  The EU-Canada comprehensive economic and trade agreement, CETA, has been agreed.  These are only examples of major decisions that have been brought forward by the Commission on top of all its regular, routine work.<br/><br/>There is also the question of trust and legitimacy.  For too long, there has been a gap between what people expect of the EU and what the EU is able to deliver.  This vacuum is oxygen to populists and those bent on discrediting the EU and member state governments.  From the beginning of its mandate, this Commission pledged to focus on where it can deliver the most tangible results and to act only where effective EU action will make a concrete difference.  We also need to ensure that all member states make good on their commitments, in a nutshell that they do what they signed up to do.  That does not always happen.  British citizens are about to pay a high price for the policy of blaming Brussels and disowning commonly agreed decisions.  We need to make sure that we all take responsibility for our decisions, own them and communicate the reasons behind them.  Only then will trust in the EU and in member state governments improve again.  Brexit is not happening because there was a great campaign to get out but because 30 years of eurosceptical misinformation went unchallenged by the pro-EU camp in the UK.  Other countries should learn from this experience.  <br/><br/>Traditionally, attitudes towards the EU have been positive in Ireland.  The most recent Eurobarometer poll revealed that 77% of people in Ireland were optimistic about the future of the EU, the highest percentage across the EU.  What is more, Irish respondents, at 55%, were the most likely to have a positive image of the EU.  This view is reinforced by the Europe Day poll published in Ireland on 9 May, which showed that 88% of all adults asked agreed that Ireland should remain a part of the EU; 87% agreed that Ireland has benefitted from the EU; and the percentage of those who believed Ireland should leave the EU continues to decrease year on year and now stands at 16%.  This positive reaction should, however, never be taken for granted.  The EU must be constantly defended.<br/><br/>In respect of the White Paper, the issue is how do we put our best foot forward as an EU of 27 member states.  The European Commission's White Paper on the future of the EU sets out five possible futures for the EU.  In essence, it asks what kind of EU we want to have in 2025 and beyond.  These scenarios are not intended to be a prescriptive or an exhaustive list.  They outline a series of different paths the EU could follow, but are solely intended to get the debate out of the starting blocks.  In reality, the final scenario might not be among the five proposed here.  <br/><br/><b></b>Scenario 1 is that the EU carries on as it is doing and focuses on delivering its existing agenda of positive reform.  It is essentially business as usual.  Given the problems we have had, business as usual might be the best route.  Scenario 2 is that the EU returns to what may be called &quot;the Single Market and nothing but the Single Market&quot; as its focus.  I do not think there would be a majority in favour of having the EU purely as a trading bloc, although it certainly would have been the British preference, were they staying in.  Most countries see the EU as being much more than that.<br/><br/>Scenario 3 is that those who want to do more in certain areas move forward together, for example in defence and so on.  There has been some commentary and some concern expressed in Ireland and elsewhere about some countries moving forward and leaving the others behind.  In reality, this is enhanced co-operation, which we have today.  Ireland is not in Schengen.  A number of EU countries are not in the eurozone.  It is not much different from what we have today.  However, it is not something the European Commission would favour.  We would much prefer that everyone moves in the same direction at the same pace.<br/><br/>Scenario 4 is that the EU focuses on a smaller number of policy areas and acts more efficiently in these areas, in other words, the EU's resources are focused on a smaller number of areas.  The difficulty would be getting agreement among 28 member states as to what should be the key areas and where funding should be dropped.  It is not without its difficulties.  Scenario 5 is doing much more together, sharing more decision-making and resources across a wider range of areas.  Most pro-Europeans would favour this option.  However, although this is only my personal feeling, I would imagine that if it is too difficult to get agreement among 28 to move forward at the same pace, it is inevitable that many countries are not going to wait around for the slowest wagon in the convoy.  It will end up going back to scenario 3 whereby a number of countries move forward and the others join later.  <br/><br/>It is now up to all of us to make the choices which will determine what the EU looks like in 2025.  Some commentators and politicians have already been vocal on what scenario they would choose.  Interestingly, at a recent dialogue with Commissioner Andriukaitis in Dublin, 63% of participants voted in favour of scenario 5, doing more together or greater integration.  This is only the beginning of the process, however.  It is clear from successive polls in recent months that Irish people, in general, want to remain in the EU.  The question is what kind of EU do Irish people want to remain in for the future.<br/><br/>In terms of the next steps, having published the White Paper to kick off the discussion, the Commission is now in listening mode.  In addition to the White Paper itself, the Commission committed on 1 March to publish five reflection papers to look in more detail at the future of the EU's work in five key policy areas, namely, strengthening the social dimension of Europe, published on 26 April; harnessing globalisation, published on 10 May; deepening the economic and monetary union, published on 31 May; the future of Europe's defence, published on 7 June; and the future of European Union finances, to be published soon, possibly on 28 June.  These papers are intended as contributions to the debate.  In President Juncker's September 2017 state of the European Union speech, he will elaborate on these ideas, but it will only be in December 2017, at the European Council meeting of the EU's heads of state and government, that the first conclusions will hopefully be drawn.  The idea is that these first conclusions will form part of the debate leading up to the next European Parliament elections in 2019 and the formation of the next European Commission.  <br/><br/>Regarding discussion of the White Paper in Ireland, the European Commission's representation here will ensure a wide range of opportunities to engage with this debate between now and the summer of 2019.  As things stand, a number of visiting European Commissioners have committed to engaging with Irish people across the country on these issues in what we call citizens' dialogues.  During the past month alone, Commissioners Andriukaitis and Hogan addressed separate events in Dublin and Kilkenny and we are working on events in Donegal next month with first Vice-President Timmermans and Commissioner King in the context of the McGill summer school.  We will of course continue to engage closely with the joint Oireachtas committee and the Government during this process.</p><p> However, I see our role as being complementary to the efforts made by others and not the other way around.  The primary responsibility for consultation must rest with the elected representatives in Ireland whether they are at local, regional, national or EU level, and also NGOs and sectoral organisations.  The future shape of Europe has a big bearing on the citizens, many of whom are represented by NGOs be they sectoral, economic or non-economic.  These organisations should consider the subject as well and put forward their views.  </p><p> While my office is happy to represent and work closely with anybody here in Ireland, it is the Irish Government that must decide what direction the future of Europe should take.  Therefore, it is elected representatives who must lead the discussion here.</p><p> I thank the Chairman, ladies and gentlemen for their attention.  My colleagues and I are happy to listen to any comments.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-21a.177" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1399" speakername="Neale Richmond" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017062100002#C00300"><p>I welcome Mr. Kiely and Mr. Klom to the meeting.  They are always welcome guests here and in many other fora.</p> <p>  Mr. Kiely's paper is excellent and fascinating.  Much of its content points to a rosy future within Europe.  I wish to refer to the key problems that face Europe that he mentioned largely on pages 5 and 6 of his presentation.  These are key problems for the European Commission as much as it is for member state Governments and other European institutions.  If we do not start tackling these problems then everything in this worthwhile paper will be moot, and they are real and tangible efforts that will make a huge impact on people's lives.  The Chairman of this committee has mentioned the key line in Mr. Kiely's presentation, that the people of the UK are now reaping the problem of what years of Euro scepticism will lead to.   </p> <p>  When we look to combat Euro scepticism, whether domestically or on a wider plain, it needs to be led by the core institutions of the European Unions and, in turn, the European Commission.  Unfortunately, I do not think that the European Commission leads the way when it comes to selling Europe.  The European Commission is excellent at engaging, educating and providing a balanced point of view but there are legions of people who make their entire living and livelihood from attacking and blaming Europe.  They blame the concept and dream to such an extent that they blame Europe if the weather is too cloudy or hot.  We have not seen a spirited passionate response by Europe.</p> <p>  Over the past weekend I read some lovely tributes that were paid to the late Helmut Kohl after he passed away last week.  He was one of the giants of European politics.  He witnessed the recovery of war torn Germany and knew why Europe was so popular.  That generation of people is passing on and the future of Europe is now in the hands of my generation who take everything for granted.  For example, they take for granted free roaming for mobile phones that was announced last week.  They take the free movement of people across Europe for granted.  They take the right to work, the right to live and everything else for granted.  </p> <p>  I am sorry for picking on the office of the European Commission but the witnesses are here to discuss the White Paper and answer our queries.  The European Commission will say it has engaged and that its investment plan, or Juncker plan, will open up opportunities and lead to investment.  We need to see the European Commission take the lead.  The Commission must aggressively and simplistically sell Europe.  It must sell the dream.  Europe as we know it has lasted 60 years so it is time for Europe to be revitalised.  We cannot rely on pro-European lobbies to continue that work because they are dwindling and I know because I have worked in the area.  I spend my life going to pro-European meetings here.  Therefore, I know that the average age of the people who attend such meetings is 70 to 80 years of age.  They are Irish people who went to Brussels in the late 1970s and during the 1980s as part of a wave of stagiaires and some of them were the first to undertake the first ERASMUS classes.  The next generation are taking all of these wonderful things for granted.  The passion and enthusiasm we see for Europe no longer comes from Germany, Ireland and France but from countries that want to be part of Europe such as the Ukraine, Serbia and the opposition movements in Turkey.  They are the people who are selling Europe.  If Europe does not start to sell itself then the White Paper on the Future of Europe and 60 years of outstanding work will be for nothing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-21a.178" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017062100002#C00400"><p>I thank our guests for attending today.  The presentation on the White Paper has been interesting and timely.  As Senator Richmond has said, it is time that we in Europe analysed ourselves in a critical way.  We must determine whether we, as Europeans, are all travelling in the same direction.  Like him I have reached the conclusion that we have not all travelled in the same direction for some years.  It is interesting that there is a higher level of satisfaction with the European Union in Ireland than in most other European countries and a higher level of Irish people wish to stay in the European Union.  I would have thought that whether or which would never arise.  I would have thought that, in comparison with the scenario that Senator Richmond has referred to, there could be no doubt in anybody's mind as to where Europe should be and where it should be in the future.</p> <p>  We, as Europeans, are the victims of our own success.  Together, we have managed to achieve a great deal by being single-minded, objective and following a consistent pattern over the years but now we take that for granted.  I agree with the Senator that we take all of our achievements for granted.  Sadly, there is a price to be paid when something is taken for granted and there is danger that complacency will set in.  People will try to re-invent Europe and improve its shape.  Such attempts have happened many times in the past but without success.  I agree with the Senator that we have reached an important juncture.  We must consolidate a peaceful Europe and one that is consistent with its objectives.  We need a stable Europe.  Any element that disappears from that scenario will leave Europe vulnerable.</p> <p>  The White Paper contains very interesting points, in particular the five scenarios.  We may move towards what some people have referred to as greater integration.  We are not great supporters of federalism in this country and I do not think we need to be.  There is no reason to presume that the European member states cannot proceed as they did in the past provided they recognise each other's existence.  </p> <p>  As I have criticised in the past, a chasm has allegedly grown between individual member states and the European institutions.  Is it a reality or just in our minds?  Have we grown apart?  On the one hand, there is the Commission and, on the other hand, there are the member states and the Council.  To what extent are we prepared to look at ourselves in a critical way and decide that we must think as one?  Individual member states thinking as one is key.  This aspect will dominate European politics for the next 50 years.  Failure to do so will also dominate.  If we make one wrong decision and go in the wrong direction then generations of people will pay.</p> <p>  I realise that the age profile of the Irish population differs from that of other European member states.  We have a larger tranche of young people than most other European states with the possible exception of Romania and maybe one of the newer member states.  </p> <p>  We must identify, isolate and deal with the contentious issues that have arisen throughout Europe over the past five years.  As long as we have people in individual member states holding certain views and being critical of the European institutions, and critical of their colleagues in the Union or members of the Union, then there will be no unity of purpose.  If we do not have a unity of purpose then we do not have a Europe that we expect to rely on in the future.  It is the type of Europe that we will need to rely on to a greater extend in the future.</p> <p>  I believe that it is still within the capacity of the European member states to identify issues collectively and individually.  I urge member states to put their differences to one side and avoid going in different directions.  As Mr. Kiely has said, all of these directions have been tried before without success.  It is like getting advice from a bad adviser.  There is no sense taking advice from a bad adviser if one can say to him or her that the policy or policies have failed before or did not go anywhere.</p><p> Ireland faces a double challenge in that we also have Brexit.  There has been much speculation on the dreaded challenge of Brexit and the damaging impact it could have on this country.  We are looking at Brexit from the wrong vantage point.  We intend to remain a member of the European Union and we need to expect the highest possible delivery from the EU.  Becoming pessimistic and suggesting there are pitfalls and traps all over the place is damaging our bargaining capacity.  We must expect the greatest and the best, nothing less.  When we make statements that we will do the best we can or try to secure the best deal we can, what message does it send out to those with whom we are negotiating?  It sends a message of doubt.  As the Chairman and I know from our respective constituencies, raising a question about one's own ability to achieve the best outcome is not a good bargaining position. </p><p> There are two issues.  We need to achieve the best outcome in the Brexit negotiations, namely, what we have, we hold and in respect of the review arising from the White Paper or otherwise, we need to bring the sides together in order that those at the centre of Europe who are making decisions reflect the views of people on the ground, as opposed to those of the most extreme groups.</p></speech>

I am sorry I missed much of the presentation.  I was caught in the Seanad Chamber where I was in the Chair.  Their contribution is very interesting and deals with the White Paper on the future of the European Union.  As Deputy Durkan stated, much of this is about bringing people together.  Some recent remarks I read are a cause for concern.  Do the larger countries in the EU plan to work together to bring about tax harmonisation?  I have in mind our corporation tax and so forth.  If that were the case, it could be disastrous for Ireland, although we have a veto.  Perhaps the witnesses will comment on what they believe is happening in this regard.  Is the Department of Finance concerned that there may be moves afoot on this issue?</p> <p>  While Brexit is not specifically on the agenda for our discussion, I am pleased the negotiations have started well.  When will we reach the point where the United Kingdom will be inclined to relent?  One cannot adopt a hard and fast position in negotiations.  I am concerned about the Single Market and customs union.  When will the crunch stage be reached in the negotiations on Brexit?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-21a.181" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1393" speakername="Terry Leyden" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017062100002#D00300"><p>I welcome Mr. Kiely and Mr. Klom and the members of the diplomatic corps and their staff, specifically the ambassador of Georgia.  While the White Paper is welcome, the outcome of the negotiations on Brexit will affect the outcome of the White Paper because much of the latter will depend on what happens on Brexit.  The negotiations have started well, however.</p> <p>  A delegation from the joint committee met the chief negotiator for the European Union in Malta.  We also met the chairperson of the European Parliament committee dealing with Brexit.  We received a very good response and I noted the great awareness of Ireland's unique position.  If our position is not taken into account, a deal will not be possible because we must secure an agreement that protects Irish citizens and trade. </p> <p>  I note the statement by the Chancellor of Exchequer that British people did not vote to reduce their income or standard of living but for another reason which will become clearer as the process develops.  We should now allow the negotiators to negotiate and the new Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, who has specific responsibility for Brexit, to get on with his job.  I welcome the clarity provided by this new role for the Minister as it will enable him to co-ordinate Ireland's response to Brexit with the new Taoiseach.</p> <p>  I heard a Tory member of parliament, Mr. John Redwood, interviewed by Se&aacute;n O'Rourke on Monday.  I was with John Redwood when we negotiated the Single European Act and he was an enthusiastic player at that point who engaged diligently in negotiations to ensure the UK secured the best possible deal in the Act.  He achieved that objective and Ireland co-operated fully in that regard.</p> <p>  The departure of the UK will be a major blow to the European Union, regardless of what outcome is achieved.  I would prefer if Britain remained inside the EU because the UK and Ireland have been very good partners and have worked together closely in the EU.  While we joined the European Union together, we will not leave together.  It is fascinating to hear different points of view expressed on the EU.  When British people realise what benefits they secured in the European Union since the 1970s, they will realise there is no benefit in disengaging from Europe.  High food and building standards, which are highly relevant today, are the result of membership of the European Union.  These standards were negotiated over a period and we embraced them.  Sometimes the European Union is blamed for excessive enforcement of regulations when it is Departments that are overactive in this regard.  As the Chairman will acknowledge, the regulations applied in agriculture and business are unreal.  These standards may be in excellent but I noted on a visit to Brussels at the weekend that the standards we must enforce here are not enforced there.  A disabled person, for example, would have great difficulty getting to a disabled toilet in Brussels.  Anyone building here must provide disabled toilets at significant cost, as they should.  It is interesting to note how forceful and diligent various Departments have been in transposing into Irish law, without major amendment, European Union regulations.  That said, we want to remain a member of the EU.</p> <p>  If and when the United Kingdom leaves the European Union, other countries, including Montenegro and Georgia, will enthusiastically apply for membership of the European Union.  As a country that supported Croatia, Estonia, Romania and other countries when they applied to join the EU, we will enthusiastically support and encourage other countries to join the EU.  We will co-operate in every way possible.  The next few years will be fascinating.</p> <p>  I am grateful that the European Commission has a presence in Dublin, although I would prefer if it were closer to Leinster House.  The witnesses could not do anything about that decision, however.  Perhaps it will return to a location more convenient to Leinster House in the not too distance future.  The European Commission office on Molesworth Street was a tremendous asset for Members of the Oireachtas to enable us to work with representatives of the Commission and Departments.</p></speech>

In recent years, people have made populist statements to the effect that Europe should go to hell because it is the cause of all our troubles.  This sentiment has been strengthening.  Senator Leyden touched on a point regarding standards.  In Spain, for example, construction workers wear sneakers and do not wear yellow high visibility vests.</p><p>There is no such thing as certified scaffolding.  The rules applied here are completely different from what happens in other parts of Europe and that gives the European model what we call a bad name.  I will give another example.  Whether it is HSE policy or the interpretation of rules and regulations from Europe, I always tell this story about a small shop that had three stools for people to sit on when they were collecting their pension on a Friday.  A HSE official called in one day and said the stools had to be removed because there was no public toilet in the place.  The shop could not be encouraging people to sit down if it did not have a toilet.  The person who owned the building did exactly what they were told and removed the stools.  The following week the elderly people were looking for the seats so they could sit on them while waiting to be picked up after collecting their pension, so the person brought out the stools.  There was another unofficial visit and subsequently the person received a letter telling them that there would be one more visit and if the stools were out in the shop the person would be fined &euro;3,000.  People in business see this type of thing happening and regardless of whether the policy or direction comes from Europe it is easy to give Europe the blame.<br/><br/>Equally, Senator Leyden rightly made a point about agriculture and how stringent the rules are for farmers.  If is not as if we all want a situation where there are no rules or regulations.  Recently, there was a suggestion about splash back slurry spreaders.  Everybody was encouraged to install slatted tanks.  If one has a slatted tank it means one has an effluent problem and one must get it out on the land at whatever time of the year one can.  Again, one is restricted in when one can put it out.  All of the farmers and the contractors have the splash back slurry spreaders.  There was a banner headline two weeks ago in the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i>on the possibility that they would be made illegal.  Instead, one would be required to have a dribbler system, which puts the slurry directly into the ground rather than spraying it into the air.  Of course, the issue was emissions, ammonia in the air and so forth.  There are several other ways in which that problem could be tackled.  For example, one could put charcoal dust into the tank.  That would improve the quality of the slurry, one could continue with splash back and one would not require this dribbler system, which is cost prohibitive.  Much of the terrain we have would not be suitable for the dribbler system as the system cannot be worked practically on the land.  Again, the blame for such situations rightly or wrongly falls back on Europe.<br/><br/>I believe that is what happened in the campaign for Brexit.  The politicians who were selling the divorce model and campaigning for leave got the media into a frenzy of enticing and encouraging people to vote for Brexit, which is exactly what happened.  I am not trying to say that the same thing could happen here in the future, but the concept of Europe getting a bad name stems from situations such as that.  It has been growing over the years.  Experienced politicians, such as the members here, who have been in politics for a long time have seen the growth of what you call populism in your White Paper.  It has grown, but it is because of things such as that.  It makes it easy for people who wish to promote the demise of the European model to sell it.  It is no mystery to me.  While I was dismayed and surprised with the vote for Brexit, but I was not shocked.  I saw the way the politicians were running their campaign and they sold it effectively, but what they sold was a pup.  We all know that.<br/><br/>Thank you very much, Mr. Kiely.  You are welcome to make summarising remarks if you wish.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-21a.184" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry Kiely" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017062100002#E00200"><p>I will be brief because everyone's comments were more or less on the same line.  On the rules and regulations, certainly there is a problem on occasion with countries or officials perhaps being over-enthusiastic in the interpretation and implementation.  Not long ago I attended an event at which many farmers were pulling their hair out about a particular inspector in the county.  Another bunch of them were saying that another fellow was all right.  There is even a problem with two inspectors under the same authority at local level, with people complaining about the application of the rule by one but not by the other.  We are dealing here with all sorts of diverse situations across 28 member states.  There certainly is a problem with the interpretation and implementation at local level.  I have always worked in agriculture and since Commissioner Hogan took office, although his predecessors did this as well, he has been pulling back the member states and telling them to use their heads and a certain degree of logic and pragmatism in implementing the rules.  There are also those who exaggerate and put the responsibility on Europe for something that is not Europe's responsibility but the member state's.  You spoke about the three tools.  I am sure that has nothing to do with us.  I cannot say that with 100% certainty, but 99% certainty.  The last big flood was two or three years ago.  Some politicians here tried to put the blame on Europe's environmental law, but that was not true.  It happens every day of the week across Europe.</p> <p>  To refer to the points made by Senator Richmond and Deputy Durkan, we and the European Commission counter it, but we do not have the resources spread across the EU or we do not have the access.  We are depending on the media.  If the media are negative towards the EU, as is the case across much of the media in Britain, it is a lost cause.  One cannot get the response in.  Also, the populist criticism of the EU is much more sexy and more likely to get coverage in the media than a dull, formal answer from the European Commission.  We are a civil service and we must answer in a formal way.  We cannot sex it up so it does not get covered as easily.  That is the reason I said earlier, in terms of selling the White Paper, that it comes back to national level.  The British are leaving because the pro-Europeans in Britain sat on their hands for 30 years.  They did not put their heads above the parapet and take on the eurosceptic criticism.  Their attitude was, "Why would I put my head in the firing line?  It doesn't matter and we don't care".  They know now that it does matter.  It affects them.  One cannot take it for granted that there will always be massive support for the EU in Ireland.  After all, we lost two referenda.  It can happen very easily.</p> <p>  Senator Richmond has left.  I am not saying in any way that the Commission is giving up.  In fact, we are reinforcing our resources and our approach to communication all the time.  However, that is in Brussels.  Much more must done at local level.  I take the point that peace and so forth is not so important to young people any more.  Much of the stuff that has come from the EU is taken for granted.  However, the younger people are more supportive of the EU than the older people.  Who voted to leave in Britain?  It was the older people, not the younger people.  If the younger people had voted in greater numbers, Britain would not be leaving.  There is no problem with younger people in the EU, even though they take all the things in it for granted and do not realise that they come from the EU.  To return to Deputy Durkan's point, we have to remind people about what is there.  It is not so easy.  Much of the social legislation in many of the countries would not be in place without the EU.  That is also the case with much of the environmental legislation.  People have to be reminded of that but it is very difficult to convey it to people.  Ultimately, one can only get it across to them face-to-face.  The media are not there to facilitate us getting a message out.</p><p>In many cases, it is a hard slog.</p><p> In terms of Brexit, it is not in our hands.  We do not know what Britain wants.  It will probably want something that cannot be given or that crosses the line of the four principles.  It keeps talking about the bill it faces from the EU being a punishment.  It is not a punishment, it is what Britain owes.  If good enough progress is made on the three main points to start out with, including the Border and so on, agreement may be possible.  Also, one sees inflation feeding into the system and more and more banks talking about moving their business.  Up to now, Britain has been in a nice situation.  It has gotten the benefit of a devaluation of sterling and has not yet been hurt by Brexit.  However, it has not yet left the European Union.  It has gotten the benefit of a devaluation without the negative impact of Brexit but the devaluation is now having a negative impact as people get worried that there will be a hard Brexit and the British economy is slowing down.  All of these issues are helping to concentrate people's minds in Britain.  The British Government's expectations in regard to the exit deal they want will hopefully become more realistic and be something that can be met by the 27 EU member states.  However, the British Government has not helped itself by its rhetoric on this issue over the past six to 12 months.  Neither the European Union nor the European Commission want a hard Brexit but that will depend on what Britain is prepared to do.  We will negotiate and the EU is very clear and will be very clear.  The difficulty is we do not know what the British position is.</p><p> There was a mention of tax.  If countries want to harmonise their tax rates, that is no problem but it is their business.  Nobody can force Ireland or any other country to accept a tax regime.  It is national competence.  Ireland would have a veto on that.  Some countries may press ahead with it but I do not know if they will.  The common consolidated corporate tax base, CCTB, is on the table at the moment.  Ireland has some difficulties with it, as do some other countries.  I do not know where that is going to go.  However, there is nothing to stop individual countries agreeing to have a common tax regime.</p></speech>

The purpose of this morning's meeting is to discuss the impact of short-term lettings on Ireland's housing and rental market.  The meeting will consist of two sessions.  I welcome to our first session Mr. Richard Shakespeare and Dr. D&aacute;ith&iacute; Downey from Dublin City Council, and Mr. Earn&aacute;n &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh, Mr. Neil Maher, Mr. Andrew Harkin, Ms Niamh Drew and Mr. Eamonn Kelly from the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

Accompanying me are Mr. Eamonn Kelly, senior adviser in the forward planning unit; Ms Niamh Drew, assistant principal officer in the planning policy unit; and Mr. Andrew Harkin from the rental market and approved housing bodies, AHB, regulation unit in the Department.  Mr. Neil Maher, who was mentioned by the Chairman, is unable to attend today.</p> <p>  The strategy for the rental sector recognises the potential issue of significant numbers of properties being withdrawn from the long-term rental market, particularly in Dublin, for use as short-term tourism-related lettings and the negative impact of this on the supply and availability of residential rental accommodation.  The growing use of online platforms, such as Airbnb, may, if not adequately regulated, facilitate and encourage this trend.  The Department recognises that home sharing, which involves people providing overnight and short-term accommodation in their own homes, can be an important source of income helping home sharers to meet the costs of mortgages, rents or other household expenses and hence support tenure security.  It also supports tourism and associated economic activity and even social and cultural exchange.  Home sharing where the dwelling involved is the permanent or long-term residence of a person or family does not reduce the number of residential units available in the housing system and the economy.  For this reason, planning regulations have traditionally recognised that home sharing and overnight guest accommodation is permissible in certain circumstances in houses but not apartments without a need to obtain planning permission.  </p> <p>  That said, however, the Department is concerned that the growing availability and use of online short-term letting platforms and the potential commercial opportunities they provide may encourage landlords who normally provide residential rental accommodation to tenants to seek to obtain higher returns by ceasing residential letting and moving to short-term letting to tourist and business traveller customers.  It may also encourage new investors to purchase residential units for short-term letting as an investment option, thereby reducing the number of residential units in the housing system.  Both of these scenarios involve residential properties being lost to the residential housing system, meaning that less long term and secure accommodation will be available to the growing numbers of families and people who need it.  The social and economic impacts of difficulties in accessing accommodation are significant and will not be compensated for by other economic benefits of the shift of residential units into short-term letting.</p> <p>  The Department is also concerned that the ability to use online platforms may facilitate or promote the use of housing units in multi-unit residential developments, such as apartments, for bed-and-breakfast accommodation contrary to the provisions of the Planning Acts and create planning enforcement difficulties for planning authorities.  Generally, under the planning code, all development, including a material change of use, requires planning permission unless exempted under the Act or associated regulations. However, there is a specific exemption in Article 10(4) of the regulations which provides that within certain limitations or restrictions, development consisting of the use of a house for overnight guest accommodation is exempted development and, therefore, does not require planning permission.  Apartments, however, do not benefit from this exemption.</p><p>Where there is a question as to what in any given case is or is not development, or is or is not exempted development, anybody can request a declaration under section 5 of the Act from the relevant planning authority, or from An Bord Plean&aacute;la on referral.  When considering such a section 5 referral in a particular case last year, An Bord Plean&aacute;la determined that planning permission is required for the exclusive use of a residential apartment for short-term holiday lettings.  The implications of this case raised a number of other regulatory and related issues, such as consumer protection, tax liability, residential tenancy regulation, support for tourism, and planning.  Subsequent to that decision, the Department issued a circular on 22 December 2016 to bring this determination to the attention of planning authorities to ensure they were aware of the grounds on which the board reached its decision; the planning implications in terms of the requirement for such commercial use of residential units to be the subject of an application for planning permission; and the importance of a proactive approach to planning enforcement generally in this regard.  The circular stated that planning authorities should take appropriate enforcement action under the planning code where it is brought to their attention that a particular property may be being used exclusively for short-term letting.</p><p> In order to address the unintended consequences of short-term lettings, particularly the withdrawal of supply from the residential rental market, the rental strategy committed to the establishment of a working group comprising representatives of relevant Departments, public bodies and wider interests in this area to provide full clarity on the appropriate regulation for management of short-term tourism related lettings, given the desired overall housing and rental policy objectives.  The first meeting of the working group took place last Wednesday, 14 June.  On foot of that meeting, it was agreed that the group will gather the available data to assess the scale of the issue; consider the approaches used in other jurisdictions; identify the areas in the country most at risk of negative impacts of short-term letting; and develop a clear policy approach based on housing priorities as outlined by the Government.  On that basis, a circular will be prepared for issue in the near future to provide guidance to planning authorities on how to ensure that residential rental supply is protected in areas where demand is high when considering planning applications for short-term lets.  The objective will be to limit the exclusive use of residential units for short-term letting, while facilitating those who are letting rooms in their own homes to do so, taking into account the specific issues associated with short-term letting in apartments and other issues such as standards and consumer protection.  The group will also assess whether further guidance or changes to the regulation are required. </p><p> In addition to establishing a working group to consider short-term lettings, the Department has been engaging with Airbnb over the last months with a view agreeing a memorandum of understanding, MoU.  While Airbnb is the most well-known and fastest growing operator in the sector, there are a number of other companies operating similar business models, such as Abode, Staycity, theKeyCollection and others.  In discussions with the Department, Airbnb has expressed its concern at the potential loss of supply to the residential rental sector and has shown a willingness to work with the Department to develop a collaborative agreement.  Discussions in this context are ongoing and, if successfully concluded, are intended to form the basis for putting similar arrangements in place with other online platforms.  The Department&rsquo;s joint commitment with Airbnb is to co-develop protocols and processes that encourage and facilitate home sharing while preventing unwelcome and unauthorised commercial rentals being advertised on the Airbnb platform.  However, any MoU that may be agreed shall be in addition to requirements under the planning code.  In this regard, it will not remove the obligation to obtain planning permission, as required, nor will it prohibit the reliance on an existing planning exemption, as appropriate, or the ability to seek clarification from the relevant planning authority as to whether planning permission is required. </p><p> I have tried to give an overview of the complex area that is short-term lettings and the Department's approach to it, and provide the committee with an update on developments, considerations and progress to date.  I understand that Dublin City Council has some more quantitative information that will be useful for our discussion.  My colleagues and I will be happy to take any questions. </p></speech>

I introduce my colleague, Dr. D&aacute;ith&iacute; Downey, head of housing policy in the housing department of Dublin City Council, DCC.</p> <p>  It is not clear what definition of "short-term lettings" the joint committee is using, or what impacts it wishes to consider.  In preparing this response, I have assumed that the committee is primarily interested in lettings of less than six months' duration and that its primary concern is the potential adverse impact, if any, of developments in the short-term lettings market on the availability of more traditional lettings which could meet the longer term housing needs of households.  Finally, I have presumed that the committee is interested in the question of whether there is a need for greater regulatory control of the short-term letting market.</p> <p>  It is important to state at the outset that short-term lettings are an important part of any properly functioning housing and rental market.  The availability of these lettings fulfils a key role in meeting particular accommodation demand.  There has always been a market for short-term lettings in Ireland and especially in the main urban centres.  The short-term lettings market operates as an important secondary element in a properly functioning accommodation system.  In Dublin, this market segment includes hotels and developments in which short-stay arrangements in self-contained residential accommodation are regularly available.  Such accommodation is required to meet the demand for short-stay residential space in Dublin for personal, work, study, business and tourism reasons.  It is important that Dublin's growing demand for such accommodation is met by a responsive, flexible and quality supply.  Dublin city&rsquo;s development plan for 2016 to 2021, therefore, includes policy objectives for the appropriate planning and development of short-stay accommodation in its various forms including new "apart-hotel" provision.</p> <p>  It is clear that the recent phenomenon of Internet-hosted data-centric technologies has disrupted the traditional business model for short-term lettings.  This is part of the new collaborative economy with peer-to-peer platforms for the listing, discovery and booking of short-stay residential accommodation.  This has created a new marketplace for an additional form of lodging or accommodation that includes options to use shared space in private residential accommodation, both rental and owner occupied, and also allows users to share and sell residential space of their own or to provide access to shared residential space.  The global market leader in online platforms for sharing and selling space in private residential accommodation is Airbnb.  It acts as an intermediary between consumers and producers to reduce the risk and cost of offering a home as a short-term letting, which enables suppliers, primarily home owners, to participate in the commercial market for short-term residential accommodation.  Airbnb reduces transaction costs for both consumers and producers and provides a feedback and reputation mechanism that allows for a safer and more streamlined transaction.</p> <p>  Dublin City Council has undertaken some preliminary research on the extent of Airbnb activity in Dublin, which was presented to a meeting of the council&rsquo;s housing strategic policy committee on 10 March 2017.  A copy of that presentation has been circulated to the joint committee.  The available data suggests that a total of 6,729 listings exist on Airbnb for all of Dublin, with 5,377 listings located within the Dublin City Council area.  Of these, 50% are listings for "entire houses or apartments only".  It has been suggested that the development of Airbnb and other similar platforms is having a serious adverse effect on the supply of properties available to meet the longer term housing needs of households.  It is not clear that this is necessarily the case for the following reasons: First, Dublin City has 211,591 occupied housing units according to census 2016.  They comprise 105,273 households in owner occupation - roughly 50% - and 62,865 households in private rental - 30% - with the balance being a combination of social, rental and other living arrangements.  This compares with just 5,377 listings on Airbnb for rooms and-or entire apartments or houses in Dublin city.  Second, it is likely that Airbnb and similar platforms have, at least to some extent, displaced more traditional approaches to managing short-term lettings.</p><p>Third, a particular strength of Airbnb and similar platforms is they facilitate short-term letting of vacant rooms in a very efficient manner.  It is possible that prior to the availability of these platforms, property owners would not have considered renting spare rooms to the same extent.  Airbnb also facilitates very short-term letting of entire apartments or houses while an owner is away on holidays, for example.  This contributes to a more efficient housing market and has no adverse effect on the availability of properties to meet the longer term housing needs of households as in the absence of an Airbnb-type platform, the property would simply remain vacant until the owner returns.  Short-term letting where the dwelling involved is the permanent or long-term residence of a person or family does not therefore reduce the number of residential units available in the economy.  Home sharing or the letting of a room or rooms within a home can be an important source of income, helping home sharers to meet the cost of mortgages, rent or other household expenses.  This can support their tenure security.  It also supports tourism and associated economic activity, and even social and cultural exchange.</p><p> Despite the significant market efficiency gains associated with Airbnb and other sharing platforms in the use of otherwise under-utilised residential space and the ability it gives home owners to generate revenue, there are concerns about the economic and welfare effects of the operation of these platforms on the residential housing market.  These can be broadly grouped into the following areas.  These are impact on housing affordability in local rental and home ownership markets; the production of negative externalities or adverse impacts on local neighbourhoods associated with too high a concentration of short-term letting activity; and the emergence of a shadow lodging sector, where providers may evade compliance with established regulations and taxation.</p><p> Available evidence tends to suggest Airbnb activity has a high impact on the vacancy and occupancy rates in residential housing in particular neighbourhoods but a more marginal effect on prices.  Airbnb has also allowed home owners in residential areas outside the city centre tourist areas to participate in the tourism accommodation market.  This is an important feature of Airbnb activity in Dublin that has allowed for short-term lettings in suburban locations not immediately associated with tourism.  The local effects of Airbnb and other platforms on house prices, rents, neighbourhood livability and economy, and the consequences for incumbent businesses and residents, are important empirical questions.  Currently there is limited available evidence upon which decision makers and the public can rely.  Dublin City Council is committed to undertaking further research into these matters in 2017 and we will work directly with Airbnb to undertake a survey on attitudes and opinions among service users in Dublin.  We have also engaged consultants to undertake an economic analysis of the scope and scale of the collaborative economy accommodation market in Dublin.</p><p> Dublin City Council is a member of the recently established working group on short-term lettings, which is chaired by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  This group aims to provide clarity on the appropriate regulatory approach from a planning perspective for short-term lettings to address unintended adverse consequences of these lettings.  The group is expected to report in the third quarter of 2017.</p></speech>

Both of the papers before us are very interesting.  I will make a few comments, if I may, before getting into the detail of the questions.  I read all the submissions before us today and there is a certain trend running through them.  There is basically a need for some regulatory control for the very short-term lets.  In every submission we have received, people speak of regulatory control.  There is a need for quality and standards in accommodation.  We must be realistic and responsive to demand; we should be honest and realise that Airbnb works because there is a demand for it.  There has always been a demand in cities for short-term letting, which serves a purpose, stimulating economic activity and tourism.  It is good that there are spin-offs for people in the short term with regard to the buying of commodities and goods in the cities.  There are many benefits, which is very important.  There are short-term lets in any city, which is important.  We do not want any stagnation in the city and we want it enlivened by a cross-section of people and different traditions and backgrounds.  This feeds into a very positive living city, which is important for Dublin, which has made great in-roads in that regard.  I am singling out Dublin for a moment as Dublin City Council produced one of the documents.</p> <p>  We must be responsive to the realities on the ground and the demands that exist for accommodation.  We should not get hung up on the word "Airbnb" as there are many other portals and ways to book short-term accommodation.  That relates to a flaw as the Department mentions a memorandum of understanding.  There are more people out there who we do not know about or quantify who may engage in very short lets.  Perhaps there should be a memorandum of understanding with the sector, which requires public consultation and engagement in a broad sense with the sector, or at least in as much as we can make contact with the sector.  That is a difficulty in itself.  There must be flexibility in that respect.</p> <p>  We can set a context.  In October 2016, An Bord Plean&aacute;la made a significant decision on short-term lettings.  That decision arose, as we know, from a section 5 declaration that went to the board and not the council, seeking clarification relating to a matter pertaining to a property in Temple Bar.  It is worth noting what the board stated, as it is important.  Anybody can seek a section 5 declaration, as witnesses know.  The board decided the use of the entire residential apartment on a year-round basis for a series of short-term holiday lettings constituted a change in use.  It stated such a change of use raised planning considerations that are materially different from the planning considerations relating to the normal use of residential apartments and the change of use is material, constituting development under the Planning and Development Act 2000 as amended.  Finally, the board indicated the development was not exempt and therefore required planning permission.  That is the basis on which we work as it is what the independent planning board stated.</p> <p>  Going through the submissions, there is a concern that people comply with planning, health and safety issues, general regulations to do with tenancy and taxation.  These are underlying issues, although we must be very careful with our remit.  There is also the issue of the shadow lodging sector and people evading compliance with regulations, rules or taxation.  We must also draw a reference to Dublin City Council, whose development plan goes from 2016 to 2021.  Perhaps it will share any specific objectives in the county development plan that preclude some of what we are discussing.  Is there room for change and should there be change?  I know that is more a planning than housing issue.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions.  Mr. Shakespeare mentioned a consultant and that work will be really interesting.  There is a lack of hard factual evidence that we, as policymakers, can rely on.  There is much anecdotal evidence.  I took the time yesterday to examine what is happening in Barcelona, London and Madrid.  Airbnb is nothing new and it is all over the world.  There are regulations and caps in London, for example, on the amount of nights one can stay.  There are imaginative ways to deal with this.  When does Mr. Shakespeare envisage the report he mentioned will be completed?  It would be very beneficial for us to look at that at another time.  The personnel from the Department mentioned a memorandum of understanding with a particular named group - Airbnb - but that is not good enough and it will not capture all we want, with all due respect.  There must be a bigger engagement with the sector.</p> <p>  The witnesses both touched on the reality that due to the financial crash and other matters, many people are renting rooms in private homes to supplement or pay their mortgages.  They would be on the street if they did not do it.  It is a reality we must recognise and acknowledge.</p><p>There are many people engaged in Airbnb who need that income to pay their mortgages and keep a roof over their heads.  It is a complex issue.  In terms of the reports to date on this issue, there is a lack of detailed, hard, factual evidence that policymakers need to make policy.</p></speech>

At the outset, I would like to declare that I am tourism service provider in the Wicklow area.  As such, I have an understanding of the importance of Airbnb and other platforms to the tourism industry.  They are a vital part of the industry.</p> <p>  In terms of this discussion, we need to focus on the impact of short-term lettings on the housing crisis.  In this regard, we need to drill down into the statistics on short lettings to determine the number of short-term lettings of premises on an almost full-time basis.  No one has an issue with people letting out a room in their own house or letting out their home for a time when they are on holidays as neither of these practices has an influence on the housing crisis.  What is having an impact on the housing crisis is owners of multiple properties letting their properties on a short-term basis throughout the year.  What work is being undertaken by Dublin City Council or the Department to determine what proportion of the 6,700 apartments or houses in Dublin are being let on a short-term basis over a lengthy timeframe?  That is where we need to focus our attention, including from a planning and Revenue point of view.</p> <p>  It was mentioned earlier that the Department is looking at how other countries are dealing with this issue.  We are all aware of the measures that have been introduced in London, Berlin, New York and Barcelona.  In terms of the figures presented today, there is a significant increase in Airbnb and short-term letting in the tourism hotspots.  According to the figures, 5,700 properties are based mainly in the Dublin city area.  From the witnesses' point of view, how can we get to where I believe we need to be from a housing crisis point of view?  As I said, there are other issues involved in terms of planning and Revenue, but in terms of the committee's focus today, the housing crisis, we need to get to the people who are letting their properties on a short-term basis over a lengthy timeframe.</p></speech>

We are conscious, as I am sure is Dublin City Council, the remit of which, in terms of the Dublin area, is broader than that of the Department, of the balance to be met between the economic benefits of short-term letting in terms of broader economic issues and the tourism sector and the potential negative impacts on housing.  As I said, these are not substitutes for each other.  In other words, the benefits that derive from a more vibrant tourism economy do not necessarily accrue to people who lose out arising from problems in the housing sector.</p> <p>  I agree that the problem is not limited to Airbnb.  I listed a few of the other providers.  There are more.  I have heard there are up to 15 online providers.  There are also a number of providers that are not online and have been operating in this area for some time.  In regard to the memorandum of understanding, MOU, it is not the Department's strategy for dealing with this issue.  It has come about because of the willingness and the desire of Airbnb to engage on this issue because it acknowledges the problem arising has implications for its operations.  We are engaging with Airbnb.  If we do reach an agreement with it, we will use that as a basis for similar sorts of arrangements with other providers.  However, that is independent of the working group which is chaired by the Department.  It is examining the issue not from the point of agreements with individual providers but from the point of view of an overall regulatory framework and approach to planning for and management of the sector.</p> <p>  In terms of what is going on in other jurisdictions, this is currently the focus of the working group.  It is interesting to note what is happening in other places.  Mostly, this issue is dealt with city by city.  What the jurisdictions have opted to put in place varies according to their particular issues.  As stated by Deputy Casey, the reaction differs in areas where there are high levels of tourism versus areas where there are serious housing problems.  Typically, what we are seeing is registration of short-term rental providers.  Of the actual registration of hosts, multiple listings in many places are not permitted and listings that are not in the principal private residence are not permitted.  By "not permitted" I mean they require other approval.  They are considered to be commercial activity rather than short-term letting on a home-sharing basis.</p> <p>  Another issue is nights booked limits, which relates to the point about what is happening in London, and the licensing of the platforms.  In some jurisdictions, platforms such as Airbnb are licensed.  The manner in which they operate and the information they provide to planning authorities and government can be controlled through that licensing arrangement.  For example, in some jurisdictions Airbnb is only allowed to facilitate people who are registered providers or licensed providers.  In other jurisdictions, such as Barcelona, enforcement is very tough.  There is a huge effort there now to crack down on unlicensed provision.</p> <p>  The working group will be looking at all these issues.  At the end of the day, we need an approach that is driven from a policy perspective, the priority being protecting accommodation in the rental sector and the housing system, and based on data and evidence, although that evidence is not easy to collect.  As information is power, that information is not readily available.  The approach taken will also need to be specific to the specific context.  In other words, it will be different in practice and reality in Dublin from what it will be in a rural area.  I am sure Dublin City Council can provide some information on the question of what proportion of hosts are letting multiple properties as compared with those who are letting single properties.</p></speech>

The data in our presentation originate from an organisation called <i>insideairbnb.com</i>.  It describes itself as independent and non-commercial.  It allows a set of tools to be used online to explore activity on the Airbnb website.  The data in the presentation are a snapshot of listings for Dublin available as of February 2017.  There will be another data release pretty soon from <i>insideairbnb.com</i>.  A gentleman by the name of Murray Cox is the originator of <i>insideairbnb.com</i>.<br/><br/>The data show the level activity on the Airbnb website for the categories of listings that would suggest potentially short-term letting activity.  This distribution is shown on our PowerPoint presentation.  What is useful from the distribution maps is that it shows the geography of Airbnb activity in Dublin city.  One can see the concentration of accommodation offering in the city centre area attached to areas of cultural or other tourist activity.  We will be commissioning an independent study of the scale of the collaborative economy, including other platforms as well as Airbnb.  We will bring to bear several key questions, regarding not only the regulatory impact on planning development but also the impact on the overall dynamic of the housing market.  In particular, we will be examining the sometimes challenging spillover effects which can occur where there is a concentration of Airbnb activity in an area which may be pushing up the price of residential space in that area and whether that is having a negative impact on affordability issues in rental markets, as well as with house prices.  We are primarily concerned with trying to identify whether there is a significant adverse effect on the rental market in particular locales, given the affordability challenges present today in Dublin.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-21a.210" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017062100002#F00600"><p>I thank the delegations for their presentations.  I am not opposed to short-term home-sharing lettings as a kind of a tourism product.  Everyone is convinced of the merits of this.  However, when we talk about the collaborative economy, there is an attempt to present these business models as almost like the old co-operatives, like some kind of organic, folksy and nice way of doing business.  This is not what we are talking about.  Whether it is Amazon, Betfair, Betdaq, Uber or platforms like Airbnb, this is a new multi-billion euro business model that is beginning to take hold in a range of sectors of the economy.  It is about driving down costs, as well as avoiding or evading, within or without the law, existing regulations which govern traditional sectors of the economy.  These are all causing a whole host of regulatory difficulties for countries.  None of that is new to us.  We need to acknowledge there is something significant here with which we are trying to grapple.</p> <p>  The concern many of us have is not with the person who lets out the room or the house for a short time.  No one has any difficulty with that, so long as they pay their taxes, are regulated, etc.  Our concern is that the practice in other jurisdictions, from which we have more information than we have here, suggests there are commercial landlords using these platforms either to generate higher incomes or to avoid tax and regulations.  That is the nub of what we are trying to get at.</p> <p>  I am disappointed with Airbnb.  I met Airbnb in January and outlined the information I felt it needed to put in the public domain to demonstrate whether we have a problem.  What is clear from everything said today is that we just do not know if we have a problem because we do not have the data.  That is not the fault of anyone in this room today.  I set out clearly to Airbnb that if it wanted to demonstrate good faith to politicians and to statutory bodies, it should give us the information it has.  For example, how many units of accommodation are available to let for a year, for between six months and a year, for between three months and six?  How many units of accommodation are not the principal private dwellings of the owners?  We need to be putting pressure on Airbnb to give this information to either the working group or to put it into the public domain.  Until we have that, and while the independent study outlined by Dr. D&aacute;ith&iacute; Downey will be helpful in this regard, we are not going to know whether we have a problem and, if so, where it is situated and its impacts.</p> <p>  I am also frustrated at the Department.  I do not know whether this is the fault of the Minister or the Secretary General.  The Bord Plean&aacute;la decision was in October last year.  The circular to the local authorities was in December.  We were told by the Taoiseach and the Minister in January that a working group has been set up.  It only had its first meeting last week, however.  That is on the basis of the information we have been given today and the reply to a parliamentary question which I got late last night.</p> <p>  I am not trying to be antagonistic with anyone presenting to this committee.  However, given the level of pressure on the private rental market, particularly in Dublin, the level of the housing and homelessness crisis and the number of families being put out of rental accommodation because of notices to quit by buy-to-let landlords with distressed mortgages, there is a level of urgency with this.  It seems to me that, seven months on from the Bord Plean&aacute;la decision, no one is taking this seriously.  I will say to the Minister and the Secretary General tomorrow that there is a level of urgency in this matter which cannot wait until September, October or November.</p> <p>  I am also concerned about talk of a memorandum of understanding.  It is self-regulation.  We know Airbnb in Barcelona, for example, was constantly flouting the law.  It has just been fined &euro;600,000 there for allowing 7,000 unregistered short-term lets on its platform of 16,000.  The idea of Airbnb talking nicely to us is what it does.  These are professionals and it is a big corporate organisation which has a particular business model.  I do not want to be singling it out but it is the one we know more about.  In addition to existing planning regulations being enforced, be it the local authorities and the circular, the Department is looking at drafting a memorandum of understanding and applying it to Airbnb and other platforms.  The experience from other European cities with high tourism product and high homelessness problems, however, is that self-regulation will not work.  Strong regulation in itself is not working in cities like Barcelona which has just doubled the number of inspectors it has.</p> <p>  I hope this committee sends a strong signal, which is taken back to the Secretary General and to the Minister, that we need regulation.  That regulation needs to be along the lines of what is operating in other jurisdictions, once we have the data to identify the scale of the problem which we may or may not have here.  That includes setting a number of days but also having a sufficient level of disincentive for people who break those rules and some formal regulation of the platforms themselves.</p> <p>  I know the Department is busy and there is significant pressure on it because of the housing and the homeless crisis.  Will officials tell us why it took so long to have the first meeting of that working group?  What is the timescale for finalising a report and bringing back proposals, whether to the Minister or the committee, for consideration?  Given the behaviour of some of the platforms, especially Airbnb in other jurisdictions, why does the Department believe a memorandum of understanding will be a useful tool rather than clear regulations?</p><p>I am interested to know if Dublin City Council has any data to show that there has been an increase in the total number of short-term lets, from the limited data it has been able to access.  There seems to be some census data to suggest that there has been some increase.  This is not just commercial landlords misusing such platforms to evade various kinds of regulation to make more profit.  Are we seeing an increase in the overall number?</p></speech>

The witnesses do not need me to tell them that we have a housing crisis.  There are many commercial factors contributing to that crisis, and undoubtedly this is one of them.  A decision was made by An Bord Plean&aacute;la seven months ago.  The Department says that it contacted local authorities and asked them to be vigilant and proactive on enforcement based on the decision made by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the reasons for it and the conditions associated with it.  It was said that the Department was issuing a circular in the coming weeks with a process by which to deal with future planning applications.  The Department is asking local authorities to be proactive on enforcement, but there seems to be no effort to correlate the information from these platforms to ascertain what properties are being used for this purpose, where they are and if they have the relevant planning permission to do so.  It is as simple as that.  The urgency that is needed and required across a wide range of areas in terms of how we deal with this crisis is not evident, and it certainly is not evident in this instance.</p><p>I have no issue with the information and data that Dublin City Council has.  I do not know where else it can be got.  Of the 6,729 units, how many of them were previously used for long-term lettings?  Can that be ascertained?  If they have been identified in this exercise, why are local authorities, which have the relevant expertise, resources, funds and personnel, not ascertaining what progress, if any, can be made?  Can the rule of law be enforced <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the Bord Plean&aacute;la decision?</p><p>The Government is trying its best to deal with this issue.  We are doing our best to try to inform it and push it in certain directions on other policy issues.  It can address this issue, but the least we expect is some form of urgency.  This crisis has been ongoing for the past three years.  In this instance the contributing factor is accepted.  I do not know if we necessarily need consultants to tell us the effect this is having on the rental sector.  When I hear the word &quot;consultants&quot; I think of time and money being wasted.  There is relevant, professional expertise within local authorities.  We expect that they are put there to do a job that they are able to do and can do what is set out in their contracts, which is to ascertain the information, make it available to the executive and allow the members and the executive to make a decision together to address the issue.  We do not have the time, space or money to wait on a consultant's report to tell us what is patently obvious to me and, I am sure, to many others.  Primarily, my focus of attention is on the Department and its focus and implementation of the decision that was made by An Bord Plean&aacute;la and how it is seeking to rectify that to regulate the industry.  The local authorities have the power within their own remit to do that.  We hear of memorandums of understanding with Airbnb while a working group that was promised by the Taoiseach last January on foot of a D&aacute;il question and that was to be put in place as soon as possible to deal with this issue has only met once.  It is not good enough, and whoever is responsible needs to own up to that fact, to apologise, and to put in place a means by which this will be addressed.  We do not need to be wasting our time on this issue any more than any other issue.  Just do it, go ahead with it and get it done.  Do not be annoying us about it.</p></speech>

It is secondary, but there is also a working group on receivership and the protection of tenants' rights through receivership processes involving their tenancies.  There is work ongoing with the Department of Health on the fair deal scheme and the possible mobilisation of vacant properties.  Those are only some of the issues on the supply side.  We have planned and sequenced our activities and we are where we are.</p> <p>  In terms of the timeframe, we would expect to have a new circular issued within quarter 3, and also the report of the working group.  It is not the case that we are only looking at the existing regulations and a memorandum of understanding approach.  In the working group we are looking at more guidance aimed at better enforcement and compliance with the existing system, but also potential changes to the regulation and possible legislation.  That goes to the point that was raised by Deputy Cowen in earlier questions about information.  The information is not really available.  There are multiple platforms with multiple players involved.  We could carry out surveys, but other jurisdictions use a registration process as the best way to gather information.  That is something we will consider, but we cannot just decide to do it.  For registration to be implemented, legislation will be required.  Equally, we can ask Airbnb to provide us with information, but we cannot require it to provide us with information if there is no legislative basis for it.  The question of data is something we are working on in the working group.  It will be dealt with in the report and we will see what changes to legislation are necessary or look at possible new legislation.</p> <p>  In terms of enforcement capacity, in Barcelona - the example Deputy &Oacute; Broin gave - the local authority doubled its on-the-street inspection team from 20 to 40 to look at and try to find properties.</p><p>If we are to do it-----</p></speech>

So far this year, we have had 23 complaints out of a total of 665 enforcement complaints, representing about 4% or 5% of what we have had.  They are investigated and followed through.  One of the big problems with the enforcement side of things is the fact that when one brings it to its logical conclusion and one is satisfied that an offence has been committed, there is a threshold of proof for criminal prosecution which can be difficult to get to.  We need to establish that burden of proof before we take a criminal prosecution.</p></speech>

I am conscious that the working group is in place and has not come back with its report yet, but I have concerns over An Bord Plean&aacute;la's decision.  I am concerned in turn about the likes of Airbnb and the need for a register.  Have Airbnb and other such companies been informed of An Bord Plean&aacute;la's decision?  Surely, the decision affects virtually every house.  When houses were being built and even up until now, it is not being taken into account that houses that are being built might need some kind of additional permission.  Has this been taken into account?  Have Airbnb and all similar companies been informed that they could be in breach as a result of some of the properties they are using?  I would love to know whether any action is to be taken on that.  I believe there needs to be a register and people need to be signed up.  The working group is probably looking at this idea.</p> <p>  I am also conscious that many people are renting out rooms in their own houses.  They have mortgages.  I do not think many of these people are registered or paying taxes on their rental income, etc.  They are just trying to clear mortgages.  Whether we like it or not, that is the reality on the ground.  If it is the case that there is a decision that states that one should have to apply for permission from An Bord Plean&aacute;la, many of these people are in breach in many ways.</p> <p>  I also wish to ask the witnesses about student accommodation.  We are seeing an awful lot of people getting permission to build student accommodation at present and there are huge numbers of applications.  Is there a means these people can use, an equivalent of Airbnb, during times when the student accommodation is not occupied?  Is this an avenue the working group is looking at?  I am not sure whether space is available in such accommodation.  I know that some of the student accommodation, particularly around DCU, with which I am more familiar, tends to be utilised during the off season as much as during term time, but there are cases in which it very much depends on the time of the year the college or otherwise is occupied.  I am curious as to whether there is any scope to look at this.  Are there pressure areas in the likes of Dublin City Council where these short-term lettings will have a huge impact?  Are the witnesses considering this idea where there might be a concentration of these companies coming in and trying to get short-term lettings in very high-demand spots?  If this is the case, it obviously has an impact on the likes of hotels because in many ways it is a way of undercutting hotels.  Is what the hotel is doing in breach of any legislation in terms of the process it must go through and Airbnb?  Other European countries are probably more familiar with this; we are probably relatively new to this compared to others.  I am curious about those questions.</p></speech>

My concern is that the local authority should be given some incentive to work with families.  Like the rest of us, I regularly deal with families who come into my clinic.  There are families who have room at home for their children to stay.  A person living in a local authority house who has family members who are homeless cannot take them in because if he or she tries do so, the rent goes up, he or she qualifies for nothing and there is no incentive.  Why not give families, if they have room, an incentive on a short-term basis.  When they are on the local authority housing list, the local authority is aware of it.  They should be given some kind of help so that they can stay in the family home.  At present there is no incentive for anyone to keep family members in the family home.  People go looking for somewhere, they get their full rent allowance and entitlements, and that is fine, but we have a shortage of houses.  I have been dealing with an elderly lady who had a daughter late in life.  She cannot even take her family in because they are telling her she will be over and could end up getting in trouble with the local authority.  The witnesses need to look at such cases, even in general and on a short-term basis.  I understand this cannot be done on a long-term basis but, while we have a crisis, surely common sense will prevail.  If a family member has a spare room, there should be some incentive for him or her to be able to keep a family member there for a few months or a year until the local authority can help them.  There is no help.</p><p>It is a serious issue.  We have a massive shortage of houses.  I get frightened when I hear of various working groups, surveys and so on.  People need to get themselves together.  Common sense is needed.  We need to give the local authorities the help they need, whether through introducing incentives or telling them they have, say, six or 12 months to try to do something.  There is nothing there.  That is why we are falling down.  Until we start to do things like that, the housing crisis is only going to get worse.  We talk about student accommodation.  My home town of Carlow is very much a student town.  We have two third level education entities.  I have looked for short-term accommodation for families but people will not accept rent allowance or the housing assistance payment.  Something needs to be done by local authorities.  If there was some incentive, even in the short term, it could provide a solution.  The witnesses might come back to me on that.</p></speech>

Has it driven them into the Airbnb market?  I am being told it has.  There has been a lot of criticism of landlords from many sectors, which they feel is unfair.  All through the bad times and the tough times, they made units available for social housing.  They feel they are being denied the ability to increase their rents because of this cap and so they are making their properties available for Airbnb rather than social housing.  Are there figures available that substantiate what I have been told?</p> <p>  Another issue regarding social housing and local authorities is where the Department still demands four layers of approval.  Local authorities can opt for fewer stages of approval - perhaps one or two - but there is a stipulation which hurts them in that if some extra cost arises, after they have signed up to the two layers of approval, they must foot the bill themselves and they do not have the funds to manage that.  The Department is being very unfair in this regard.</p> <p>  The third thing that is hurting many people, in particular people in the 50s, is the grant aid for the elderly is only available to people on reaching 65 or 66 years.</p></speech>

We do not know what is happening.  On the face of it, it appears there are a growing number of tenancies and of landlords registered with the RTB.  There is a lot of anecdotal evidence that people are moving.  I have certainly stayed in Airbnb accommodation which was clearly previously used for long-term tenancy.  We do not have the information.  We can look across at other jurisdictions and we can see that it has happened.  They have information and it is likely that it is happening here.

There is a considerable number of proposed developments for aparthotels and a number of companies have announced their intentions to develop property specifically for short-term rental.  I would return to my earlier comments that what we are looking at here is trying to identify the locales and areas where the concentration of peer-to-peer platform, collaborative economy rental for accommodation is having an impact on prices and whether that impact is negative or driving rental inflation and whether it is taking out of circulation or use properties that would otherwise be available for longer-term rental.</p></speech>

The question around what individual Airbnb hosts understand are planning requirements is very relevant and something we will look at.  Even in the discussions with Airbnb around the memorandum of understanding, if we get to a memorandum of understanding, the clarification of planning requirements for hosts, what is and what is not exempt and what permissions are required, will be one of the things that will be in it.</p> <p>  We have not looked at the use of student accommodation.</p></speech>

This time last year, we issued a circular to all local authorities suggesting that while we cannot control permissions that have already been granting but from now on, we have given recommendations to local authorities that they should consider tourist use during the summer in their grant permission.  That has already been issued and recommendations have already been given.

The procedure would be to come back and seek a change of use if it was not permitted previously.  Off hand, I do not know how much is potentially available during the summer because the way in which many of these have been built in the past has been using public private partnership between the university and an investor and they sell on the downtime, between the middle of May to September, quite heavily so I do not know how much of that would be available.</p><p>They sell quite heavily in the downtime between the middle of May and early September.

Fingal probably does not have an issue, with 500, and D&uacute;n Laoghaire is in a similar position with only 600.  In Dublin city, 5,400 properties are listed on Airbnb.  The magic number, that is when a person breaks the regulations and becomes liable for tax, is 90 days but 2,581 are available for 90 days or more.  Of them, 1,375 entire properties are available so there is an issue in Dublin city and it is causing a significant impact on the housing crisis and the short-term rental market.  We need to progress things more quickly than we are doing at the moment.  I do not believe there is such an impact outside Dublin city.</p></speech>

While there is no statutory requirement to give it the Department, the Department could be quite persuasive and tell Airbnb that it cannot have an MOU if it is not willing to provide data that are essential for understanding it.  The Department should do it because Airbnb does not want reputational damage and it could say it will not continue the conversation until it gives the data that will allow the Department to make reasonable policy recommendations to Government.</p></speech>

Mr. &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh said he was preparing another circular but what will happen?

Some may be circulated to members and other may not while some Departments get them while others do not.  There has been a long emphasis on circulars but how does the Department actively pursue them?  Does it get back to the chief executive after a month or two for a report on the implementation of a circular?  The Department knows what the board said in October 2016.</p> <p>  We do not have enough evidence for policy-making.  As Deputy Casey said, it seems to be a Dublin problem.  Maybe we should specifically look at Dublin.  I accept that Mr. Shakespeare is producing a report but we should look at this incrementally and look at Dublin specifically.

Specifically, we will ask local authorities to give feedback on whether there have been any impacts from rent pressure zones on the availability of HAP and RAS tenancies.</p> <p>  We did ask Airbnb for data.

Airbnb might not have all the data for which we are looking.  I believe members will have the opportunity to ask representatives of Airbnb itself.  Senator Boyhan spoke about circulars.

There are large areas of huge public concern where we have very detailed knowledge from our own experience of exactly what is happening on the ground.  This particular problem is not one of them.  Our knowledge of Airbnb is secondary.  We welcome the opportunity to address the committee.  We assume the committee is asking us, as it tries to grapple with this issue, to put it in context.  That is where we think we may be able to contribute.  We are not able to bring any of our own statistics or figures on it.  The research, which I hope is useful, is secondary research we have done on the issue.  I do not think the committee needs me to spend time telling it how many individuals and families are homeless.  It is the context in which we are working.  What Focus Ireland can bring to it is our own research.  Every quarter we do a detailed survey of every family that became homeless in a particular month.  We phone them up and ask them about not only the immediate cause of their homelessness but their trajectory into homelessness.  If we ask families why they became homeless, we end up with a very large number of people who say it was because of family breakdown.  If we ask them what happened before that, we find that a very large number were living in the private rented sector.  Things went wrong and they went to live with wider family for a period of time and when that broke down they ended up in homeless services.  To really understand what is happening, we have to see that these families previously lived in the private rented sector rather than looking at the last place they lived in.  Overwhelmingly the families that are in emergency accommodation had their last secure home in the private rented sector.</p><p>A small proportion are new family formations but they are the primary ones.  Over time we have moved to a situation where the families who became homeless from the private rented sector were saying that rising rents were the cause to saying that it is landlords ceasing to be landlords that is the primary cause.</p></speech>

So to some extent then we are in a situation where in an immediate sense the crisis of homelessness is in the private rented sector.  Obviously, I hope it is now well recognised that the fundamental problem is in our failure to deliver affordable and in particular social housing, but the problem is expressing itself in the private rented sector.  The question of to what extent housing units which could be privately rented are moving into Airbnb or other platforms for short-term letting is extremely important.  We struggle day by day to find places for people to stay.  All of our organisations invest substantial funds, including public funds, in buying and owning new property, so if we are leaking property elsewhere it is extremely important.<br/><br/>It is striking then that there is a very little data on this.  The absence of data highlights part of the problem.  It is not just this area on which we lack data.  Every area to do with housing and homelessness, other than the number of individuals who are homeless is highly contested - for example, how many houses were completed; how many houses were started; how many houses are vacant and why they are vacant.  The absence of our knowledge about the housing sector says something about the way society has dealt with housing and why we currently have a homelessness problem.  Probably the most reliable data one can get is from the Airbnb website, which gives some clear indications about what is available but its is very clear about its limitations as a data source.  It always increases one's confidence if a website tells one why one should not believe in information it contains or what its limitations are.  It has a figure of 457 full buildings which are described as highly available.  If a building is highly available it is probably not being used as a home.  At the very least, that is the number of housing units which would otherwise be in the private rented sector if they were not being used for Airbnb.  There are also very striking figures on the website about the money one can get from Airbnb as opposed to what one would get in what is already a very inflated private rental market.  In particular, if one is not paying tax on it, it shows that it is very attractive to go on Airbnb.  Some of those details are outlined in the paper and some of the limitations in the data are also clearly indicated on the website.  I will not go into that detail.<br/><br/>Focus Ireland's analysis of the situation is that Airbnb is absolutely not the cause of our homeless crisis.  Some of the more extreme commentators have said it is the cause but that is not the case.  It is a service that makes a valuable contribution both to tourism in Dublin and elsewhere, and also to household income.  We have got to bear that in mind.  What we have here is a disruptive form of business entering into an extremely regulated sector.  We have had piecemeal regulation and no coherent strategy on regulation in the private rented sector, which is felt to be onerous by landlords and insufficient by tenants.  Entering into that is a disruptive new web-based, free market process which is completely unregulated and, inevitably, it will cause enormous difficulties.  The response to that is wider than Airbnb but it is a question of how the State struggles with such web-based, regulation-free interactions.  Each individual who is letting out his or her place for B&amp;amp;B feels his or her action is entirely justifiable and there is no negative consequences, but when looked at <i>en masse</i>has very severe significant social impacts.<br/><br/>I believe Airbnb is coming before the committee next week.  The fundamental thing is that as a highly profitable enterprise it behaves in a very socially careless way at least.  Like all companies that rely on data, it treats the data it gets from private citizens as an asset of its organisation and does not share it with public authorities who need it in order to understand the implications of its behaviour.  That is one of the fundamental things the committee needs to challenge.  I do not know what can be done under Irish law to get the company to share information that is reliable but one cannot have regulation without data.  The only way it appears one can get data other than from such companies is by employing a significant number of inspectors, who operate from the grassroots and try to clarify the situation.  One will see examples of that being done in Barcelona and elsewhere.<br/><br/>While Airbnb is not the cause of the problem it is a significant part of the picture in terms of being a contributing factor to making it worse.  If we take that minimum figure of about 450 complete housing units, which are more or less completely dedicated for use on Airbnb, it would cost &euro;900 million for the State to provide those 450 housing units.  That is a fairly substantial part of the State's investment in social housing.  If Focus Ireland and the other organisations here had access to 450 housing units for families we would be looking at enormous savings in terms of hotel costs and it would result in the transformation of the lives of large numbers of families so this is having a very significant impact at the moment.  There are things that we need to do now in relation to regulation and control because we are in the middle of a crisis, which may not necessarily be the things one would do in a normally functioning housing market.  When we call it a crisis that is the implication of what we are saying.  That needs to be looked at.<br/><br/>What is striking about the situation is that some cities are very much gearing up to this problem and are learning lessons about how to regulate the situation.  There seems to be no visible sign of cities across the globe who are all facing the same problems sharing experiences, sharing knowledge or networking to create responses.  We would very strongly recommend that it is part of what should be done.  In the absence of data it is very hard to be more specific than that but we would very strongly recommend that the next stage of the committee's programme should be to try to bring together what data are available, but that needs to be done extremely quickly because this is a problem of the now rather than a long-term think-in about how we deal with the web-based provision of services, which are now being completely deregulated by the Internet.<br/><br/>Sr. Stan of Focus Ireland has regularly spoken about the commodification of housing and how we need to see housing not as a commodity but as part of the fulfilment of a human right to housing.  Airbnb and the taking of housing units for which planning permission and probably public subsidy existed to provide them as homes and putting them on the market to be sold off in this way is an absolutely perfect example of the commodification of a scarce resource, which is essential to fulfil our human rights.</p></speech>

Our spokesperson, Niamh Randall, sends her apologies for not being able to attend.</p> <p>  The Simon Communities are a network of communities providing local responses to local needs and issues of homelessness all around the country in Cork, Dublin, Dundalk, Galway, the midlands, the mid-west, the north west and the south east.  Similar to Mr. Allen, our submission is based on two very important issues at this moment.  We wish to deal with the complete lack of affordable housing options in Ireland at the moment, which we believe to be at the core of the housing and homelessness crisis.  In that sense our priority must be to deliver new models of affordable housing such as cost rental, which is one financially sustainable social housing model.</p><p>This has to be backed up by increasing local authority social housing construction as much as possible. <br/><br/>The second contextual element would be the private rented sector.  It is not working for renters, namely rent supplement or HAP recipients.  If one looks at the most recent rental report on the website <i>Daft.ie, </i>one will see that rents have increased by 52% nationwide, availability of property is down 82% and this has the impact of creating an ultra competitive and crowded private rental sector.  The knock-on effect of this trend on social housing is that it makes the rent supplement and HAP payments increasingly ineffectual.  A recent study by the Simon Communities of Ireland has shown that 88% of properties are beyond the reach of people in receipt of these vital housing payments.  I did a brief exercise on the data to try to approximate the scale of short-term rentals in Ireland by conducting Airbnb letting searches in key locations around the county.  A search of entire place rentals in Cork on Airbnb for this working week shows 51 properties available for two people to rent.  The site user, me, is also informed that these 51 properties represent only 17% of total listings in Cork, suggesting that full listings of entire place rentals would equate to approximately 300 properties in that location.  Using a similar search in Galway, 185 entire place properties are available representing 27% of total listings in the area, suggesting full availability would equate to 685 properties.  A search in Limerick reveals 24 entire place rentals, or 20% of total listings, suggesting there are approximately 121 listings in Limerick.  In Dublin where the problem is most acute, a search reveals over 300 properties available to rent, representing 15% of total listings, suggesting total listings in Dublin could equate to approximately 2,000.  The main caveat is that I undertook a loose crude exercise but it illustrates the lack of data that is at the core of the problem.  <br/><br/>To gauge the impact of short-term lettings on the private rented sector, we could compare availability on Airbnb to the <i>Daft.ie </i>rental report.  This would reveal that the 300 entire place properties available to rent on a short-term basis in Cork represents 37.5% of total available long-term lettings in Munster as of 1 May.  In Galway there are 13.5% more properties to let on a short-term basis than the total number of properties available to let in Connacht and Ulster combined.  In Dublin, the 2,000 entire place properties available to rent on a short-term basis on Airbnb are approximately equal to twice the total number of available properties available for long-term letting in Dublin.  As Mr. Allen alluded to, if these short-term lettings were released into the private rented sector, one could argue that it would reduce the over-competitive nature of the sector and possibly slow down increasing rents.  The impact on the wider housing sector is less simple to gauge.  One potential impact of short-term lettings on the cost of housing was demonstrated in the planning case taken by the Temple Bar residents' group against an Airbnb host operating a short-term let with annual rental earnings of nearly &euro;80,000.  The property came to the attention of the group when it was listed for sale at a price of &euro;425,000, which the Temple Bar residents maintained was above the local average of similar properties of about &euro;275,000.  The inflated asking price was said to reflect the revenue stream generated by ongoing short-term letting through Airbnb.  One could suggest that successful short-term letting properties like this could drive up local house prices on the basis of profitable revenue streams.  <br/><br/>One solution to the problem would be to explore different regulatory measures to lessen the negative impact of short-term lettings on the housing and rental market.  A number of European capitals have introduced new regulations combined with increased enforcement in an attempt to curb the impact of short-term lettings on the housing and rental markets, examples include Berlin, Germany, Amsterdam in the Netherlands, cities across France and more recently increased enforcement procedures in Barcelona.  <br/><br/>In this context we must protect people who are currently living in the private rented sector.  To do so, we must fast track existing commitments to introduce indefinite leasing, giving people a long lease only dependent on their conformity with the lease agreement; we continue to see an urgent need to introduce rent certainty with rents linked to the consumer price index.<br/><br/>We need to boost the affordable housing supply.  The Simon Communities of Ireland believe that one of the primary solutions to the housing and homeless crisis lies in strategic State investment in affordable housing for low and middle income families.  The commitment to develop a cost rental model for the rental sector is encouraging and NESC and the Nevin Economic Research Institute have done great work in this regard.  Tax incentives for cost rental providers must be considered to ensure their viability.  The proposed use of local authority owned land to deliver rental units targeting middle income families is welcome but must be balanced by securing significant conditions from investors in terms of security of tenure, rent certainty, quality, safety and fire standards, developer contributions similar to the existing Part V contributions for social housing and ultimately local authorities must be fully resourced to re-engage in large scale social housing construction, given that current completion rates are disappointingly low at 665 units built in 2016.<br/><br/>In conclusion, we need to increase availability and access to affordable housing for low and middle income families.  In the private rented sector it is crucial that we increase security of tenure and rent certainty for all those living there and the knock on effects on people in receipt of State housing benefits.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-21a.280" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Francis Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017062100002#N00200"><p>I thank the Chairperson and members for the invitation extended to the Peter McVerry Trust to attend today.  Much of the commentary on short-term lettings just focus on the letting platform Airbnb.  What we would like to stress is that this is simply the largest concentration of short-term lettings online.  There are many other businesses and individuals operating in the market who do not use the platform.  The rise in the number of short-term lettings in such an unregulated manner is another symptom of a highly dysfunctional housing system, while short-term lettings do not have a major impact on the housing system as a whole, at present they can in specific small or local area systems have deeply negative and disruptive impacts.  The rise can also disproportionately impact on specific groups within the housing system, such as people reliant on private rented units for their accommodation.  It is also of concern that the use of short-term letting is growing in popularity as it does have the potential clearly to grow to such a point that the broader housing system is more deeply impacted.  The manner in which short-term letting has grown also points to deeper problems with our planning system and particular shortcomings in how we monitor and enforce planning legislation. </p> <p>  In assessing the impact of short-term letting, the Peter McVerry Trust has framed this presentation around three critical issues - these are entire properties to rent; businesses or individuals engaged in multi-unit lettings; and, non-compliance with planning regulations.  With respect to the negative impact on the availability of rental properties, the primary issue of concern to the Peter McVerry Trust is that the rapid rise in short-term lettings has caused a further decline in the number of properties to rent under a normal medium-term lease.  This is critical because the private rental market remains the main access route for people leaving homelessness, particularly for single adults, who would otherwise face very long waits for social housing opportunities.  The growth in short-term lettings has undoubtedly led to traditional rental properties transitioning to the short-term lettings market.  This reduces overall supply.  It impacts on Peter McVerry Trust's ability to move people out of homelessness and of course, most important, negatively impacts on people in homelessness.  At any point in time, the rapid rise in the number of properties lost to short-term letting is concerning, given that supplies have been disrupted and reduced.  It is of particular concern at the current time when the availability of rented properties in Dublin and other high needs areas is at a historically low level.  Peter McVerry Trust is concerned that existing rental properties are being transitioned to short-term lettings.  This means a tenant being evicted and displaced.  At present sitting tenants are being evicted by property owners in order to facilitate a shift from medium-term to short-term letting.  We do not have any record of specific instances and it is perfectly feasible that some tenants have ended up in homeless services as a result of property moving to the short-term lettings market.  For the property owner, higher yields secured through short-term lease model and a commercial environment, devoid of any genuine regulation, make sense.</p><p>Short-term letting also has the potential to impact on new supply.  It is likely to reduce the number of new properties to rent in the future and to also impact on the ability of potential home owners to buy homes.  This arises because of a significant growth in the number of businesses and individuals engaged in large-scale commercial multi-unit lettings. In 2016, there was a significant increase in the number of multi-unit users of the Airbnb platform.  Given the absence of regulation and the high yields available, many investors are now acquiring properties on the market to add to their short-term lettings portfolios.  This means those same properties cannot be used as traditional rental properties or cannot be bought by home buyers or owner-occupiers.</p><p> We have tried to focus on one area to give an example of how short-term letting can impact on housing in an area.  In this regard, we have taken Dublin 1, where the Petter McVerry Trust is based and has historical links.  Currently, there are more short-term rental properties available in the Dublin 1 area than there are traditional rental units.  In other words, there are approximately 40 traditional rental properties and in the region of 300 short-term lets available.  As this is in an area in which there are significant levels of overcrowding in existing rental properties, acute levels of social housing need and almost a complete absence of affordable housing options, the impacts are clear.  While a significant number of those short-term listings are found on Airbnb, the majority are not listed on that platform.  One relatively new actor in the short-term lettings market in this area has converted a number of residential properties to commercial short-term lettings, without any record of planning approval.  The Peter McVerry Trust estimates that within the immediate environs of Mountjoy Square, Dublin 1, at least 30 former rental units have been lost in the past 18 months as a result of illegal change of use for the purposes of short-term lets.  The trust is aware that this is reflected across other residential buildings in other parts of Dublin 1 and Dublin 7.  Some of these instances have been highlighted by us and others in the media this year.</p><p> We would like to place on record our recognition that for some owners the use of short-term letting is a means to afford their housing.  This can be due to the need to address a legacy from the housing boom and financial crash, with many property owners stuck with devalued assets and crippling mortgages.  Equally, many people are facing very real challenges in holding on to their accommodation and the use of short-term lettings may offer them the chance to retain their homes.  The Peter McVerry Trust would hope that the committee would recognise these sensitivities when considering how best these individuals and home owners can be supported to comply with planning, health and safety and tax issues.  It is almost a separate body of work to tackle the actions of commercial businesses and individuals operating full-time lettings of entire properties, which is a smaller but rapidly growing segment of the short-term lettings market.</p><p> As regards recommendations, previous speakers have pointed to the lack of data.  Evidence is needed to boost of our understanding and to formulate policy.  On planning enforcement, the Peter McVerry Trust believes that at the very least a proactive response from local authorities is needed to ensure full planning compliance regarding properties used for short-term leases.  This may require a cultural shift because, as one local authority official stated, enforcement would, as a first, action-oriented step, lead to an immediate reduction in the use of illegal short-term lettings.  We would also urge consideration of a term defined ban on residential to commercial change-of-use applications in respect of short-term lettings in light of the current housing crisis.  This measure, when combined with an enforcement approach, would push the owners of properties who let them, in their entirety and on a full-time basis, to put them back into the housing system, thereby increasing the number of properties to rent or buy.</p><p> The committee should examine the need to review and, if necessary, amend the Planning and Development Act to ensure the imposition of adequate financial penalties on those found to be in breach of planning legislation .  International evidence, particularly from the US, with respect to Airbnb hosts shows that this is the most effective deterrent to prevent illegal listings.  It is important that we try to address the problem rather that the publicity.  We would have serious reservations about an MoU with Airbnb.  We believe that legislation and enforcement of existing legislation is the best course of action.</p></speech>

I am not sure if they were following the earlier session when members expressed frustration about the lack of hard data, particularly in terms of how short-term letting is affecting Dublin city.  What most of us were urging is the need for regulation of this sector to ensure that it does not have the type of negative impacts just outlined.</p> <p>  The recommendations outlined by Mr. Doherty at the end of his contribution are particularly helpful and I will be urging the committee to take them into account when it comes to producing its report.  I have two questions for the witnesses, the first of which relates to enforcement.  In his submission, Mr. Doherty mentioned two potential areas of enforcement.  Has the Peter McVerry Trust made planning enforcement complaints to Dublin City Council?  We heard earlier from the council officials that they are only responding to complaints made rather than proactively looking at issues.  If the Trust has not already made complaints, I urge it to do so or to provide us with the information so that we can do so.  We would be keen to do that.</p> <p>  I am particularly interested in the recommendation relating to planning around change-of-use applications, which we are examining in the context of the vacant homes issue.  Am I correct in stating that what the trust is recommending is a ban on change of use from commercial to residential for the purposes of short-term lets?  Perhaps Mr. Doherty would elaborate.</p></speech>

I would like, however, to thank them for and acknowledge their efforts in terms of the preparation of the report provided today, which reaffirms our beliefs in respect of this sector.  While short-term letting might not be the main contributory factor in the homelessness crisis, it is not helping and is making a critical situation worse.</p> <p>  We met Department officials at our earlier sessions.  It would appear that very little has been done since the decision by An Bord Plean&aacute;la issued.  A working group was established but it has only met once.  It met for the first time last week and while it has issued circulars to the local authorities urging planning enforcement officers to be vigilant in respect of this sector and how it is policed, there is no direction to them to actively seek to address issues within local authority areas in terms of this activity.  Neither this committee nor the Peter McVerry Trust should be the policing authority but it would appear that the practice is that the local authorities will only act on foot of complaints made to them, which is far from what they are supposed to be doing, as far as I am concerned.  They are supposed to enforce the law of the land.  There is legislation in place in that regard.  The matter has been adjudicated by the relevant authority, namely, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, and the local authorities need to act accordingly.  It would appear, without them admitting so, that they do not have the personnel or manpower to do a trawl and match the effort made in other cities throughout Europe.  We have said in no uncertain terms to the Department that it has failed in its responsibilities heretofore.  We expect a sea change in this regard as soon as is practicably possible.  There is an urgency required in the context of the response to this crisis which has not been forthcoming from the Department.  This is example of another matter in respect of which the right procedures and processes are not being adhered to.  We will seek to hold the Department and the Minister with responsibility for it to account.  The Peter McVerry Trust can be assured of our assistance in ensuring that is the case.</p></speech>

Many of today's witnesses mentioned that there is anecdotal evidence that short-term letting is impacting on the housing crisis but there is no hard evidence in that regard.  We have an idea of the number of properties in question but no statistics.  There are a lot of issues arising in terms of legislation.  Mr. Doherty mentioned that legislation, as opposed to other measures, is required.  A register of short-term lettings is important.  That issue needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  I know that the witnesses are aware of the decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la in regard to the short-term letting of apartments, which is not permitted, and of houses, which is permitted.  Also, in the context of houses built in recent years, owners wishing to let them in the short term or otherwise are required to obtain permission to do so.  At our earlier session, we heard from one of the groups that the requirements in respect of these properties, as set out in the decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, have not been conveyed to Airbnb and other similar operations, which is disappointing.</p><p>They do not seem to have gone to them to say that these different requirements have to be met with regard to these properties.  For example, they have to be registered for VAT and as employers.  People do not seem to have been told there are planning issues that need to be addressed and that they need to ensure the properties they are getting are covered properly.  This does not seem to have been done.</p><p> Obviously, the working group will come back with many recommendations.  I am sure many of the issues we have been discussing will arise in that context.  I am worried about the use of student accommodation for short-term lettings.  This needs to be looked at carefully.  I do not know whether the witnesses have an opinion on that.  There are other examples of properties that might also be utilised in this way.</p></speech>

I was at another committee meeting when they made them.  The issue of short-term lettings has been raised in the D&aacute;il on many occasions by various people.  While companies such as Airbnb are having an obvious impact, I think they are becoming a convenient scapegoat to be thrown up as a reason for the housing shortage.  We do not have Airbnb in Blanchardstown as far as I am aware because it is not a popular tourist destination.  I would not say too many people in Deputy Ellis's local area-----</p></speech>

I am not minimising it.  I get irritated because I think it is raised as an issue far too frequently.  I think that, in general, the use of accommodation to make money in life is awful.  I would be in a minority in this D&aacute;il in that regard.  Most Deputies are in favour of such activity.  I would not be in favour Airbnb at all.  I think we should move on because there is really nothing to see here.  Key areas of homelessness have been identified in Dublin based on the addresses of people who are staying in emergency accommodation.  I am sure the witnesses from Focus Ireland and the other groups will know that these people tend to come from particular areas.  There seems to be a huge problem in north-west Dublin.  It is not about Airbnb; it is about a lack of affordable public housing.  A year on from the special Committee on Housing and Homelessness, which many of us spent time on, nothing has changed.  The situation has got worse in the sense that more people are now registered as homeless.  I think this is an ideological question.  A complete and utter change of policy is needed.  We should bring the new Minister before this committee.</p></speech>

I have read the three submissions.  I had to go to the Seanad to raise an item on the Order of Business but I am back.  I took the time to read all the submissions.  They are excellent and concise.  As Deputy Coppinger said, this is a simple enough issue.  It needs to be seen in the context of social housing policy and the delivery of affordable and social housing.  We do not have a national affordable rent scheme.  I think we need to look at this matter in that bigger context.  I think the reports are excellent.  I hope some of the recommendations will be fed into this process because they are important.  I note that the submission made by the Peter McVerry Trust argues that the growth in short-term lettings is having an impact on the trust's "ability to move people out of homelessness".  This is a simple but profound statement.  Clearly, we need to address this real issue.</p> <p>  Everyone who has spoken here today referred to the need for quality standards and compliance with regulations.  That needs to be done.  I agree with Deputy Cowen that there did not seem to be any sense of urgency on the part of the officials from Dublin City Council or the Department in this regard.  We heard the usual stuff about being notified of the board's decision in October as part of the section 5 declaration that was made in respect of Temple Bar.  The standard old circulars are coming in like confetti into local authorities.  They sit on some shelf or in some folder and nothing happens.  I think Deputy Cowen is right.  It is disappointing that a proactive approach has not been taken.  If an issue is raised with an authority, it is obliged to do something about it.  It is simply not good enough to send a circular to the Department.  These bodies need to be on the Department's case, month in and month out, in order to ascertain what is happening.  That is where matters stand.</p> <p>  The lack of an evidence base is clear in all of this.  Two of the groups mentioned in their submissions that there is a need for greater research and greater clarity on all the points.  Everyone - policymakers, stakeholders, users and people who avail of rented accommodation - needs to work on the basis of evidence so that alternative solutions can be found.  If there was more accommodation in the market, this really would not be an issue.  I am an advocate of Airbnb.  There are great benefits of having Airbnb in cities.  We have an acute housing and accommodation problem.  There are other problems associated with that.  I congratulate the witnesses again.  I know many of them have been here before.  Their submissions were concise, which is really impressive.  These committees tend to attract endless papers, but these submissions are concise.  I think these strong recommendations should go forward as part of the general policy in this area.</p></speech>

The main issue is lack of supply of housing.  I think this problem will get worse until the Government sorts that issue out.  Last year, the then Minister, Deputy Coveney, said there was a lack of clarity around the role of Airbnb.  That is the problem.  I firmly believe there is a lack of enforcement, a lack of legislation and a lack of leadership.  I suggest that all local authorities should be given proper leadership on the role they need to play.  It will go down to that.  Everything in local authority housing goes through all the local authorities.  The Department needs to put more emphasis on building houses.  It is not happening at the moment.  We are being given all these promises.  I hope they are fulfilled.  This is a very good report.  It is sad that so many people are homeless in 2017.  We really need to address the major issues they are facing.  I commend the witnesses again.</p></speech>

I accept that Airbnb has not caused the housing and homelessness crisis with which we are dealing.  Obviously, supply and affordability are massive factors.  This committee will discuss the quarterly report relating to Rebuilding Ireland tomorrow.  We are aware that local authorities are being tasked with coming up with State-owned land in their respective areas where affordable and social housing can be developed.  Senator Boyhan will be familiar with a site in our area of D&uacute;n Laoghaire where there is the potential to return almost 500 units.  It is up to local authorities to decide whether the units that are developed should be private, affordable, rent-to-buy, build-to-rent or social.  They are tasked with making those decisions.  We know that local authorities own over 600 sites throughout the country with the potential to return 10,000 units.  While we are waiting on that supply, we have problems in other areas as well.  I wonder whether the witnesses can see any innovative ideas or alternatives in the short-term lettings area.  I invite all the witnesses to respond to the various points that have been made.</p></speech>

We have not done so.  We do many things, and planning enforcement is probably the least of our priorities at the moment.  We can certainly share the information we are aware of with Dublin City Council.  We have made it available.  It has been shared on platforms like &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; and <i>Dublin InQuirer</i>.<br/><br/>I would like to clarify the point that was made about proposing a ban on change of use.  That relates specifically to short-term lettings that are currently let but which do not have planning permission.  Where should the owners of such properties go to seek planning permission, given the current crisis?</p><p>Our priority should be housing and homes for people, be they homeless or seeking rental accommodation, over the needs of the tourism industry.</p><p> Several members have raised the question of urgency.  Everyone on this side of the table would agree that we need to see greater urgency in the system.  Front-line staff in the Peter McVerry Trust and Focus Ireland try day in and day out to do their best in a growing and deepening crisis.  We need the effort and urgency that we display to be replicated at political level in the Department and the local authorities.</p><p> Deputy Coppinger mentioned that Airbnb does not impact on particular areas in north-west Dublin.  There is, however, a ripple effect for people who cannot get accommodation in the city because apartments are being changed to short-term lettings.  These people then move to outlying areas which pushes up prices and affects those at the lower end of the market.</p><p> I often say that if the housing system above us in the homeless sector is broken, it makes our task of ending homelessness almost impossible.  If we cannot get access to housing in the first instance, we cannot move people out of homelessness and, therefore, we stay with the shelter system which grows in scale and the problem deepens.</p></speech>

That is a commitment in the Rebuilding Ireland action plan and is being brilliantly rolled out by Focus Ireland and the Peter McVerry Trust.  We need the housing units to deliver this.  Local authority sites should be used to develop and build a certain allocation of homes to house people under Housing First, which is housing without preconditions and with all the wraparound supports a person will need.  We increasingly see a need for a youth Housing First-style programme too.  The delivery of Housing First units is vitally important for that to be correctly implemented.</p></speech>

To broaden it a bit, from family connections in Leitrim, which has the lowest rents in Ireland and supposedly the largest amount of empty property, I know that it is virtually impossible for people to rent privately in the area because virtually everything that is available is in Airbnb.  While it is not necessarily leading to homelessness it is leading to housing precariousness for couples in those circumstances.  It is not just a question of homelessness but the overall impact on the private rental market.</p> <p>  We regularly get proposals for innovative ideas.  Focus Ireland and the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive are regularly confronted late at night with the problem of helping families when there is no emergency accommodation and no hotels are available.  Contingency beds are made available in hotels that are partly under construction, which is less than ideal and which leads to problems.  There is some very serious misinformation from some quarters about what is going on there.  It is certainly problematic.  People propose from time to time that we use Airbnb for this sort of situation.  That would be a further wrong step in our response to the crisis because that is short-term accommodation and is not part of any medium to long-term solution.  That is one innovative solution I mention and denounce at the same time.  In the United States, where Airbnb is coming under criticism, it is offering to house refugees.  We need to distinguish public relations exercises from the substantive issue.</p> <p>  It is absolutely crucial to distinguish between the problems arising because we do not have good enough legislation because things have changed, and the problems arising because we have not bothered to implement the legislation and regulations that we have in place.  Most of the examples we are giving are of non-implementation of regulations.  There is increasing and welcome regulation of the private rented sector and taxation of landlords, which is all great.  However, if there is another area where places can be rented out, ignore planning legislation and not pay tax, of course there is a problem.  While it is the responsibility of local authorities to implement regulations, it is the responsibility of the Houses of the Oireachtas to be much stronger in demanding that.  One issue to consider is how the policing of it is funded and how much of the savings that would be made by implementing the regulations would actually go to the local authorities and, therefore, create a funding source for them to be able to do this, as opposed to what happens now whereby people do not tend to regulate systems where there is no benefit to them from the regulation.  As a result, the benefit goes into somebody else's pocket.  That might be considered to get this working.  To be tied up in long discussions about new legislation when we cannot be bothered to implement existing planning or tax legislation would be time misspent.</p></speech>

I ask everyone present to switch off their mobile phones because such devices can interfere with the sound recording system.  The purpose of today's meeting is to continue our pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the Data Protection Bill 2017.  I welcome Mr. Denis Kelleher, who is a barrister and author on data protection law in Ireland.  On behalf of the committee, I thank him for his attendance at today's meeting to discuss this important legislation.  The format of the meeting is that I will invite Mr. Kelleher to make an opening statement, to be followed by a question and answer session with the members of the committee.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I want to draw Mr. Kelleher's attention to the situation in relation to privilege.</p><p>Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.

I will not read through my statement which I realise is quite lengthy but will instead highlight some of the salient points.</p> <p>  Data protection law will become extremely complex in the next few years.  Currently, we have one single data protection Bill, with a general data protection regulation, GDPR, which is to apply to the State from May next year and to which, with the data protection directive, we will see further layers of complexity being added.  In addition, we will have a residual domestic regime and many other items of legislation coming through the system, as well as the privacy regulation.  Rules may also come from the European Union about foreign and security policy.  One of the key points to make is that data protection is no longer being settled at a legislative level.  There are many rulings coming from the European Court of Justice.  They will change significantly what data protection is and this will have a big implication for the State also.</p> <p>  I make five submissions on the five headline comments, namely, the role of the Data Protection Commissioner; whether the existing Data Protection Acts should be repealed, replaced or amended; the role of identification services under the general data protection regulation, GDPR; the role of the Oireachtas under the GDPR; and damages.</p> <p>  I will make some submissions on the role of the Data Protection Commission.  The main point to take into account is under existing law that the Data Protection Commissioner is fully independent.  It is important to realise the European Commission has prosecuted Austria, Germany and Hungary for failing to have a properly independent data protection commissioner.  We can assume from this that it has examined intensively the independence of the Data Protection Commissioner and is satisfied that she is independent in accordance with the current law.  However, I have some queries about the legislation.  One issue I wish to flag is the delegation of functions under the Civil Service Acts.  In terms of what is happening, many of the Irish drafting conventions provide for issues such as the delegation of Ministers' functions to the Data Protection Commissioner; but that is open to being misconstrued.  Perhaps the phraseology should be "... should delegate the functions".  There are a few such technical changes.  Somebody who is well versed in the Civil Service Acts and the way civil servants are controlled and disciplined by the State understands the importance of the independence of staff not being interfered with, but it would be wise to change the drafting to ensure there would be no appearance of bias in that regard.</p> <p>  Depending on how the Data Protection Commissioner uses her office, she may not need a seal.  It is adding a layer of bureaucracy to the process that may not be needed.</p> <p>  The provision in the Bill dealing with the prohibition on the unauthorised disclosure of information is very good.  It is a clever provision.  On the other hand, I question whether we need to insert "gateways" to ensure the Data Protection Commissioner will be able to properly share information with other public bodies such as the Garda if it wants to bring a prosecution, the Director of Corporate Enforcement and so on.</p> <p>  I make a detailed submission on the imposition of fines on public authorities.  I am aware that it has been controversial, but the Data Protection Commissioner is strongly of the view that she should have powers to impose fines on public authorities.  I have sympathy for that view.  On the other hand, one needs to question whether the imposition of a fine is an effective deterrent for a public authority because if we think about it, both the Data Protection Commissioner's office and the public authority are funded by the State.  If the commissioner imposes a fine, it will go back into the general fund from where the money for the public body came.  Essentially, all we are doing is creating a circular transaction.  An issue I have with it is that it detracts from the real deterrence for public bodies which is twofold.  One concerns claims for damages.  They may be sued by a member of the public.  The other major concern for public bodies is that they may be found to be processing personal data in breach of the Data Protection Acts.  They may be found to be processing personal data illegally, which will mean that any decision they have made in processing that personal data may be invalid.  That is a big concern.  There is limited awareness in the public sector of how significant an issue this may be in the future because if personal data are processed without a proper legal basis, under Irish law, it will be done illegally.  That raises a range of issues about whether penalties can be imposed on a person on the basis of personal date possibly being processed illegally.</p> <p>  Another point I discuss in some detail concerns the possible repeal of the existing Acts.  This is a very interesting question.  I agree with the Data Protection Commissioner that &ldquo;...a patchwork presentation of the new Irish law in the form of a 2018 amendment Act rather than a completely new stand-alone Act does not create the impression of a new, modernised regime&rdquo;.  That is correct.  On the other hand, my concern about repealing the old Acts in their entirety is that they deal with the processing of personal data for national security purposes.  We are very fortunate in Ireland that we do not need to engage in much processing for that purpose.</p> <p>  My concern about the repeal and replacement of the legislation relates to timing.  The Data Protection Bill has to be on the Statute Book by May next year.  It is an enormous item of legislation.  As members know, these are just the heads.  There is an absence of detail which will be added by the Parliamentary Counsel.  We will be looking at a very significant item of legislation at the end of the process.  If we were to try to do these two things at the same time, namely, set out the residual regime which potentially is still significant and the new GDPR regime, I question whether the Oireachtas would be able to allocate the proper length of time to debate the legislation.  That is the reality.</p> <p>  Could the Parliamentary Counsel deal with this issue and, for example, leave what one might term the rump regime in order that we would have an entirely new Data Protection Act?  We would leave behind the rump regime in order that the State could return to it at some stage in the future and deal with the residual regime.  In reality, there are very small areas of processing in Irish life that would be subject to the rump regime, but I understand we need a residual regime in that regard.  I agree that it does not give the right impression by phrasing the new data protection Bill as a sequence of amendments to the existing Data Protection Acts.  It would be better from the point of view of perception and for people who have to deal with this legislation on a day to day basis to have an entirely new data protection Bill.  I hope that could be dealt with as a drafting issue.</p> <p>  The next issue might be the most controversial.  It concerns identification services.  Many queries have been raised about the processing by the State of identification data.  The reality is that under the GDPR, such data will have to be processed.  Social media providers and persons engaged in profiling will have to be able to distinguish between children and adults.  That is a legal obligation.  They are subject to onerous fines and open potentially to very serious claims for damages if they process the data of children where they are not supposed to do so.  Social media providers, fintech firms and so on will have to be able to identify who is and is not a child.  This raises the question of who will be involved in the identification.  Essentially, there are two choices.  The default position is that that identification will be made by the market.  The market will provide a solution and it is already doing so.  I would prefer, however, if that was not the solution.  I would prefer if the State provided a solution.  As a public servant, I have a bias towards the public sector, but it is better to have the Government providing the identification service.  Where there is access to remedies, fair procedures and rights and the ability to see clearly what is happening with my data, it would be better if the State was providing that service.</p> <p>  The important point is that the GDPR will require identification services to be provided.  There is no avoiding it.  The question is who will provide them.  If a decision is taken that the State will not provide them in the future - the State is not in a position to provide them at present - there is the default position and we will have to use social media or some specialist provider to provide identification services.</p><p>I do not believe that is good, but that is my opinion.<br/><br/>On the role of the Oireachtas under the GDPR, I flag a couple of points.  One is that it is going to take into account the fact that the Data Protection Commissioner will have a significant role in the future.  The commission will have to be consulted on data processing and the legislative amendments that provide for the processing of personal data.  That will significantly increase the workload of the commissioner.  I suggest some mechanism to take into account these submissions.  Given the level of data processing one will see in the State in the coming years across a range of functions, one must ascertain whether it is appropriate to continue in an<i>ad hoc </i>way?  Should some framework be set out in order that one can consult in early course?  Obviously, it is highly desirable for the State and the Oireachtas to consult the Data Protection Commissioner as early as possible in order that issues can be identified and dealt with.<br/><br/>The second point I wish to make is about the legal basis.  There is a rather technical debate under way on the extent to which one needs a legal basis and how far it goes.  As I said, I can leave that issue to one side.  I made submissions to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Expenditure and Reform which has referred the matter to the Oireachtas legal service, but there is a significant point of discussion about the extent to which, if the State is to process personal data, that needs to be called out in legislation.  I suggest it may be dealt with to some extent in legislation.  Certainly, one could bring forward amendments.  One could have an amendment that would enable a Minister or another relevant body to make regulations setting out the criteria the GDPR required a law to display.  It could require that laws providing for the processing of personal data identify factors such as the purpose of the processing and the retention period.  If the Minister were to take the view that an existing provision that allowed for the processing of personal data such as in the payment of a grant were not sufficiently detailed to meet our obligations under the GDPR, a power would then be granted to make regulations setting out the detail required.  That might be useful.<br/><br/> There was a discussion the last day about whether one needed to make a specific provision in the GDPR for the award of damages.  I am not sure one does.  It is a drafting issue.  I personally do not believe a specific provision is needed for the award of damages.  The GDPR plainly provides for the award of material and non-material damages.  I understand the preference at European level is that unless we definitely need to make an adaptation of national legislation, we should not do so.  I do not see the need to make that amendment now.<br/><br/> The provision in the GDPR that may allow for the taking of class actions and the bringing of actions for damages before the courts is very interesting.  It is very significant, given the nature of data processing.  The data processing system processes everyone's data in the same way.  What would occur in compliance with the GDPR in the case of one person would occur in the cases of a large number.  One of the key issues the GDPR does appear to address is whether one can bring class actions.  It states one can bring group actions where provided for by member state law.  As members know, Irish member state law does not provide for class actions.  It does cover representative actions.  Certainly, on the basis of discussions with my legal colleagues, I believe there would be no surprise if people were to seek to bring class actions or rely on this provision.  It is only the Irish rules of court that prevent class actions from being taken.  There is an argument made that these rules of court should be adapted to allow for class actions.  This poses the question as to whether it would be appropriate.  If one believes it is, how would one manage them?  That is very significant.<br/><br/>People become very focused on the issue of penalties.  The penalties are not as important.  There are two points to be considered in this regard.  With regard to the public sector, the main point concerns the illegality.  It will be very difficult for the public sector to operate.  If it processes personal data in breach of the GDPR, it will have a big problem with illegality.  Many of its functions will have to be stopped until it can process personal data legally.  The second point concerns damages which are a very real prospect and a very real deterrent.  Obviously, data subjects who can claim damages will obviously prefer to get damages directly into their pockets rather than have fines awarded.  The imposition of a fine on a public body or private sector entity may give a subject some satisfaction, but the award of damages will obviously give them money.  Being what they are, people would prefer to opt for the money, not the satisfaction attached to the imposition of a fine.  If anything is to change in the enforcement and status of data protection law in Ireland, it is the latter point on damages.  It is very significant and will have a significant impact on budgets.  If a public body makes an error in the processing of personal data and faces a large claim for damages, it is a problem.  As we know, the State has faced very significant claims for damages, amounting to hundreds of millions of euro.  There is a great danger that if it does not get the processing of personal data right, it could face similar claims for damages in the future.</p></speech>

Am I right in saying it includes issues such as those concerning memoranda of understanding?</p></speech>

There was a separate committee and there is a separate data sharing Bill.  My main concern about this legislation is the scenario in which all data protection legislation is moving towards circumstances in which one will need a great deal of precision in how processes personal data.  Therefore, the law does have to call out a lot of these issues.  On the one hand, if a Minister has power to process a grant application, there is an implicit power to process personal data in respect of the application.  On the other hand, there is much data sharing within the State sector on the basis of the Supreme Court's judgment dating from 1990 in the case Desmond <i>v</i>. Glackin.</p></speech>

Is Mr. Kelleher's concern that if it is not set out in legislation, it could fall foul of the regulations?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-21a.313" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Denis Kelleher" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017062100002#C00500"><p>That is precisely the concern.  Many data subjects will not object to the processing of their personal data for the purpose of being paid a grant, obviously, but if they do not get it, they may object.  There are, under Article 6.3 of the GDPR, some specific elements that have to be within the law.  There is a debate on whether the provision needs to be in every item of legislation that provides for the paying of a grant.  In that regard, I suggest this issue be addressed by the GDPR essentially setting out that Ministers can create statutory instruments, perhaps, to include relevant elements, if they consider it necessary to do so, to allow themselves flexibility, reserving a position that where there is a general power to pay out money or process people's personal data in a particular way, one can do so.  The issue of data sharing arises in that the structure of the State is such that each Minister is in charge of his or her Department.  Each Minister is, therefore, a data controller.  The classic example involves the transfer of data from the Department of Health to the Department of Social Protection.  Section 8 of the Health (Alteration of Criteria of Eligibility) Act 2013 which is quite obscure providers for the Revenue Commissioners or the Department to go to the Department of Social Protection to access information and <i>vice versa</i>.  Where one provides for the payment of a disability grant from the Department of Social Protection, for example, that Department could access the systems of the Department of Health and Revenue to identify a person's health records to ascertain whether he or she is really disabled and his or her income to determine whether he or she should receive the grant.  That is the power needed in the sharing of data.  One needs to consider the complexity of the data sharing and the impact on individuals.  What the GDPR is doing is bringing a layer of complexity to these decisions.</p></speech>

The Circuit Court awarded him damages of &euro;15,000 in respect of that ignored data protection access request.  That is a significant amount of money.  The case then went to the High Court, which took the view that he was not entitled to non-material damages.

If one had a Department with a system that was failing to process some quite basic access requests it is easy to see how one could get 1,000 such claims.  We would then be into &euro;15 million.

Claims have been settled in the past for figures of &euro;10,000 for things like failure to secure a CCTV, for example.  There are currently differing views as to how much claims would settle for.

If, for example, the Data Protection Commissioner was to impose a fine on a Department of &euro;1 million, as a result that Department has to either stop providing services to citizens or alternatively get an emergency allocation of &euro;1 million to make up that loss.  The fine does not go to the Data Protection Commissioner, it goes into the general funds.  In a sense then there is a circular transaction.  I am going to state, in the classical lawyer fashion, that this depends on which direction one wants to follow.  The preference in this State is that public bodies not fine other public bodies because that is seen as a circular transaction.  This has been the convention to date in this State.</p> <p>  In my view, the very real penalty that would be imposed on public bodies would be twofold.  First, they would not be able to do their job and consequently would have a problem there.  Second, if the DPC decides that a public body is processing personal data illegally then the data subject in question would be able to bring claims for damages against that body.  That may be a very real penalty on them.  </p></speech>

I realise that this is quite controversial in the context of the current debate on the public services card in Ireland.  The difficulty here comes down to the question as to who one wants to process one's personal data or be responsible for one's identification.  If the State is responsible for this then the individual has many protections through such things as judicial review and fair procedure.  If a social media company is doing that identification then the individual's ability to get protective oversight is much lower.  The individual then either brings an action before the courts him or herself or else uses his or her rights of access and goes to the Data Protection Commissioner.  I understand that there are, for historic reasons, good arguments as to why the provision of identification services by the State is controversial.  On the other hand, however, we have to look at the reality of today, which is that the alternative to the State identifying individuals is that this be done by a private sector body.</p></speech>

For all the concern I might have about this, I would have more concerns about the private sector because it obviously has an ulterior motive.  The private sector makes money and it makes its decisions and does what it does in order to maximise earnings.  That would be the driving force for the private sector if it were to get involved in this area.  Does Mr. Kelleher not think it absolutely imperative that the State takes on this role?</p></speech>

This is a policy decision for the Oireachtas and for the State as to which road we go down.  There is a tendency to phrase this in such a way that the only identification mechanism available is one run by the State and that if the State does not provide this then we will not be identified by anyone.  In reality, of course, the general data protection regulation will force social media providers to identify who is and is not a child.  The question then is: who is going to do this?  The social media providers undoubtedly have the capability to do this at the moment.  Somebody like myself and many other people might not like to be clearly identified by a social media provider or private sector company.  We would prefer to have the State be in the position to do this.  There are obviously risks attendant to that.  There will also be costs.</p></speech>

There is a whole issue around the running of information systems across the State.  If we were to have an identification system then the most efficient way to run that and to lower the cost would be to pool all of the data into one giant database.  We would then get into other data protection concerns, of course.  This is not a risk-free outcome either.  We have to compare it to the alternative, however, which would be a private sector monopoly on the provision of these services.  The reason the GDPR is so blas&eacute; about the need to identify someone as either an adult or a child is because most other European member states do this as a matter of course.  As members know, people living on the Continent must have their ID cards on them at all times.</p><p>If a policeman asks a person to identify himself or herself, he or she has to produce ID.  If the person does not, the policeman can arrest him or her, bring him or her to the police station and hold him or her there until he or she identifies himself or herself.  For historic reasons, they have a quite different regime from ours.  It is a very significant policy change for us to say that the State would be in a position to definitively identify all its citizens.  The problem is that is happening anyway.  Everyone in this room, I assume, has a mobile phone.  We all are effectively identified by that anyway.  It is quite easy to track our movements across Dublin at any stage through our mobile phones and then to track our conversations, etc.  Effectively, we are being identified anyway.  We are being identified through our faces.  If a person walks through the streets of London, they have facial recognition technology which will track him or her from one point to another.  The question is who is going to do this identification.  Is it going to be the State or is it going to be the private sector?  Is it going to be the market providing the solution or will it be the State?  It is a significant question.  It is a question that the GDPR was going to force us to answer, one way or another.  If we do not answer, it will just default to the social media companies.</p></speech>

It is just the perception.  I do not mean to interrupt the Deputy, but she is absolutely independent at the present time.  There is no question about that.</p> <p>  There have been three challenges to the independent data protection commissioners in Europe - in German, Austria and Hungary.  I guarantee that when those three member states were being prosecuted before the Court of Justice, there would have been a review undertaken of breaches of other member states' independence and clearly the Irish regime passed.  One can say it definitively.  I would have reviewed it.  One will see a reference.  She is independent at present.  The question I would have is about perception of independence and whether the drafting need to be tweaked away from current Irish conventions of drafting to make clear that such independence is there.</p></speech>

The point to be made there is that it is the GDPR and the European Legislature that have decided on the funding mechanism.  There is no provision within the GDPR for the Data Protection Commissioner to be self-funded.  I believe there was a debate within the European Legislature, within the European Union, as to whether or not one could create a self-funding mechanism.  They have not gone down that route.  Instead, what they have preferred is that she has to be funded by the State.  There have to be protections in there around her funding but she has to be funded by the State.  The State, whether one likes it or not, has no option about that.</p> <p>  Obviously, there is the question of what sort of safeguards one can build into the legislation in relation to that.  According to the heads of the Bill, that is still being discussed.  However, the reality is there is no other funding mechanism available to the State in relation to this.  For example, there is no mechanism for the Data Protection Commissioner to impose levies or fees in any way.</p></speech>

That would be conceding some sort of budgetary control.  There is no mechanism by which one could do that at present.</p> <p>  In terms of how they have set out the legislation, they have done it in an interesting way.  Instead of social media firms and persons who process personal data funding the Data Protection Commissioner's office, every significant data controller in the State has to hire his or her own data protection officer, who is like his or her own mini-supervision.  That person is somebody who will effectively review, I suppose one could say, data protection within that organisation.  That is how they are funding that.  Otherwise, if they did not go down that route, one of the concerns is one would end up with an enormous data protection commissioner's office with thousands of staff.  At present, I am not aware of any proposal that the funding would be set at a European level, but under the legislation she has to receive sufficient funding to allow her to do her job.</p></speech>

The body would have processed personal data in breach of the Data Protection Acts which would then have a knock-on effect on that public body's ability to use that information.  That is one deterrent.  The other big deterrent is the potential that the subjects whose data has been processed illegally will be able to bring damages claims against that public body and it looks like they may be able to combine into class actions, and those claims may be quite significant.</p> <p>  It is really a policy decision for the Oireachtas as to how data protection would be enforced against public bodies.  There is a range of options.  It is a question of which is the most effective and whether one imposes finds or just says it will be left to a matter of legality plus the potential of damages claims to ensure that public bodies process personal data appropriately.</p></speech>

The group of people could get together and say that they would bring one representative action forward.  The Deputy will have seen that, for instance, in the Army deafness case, with big sets of actions where one saw individuals going forward with their claims being set.  That is one option.  The other option is that the rule against class actions, as I understand it, is basically set out in the rules of the superior courts and court judgments.  I would be surprised if one does not see lawyers bringing forward claims stating that they want to bring forward a class action and testing elements of that, and stating under Article 80 of the GDPR they are entitled to bring forward class actions and they want to bring forward those class actions.  Then the issue for the Oireachtas is that one can bring class actions, as stated in the GDPR, where provided for by member state law.  In a sense, does the Oireachtas want to govern that process or does one allow actions before the courts and decisions of the superior courts rules committee, which is, I suppose, where the action will move to otherwise if the Oireachtas does not consider that point?  One way or another, one will find oneself with some sort of representative or class action being brought the courts.</p></speech>

If, for example, where staff have taken social welfare data such as PPS numbers, one is looking at whether or not one should be able to prosecute staff for breaches is a matter, I suppose, for each Department's legislation to look at the Department's confidential information.  It is the obligation of the public body to control its confidential information and have effective controls in place.</p> <p>  In terms of members of staff who would breach that, on a statistical basis there will always be individual members of staff who are willing to break the law where there are financial incentives.  The first obligation has to be on the data controller to ensure he or she protects against that obvious risk.  Then if one is looking into that, one can ask, if somebody breaches the obligations of confidentiality, is there an effective deterrent against them?</p><p>One deterrent is that they can be prosecuted for a criminal offence.  The confidentiality provision in these heads is very good, because it does not actually provide for an offence.  The primary mechanism that one would want to bring against somebody for something like that is an action for damages, because the burden of proof is much lower.  One is then able to say that somebody can be sued for breaching a person's confidentiality.  The processes are not as rigorous.  There has to be a very high standard of proof to bring a prosecution against a person.</p><p> I think this sort of mechanism, whereby one can actually bring an action for damages against an individual who breaches confidentiality in that way, is potentially quite a good remedy.  On whether or not people working in public bodies should be subject to prosecution for breaching confidentiality, it is up to each public body to look at how personal data is secured, where the most sensitive pools of personal data are, what sort of operational or administrative protections - such as encryption - can be brought in to ensure the confidentiality of personal data, and whether it is useful to have the possibility of prosecuting people who breach that.  It is part of a suite of remedies.  I do not think it is sufficient in itself to say that if somebody breached that personal data and confidentiality, that person can be prosecuted.  I do not think that is sufficient.  Much more than that is needed.  This legislation would have to be very careful to not seem to water down the obligation on data controllers to ensure confidentiality of data that they process.  The dishonest employee is just one of a range of risks which they have to guard against.</p></speech>

There have been a number of questions focusing on local authorities and other public bodies.  Does Mr. Kelleher believe that there is a need to upgrade the legislation about this area?  I noted his earlier opening remarks where he talked about fines.  At the end of the day, it is coming out of the one pot into which it is going to return in any event.  It is not about the fine.  The fine is a disincentive to bad practice.  What other alternatives are there to ensure that the highest standards apply in local authorities?  Are there other sanctions that can be considered, other than fines, that would help ensure that the highest standards apply to public data held by public bodies and local authorities?  At the end of the day, the fines are academic.  Are there any particular sanctions that Mr. Kelleher thinks could be considered in this regard, in the context of this legislation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-21a.369" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Denis Kelleher" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017062100002#F00300"><p>It is difficult to say.  As I say, there is the possibility of illegality and damages claims being brought.  The main thing about this legislation is that it proposes a very high standard of procedural steps that data controllers like public authorities have to go through, including such things as data protection by design and the thought of appointing a data protection officer, DPO, and engaging in such things as data protection impact assessments.  There is a range of processes that they need to go through and to get in place.  It is going to be very challenging for them to be in a position to get those in place in the next year.</p> <p>  On the remedies, I take the Chairman's point on public authorities, because they have a particular status in law.  How does one impose a sanction on them?  It is a question for the legislature as to how it wants to impose that sort of penalty.  I can understand how there would be a certain level of unhappiness in a local authority, from people benefitting from services provided by that local authority, if they discover that the money that was going to be spent on their park, for example, is now being transferred back into public funds to pay a fine to the Data Protection Commissioner.  That is how it would be perceived even though all that would hopefully happen in that situation is that the money would come back out again.  One has to be careful not to get into that issue of perception about what is an effective remedy.</p> <p>  I take the Chairman's point that one has to look very carefully at whether or not there are effective sanctions.  The real risk and concern for the State here is rather than that circular transaction, which might ultimately create some bureaucracy, there may be damages claims being brought.  This may then result in people extracting money from the State and budgets being lowered quite significantly because public authorities have to pay out damages claims.  That would be my concern.</p></speech>

They are another break on people entrusted and employed within the system, ensuring that the system is fit for purpose and that there is no leak and no transgression relating to data protection.  I would have confidence in the overwhelming body of directly elected local representatives that they themselves would be as eager as we would to have the highest standards apply.</p> <p>  On the other matter, I asked the Data Protection Commissioner, DPC, questions here last week.  Be it commissioner or commission, as the case might be subsequent to this legislation, it is apparent from her responses and all I have read that she is and would be accountable to all Oireachtas committees as the case might be.  Is there not, in the normal situation, and one could identify any number of other public bodies with certain responsibilities, a natural direction with regard to accountability and coming before committees?  On head 13, does it need to clarify the Oireachtas committee to which the DPC would be accountable after the passage of the legislation?</p></speech>

Data is now being processed right across the State.  If there is a situation where the DPC could be called before any committee, she might find herself burdened with a significant workload, because there is no part of the State where personal data is not now being processed, both in the private and public sector.  The only other question that might be raised on that is on expertise.  As the Chairman has seen from the legislation, data protection is a particular area of law which requires its own particular expertise.  While one may have concerns about whether it might become diffuse, there are obviously benefits to having a single point of contact.  The DPC has to be accountable in some way.  The question for the Oireachtas is how that accountability mechanism is managed.</p></speech>

They found themselves in difficulty over the straitened years, which are hopefully now largely past, and their loans, with a substantial body of others - a loan book, <i>per se</i>- were sold off to a third financial institution, outside the jurisdiction in some cases.  People engaging with direct application to a local lender, whether through a local bank branch or whatever the case might be, have developed a relationship and trust, and all the information that they proffer to help secure a borrowing is also transferred, in some cases outside of the jurisdiction, and they are quite unaware of it.  I have no doubt that the answer is probably that they ticked a box or signed a contract that provided, in small print, that this can happen.</p><p>It is a damnable situation.  I am reflecting on grievous upset on the part of a not insubstantial number of people who have referred this issue to me.  I do not know if I am being targeted because my background is in the same realm.  Colleagues to whom I have spoken have had similar cases referred to them.</p></speech>

This issue has been argued before the High Court on several occasions.  It has also been argued before the European Court of Justice where somebody has signed a loan.  The leading European case is that of Probst <i>v.</i>mr.nexnet.  There have been a number of High Court cases in Ireland about this element of either securitisation of the loan of transfer of the loan.<br/><br/>One of the arguments they have made is that they did not consent to this and did not consent to the transfer of their personal data.  Typically what happens is that they look into the contract and where the contract allows for the transfer of one's personal data in that way, it just goes ahead.  People need to be very careful about the contracts they sign because once a person signs a contract that person is effectively providing the controller of those personal data with the ability to transfer or process the data for the purposes of the contract.  In one case, a lady objected to the securitisation of her loan and the High Court allowed for the securitisation.  The only clause they could find in her contract that allowed for securitisation was in fact the data protection clause, which allowed for the transfer of her personal data for the purposes of sale.  They read back from that that the contract, itself, allowed for the transfer of the sale of the loan.  If the contract allows for the sale of the loan in data protection law, that is sufficient.  I realise that it creates considerable upset and there are a large number of cases on this point.  It is settled law at this stage that if a person has agreed to it in the contract, the transfer can go ahead and can be processed for the purposes of debt recovery.</p></speech>

People take out these arrangements without going into the fine detail of the small print.  It is not in small print for any other reason than to dissuade people from studying it in any great depth and they do not do so.  Should there not be an obligation on financial institutions and others to state more prominently the detail relating to data protection in any contract signed whatever the case might be?  This needs to be heralded from the outset, not just with taking out a loan with a banking institution but in a much broader sense.</p></speech>

It has to be given in concise clearly understandable form and so forth.  There are clear obligations under data protection law and other laws to make it clear to people as to what will happen to them regarding the loan, how their data may be transferred and how enforcement proceedings may be brought against them.  The problem is that people tend not to read this.  There is the notorious situation of a whole field of people who have put up nonsensical terms and conditions such as agreeing to transferring one's immortal soul or one's first-born child in return for getting access to some social media service.  People typically sign these contracts without another thought.  People just do not read the terms and conditions.</p> <p>  There are provisions in the DPR trying to force controllers into setting out these terms and conditions in concise form.  Notwithstanding that, people do not read them and even when they read them, they seem to disregard them.</p></speech>

I did it deliberately because I wanted to draw attention to my perception of the situation, which is and was that the problems of rural Ireland and balanced regional development do not rate highly at all, at any level.  I did not expect, however, a serious and constructive response from the Chairman of this committee.  I thank him for inviting me here to make this presentation.  Regardless of its being an ordeal for me, it is worthwhile putting it forward.  It is also difficult for me because I am a personal friend of the previous Taoiseach and would not want what I say to damage our personal relationship, whatever about our political relationship.<br/><br/>I read the instructions or protocols on making a presentation here. They require me to make a written submission, which I have done.  I hope members have had an opportunity to read it.  The protocols also state I can make an oral presentation, which is what I am doing now, and it is stated I must avoid repetition and confine my remarks to a maximum of five minutes.  I do not intend to be anywhere close to five minutes.  I am not sure how I can avoid repetition because the whole matter can all be summarised in the sentence that the WDC is a very powerful organisation with tremendous potential.  I do not believe it has been taken seriously.  I used an analogy recently that I hope is not taken as being to facile.  As chairman, I was presented with a very powerful car but I never found out whether I could drive it or not because we were never given the keys or petrol.  We were never empowered to make use of the power of the organisation.<br/><br/>There is an improvement over the previous time I had to come here, which was when I was being proposed for my position.  There was only one member of the committee present for that meeting.  A chairman had to be found somewhere.  Back then, the status of the WDC was not taken very seriously and I am glad that has improved here.  <br/><br/>It is fortunate we are to have a Minister for rural affairs.  I do not know whether I should take any credit for it or not.  There is no harm in taking credit; we all do it sometimes. I do not know whether I could claim to have had some impact on the thinking.  I would like to think so but I do not believe that is the case.  To be serious about it, I welcome the appointment of the Minister, Deputy Michael Ring.  He is the ideal man for the job and I wish him well.  I hope he does very well.<br/><br/>The submission I made has outlined for members some of the details of what the WDC feels it has achieved over the years.  Let me mention a few points briefly.  The Western Investment Fund has invested &euro;48 million.  Grants or funds were provided to it of &euro;34 million, which became &euro;48 million.  No moneys are coming to it now because it is a self-financing fund.  Some &euro;3 million per annum is available from the revolving element of the fund.  I has not been responsible for but involved in the creation of 2,200 jobs.  I am told that if a multiplier effect is applied to that, it could equate to 5,000 jobs, which is very substantial in the region.  The PAYE take from people employed in companies assisted by the WDC in 2014 and 2015 was &euro;17 million.  I do not know whether the Chairman would like me to go through other achievements and publications.  They are in an appendix that I circulated.  One can see publications on natural gas, renewable energy, broadband, rail, international air access and the creative economy.  We have developed a website called , which has won awards against companies such as Guinness and ESB.  It is a very successful website that promotes the west.  It was run by the WDC. <br/><br/>One might assume from the attainment of all those achievements that neither I nor anybody else would give out about the priority being given to the WDC.  The GDP for the region is only 85% of the EU average.  The same figure for Ireland is 130%.  Statistics for 2014 show that regional GDP per person in the west was 76% of that in the State overall.  There is much slower job recovery in the west, at just 2.8%, which is less than half that in the rest of the State, at 6.3%.<br/><br/>  There is higher youth unemployment in the west among those between 15 and 24.  The rate is 30.8%, substantially higher than the 20% in the rest of State.<br/><br/>I was involved in voluntary community work all my life.  I took on the job with great enthusiasm and excitement because I was aware that the people working there are excellent.  It is a small bunch of very committed people.  I thought we would make great progress.  Instead, there was no board in place for three months very soon after my appointment, from February 2014 to May 2014.  One might have believed this would be a once-off and would not be repeated but the fact is that there has been no board in place since February.  Therefore, an even longer period has elapsed this time.<br/><br/>The non-pay allocation for staff was reduced from &euro;1.5 million in 2008 to &euro;0.5 million in 2015, a decrease of 66%.  The staff number has fallen, from 17 to 11, a decrease of 35%.  The CEO position has been vacant for a total of five years, from 2011 to the present.  There is no great indication of any great commitment to the organisation.<br/><br/>Through my relationship with the former Taoiseach, we had a meeting with his economic advisor, a man called Mr. Andrew McDowell.  I am not supposed to mention names; I am sorry.  Do I withdraw that?</p></speech>

The final straw for me was that, mistakenly or otherwise, that &euro;2 million was put into a capital fund.</p><p>The Western Development Commission, WDC, could not use the money because we had no wish to buy anything of a capital nature.  I spent the last 18 months of my term there as chairman trying to have that moved from capital expenditure to current expenditure.  That has not happened to date.  I leave it to the committee's assessment of how seriously we are taking it.<br/><br/>I thought when the committee kindly invited me to come here that I had better check if anyone else felt like this.  I checked round with a few people in case I was just giving out.  I checked with somebody who did consultancy work for the Western Development Commission while I was there.  This person wrote back to me, saying, &quot;I can well appreciate your sentiments on the matter.  I always felt there was a real lack of engagement by the Department in the WDC's mandate.  They are a talented bunch with much skill and knowledge&quot;.  I can only emphasise that.  It continues with &quot;but I have never really been able to mobilise or utilise it to great effect, or when they have, they ultimately found themselves being suppressed by various actors.&quot;  That has been my experience and that is my message here today.  It is a good organisation which probably could achieve much, and is not taken seriously.  I personally felt like an unwanted child.  I am not sure what the reason is.  Sometimes I think it is because the WDC was landed on our administration.  It emerged from a campaign by the bishops, &quot;Crusade for Survival&quot;.  I think it has been, at best, tolerated rather than encouraged.<br/><br/>I hope that people on this committee will agree with some of what I am saying, take it on board, and try to have the whole issue of the decline of rural Ireland addressed seriously and increased in priority in political terms.  I hope that it may cause a change of mind and mindset at official level.  There are many programmes in existence.  One person that I also asked said that it might be worth making the point to the committee that the Leader programme - that is the EU programme for rural areas - is absolutely strangled.  A year since kick-off, there has still been no money approved because of the bureaucrats' fear that someone will make off with a euro.  There are other comments from other people, but maybe I have said enough.  I want to leave an impression and to try to convince people that I was an honest person with a good board and a really dedicated staff.  The only time that anyone had any interest in what we were doing or not doing was on matters of governance.  I do not think that is the way to motivate people or to get the best out of them.  A long time ago, a much better author than me, John Healy, wrote <i>No One Shouted Stop</i>.  Rural Ireland is declining.  It will become a major issue, like the housing issue, if we do not address it now and deal with it.  I ask people to begin to shout stop, or to begin to shout, maybe, start.<br/><br/>I brought some literature about the WDC which the committee may wish to have circulated later.</p></speech>

Fracking will also be a big issue for rural Ireland and rural communities.  I apologise in advance, because I have to go into the Seanad to speak to that debate.</p> <p>  I thank Mr. McGuinness for his courage in what he has done in the past number of months.  I do not underestimate how difficult it was for him to do that.  He already referred to his long-standing relationship with the former Taoiseach, so for somebody like Mr. McGuinness to come out and say these things because they were so important for rural Ireland and the west is huge.  It speaks to all of what we are trying to do here and what we have been trying to do for years.</p> <p>  I also acknowledge the work of the Western Development Commission, including under Mr. McGuinness as chairperson, and all of the reports and strategic framework that it provided over the years, because that has all served to unite communities and to try to bring about a united response to the huge problem we have.  Going through and examining Mr. McGuinness' submission from today, I think he hit some key aspects.  I want to acknowledge what he and the Western Development Commission have already achieved.  I also want to acknowledge what he has done outside the Western Development Commission, including his foundation of Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, with others, and the Mayo campus of the GMIT and what is happening with that and the threats and battle there to try to develop that in the way that it should be developed.  I know he has always been a positive person and has always looked for opportunity and to bring people together to enhance that opportunity for rural Ireland.  Mr. McGuinness said that his ambition was not matched at either political or administrative level, and I think that hits the nail on the head.  He said that he was naive.  I would not say that he was naive, but that he was always ambitious for rural Ireland, as I would like to think I am myself.  There is a difference between being ambitious and being naive.</p> <p>  Mr. McGuinness referred to relating to governance and the concentration on governance.  The first question I would ask is if he thinks the institutionalised thinking of some of our Departments and representatives is a deterrent to tackling what is really happening in rural Ireland.</p></speech>

I have no semblance of doubt that it is a deterrent and a real negative.  I am not sure how that can be dealt with.  It has probably gone on since the State was formed, but for some strange reason, at rural affairs level, it is very dominant.  I do not want to be negative all the time, and I do this often, but I believe that there is a huge need to reduce the level of bureaucracy in this area.  I feel that most communities are anxious to help in solving their own problems.  A minor suggestion to think about would be to set up a fund to make a certain amount of money available to any community that has a reasonably coherent plan, providing it could match it with the same amount of money itself, with absolutely no strings attached, and almost a condition that it would not become involved in bureaucratic activity, and that further moneys to that community or communities would only be made available on the basis of achievement.  It may be too simple but I think it could work.  We hear about "bottom-up" all the time, but I can say that, at the bottom, there is not much chance of getting up that ladder.</p></speech>

I think what Mr. McGuinness is trying to say is that flexibility is needed in the approach to be able to adapt directly to the needs of each community.  The only way we can empower communities and build capacity within communities is to allow them to have that bit of flexibility.  If Mr. McGuinness contrasts that to the problems that he experienced in trying to change the &euro;2 million expenditure from capital to current expenditure, if he had gone out and bought something that was maybe not all that necessary, or that was certainly not a priority, but fitted under the capital heading, then that would have been okay.  The question is if Mr. McGuinness believes huge sums of money are wasted because of restrictions on how money is spent and that maybe items - maybe even capital items - are purchased and that it is all coming from the taxpayers' public purse.</p></speech>

We saw some of the figures released last week for places such as Ard na R&iacute; in Ballina where the rate of unemployment is 31.4%.  In my area, Binghamstown, the rate is at 29.9% and in the Ballina urban area, 27.7%.  However, the narrative and Government policy are being framed by the fact that there is almost full employment.  The disparity experienced by the communities from which we come has not been addressed.  There is not even an acknowledgement of the extent of the problem and until we get such an acknowledgement, we cannot hope to find real sustainable solutions.  Does Mr. McGuinness agree with me?</p></speech>

I used that quotation because I had checked with people involved in community work and rural affairs.  I had no connection at all with the Leader programme.  It is evidence to support my case from someone who has been working through the Leader programme.  Personally, I do not know.</p></speech>

It takes decision-making out of local communities and makes the process more bureaucratic.  I have deep concerns about the depreciation in value of the Leader programme this time around.  There have been major mistakes made which I will address at another forum.  One of the biggest assets in the west is the Corrib gas project.  It pains me to see high levels of unemployment and emigration, but at the same time it should be remembered that it was the policy of a previous Government to give terms to oil companies which involved tax write-offs on their costs incurred all over the world.  Surely that needs to be changed.</p></speech>

It should be noted that he has made a major contribution in the west and a major statement in saying he did not want to be reappointed.  Unfortunately, it did not raise any issue in the national media.  If it had been any other agency or an agency based in Dublin, days would have been spent talking about the crisis, but there was no such effect.</p> <p>  When the Western Development Commission was set up, I was very sceptical about it because nobody had talked to the existing agencies to say the commission would deal with particular items in the west.  It was not like SFADCo in the days of Brendan O'Regan where it had incredible power in Shannon, the results of which we can still see to this day in that region.  Does Mr. McGuinness agree that one of the major problems faced by the commission was the silo effect, with all of the agencies and Departments acting in their own interests and holding onto power and not being willing to release it to a major agency that would have major funding and a major role to play in business and industrial development in the west?</p></speech>

SFADCo was one example.  I could refer to the way the Gaeltacht co-ops were treated in my time compared to now.  We had a meeting recently with past and present co-op managers who could not believe the way we had been treated.  When we got into financial trouble, we were bailed out and the result is there are hundred of jobs in the most unlikely of places.  Does Mr. McGuinness agree that there were development models in the past that were not hamstrung by bureaucracy, which seems to be the case today?  Mr. McGuinness comes from County Mayo.  Does he agree that if Monsignor Horan, if he was alive, were to try to do today what he did then, the governance guys would close him down and that all he would have was an Aer Arann landing strip at the top of Barr na Cuiga?</p></speech>

My experience of the 1970s and the 1980s in the Gaeltacht was that the Secretaries General of the Department had enormous power for good and were very brave in the decisions they took.  When they needed to assist people who were struggling, they assisted them with a minimum of bureaucracy.  Would I be right in thinking that no matter what Mr. McGuinness's chief executive put forward, he would hit a block wall?  The system was so rigid and careful to count the pennies, it was stopping anything happening?</p></speech>

Virtually no money has been spent this year by the Department on what will be regional and rural affairs on the capital side.  Any expenditure literally relates to the administration of the Leader programme.  That means there will be a rush to try to spend money by the end of the year or else there will be a major underspend.  If &euro;5 million or &euro;10 million were given to the western investment fund as a kick-in, does Mr. McGuinness believe that could be usefully spent on job creation in the west?</p></speech>

In terms of community schemes that would not have an immediate payback but rather a long-term payback, our executive in Ballaghaderreen has many plans for such investment but does not have the money.</p></speech>

Does he believe a bold decision like that - he knows my preference was the site at Knock airport, which crazily was knocked by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, but I will settle for Charlestown where a site was purchased - would make a psychological difference and show from day one that we are now in a new dispensation, and I am sure the jobs in that part of Mayo would be very welcome.</p></speech>

We are choked by bureaucracy to the point of inertia, jobs not getting done, obfuscation and hiding behind the language of it.  What Departments are we talking about?  I am sitting here now, but at one stage this committee was dealing with the beekeepers.  We then had birds in the bushes, part of the arts, rural development, regional development and the Irish language.  What Departments was Mr. McGuinness dealing with?  That is the first question.</p> <p>  Will Mr. McGuinness outline the biggest choke of all in terms of bureaucracy?  He mentioned turf wars and governance versus creativity.  What Departments is Mr. McGuinness talking about?  what does he believe our role here should be now, and would he be involved in it?  Despite what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said, which is a brilliant idea, what would Mr. McGuinness do now?</p> <p>  From my knowledge of politics over the past five years, and even from writing a report, which is completely different, I believe that all roads lead to Rome.  It seems to me that the most creative communities are closed down because of territory or funding, and that creativity is not even used or copied in other areas.  The communities are not listened to.  Will Mr. McGuinness talk about that?  Did he come across a community that was doing something unique which did not get the funding or could not go forward?</p> <p>  How much does he believe the Minister, Deputy Ring, knows about this?  Has he experience of it?  He is a west of Ireland man.  He has been involved in tourism and sport, both of which traverse politics and in which Mr. McGuinness plays a major part.  How knowledgeable is the Minister of the choking of those areas?  It is a type of put-down by Governments over creativity.  Does the Minister know what Mr. McGuinness's organisation is saying?  I do not know what Department we are in yet.  The Chairman might inform us of the Department it would be best to contact.  We are caught between the devil and the deep blue sea.  It is literally a case of a bit of this, that and the other and whatever you are having yourself outside Tulsk.  Mr. McGuinness might answer some of those questions because what he has had to say is a new sweep, so to speak.  Rather than him leaving it all behind, we need him more than ever.  Is Mr. McGuinness definite about the fact his contribution would be in the background?  Would he be prepared to bring that experience to a new regime or does he believe that nothing will change?  I am asking Mr. McGuinness to respond to what is a more general conversation.</p></speech>

They are all very interesting and I will try to deal with some of them.</p> <p>  The one about Departments is very relevant.  At almost every change of Government since it was formed, this area moved to some other Department.  It was in arts and culture, agriculture, the environment and, before the creation of a rural affairs Ministry, it was back in arts.  One could be forgiven for thinking it was a case of, "This piece is left over.  Where will we shove it?"  It is indicative of the thinking around rural Ireland.</p> <p>  On the choking point, if one were to prioritise it, it would be bureaucracy, a lack of empathy at senior Civil Service level and therefore right down along the line.  I will not be very popular with people working in those Departments, but that is the reality.  As to whether the Minister, Deputy Ring, knows, I do not know.  He is a man of action, as Senator Conway would know, so we would be hopeful.</p> <p>  The suggestion from Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v about moving the Department there would be a huge step for rural Ireland, not only in setting it up but also in terms of the message it would send out.</p><p> What else needs to be done?  In spite of all of us, including me, having all the answers, the matter of rural decline is very complex and it probably needs really serious worthwhile study.  I would be worried that the Minister, Deputy Ring, would not want to hear about another study.  An issue as complex as rural decline is worth studying seriously.  We all know it is a worldwide phenomenon of people moving from rural parts to cities, but I suspect somewhere in the world has managed to cope with it.  We should always follow best practice if there are examples of it somewhere else.</p><p> With regard to Senator O'Donnell's question about my role, with governance the way it is now, the door is bolted and the horse is gone.  I am not sure about that.</p></speech>

We are very involved and we are writing a report about rural development and the sustaining of rural communities.  It is the oldest story in the world, as out the door goes the experience and we start all over again.  I am not ageist.  One of the recommendations is to use the brilliance that has been there.  The witness has made a distinctive and distinguished contribution and it cannot just go out the door.  He has also made a very honest mark on it by saying it is useless not only to ask him to stay but to ask anyone else to stay, even the Michael O'Learys of this world, mar dhea, if we are not going to be listened to, if we are choked, money is not released to projects and creativity will not be answered.  That is the reason I asked the question of the witness.  It is not about jobs but rather experience and knowledge that we should be aware of.  He is the first person I have seen in my six years here who has said he will not continue as no one is paying a blind bit of notice.  He said it in a far more elegant way than I have put it and in a far more political way.  He is right in what he outlined.  It is nothing short of a disgrace.</p></speech>

Mr. McGuinness is a brave man who has made a stand of conviction, which is not regularly visible in this country, unfortunately, and in these spaces.  When the witness was here representing the Western Development Commission with some of the staff, I was so impressed with the model that I thought it should almost be replicated in other regions in order that it could become a template to be copied and put elsewhere, especially with regard to long-term development.  One of the points mentioned by the witness's colleagues was that a great deal of effort was going into long-term investments that would not necessarily have a short-term business plan feasibility factor but over time would make a much better contribution to the environment.</p> <p>  Mr. McGuinness's view is that the capacity and effectiveness of the Western Development Commission was good but hampered or hamstrung by a lack of political energy behind it and departmental issues.  The witness used the word "oppressed" when speaking about the effects of the Department.  Is that a fair analysis of the experience?</p></speech>

A Minister of State asked if a turf war was being sought when Mr. McGuinness simply sought to identify what exactly would constitute an enhanced role.  It seems we cannot necessarily ask the Civil Service to reform itself, but elected representatives have the responsibility to reform and ensure these processes function.  Was Mr. McGuinness able to speak to anyone in the political sphere to try to break the logjam being experienced?</p></speech>

With regard to the Departments, would it be a good idea to have a recruitment policy that would bring in far more people from outside the Civil Service on a regular basis?  This could lead to a churn of people developing in the system and those coming from outside who may have different types of experience, perspectives and approaches.</p></speech>

I am very encouraged by the committee's assessment of what I have said.  The members are the people with political power and I am greatly encouraged by the way they see merit and truth in what I am saying.  As a result, I am optimistic that the committee will put forward proposals and plans to address this shocking issue.  The Western Development Commission is such a small organisation but it has great potential.  It has people who have come not just from the Civil Service and there is a great mindset.  It has been sat on, as it were, for so long and this would continue but for the fact I have raised the matter.  I do not want any credit for that.  I am very encouraged by the way all the members have responded, and from that a different mindset will come.</p></speech>

It is shocking.  People outside the political world ask me and, I am sure, other elected representatives every day how the State can be so impractical in its delivery of services.  A senior Minister has said there is much capture, as it is called, going on.  A Minister would go into a particular role with very strong views of what should happen and high hopes.</p><p>All of a sudden, however, the Minister is surrounded by ten or 15 experts, possibly with PhDs, who can think of 100 reasons for not taking the most logical steps, and this leads to a freezing of action in Departments.  We are near to the completion of a report which hopes to identify a large number of recommendations and actions which will be given to the new Minister, hopefully to implement.  The evidence given by the witnesses will inform a large part of our thinking and the content of that report.</p></speech>

I live in Ballaghaderreen which is the headquarters of the WDC.  Ballaghaderreen is like many other towns but not all rural communities are the same.  As Mr. McGuinness said, rural decline is a complex issue.  In my first contribution in the Seanad, this time last year, I asked for a detailed analysis of each town and its hinterland in order that we could understand the challenges and opportunities.  I believed then that the Western Development Commission had a huge role to play in looking at the analysis and I still believe that.  I am as frustrated as Mr. McGuinness that we have not seen progress.  There is an action plan for rural development and a certain level of funding through CL&Aacute;R and the town and village renewal scheme, but there needs to be a bottom-up approach and this needs proper support and investment.</p> <p>  I am involved in the town team in Ballaghaderreen and we face huge challenges which are similar to other rural areas, with a high rate of vacancy and unfinished housing estates that have not yet been taken in charge because of the construction industry of the 2000s.  We have a high rate of unemployment and we need proper support in order that more young people will want to come back to rural areas.  While we have many challenges, there is a lot of good, there is a good quality of life and I am very proud to live in a rural area.</p> <p>  I know about a lot of the work in which the WDC is involved, such as its extensive research.  We have excellent researchers and I know many of them.  The research is important as it provides the evidence for the need for investment and funding.  Senator O'Donnell spoke of the creative sector, and the WDC has done a huge amount of work to develop the creative sector.  It sees huge potential for this in the western region, and I agree on that.  It is also looking at renewable energies such as biomass or district heating, and a lot needs to be done in those areas.  We need to know what needs to change.  Mr. McGuinness said bureaucracy needs to be reduced, balanced with a governing structure, and it is extremely difficult for community groups and business people to overcome so many unnecessary obstacles.  He also spoke of the need for communities to come up with a coherent plan which could be funded through the WDC.  Is there anything else he feels needs to change in order that the Western Development Commission can be supported in its work and reach its potential to impact positively on rural areas?</p></speech>

The ability of the commission should be recognised and taken seriously and it should be reporting at the level of assistant secretary, at the minimum.  Senator O'Donnell asked what was happening at the moment.  The answer is "Nothing".  People are doing their work but nothing much is happening.  Under the current way of thinking, that could go on for the entire duration of the next board.  No one is asking what we are doing, how we are doing it or what targets we are meeting.  We are required to have a strategic plan and I got a commitment to lobby and campaign into our most recent plan, but we were asked to take it out as it was not part of our remit, even though it is more or less what I am doing today before this committee.  We were asked to take it down from the website.  That is what needs to change.</p></speech>

Do further relationships need to be built across the different authorities to achieve its goal?</p></speech>

We do not have capacity to do much with other authorities.  When we had a small budget we got other county councils to come in and put together a package to promote Knock airport, resulting in a lot of extra traffic through the airport.  That is just one example, and there is scope for more co-operation, particularly with local authorities, but without a budget there is not much one can do other than talk.</p></speech>

That is what needs to change and there needs to be a shift of mindset in order that we do not just state the problems but invest in fixing the problems.</p><p>It is very disappointing to hear that a person who is extremely passionate about rural areas has had to make this decision.  Mr. McGuinness has not come here without reason.  He has come here because he has identified significant issues with the functioning of the WDC and I certainly know that this committee will do everything it can, along with the Minister, Deputy Ring, with whom I know Mr. McGuinness has worked closely down through the years.  The Minister is about delivery and we need to make sure that he is briefed on the challenges.  If he does not know about it then he needs to know.  We will do that and I hope Mr. McGuinness will stay involved in some capacity because his experience is important. </p></speech>

I thank him very much for his courage and his honesty.  As all the other speakers have said, it takes a very brave, big person to do what he has done and to take the ultimate decision, because of principles, to step aside from the job he was appointed to do.  I say well done to him.  It is great to be able to have this frank and honest discussion about how we prioritise rural Ireland.</p> <p>  I have some questions based on Mr. McGuinness's experience and having seen what he has seen.  We are inundated with groups that repeat what Mr. McGuinness has presented here today around the stringent and laborious, rules preventing them from accessing the millions of euro in funding that is supposed to be there for groups in Leader programme funding.  The groups and the people who are behind the applications - including volunteers in many cases - are willing to take on these types of projects, they have the creativity, capacity, ability and a definite need for the projects they put forward to Leader.  In Mr. McGuinness's experience, does he believe anything could be wrong in their applications or is there something that they are not doing right in regard to the Leader programme funding being so inaccessible to them or is it just down to bureaucracy?  We could be told that the applications are not good enough, or that the people behind the applications are not expert enough, or do not have the experience to carry these projects through.  In Mr. McGuinness's experience is it the case that the people, the will, the enthusiasm and the creativity are on the ground to do it and they are just not being let do it?</p></speech>

The Leader programme, however, was never involved in one of the organisations from which I have managed to escape.  I believe that the spirit is there, and the Senator prompts me to suggest a group to look at - if she has not already spoken to or listened to them - called  Communities Creating Jobs.  They are in Dunhill, way out in the wilds of Waterford.  They are based on the belief, and have proof of it to quite an extent, that each community can create ten jobs.  They have a pilot scheme up and running in co-operation with National University of Ireland Galway and the GAA.  It sounds like a great model.  Again, they cannot get any Government take-up on the model to expand it.  Forgive me for making the suggestion but it may be worthwhile for this committee to hear from Dr. Senan Cooke and I will pass on his contact details.

I ask obvious questions but I want Mr. McGuinness to state it for the record.  We know that Brexit is one of the biggest issues to face Ireland in the next decade.  For me and for most of the people around here rural Ireland is of the same importance.  In Mr. McGuinness's opinion is the portfolio worthy of an entire Department for itself and of not being tagged on to a Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs or anything else?  As Mr. McGuinness said earlier, rural Ireland has been tagged on to various Departments over the years.  Is it worthy of a Department in its own right?</p></speech>

It is not the case that rural Ireland is just forgotten about and is not seen as important.  There is a deliberate attempt to sideline rural Ireland and there is a focus, not just coming from any major city in Ireland, but also from further afield, to prevent people living in and setting up businesses in rural Ireland.  Is there a deliberate attempt to usher people in to the more urban areas?</p></speech>

One-off housing is a very controversial issue.  That is the only evidence I have seen of a deliberate attempt.  I believe it is more a case of omission than being deliberate.  We are just not taken seriously.  Any issue that is neglected for long enough becomes a real issue.  We have the current example of housing and I predict that this will happen in rural Ireland if we do not address it and take it seriously.  I take the Deputy's point.</p></speech>

I believe that I was here when Mr. McGuinness came in to the committee as a newly appointed chairman of the WDC and he was full of vigour and enthusiasm for the position.  It is very disappointing that he is no longer the chairman, obviously, but I share in the appreciation that he has spoken so candidly on the issues around the WDC.</p> <p>  I get a sense that this malaise goes back almost ten or 15 years.  Consider what happened to community development and rural development when we had a whole process of alignment of the community development programmes, CDPs, with the partnership companies.  We then had the cohesion of the partnership companies with the Leader programme companies.  We are now seeing the pulling back of control from Leader companies to the local community development committees, LCDCs.  I am seeing a trend towards centralisation where the Government Departments are sucking everything back into the centre and I get a sense that it is because they do not trust - or do not want - the local communities to make the decisions for themselves.  Many times the Departments use the argument that it is about governance issues, that one cannot trust the people out there in those small little companies, that they are all too different, that they cannot run their own businesses etc.  We have seen, however, classic examples of companies that went completely belly up and funds went all over the place and they were supposedly under the governance of the Government Departments.  One only has to look at the Gaeltacht areas to see where this happened in a catastrophic manner.  I do not buy the argument that local communities could not manage their own affairs.  I believe they can but they are not being trusted to do it.  Would Mr. McGuinness agree with the analysis that there is a sucking of control straight back in to the centre because the Departments want to control the moneys and tell everybody where it is to be spent?  They put on the veneer that it is a bottom-up issue, they tick the EU funding box about the money supposedly being decided at a local level but really the control lies in the Departments and one cannot spend a penny without their permission, ticking their boxes and filling in all their paperwork.</p></speech>

There is strong evidence that they would hope to go even further with that.</p></speech>

Is it by default or by design is the only other question to be asked.  Mr. McGuinness spoke about the difficulties he has had with the Government Department regarding the &euro;2 million in his own funds that he wanted to try to move across.  Does the witness believe that it was just incompetence or a lack of time?  Is it the case of a lack of staff in the Department to be able to address an issue or was it in some sense by design that they were trying to frustrate the efforts of the WDC to do what it was supposed to be doing?</p></speech>

When it happened I thought it was a mistake.  I had access, politically, to the top level in the country, and 18 months of that failed to have it changed.</p></speech>

Mr. McGuinness mentioned the co-funding issue.  For a lot of projects one would look to the county councils to get co-funding.  When we meet with county councils or local authorities we find that their discretionary funding has also been heavily curtailed.  The amount of money they may have had to spend on co-financing projects previously is also drying up.  In a lot of cases one finds that there is a budget allocated nationally but that the boxes cannot be ticked because co-funding cannot be secured.  Has Mr. McGuinness also found that it is very difficult to fulfil those co-funding requirements?</p></speech>

We had no funds to co-fund with anybody during my time.</p></speech>

It is very stark.  It is my opinion that what has gone on here is absolutely disgraceful and certainly needs to be addressed.  We need to see local actors re-empowered to take control of developments in their own areas and their own communities.  We need to trust them and give them the wherewithal and the permission to do that.</p> <p>  The other issue I mentioned, and Mr. McGuinness mentioned it himself, is around that clause on lobbying that had to be taken out.  I find that quite a lot of people who depend on funding from State agencies or Departments are practically gagged from speaking out against anything because their funding may be cut or they may be threatened with some form of action if they even criticise.  It is very detrimental, in the modern republic which we are told we have, that people cannot engage in a critical manner and speak out openly about problems that they see.  In many cases these are the people at the coalface, who realise what the issues really are and could help resolve them and make sure that the money is spent in a better way.  I get the sense that must have been frustrating for Mr. McGuinness as well and that the only way he could speak out was by extricating himself from that position.</p></speech>

It is not an easy thing to do to come in and tell one's story like Mr. McGuinness has done.  We greatly sympathise with him because we can understand greatly what is happening.  Take our own Leader programme in Kerry.  There were three excellent companies delivering the Leader programme.  There was North and East Kerry Development, South Kerry Development Partnership and IRD Duhallow.  Up until 2013, everything was working fine.  They were getting funding and they were giving it out.  The new proposal, which was set rolling by the then Minister, Phil Hogan, has finished the whole thing.  There are 18 stages of approval now for the Leader programme.  Not one cent has gone to any company.</p> <p>  As Mr. McGuinness said himself, communities want to help themselves.  All they need is a bit of financial help and a bit of support.  They are not getting it now.  The Leader programme was about a rural, bottom-up approach up until now.  We were the envy of all of Europe in respect of the way in which it was run.  Now, however, it is terrible.  I can understand Mr. McGuinness's reasons for not wanting to be part of it anymore because it has fallen apart.  It is so sad really.  </p> <p>  I have no apologies to make to anyone.  All the Government is doing at the present time is manipulating the figures.  The only employment in certain villages around the rural countryside now is community employment, CE, schemes.  The minute a person goes on a CE scheme he or she is no longer unemployed in their books.  That is the only thing that is reducing the figures in rural Ireland.  There are no jobs being created.  Every morning when I wake up there are another 100 or 200 jobs announced for Dublin.  When I go out the gate here every evening there are tower cranes all around.  One would wonder how they do not get stuck in each other as they twist around, there are so many of them.  </p> <p>  We do not have that in the west of Ireland.  The farther west one goes, the worse it gets.  I do not think this Government has the will or the inclination to address the issues of rural Ireland.  We have been denied infrastructure, broadband, roads and so forth.  Every available penny one can see - and I do not know how much funding is available - is all being spent here on underground projects and overground, on the Luas and whatever else.  We do not begrudge the people of Dublin, but we want fair play as well.  </p> <p>  I can understand Mr. McGuinness's frustration about what has happened to his excellent company.  I personally did not know about it.  I can see from today that it was doing the very same kind of work that our development companies were doing in Kerry.  They are stranded now.  They are stopped.  They wonder every day where the next euro will come from.  They are dropping people like flies.  They cannot pay them.  Something needs to be done for that wonderful programme, which I raised in the D&aacute;il Chamber again since I left here.  </p> <p>  It is as if they do not want to give out the money.  There are 18 stages of approval.  Like everything this Government does, it is announced three or four times because nothing has been spent.  There is some hurdle that has to be jumped or something that prevents it starting.  It is the same with the housing.  It is the same with everything.  There are four stages of approval for local authorities to build houses and then the Minister says that he has removed those obstacles.  That is not fair.  That is a blatant untruth.  Yes, the local authorities can go for a two-stage approval, but if any extra costs arise on the site or in the building works the local authority has to foot the bill for the extra costs.  That is not fair.  They are just not being fair and they just do not want to know.  </p> <p>  I thank Mr. McGuinness for coming in to us.  We are very appreciative for his time in doing that.  It was not easy on his own.  I thank him.  He is very welcome here and if there is anything that we can do for him in the future I hope he will contact us. </p></speech>

I will finish with a small bit of humour.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh is correct.  The previous time I came before the committee I was bearing my soul as the incoming chair.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh and Deputy Luke Flanagan were here.  I believe they were the only two people here.  When I was finished, Deputy Flanagan said that I seemed to be an honest man and that the committee would give me its blessing.  He made a prediction however.  He said that when my term was up I would not have made a bloody bit of difference to Ballaghaderreen or Castlerea.  Those were the two towns he mentioned.  I hope that as a result of what I have done here today and the interest members of the committee have taken and the sincerity with which they have responded, that it will not be thrown at whoever replaces me that he did not make any difference to Ballaghaderreen or Castlerea or Castletownbere or wherever and that we will begin to make a difference to rural Ireland.</p></speech>
