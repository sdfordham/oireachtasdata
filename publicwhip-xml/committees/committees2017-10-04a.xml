    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-04a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emily Logan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017100400002#D00300"><p>Thank you very much, Chair.  I also thank the members of the committee.  On behalf of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, I thank the committee for the opportunity to meet in this module of its deliberations.  I would like to briefly outline the institutional structure and legislative basis of the commission for members of the committee and members of the public who may be less acquainted with our work.  The commission is Ireland's independent national human rights and equality institution.  It was established in primary legislation in the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014, following the merger of the precursor bodies of the Equality Authority and the Human Rights Commission and it has been in operation since November 2014.</p> <p>  Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally and I are two of 15 members of the commission, appointed by the Head of State, the President, following an open competition and resolution by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  We have no reporting relationship to Government and account directly to the Oireachtas for our statutory functions.  We appear today, to represent the views of the commission, which for the record, are contained in our recent policy statement on a new legal and regulatory framework on abortion in Ireland, in light of its international human rights obligations.  The statement was submitted to the committee on Monday.  It will come as no surprise to the committee that we do not have consensus at the commission on this matter but, procedurally, section 16 of the Act facilitates majority decision making.  In practice, that means that when we meet in plenary we take a vote on matters that are contested and this matter has been put to the commission on ten occasions since its inception in 2014.  What we bring before the committee today represents the views of 13 out of 15 members of the commission.  Two members of the commission do not support the document in its entirety.  The commission's independence has been recognised internationally and we have been awarded A status accreditation at the United Nations, under the UN Paris Principles.  Those principles set out the necessary guarantees required to ensure that a national human rights institution can carry out its functions in full independence, free from any form of political or other pressure.  Through a range of legal powers determined by the Oireachtas, we are mandated to promote and protect human rights and equality in the State.</p> <p>  Of most relevance to today's discussion, is section 10(2) of the 2014 Act, which is to "keep under review the adequacy and effectiveness of law and practice in the State relating to the protection of human rights and equality".  Under section 10 of the Act the commission is also mandated "to consult with such national, European Union or international bodies or agencies having a knowledge or expertise in the field of human rights or equality as it sees fit".  Ireland has ratified six of the nine core UN human rights treaties and is bound by those obligations as a matter of international law.  For each treaty, there is an expert independent monitoring committee that oversees compliance.  Ireland's compliance with the treaties is examined on a periodic basis and under our legislative mandate, the commission formally participates as the national independent monitor of human rights in this process and monitors the State's compliance with the recommendations.</p> <p>  UN treaty monitoring committees have regularly raised concerns regarding the current legal position in Ireland in relation to abortion.  Most notably, in 2016 and 2017 the UN Human Rights Committee found that Ireland had violated a number of rights of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, following complaints taken by Amanda Mellet and Siobh&aacute;n Whelan, both of whom experienced pregnancies with fatal foetal abnormalities.  I use that term as it is well understood.  I know it offends some but it is important that we all know what we are talking about.  In Amanda Mellet's case the UN Human Rights Committee found a violation of Article 7, namely, the prohibition on cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.  The committee took the view that many of the negative experiences could have been avoided if Ms Mellet had not been prohibited from terminating her pregnancy in the familiar environment of her own country and under the care of the health professionals whom she knew and trusted.</p> <p>  The committee also found a violation of Article 17, namely, protecting the right to privacy, stating that: "the interference in Ms Mellet's decision as to how best to cope with her non-viable pregnancy was unreasonable and arbitrary".  The committee also found a violation of Article 26, namely, equality before the law, taking into account the financial cost of travelling to the UK.  The facts of the 2017 Siobh&aacute;n Whelan case were similar to those in the Mellet communication and relying on the same reasoning, the committee also found a violation of Articles 7, 17 and 26, namely, the prohibition against cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, protecting the right to privacy and equality before the law.</p><p>The State&rsquo;s response to the UN Human Rights Committee&rsquo;s views in the Mellet case, which included an acknowledgment by the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, of its views, an <i>ex gratia</i>sum of &euro;30,000 and a detailed itemisation of the steps being taken by the State on foot of the case, further demonstrate the significance of Ireland&rsquo;s international legal obligations for domestic law and policy.<br/><br/>UN treaty monitoring bodies are the pre-eminent interpreter of Ireland&rsquo;s binding obligations in international law under the human rights treaties it has ratified.  Their views on Ireland are, therefore, authoritative and have a significant role in the interpretation, application and development of Irish law.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-04a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017100400002#E00200"><p>It is the view of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission that the State should approach reforms on access to abortion in Ireland primarily as a matter of health care policy.  To do so would be in keeping with its obligations under international human rights law.<br/><br/>As the committee is aware, the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 allows for terminations of pregnancy where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother.  This limited access does not meet the requirements of international human rights law.  Concerns about the barriers placed by the existing legal framework on women&rsquo;s right to the highest attainable standard of health, the right to privacy, to equality before the law, to non-discrimination and to freedom from inhuman and degrading treatment, as well as the State&rsquo;s special obligations towards minors, in particular the girl-child, have been raised by several international human rights bodies.<br/><br/>The position taken by UN human rights treaty bodies differs from the position taken by the European Court of Human Rights.  In the case of ABC <i>v</i>. Ireland, the court concluded that abortion law in Ireland struck a fair balance between the competing interests presented.  The court relied in particular on the right to travel abroad for abortion, as being significant in applying the fair balance test and in assessing the proportionality of the interference with a woman&rsquo;s right to private life.  A wide margin of appreciation was applied by the court.  Ultimately, the court concluded that the constitutional prohibition on abortion in situations where a woman&rsquo;s health or well-being were at risk pursued the legitimate aim of the protection of morals, and reflected the profound moral values of the Irish people.  The court did not accept that sufficient evidence had been presented of a change in those values since the adoption of the eighth amendment.  I would be happy to expand on this judgment in our discussion and subsequent case law from the court.<br/><br/>The UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has made clear the &ldquo;realisation of women&rsquo;s right to health requires the removal of all barriers interfering with access to health services ... including in the area of sexual and reproductive health&rdquo;.  It has identified the criminalisation of abortion and restrictive abortion laws as among these barriers.  The committee has also specifically expressed its concern on the discriminatory impact on women who cannot afford to travel abroad to access abortion services or access the necessary information.<br/><br/>These concerns were reiterated in the views of the UN Human Rights Committee.  In her concurring opinion in the Mellet case, Professor Cleveland stated &ldquo;the committee&rsquo;s finding of a violation of Article 26 in the author&rsquo;s case ... is fully justified on grounds of discrimination arising from gender stereotyping&rdquo;.<br/><br/>The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is of the view that the key areas that require attention by this committee include the development of a legislative and regulatory framework that provides for access to abortion for reasons of risk to life and health; socio-economic or family circumstances; pregnancy as a result of rape or incest; and fatal foetal abnormality.<br/><br/>The commission has in the past raised concerns about the number of examinations a girl or woman may be subjected to where she seeks treatment under the current legislation, as well as the effect this may have on a woman&rsquo;s right to respect for her private and family life.  The commission has also raised concerns about the barriers that assessment and certification requirements place before women with restricted access to medical practitioners or health information, such as women from poorer socio-economic backgrounds, from ethnic minority groups, or with intellectual disabilities.<br/><br/>A reformed framework for access to abortion services under a wider set of circumstances should avoid the creation of new processes where vulnerable women and girls may be subject to trauma, re-victimisation, delays in treatment or other harms.  The commission is of the view that a new framework for access to abortion should place the decision-making process primarily in the hands of the pregnant woman in consultation with her physician.  The commission stresses the importance of ensuring that constitutional reform avoids replicating the barriers to human rights and equality that are in place.<br/><br/>Given these considerations, the commission recommends the referendum announced should allow for the development of a framework governing access to abortion that has a basis in primary legislation and regulation.<br/><br/>As has been highlighted at the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly and in other fora, the criminalisation of abortion constitutes a potentially serious chilling factor for women seeking medical care, as well as for health care staff providing such care.  The commission, therefore, is of the view that, notwithstanding limitations that may be placed on access to abortion by legislation and regulation, the State should decriminalise abortion in all circumstances, as required by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in its concluding observations on Ireland adopted in 2016.<br/><br/>The commission and others have highlighted serious shortcomings in Ireland&rsquo;s sexual and reproductive health education system.  In parallel to a reformed legislative and regulatory framework for access to abortion, it is crucial the State develop a comprehensive, scientifically objective, sexual and reproductive health education policy.<br/><br/>I thank the committee for its attention and we welcome questions and further discussion.</p></speech>

I found them extremely helpful and informative.</p> <p>  In what way is the criminalisation of abortion a barrier to achieving adequate human rights standards?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-04a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017100400002#E00500"><p>It has been commented on repeatedly by various UN human rights bodies that criminalisation may impose barriers to women seeking access to health care.  In and of itself, it creates a barrier to the achievement of the right to the highest attainable standard of health in that access to abortion is seen as part of that right for women which includes reproductive and sexual health.  Criminalisation directly impedes that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-04a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1389" speakername="Paul Gavan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017100400002#E00600"><p>Have other countries been before the European Cout orf Human Rights on access to abortion?  If so, can the commission discuss the findings and the reasoning behind them?</p></speech>

After the ABC case, there were two further significant judgments of the court on Poland where it found violations not only of Article 8, the right to private life and family life but of Article 3, the prohibition on inhuman and degrading treatment.</p><p>In that context, the court took the view that the Polish authorities had not provided for an effective and accessible procedure to access abortion, which was lawful under domestic law in Poland.  The particular circumstances of the cases included what the court described as deplorable treatment of an adult woman in one case.  In another case a 14 year old girl, who had been a victim of rape, was described as being humiliated and not being given access to abortion that was lawful under domestic law in that context.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-04a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1389" speakername="Paul Gavan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017100400002#F00300"><p>This is my last question.  Given what the IHREC representatives have said to us today, can they sum up what they believe to be Ireland's legal obligations now under human rights law with regard to this issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-04a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017100400002#F00400"><p>I wish to add that at the European Court of Human Rights a margin of appreciation was allowed for in the A, B and C<i>v.</i>Ireland case.  The court specifically said that margin was not unlimited and that the court must supervise compliance by contracting states in line with their obligations under the convention.  That specifically includes regard to Article 8, but in other cases relating to Article 3 there is no margin of appreciation because the article provides for an absolute prohibition on inhuman and degrading treatment.<br/><br/>Senator Gavan asked about the position under international human rights law.  The positions of human rights treaty bodies are documented in our policy statement.  The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has called for decriminalisation.  We have noted in the policy document how various UN human rights treaty bodies have called for Ireland to ensure access to abortion in situations where there is risk to life and health.  Socio-economic circumstances have also been referred to by the European Committee of Social Rights as have pregnancy due to rape or incest and fatal foetal abnormalities.  Committee members will find greater detail on the views and the various concluding observations from UN human rights treaty bodies in our policy document.</p></speech>

Before I start my questioning, I want to talk about human rights and the right to life.  I am talking about the right to life of the child in the womb.  Ms Logan has qualified something and seems to be putting more of a weighting on the existing life rather than pre-life.  I am referring to where Ms Logan finished off on the last statement.  Can she expand on exactly what she has said?  It will bring me to further questions about the right of human life.</p></speech>

In international human rights law, there is a strong link between health and access to health as against waiting until someone is at the threshold of almost losing her life to make a decision.</p></speech>

It is a matter of when we get to the point of competing rights.  There is well-established medical practice in this country, dating prior to the 1983 referendum, of<i>in utero</i>surgery and prenatal care, for example.  That is well-established and there is nothing in international law to prohibit that.  We are only referring to a situation of competing rights.  This was referenced by Mary O'Toole last week - we are talking about a life and life situation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-04a.28" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017100400002#F01400"><p>I wish to comment specifically on that.  In the case law of the European Court of Human Rights, it has been stated repeatedly by the court that there is no consensus among contracting states to the convention on the moment human life begins.  In that context, the reasoning in Article 8 suggests a significant margin of appreciation has been allowed.  In the practice of international human rights law, there is nothing that prevents protection for prenatal life.  However, in terms of what the UN human rights treaty bodies have said, for example, the draft general comment on the right to life from the UN Human Rights Committee suggests this should not preclude the protection of a woman's rights to have access to abortion, which is seen as part of the right to life, the right to health, the right to be free from inhuman and degrading treatment and as part of the right to privacy and non-discrimination.  That is the context.</p></speech>

The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has said that access to abortion should primarily be a health care issue, and I totally agree with that.  Page 10 of the IHREC document refers to the UN special rapporteur referring to health, rape and fatal foetal impairment.  Does Professor Mullally believe that the IHREC is in compliance?  If so, there is a big step in talking about socio-economic and family circumstances and the grounds for abortion, while giving the indirect link to health.  That is another step.  Can Professor Mullally expand on that and explain it?  One of the recommendations from the Citizens' Assembly was to look at the socio-economic and family circumstances.  It is one of the issues we have to debate as well.  I am keen to hear the IHREC explanation and understanding of it.</p></speech>

Let us consider the Mellet and Whelan decisions.  In particular, Professor Sarah Cleaveland concurred with the Mellet decision.  She highlighted in particular the discriminatory impact on women who may not be able to afford to travel due to socio-economic circumstances.  This has come up before several UN human rights treaty bodies.  It is also something that was commented on and found by the committee on social rights under the revised European Social Charter in the context of the collective complaint against Italy.  In that case, there was a finding of a violation of the right to health, read in conjunction with what were deemed to be multiple grounds of discrimination, including in particular socio-economic situations and location.  This related to difficulties in accessing an abortion in the Italian context.  It can come within that and it is one element of the non-discrimination requirements.  It may also be relevant to health and mental health.</p></speech>

In terms of human rights we have a particular responsibility to look at those who are on the margins and those who are vulnerable.  We know, however uncomfortable it may be, that most of the case law we have relates to children.  We also know that women who have reduced capacity or who rely heavily on the State are certainly disproportionately affected.  These women are not in positions of autonomy.  I have in mind women who are refugees and who do not have documentation.  They do not have a choice to make a decision about whether to travel outside the jurisdiction to access health care.  As Professor Mullally has outlined, this applies to women who are materially deprived or who cannot afford to make that choice.  There are groups of women who are not in the mainstream debate or conversation but who rely heavily on the State for access to health care in this context.</p></speech>

Mary O'Toole, a senior counsel, said that most of the cases that come before her related to children.  She specifically referenced children in care.  To me, nothing is going to change for them, the simple reason being that they will still have to come before the courts for a decision to be made on access if their life is at risk or anything like that.  Do the witnesses agree with me?</p></speech>

If we provide primary legislation and regulate, then that decision can be made in consultation with the physician.  Obviously, the HSE and health and social services are <i>in loco parentis</i>so normal decision-making processes would ensue.</p></speech>

The child safety and protection policy was only placed on a mandatory footing in 2011 despite the fact that it was introduced as a public policy in the 1990s.  As such, we have been very slow to recognise the importance of educating girls.  Ultimately, we are saying that we should look at prevention.  While we are looking at the hard edge of abortion here, we must also wake up to the fact that we need to properly educate young people, not just girls, who may be sexually active, however uncomfortable that may be for some people.  We must move into the 21st century on sexual health for young people.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that this is an emotive topic which divides opinion in all areas of society.  Indeed, opinion is divided in many households.  Both sides of the debate have very different views and it is important to listen to all views before we make a decision.  Not only that, we must respect each other's views and opinions.  Personally, I am against abortion on demand.  My fear is that if abortion on demand is introduced, it could become another form of contraception.  We all know that it is not simply a case of either introducing abortion or not introducing it.  My personal view is that we need to look at cases where a pregnancy is the result of incest or rape, where it could place the life of the mother at risk or where it could result in fatal foetal abnormalities.  I have specific questions for the witnesses and I address them also to all members.</p> <p>  We all know friends and family who have family members with Down's syndrome.  Statistics show that 90% of babies diagnosed with Down's syndrome have their lives terminated by abortion.  Even more alarming is the fact that 100% of babies diagnosed with Down's syndrome are aborted in Iceland.  I would be very interested to hear people's views on this and on whether they accept that we could have the same situation here should abortion on demand be introduced.</p> <p>  I listened very closely to each of the opening statements and was shocked that no one mentioned the rights of the unborn.  I would be very interested to hear people's views on the rights of the unborn and whether they believe they have any.  What measures can we take to ensure that the rights of the unborn, along with those of the mother, are protected?  I said last week here that a baby's heart beats 21 days after conception.  Facial features start to form at week 4, internal lungs begin to form at week 6, the nervous system is responsive at week 8, babies are swallowing, yawning and sucking at week 9 and the baby stretches and jumps at week 11.</p> <p>  Professor Mullally stated that the commission is of the view that a new framework on access to abortion in Ireland should place the decision-making process primarily in the hands of the pregnant woman in consultation with a doctor.  What would happen if both parties had a different view?  For example, what if the woman wanted to terminate the pregnancy but her doctor was against it?</p></speech>

I will start with his opening comments on deeply-held views.  What I tried to capture in my opening statement was that - no more than in this committee or in Irish society - I am very well aware that people have very strong and deeply held opinions on this.  This does not mean that we do not listen to those opinions.  In less than three years, the commission has had ten very serious submissions whereby it has commented on this issue.  That has meant we have had to listen to everybody's views.  It is contested but that does not mean we can set aside our respect for each other as human beings.  As such, we do our level best to try to do it within the commission.  I respect, of course, that the Deputy does not share our views.  I respect him as an individual human being who holds his views very strongly.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned rape and incest.  One of the things that was called for in the past was a review of the SAVI report of 2002 which looked at sexual violence in Ireland.  The survey has never been repeated but while the data is old, it indicates that 22% of people experience familial abuse or violence in the home.  That is something we should not ignore.  I think Deputy Fitzpatrick had a specific question for Professor Mullally.</p></speech>

In that context, there would be an obligation to ensure that health care services were organised in such a way as to provide effective access to abortion in accordance with that legislative and regulatory framework.  It should be possible to ensure that decisions are made in a timely way and that access is not theoretical but is practical and available to all without discrimination on grounds of socioeconomic circumstance or location.  Going back to the question on socioeconomic circumstances, we have quoted from the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on ensuring universal access to health care and the right to the highest attainable standard of health as part of that reform.</p></speech>

I am afraid that if we go the way we are going, abortion will be available on demand.  I would not like people to use it as a contraceptive and I would not like to think that it would facilitate a person who discovered from a scan that baby was a boy, but they wanted a girl, or <i>vice versa</i>.  That is my biggest fear of all.  I am conscious of it and I have set out my reservations.  The last thing I want to happen in this country is for abortion to be available on demand.  In America, over 55 million abortions have been carried out.  As I said in my statement, there are 100,000 people alive in Ireland today because of the eighth amendment.  I have come here and I am trying to be honest in expressing my opinion.  While I accept the witnesses' opinions, I am very disappointed.  We had a meeting here beforehand to discuss whether we will have a referendum now or in May or June.  The bottom line is that nothing should be done until everything is finalised.  I am here, I am open-minded and I have expressed my concerns.  However, I am a little bit afraid that things have been done before we have even had a chance to speak up.  I am really worried that we are going to make a major mistake and have abortion on demand in this country.</p></speech>

While we all want to respect each other's views, the statement that abortion will be used as a method of contraception needs to be counteracted.  I do not believe that is true.  We are not really here to express opinions, we are here to ask questions.</p><p>I want to follow up with Ms Logan on her statement to the effect that the Minister for Health provided an <i>ex gratia</i>payment on behalf of the State in the Mellet case.  Does that mean the State has accepted responsibility for the harm experienced by Amanda Mellet and Ms Whelan and must, therefore, take steps to reform law, policy and practice accordingly?</p><p>Would that be Ms Logan's view?</p><p> Assuming that there will be a referendum, and that will be something to discuss in the future with regard to our own position, does Ms Logan have a view on whether we should propose the removal of Article 43.3.3&deg; or replace it with other wording, with the possibility of legislation or medical regulation?</p></speech>

There are two parts to that question, the first being the possible challenge to the UN's competence.  That is not uncommon in jurisdictions.  Certainly in the past 14 years I have been involved a lot with and been in front of UN bodies.  I know it is a political response, so it is not uncommon that politically a government may seek to undermine the competence of the UN Human Rights Committee.  The committee has said that it is well aware of this and recognises it.  The UN Human Rights Committee prints what are called general comments that are thematic elaborations on its thinking on things.  The committee has said in individual communications that it recognises that while it is not a judicial body, it arrives at its decisions in a judicial spirit, which undermines the principles of impartiality and independence.  The second part of that question relates to the legal basis for those decisions, which speaks to the Deputy's question about the response of the Minister, Deputy Harris.  In linking this with the international law principles of the Vienna Convention, there is something called the "good faith principle".  If a government ratifies a treaty, it creates a legitimate expectation that it is going to comply with the terms of that treaty.  I would say that the Minister for Health's actions indicated a good faith response to the views of the UN Human Rights Committee in the Mellet case.</p> <p>  Will the Deputy please repeat the second question?</p></speech>

My first question is for Ms Logan.  I have read the new position paper released today, Human Rights and Equality Considerations in the Development of a New Legislative and Regulatory Framework on Abortion.  I respectfully put it to Ms Logan that it is very noticeable that there is not a single mention in the entire document that recognises or speaks up for the rights of the unborn child.  Am I correct in concluding that the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission believes that unborn babies are unworthy of any meaningful protections in law?</p> <p>  It is a fact that the eighth amendment has saved countless lives.  I am privileged to know personally families who were considering abortion but changed their minds at the last minute before travelling abroad.  These families openly admit that had abortion been legal in Ireland and had there been abortion clinics close to where they lived, their son or daughter would most likely not be alive today and enjoying the same chance of life as Ms Logan, me and everyone else present here today and all those in the wider community.  Has the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission spent any time considering all the good that has been done by the eighth amendment?  Why is there not as much of a mention in the document published today on all that is positive about the eighth amendment?</p> <p>  I wish to address a question to Christina.  I thank the witness for her paper and I listened very carefully to what she had to say.  In all her work as an international human rights lawyer, she never raised concerns about the barbaric practices such as the treatment of babies born after botched abortions and who are left to die alone without receiving any medical attention or loving care as they breathe their last breath.  I present a harrowing image but sadly it is a very real one.</p></speech>

With regard to the Deputy's question on whether the commission considered the right to life of the unborn, it is important for the Deputy to know that there are mixed views around the table in the same way that there are mixed views here on the committee.  Since the inception of the commission in November 2014, we have had ten occasions to debate this issue; three in relation to domestic legislation and seven around international treaty obligations.  We do not all agree.  I would say with confidence, and I assure the Deputy, that we are absolutely certain that we will never agree and will never reach consensus.  It is important that the commission reflects Irish society and the kind of dissonance we see now in the context of this debate.  It is a contested area, but as the chief commissioner, I want to assure the Deputy that of course this voice has to be heard around the commission table.  Today we do not represent all the views of members of the commission.  We represent the views of 13 of the 15 members of the commission.  Two members of the commission oppose the presentation this committee is hearing today.  I wish to assure the Deputy that with regard to the process, this is an integral part of our consideration.</p></speech>

In that respect, some people might present international law as a sort of optional extra.  Will the witnesses give a little bit more detail and explain why Ireland is bound by these obligations when we talk of violation and the State being sued?  Will the witnesses explain this a little bit more?</p> <p>  Last week at this committee there was a lot of discussion around the issue of legal uncertainty in the context of the constitutional dimensions of abortion law.  Have international bodies been concerned by the uncertainty in Ireland's current abortion law?  Could this topic be teased out a little bit?</p> <p>  Decriminalisation is not covered in the report of the Citizens' Assembly, despite the fact that many citizens asked that it would be.  We raised this with Ms Justice Laffoy who seemed to be of the opinion that it did not really need to be included in the report because if the law is changed, it will automatically follow.  Will the witnesses please expand on this, because they are very clearly saying that from an international human rights legal perspective, abortion must be decriminalised in all circumstances, regardless of what legislation might follow a referendum?</p> <p>  I turn now to the commission's view that we need to develop a health care approach to this matter.</p><p>Traditionally, in this State, Irish maternity care was dominated by the Catholic hospitals, with Catholic doctors developing the medical ethics that exist.  Will the witnesses explain how international human rights law requires us to balance women's rights against institutional and personal religious freedom, and how that is balanced in other states?</p></speech>

First, with regard to our international legal obligations and the status of international law, which is the core of the question, when Ireland ratifies an international treaty it accepts a legal obligation in good faith to implement that treaty, so it is a sovereign decision taken by the State to ratify a treaty and thereby to comply with it and give effect to it.  That is part of international treaty law.  We have a good faith obligation - that is the terminology used - to give effect to our obligations under international treaties and to ensure effective remedies in any case of a violation of those treaties.</p> <p>  With regard to the decisions of a UN human rights treaty body, as in Mellet or Whelan, those are authoritative interpretations of the bodies that are competent as a matter of law under the relevant treaty, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to interpret those.  Not only have we ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, but we have also recognised the competence of treaty bodies to receive and consider decisions and to give their views on these.  That was an additional step we took in ratifying the first optional protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  As a State, we have accepted those obligations as a matter of law.</p> <p>  The second question was with regard to uncertainty.  As was also said last week, while it is not possible, as a matter of law, to achieve absolute certainty with any legal text, the protections that are afforded should ensure that a woman has effective access to a lawful abortion, that timely decisions are made and that procedures are accessible.  That was precisely the problem in the A, B and C case with regard to the third applicant, C, where there was a finding of a violation of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights where, the court found, there had been no access to an abortion that was lawful.  This has also come up in the cases before the European Court of Human Rights in regard to Poland.  Again, there was such a lack of clarity that women and girls had been subject to humiliating situations, and moved around from one place to another, because of the absence of timely and effective access to lawful abortions.  That level of uncertainty has been referred to as a chilling factor both for medical practitioners and for women and girls with regard to their lawful rights to abortion.</p> <p>  On the third question in regard to criminalisation and decriminalisation, we referred in the policy document and also in our statement specifically to the views of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in 2016, where it called for decriminalisation in all circumstances.  Again, this goes directly to the point around access to a safe and legal abortion being part of the right to the highest attainable standard of health and the need to ensure that the criminal law does not act as barrier to access to health services.</p> <p>  The final question was in regard to conscientious objection and religious freedom.  In the extended policy document and in the submission we had made earlier to the Citizens' Assembly, we referred to the relevant provisions of international European human rights law and, with regard to the Polish decisions from the European Court of Human Rights, to the collective complaint from the European social rights committee on how health care services are organised.  While there must be recognition of the right to conscientious objection, health services must be organised in such a way that there is effective access so that a health service provider, a medical practitioner, must ensure onward referral to a non-objecting practitioner, and any right to conscientious objection, of course, should not impede the right to life of a woman and to their lawful rights under an abortion regime.  Therefore, there is an obligation of onward referral.  Reference has also been made in the Polish context to decisions being given in writing to be justified to a greater level of transparency and clarity to avoid that kind of confusion and uncertainty for any woman or girl seeking access to a lawful abortion.</p></speech>

The terminology "abortion on demand" has been used here today a couple of times.  I want to tease that out a bit from the perspective of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  When it is spoken about, as it has been here today, I suppose the question is: on demand by whom?  I would see it as being the woman who may potentially be "demanding" the abortion.  Would the witnesses have an issue with that sort of terminology in the sense of it then being a question of who has a right to block that woman's right?  Do they understand where I am coming from?  If we are using terminology which suggests a woman can demand an abortion if she feels like it, has the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission any view on who might be the judge and jury in such a situation?  While I may not be explaining myself well, the witnesses might be able to give me some answer on how they feel about that.</p> <p>  Another point raised here today is that the eighth amendment has saved so many lives.  If somebody is prohibited from travelling for either financial or other reasons to another country, would the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission see it as a good thing that women are prevented from travelling abroad to seek abortion and, therefore, we have all these children who, allegedly, are alive as a result?</p> <p>  The witnesses referred to the question of health versus life.  I know neither of the witnesses are medical professionals, or perhaps they are, but they are not here in that capacity.  Have they heard any evidence, when coming up with their documents, about what sort of health issues we are talking about?  What springs to my mind is high blood pressure, preeclampsia, the risk of stroke and the risk, therefore, of permanent disability to the woman as opposed to death.  Perhaps the witnesses could elaborate on that sort of terminology.</p> <p>  Finally, to give my own view, and I do not expect the witnesses to agree or disagree, as public representatives in a public forum such as this, we have to be very careful of listing out the gestational progression of the foetus within the womb.  Untruths have been put out here today, things that are not factually correct.  I am very concerned about the public looking on and putting a certain weight or gravity to comments of elected members who are just putting out lies.  It is very serious for this committee's work.  Reference was also made to these botched abortions which I hear being spoken about.  Again, there is absolutely evidence to suggest this.  I know Deputy McGrath has left the room.  I think it is very concerning and not helpful to the committee's work if people are somehow, wherever they are getting this information from, not checking it before they put it into the public domain.  I would like to put that on the record today.</p></speech>

On her first question about the term "abortion on demand", we suggest the most appropriate term is a woman "requesting health care".  With due respect, we certainly do not ever hear men demanding health care so why that term should be applied to women, I do not know.</p> <p>  In regard to the eighth amendment and saving lives, and whether we think it is a good thing that women cannot travel, no, we do not.  We believe the existing system is a two-tier system whereby women who cannot afford to travel are put in a situation where their autonomy is diminished and their ability to make their own decisions about their own health care has been limited by the State, so we do not see that as a good thing.</p><p> It is probably better that the health matter be referred elsewhere, as we might be stepping beyond our level of competence.  I suggest that it be left to a medical practitioner.  The committee may be hearing from some medical practitioners, so if the Deputy does not mind, I do not feel that we have the-----</p></speech>

In our statement, the expanded policy document and previous submissions, we have expressed concern that barriers to accessing health care services might be put in place because of onerous certification procedures and requirements.  We also expressed that concern with the 2013 legislation.  Therefore, we recommend that any legislative or regulatory framework that may be put in place not repeat those barriers, which can cause unnecessary delays, trauma and, potentially, revictimisation for a woman or girl seeking access to abortion services.  Therefore, it is essential that there be clarity in any legislative and regulatory framework regarding the decision-making process without the imposition of those onerous barriers.</p></speech>

Therefore, if comments are made at this committee, people should be entitled, and have a responsibility, to comment.</p> <p>  This links with the point that was made about the lack of sexual and reproductive health education in Ireland.  Regarding the term "a baby's heart beats at 21 days", an embryo does not even have a four-chamber heart at 21 days.  People are throwing these claims out, so they should be commented on and challenged.</p> <p>  Do the witnesses agree that the opposite of abortion on demand is forced pregnancy?  Is that not the alternative?  If we put restrictions in the way of someone who is seeking an abortion, we are forcing her to stay pregnant.</p> <p>  The witnesses might comment on a point that was made about the idea of abortion being another form of contraception.  It is highly insulting.  Abortion involves pain, expense - no matter what way it is procured - and a significant amount of difficulty, particularly for someone in Ireland, so it is belittling to suggest that.  Do the facts from various countries that the witnesses have put forward not speak to Ireland's abortion rate being no less than any other country's where abortion is available?  The idea about saving lives seems to be a myth.</p> <p>  Regarding sexual health, or the lack of it, Professor Mullally called for a scientifically objective policy.  This committee should use scientifically objective terms.  Last week and this, a number of members used the word "child".  The scientific terms are "morula", "blastocyst", "zygote", "embryo" and "foetus".  There are stages, and most people see the difference between them.  It is not the case that everyone in Ireland is undivided on this.  A minority of people may believe that the stages are equal, but most see the difference.  I just wanted to challenge some points.</p> <p>  Do the witnesses agree that it is significant that a State-sponsored body such as the IHREC has proposed at a public forum like the Citizens' Assembly the idea that there needs to be abortion provision for socioeconomic reasons if people's human rights are to be upheld?</p> <p>  On the issue of rape, the witnesses stated that they opposed intrusive medical examinations for pregnant women.  Do they agree that, if a rape provision is included in any abortion legislation, it would run counter to that, given that there would have to be some element of examination or the person would have to meet a certain threshold?</p> <p>  Professor Mullally stated: "The commission is of the view that a new framework for access to abortion should place the decision-making process primarily in the hands of the pregnant woman in consultation with her physician."  Does she agree that the Citizens' Assembly's recommendation of abortion on request or without restriction up to 12 weeks would fit in with the idea of a pregnant woman being able to attend her own general practitioner, GP, and being prescribed the abortion pill, which is used in many abortions in Europe, or surgical abortion?</p></speech>

She referred to the gestational term.  I am conscious that we are not giving personal views - we are representing the view of the commission.  In our policy statement, we have pointed out how gestational term limits in other jurisdictions are applied.  The commission has not gone so far in our paper as to give the committee an answer on what that should be, but we have stated that any gestational term limit included in a reformed framework for access to abortion service should be devised in keeping with best medical practice and with the health of the pregnant woman as the primary focus.  It should be necessary and proportionate and have due regard to a woman's right to bodily autonomy and her right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.</p> <p>  We agree with the Deputy's comment on sexual education.  Some of the terminology used about one of the reasons for an abortion being contraception is probably an unhelpful narrative.  Sexual education has been an important part of our considerations and it should not be forgotten about in the broader consideration of sexual health and health rights for girls and women.</p></speech>

In any framework that is developed, we are concerned to ensure that there should not be any revictimisation - any repeat of trauma - for a woman or girl and there should be effective access to a timely procedure.  It can take up to two years for rape proceedings to come to court, which needs to be borne in mind in the context of reflecting on the legislative and regulatory framework that may be put in place.</p></speech>

I will mention in passing that not all countries have equal provisions on the availability of abortion, as we heard during the assembly's discussions.  Regarding the acceptability to our society, we would be foolish to reach a conclusion just because there has been general acceptance so far and the Citizens' Assembly discovered A, B and C in the various responses to it.  There were many indications ahead of previous referenda that they would receive considerable support until the time came and they did not.  We must operate on the basis at all times that, whatever we do and say, nothing is as clear as it may appear at this stage.</p><p>I would be of the opinion - perhaps I am na&iuml;ve in this - that it would be absolutely essential for a rape victim to seek medical assistance immediately.  There are no circumstances in which that should be avoided, including for general health reasons.  This has come to my attention in cases where young children were the victims of rape were frightened, unsure of what to do and were afraid to tell their parents or guardians.  In those circumstances there is a serious void in what the witnesses have correctly drawn attention to in terms of the quality and availability of sex education in schools, but there is also a serious void in terms of what parents should know about what happens to their children.  It is hugely important that the situation would be clarified.  Regardless of the debate we are having in this situation that is of fundamental importance to the rights of the child, who is the victim.</p><p> I have gotten myself into difficulty in the past by suggesting that in rape situations there should be a quick intervention.  The counter-argument has been that the child who is not yet born is an innocent victim as well and that is a reason to allow the pregnancy to continue.  I do not accept that.  Apart altogether from the legal procedures taken against the perpetrator of a violent criminal act, there needs also to be a recognition that to allow the victim to become a victim again, as it were, and to have to continue to live with that, is unfair, unjustified and to my mind illegal in terms of an act against the person going unchallenged in that regard, apart from the-----</p></speech>

There could come about a situation whereby the right to life of an unborn child may come into focus.  For instance, the European Charter of Fundamental Rights did not deal with the issue but the very first article states everyone has the right to life.  I just wonder if there is recognition of the fact that a legal challenge may come from some quarter.  Are the witnesses aware that might happen?  I know the supposition is that it would be outside of the reach of the courts to challenge it if the legislation is passed but I have my doubts about that one as well because I think that will be challenged too.</p></speech>

My understanding from the public comments made by the Minister for Health at the time was an acceptance that there was not the kind of medical support that should have been provided to either of the women.</p> <p>  I think Deputy Durkan's reference might have been to the preamble of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  Looking at the preparatory documents it is very clear that this is a really contentious issue.  Any of the international treaties are subject to the vicissitudes of politics, if one likes, and they are a set of minimum standards.  In the context of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child such was the debate that it was not included in the main text of the document it was placed in the preamble to enable jurisdictions to ratify the convention but to also accept that different jurisdictions, as Deputy Durkan indicated in his earlier comments, have different regimes.</p></speech>

Last week we had Mary O'Toole, SC, before the committee and she reminded us that the Supreme Court had set the bar in relation to the balance of rights and there was an equal right to life and that was only called into question in the case of a real and substantial risk to the life of the woman.  The Protection of Life During Pregnancy legislation followed on to give effect to that.  She made it very clear that it did not include the right to health.  I picked up on the point Professor Mullally made, namely: "The commission is of the view that a new framework for access to abortion in Ireland should place the decision-making process primarily in the hands of the pregnant woman in consultation with her physician."  I completely agree with that.  In arriving at the decision on how to frame it, presumably there was consultation within the organisation, were there examples of other countries where she saw such an approach was in practical use?</p></speech>

There are other jurisdictions where that happens but we have not gone so far as to say that we are endorsing or making that recommendation, it is just a consideration for members, as legislators, but it does exist in other jurisdictions.  Perhaps Professor Mullally wishes to add to that.</p></speech>

That was part of what it was looking at.  In terms of our mandate to look at international human rights law, that has been repeatedly found to be a part of the right to health to ensure that there is access to a lawful abortion on health grounds.  In the committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women this is part of the development of international human rights law.  That is what we are drawing on in terms of the nature of our mandate as a national human rights institution.  In terms of what was described as being the European position at the time of the ABC judgment, the court noted that on health grounds 40 contracting states to the European Convention on Human Rights at that time allowed for access to a lawful abortion on health grounds.</p></speech>

I join with my colleagues in commenting on some of the language that has been used here today.  One comment in particular I found very offensive as a woman and as a mother; it was to make the assertion that a woman would practically arrive for her 20 week scan, find out the gender and say: "Ah no, it's a girl.  I wanted a boy."  It is a ridiculous and absurd view to have of women.  I found it very offensive.  I would just like to put that on the record.  Members should research and come in here educated on the reasons women have abortions before they make comments like that.</p> <p>  I have two questions.  One of them is based on the conversations today about rights of the unborn and of the child.  Could the witnesses make a distinction and provide a little background on the right to life of a foetus, if there is any, and how they do or do not equate to a woman as a holder of human rights?</p><p>We may as a society place value on the foetus, and place value on access to foetal development, care and health if a woman is to proceed with a pregnancy, but that does not translate into human rights and equate to the same rights as the woman.  Perhaps the witnesses will elaborate on that.</p><p> Professor Mullally said the committee needs to include the development of a legislative and regulatory framework that provides for access to abortion for a list of reasons but, in practice, we are all aware of the many practical issues that arise when trying to allow for abortion in certain limited circumstances.  How would she respond to the assertion that the only way for Ireland to fulfil its international obligations in this respect is to allow for terminations in early pregnancy on request?  To meet our obligations, we would have to allow not only for these circumstances, but for abortion up to 12 weeks on request.</p></speech>

We have said previously that nothing prohibits protections of prenatal life and, in fact, the commission, in various submissions to UN bodies, has spoken about the importance of the State strengthening prenatal care, maternal health policy, and providing better supports for pregnant women.  That has been part of various policy documents we have produced and submissions we have made to UN bodies.  The position under international human rights law is that a woman's rights under, for example, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to be free from inhuman and degrading treatment, her own right to life, right to privacy, and right to non-discrimination, cannot be undermined by priority given to the protection of prenatal life.  That has been the position of the UN human rights committee, for example.  It is limited and a woman's rights must also be respected.  The European Court of Human Rights in the RR and P &amp;amp; S cases involving Poland made findings of violations of both Article 8 and the right to private life and Article 3, in particular, and the prohibition on inhuman and degrading treatment.  The court was clear that, although there was no European consensus in its view on the moment when human life began, the court had an obligation in respect of supervision, and states had obligations to comply with the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p> <p>  What was the second question?</p></speech>

It is up to the Legislature then to deliberate further and arrive at a decision with regard to gestational limits, and we have set out approaches taken in different jurisdiction, how those have developed and the consideration that should be taken into account.  The certification requirements should not put in place further barriers to women and girls having access to abortions and should not put in place conditions or situations where decisions cannot be made in a timely way, and there must be effective access to abortion services.  It is within that context.</p></speech>

I presume that will be left in the hands of the medical practitioner.  Do any UN conventions or other international laws define "serious risk" or "substantial risk"?</p></speech>

It has been said in many contexts that this can create serious difficulties for medical practitioners in providing health care in a timely way and assessing whether there is a risk to life when complying with the requirements of the 2013 legislation.</p> <p>  With regard to international human rights law, the language used by UN treaty bodies is "risk".</p></speech>

For a medical point of view, that is a high threshold to attain.  One has to assume that the life of the woman is at a real and substantial risk.  Medical practitioners can make a decision based on that assessment but when we get into the health of the woman, socio-economic reasons, etc., where does the issue of the conscience of clinicians to abdicate from that decision come into being in the context of human rights?  Is there a conscience clause in other countries?  Is there an obligation on a clinician, if legislation is in place that obliges him or her to deal with it, or is there an entitlement through a conscientious objection to withdraw from the process in the context of human rights?</p></speech>

Other jurisdictions provide clear guidance to medical practitioners, those objecting and those non-objecting, and we have mentioned in extreme circumstances that this needs to be considered.  It is highly unusual but it is certainly provided for in other jurisdictions.  Pages 27 and 28 of our submission contain a number of references to the articulation of this, including the European Convention on Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</p></speech>

That allows for recognition of the right to religious freedom and manifestation of one's religious beliefs but there are limits on that and, therefore, in terms of compliance with European human rights law, including the provisions of the revised European Social Charter and the European Convention on Human Rights, the position has been that where a practitioner has a conscientious objection, there is an obligation to ensure there is effective referral and access to a non-objecting practitioners, and that procedures are in place to ensure that obligation is met in a timely and transparent way.</p></speech>

In the context of a pregnancy where it is identified that there is a foetal anomaly, which is not necessarily fatal, and a decision is taken to terminate the pregnancy but the woman's partner decides that there should not be a termination of the pregnancy, has there ever been an adjudication on these cases in the European or other international court?</p></speech>

When it comes to the latter, it is very clear that domestic law is no reason for non-compliance with international human rights law.  There is, then, a right to lawful abortion as a matter of international human rights law.  There is no possibility of veto as this is an aspect of a woman's right to private life, her right not to be discriminated against, and her right to health.</p></speech>

Let us look for example at how the European Court of Human Rights dealt with the RR <i>v. </i>Poland and PNS <i>v. </i>Poland cases, both of which were very tragic.  The latter concerned a 14 year old victim of rape who was moved around from one place to another because she was given neither the correct information nor access to an abortion that would in fact have been lawful under domestic law.  Her mother was also unable to get access to the services she wanted for her daughter.  The ECHR was very strong in its condemnation of what had happened and found a violation of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits inhuman and degrading treatment, in how forces had come together to put in place so many barriers to this 14 year old girl getting access to a lawful abortion, and also with regard to the mother's right to support her daughter.</p></speech>

I am an international human rights lawyer with almost 20 years&rsquo; experience of working on sexual and reproductive rights issues.  I have done consultancy work for UN agencies such as the World Health Organization and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and have worked for international NGOs.  I am here in my capacity as legal fellow in the faculty of law at the University of Toronto.  My first job involved working for a Senator from New Jersey in the US Senate and I have also worked with parliamentary organisations since then and, therefore, have first-hand experience of the work of parliamentarians and its challenges and the very important contribution they make to the realisation of human rights in their countries.  My presentation will primarily focus on human rights standards in relation to abortion and state obligations in that regard, which is what the committee has asked me to present upon.  I hope it can be helpful to members as they address the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.</p> <p>  States create international human rights law and it is based on humankind&rsquo;s common understanding of the inherent dignity and rights of every human being, which is a notion shared across religious and non-religious ethical frameworks.  Ireland has been an important player in the development of the human rights system through helping to create binding treaties and voluntarily ratifying them and by nominating and electing members to UN treaty bodies, which are comprised of independent experts that monitor state compliance with such treaties.  Ireland has also sat on the Human Rights Council, which is the UN&rsquo;s most important inter-governmental body on human rights.  Ireland has time and again respected its human rights obligations in many ways.  It has done so not just because those treaties are legally binding under international law but because they provide guidance on how to address complex and sometimes competing interests in light of what people are experiencing.</p> <p>  Reproductive rights have long been recognised as human rights and are enshrined in international treaty provisions.  International human rights bodies have long recognised that a wide range of human rights guarantees are undermined when women and girls do not have access to safe abortion services, particularly if abortion is restricted and-or criminalised.  Those rights include the rights to life, health, privacy and the right to be free from discrimination, torture and other ill-treatment and gender-based violence.  The right to health requires states to take legal and policy measures to prevent unintended pregnancies and unsafe abortions.  Such measures include respecting the right of women to make autonomous decisions about their sexual and reproductive health and also the liberalisation of restrictive abortion laws to guarantee women and girls access to safe abortion services and quality post-abortion care.</p><p>Human rights bodies have considered such failures to ensure women's and girls' access to abortion to be forms of discrimination and inequality in the enjoyment of rights.  The UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, CEDAW, has confirmed that measures to eliminate discrimination against women and girls are inappropriate if a health care system lacks services to prevent, detect and treat health concerns specific to women and girls, noting that it is &quot;discriminatory for a State party to refuse to provide legally for the performance of certain reproductive health services for women&quot;.<br/><br/>The urgency of the human rights concerns in Ireland is reflected in serious human rights violations amounting to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, as found in the Mellet and Whelan cases.  The UN Human Rights Committee held in these two cases that prohibiting and criminalising abortion in situations of fatal foetal impairment subjected these women to conditions of intense physical and mental suffering, and that no justification could be invoked nor were there extenuating circumstances to excuse such harm.<br/><br/>Human rights bodies have also held that a woman's decision to continue or terminate a pregnancy falls within the sphere of private life, which includes bodily integrity, holding that restrictive laws and practices interfere with a woman's decision, violating this right.  Human rights bodies have long stated that to comply with human rights obligations, states should decriminalise abortion, liberalise restrictive laws and remove barriers that hinder access to legal abortion.  While they have noted that states must ensure access at a minimum in cases of threat to the woman's life or health, in cases of rape or incest and in cases of severe or fatal foetal impairment, they have also called on states which allow abortion only on such minimum grounds to liberalise their laws.  This is because human rights bodies are recognising the problem of narrow laws framed around minimum grounds in that, first, they do not guarantee effective access to lawful abortion and, second, women and adolescent girls seek abortions for various reasons, many of which do not fall under these grounds, and that there are harms and human rights implications in these cases as well, especially for marginalised women.  Last year four UN experts issued a joint global statement recommending the good practice found in many countries that provide women access to safe abortion services on request during the first trimester.<br/><br/>UN human rights treaty bodies have also recognised this reality by directing states to address abortion in a more general manner without delineating grounds.  For example, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child recommends that states should ensure access to safe abortion and post-abortion care.  It also recently made this recommendation to Ireland.  Another expert body, the UN Working Group on Discrimination against Women recommends that states should recognise women's right to be free from unwanted pregnancies, noting that many countries where women have the right to abortion on request supported by affordable and effective family planning measures have the lowest abortion rates in the world, and that states should allow women to terminate a pregnancy on request during the first trimester or later, on minimum grounds.<br/><br/>The World Health Organization also recognises that restrictive legal grounds for abortion and other legal, regulatory and administrative barriers contribute to unsafe abortion because they deter women from seeking care, cause delay in access to services which may result in denial of services due to gestational limits on the legal grounds, and create complex and burdensome administrative procedures.  The Citizens' Assembly recommendation on access to abortion without restriction as to reason is in line with these human rights and health standards.<br/><br/>Although a wide range of laws and policies ultimately determine whether women's and girls' equality and right to be free from discrimination are a priority for states, trusting women and adolescents to make autonomous decisions about their sexuality and reproduction is central, including deciding whether to carry a pregnancy to term.  The UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has explicitly articulated increased access to abortion, as well as other sexual and reproductive health services, within states' obligation to respect the right of women to make autonomous decisions about their health.<br/><br/>The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has called on countries, including Ireland, to ensure that the views of the pregnant girl are always heard and respected in abortion decisions.  The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women has expressed concerns about one country's convoluted abortion law, which makes women dependent on the benevolent interpretation of a rule which nullifies their autonomy, and noted that the state party should review the abortion law and practice with a view to simplifying it and to ensuring women's autonomy to choose.<br/><br/>Having respect for women's and girl's decision-making agency reflected in the law is a key indicator of the degree to which women's equality is respected.  The achievement of substantive equality requires states to understand how women, and subgroups of women, are disadvantaged in practice by laws, policies and institutions.  Laws which do not place women at the centre of care and do not respect their decision-making, wherever those laws are, undoubtedly cause harm to all women, but particularly to marginalised women.<br/><br/>I have observed in my almost two decades of work on this issue that undoubtedly in every country with a restrictive law, the most impacted are vulnerable populations, such as women migrants, women with low economic status, women with disabilities, and adolescents.  Ireland is no exception.  The United Nations human rights bodies have time and again, including in findings against Ireland, recognised the discriminatory effects of restrictive and criminal regulation on women's access to lawful abortion on the basis of sex, age, geographical location and income.  The World Health Organization has underlined that restricting legal access to abortion leads to illegal and often unsafe abortions, and to social inequities, including because of the burden of travel.  It does not result in fewer abortions or in significant increases in birth rates.<br/><br/>Women and girls encounter many barriers to abortion, one of which is its criminalisation.  Human rights bodies have called on states to decriminalise abortion, which means that abortion is no longer regulated by criminal legislation and is not a criminal offence.  The Children's Rights Committee has urged states, including Ireland, to decriminalise abortion in all circumstances.  The UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, CEDAW, has also stated that criminalisation, as well as denial or the delay of safe abortion and post-abortion care, are forms of gender-based violence that may amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and that countries should repeal criminal legislation.<br/><br/>Human rights bodies recognise that criminalisation of abortion contributes to stigmatisation and creates a chilling effect on access to lawful services.  In the Mellet case, the UN Human Rights Committee recognised how the criminalisation of abortion degraded and stigmatised Ms Mellet through separating her from the standard way of treating patients and forcing her to travel, and that the shame and stigma associated with the criminalisation of abortion had exacerbated her suffering.<br/><br/>Human rights bodies have also recognised the chilling effect of criminal law on the exercise of professional judgment in providing women and girls with care and have called on states to alleviate its effects.  In ABC <i>v</i>Ireland, the European Court of Human Rights noted that it &quot;considered it evident that the criminal provisions of the 1861 Act would constitute a significant chilling factor for both women and doctors in the medical consultation process, regardless of whether or not prosecutions have in fact been pursued under that Act&quot;.<br/><br/>Criminal provisions present barriers not only in the context of abortion, but also to other reproductive health services, impacting the quality of care that women receive in pregnancy and childbirth, including in the context of miscarriage.  Some national courts understand that the criminal law, as well as other ways of restricting abortion, cause harm and are not a proportionate means to achieve a state's objective to protect prenatal life.  For example, European Constitutional Court decisions across Europe have upheld abortion on request laws when faced with challenges due to claims of constitutional protection for prenatal life.  While these courts acknowledge that the state has a legitimate interest in protecting prenatal life, the select means of protecting it must be consistent with women's rights.  In doing so, these courts have referenced their countries' respective obligations under international human rights treaties.</p><p>Placing women at the centre of care does not mean that states should ignore foetal interests.  The objective of protecting prenatal life is legitimate but this can be achieved in ways that are consistent with women's rights and which support women.  In addition, the evidence is clear that criminal abortion laws are not effective in meeting the state's objective of protecting prenatal life.  They do not affect the overall incidence of abortion; they just make it unsafe and burdensome.</p><p> This approach is in line with international and European regional human rights norms.  No international or European human rights treaty or treaty monitoring body or court has provided that right-to-life treaty provisions apply before birth.  This was confirmed by the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights in his report on his visit to Ireland last year.  That report states, "The Commissioner stresses that the Eighth Amendment of the Irish Constitution [...] departs from the position consistently held by human rights bodies that the right to life, as enshrined in relevant international treaties, does not apply to prenatal life."  In addition, in a landmark case against Peru in which a sexually assaulted child was not provided with an abortion, in part because of state measures to protect prenatal life, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women found violations of the convention, confirming that foetal interests cannot trump the human rights of women and girls.</p><p> Human rights bodies have long referenced achieving reductions in the rate of abortion, not through restrictive abortion laws or mandating recognition of "the right to life of the unborn" but by means of increased access to family planning services and comprehensive sexuality education, to safe motherhood services and prenatal assistance, including to reduce spontaneous miscarriage, and to social and economic protection to ease the burdens of having children.  Human rights bodies have also recognised that any procedural or other barriers to abortion can impact the ability to access legal services in practice.  Human rights require that "in cases where abortion procedures may lawfully be performed, all obstacles to obtaining them should be removed".</p><p> Human rights bodies have recommended that states remove barriers such as mandatory parental consent requirements and financial barriers to abortion services.  They have also specified that where, under domestic law, health practitioners are allowed to refuse to provide abortion services on grounds of conscience, states must adopt regulatory frameworks that guarantee access to abortion is not hindered by such practices.  They have never mandated a state to recognise conscientious objection in the context of provision of abortion services.  They have also raised concerns over judicial or prosecutorial authorisation prior to obtaining an abortion on grounds of rape, and multiple provider authorisation requirements, including in recommendations to Ireland regarding the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act.  They have also urged states to eliminate and refrain from adopting mandatory counselling and medically unnecessary waiting periods prior to abortion and to "[e]nsure that health care professionals provide medically accurate and non-stigmatizing information on abortion".  The World Health Organization has also confirmed these as "barriers [to] abortion [that] should be removed".</p><p> Access to information is critical to the realisation of all human rights.  In the context of health care, including sexual and reproductive health care, states have an obligation not to censor, withhold, misrepresent or criminalise information to the public in general or to individuals.  The European Court of Human Rights, in two cases concerning lack of access to lawful abortion, found Poland in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights for lack of proper counselling and information on abortion.  Human rights bodies have criticised Ireland's Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State For Termination of Pregnancies) Act 1995 as not being compliant with human rights.  The World Health Organization also emphasises that the information given to women seeking abortion services must be unbiased, non-directive and provided only on the basis of informed consent.</p><p> These human rights standards show that narrow exceptions to abortion bans are inadequate to eliminate the harms that such laws impose on women and girls.  The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act is an unfortunate testament to how grounds-based laws can hinder women's and girls' rights and harm their health.  The urgency of the problem is reflected in the recent decisions of the UN Human Rights Committee against Ireland.  Well-functioning abortion laws are guided by and directed at protecting women's and girls' health and human rights.  The human rights framework and its obligations provide a common-sense, evidence-based, practical approach, not only to permit expanded access to abortion but also to ensure the delivery and availability of quality abortion services.  Combined with guidance from the public health field, including the World Health Organization, human rights enable states to help realise women's equality, regardless of their age, income or background.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-04a.118" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor William Binchy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017100400002#Q00300"><p>I am very grateful and honoured to have been invited to appear before this very important committee.  It is doing excellent work for Ireland, for the good of Ireland and for the people who live in Ireland.  I have prepared an opening statement but I will not inflict it upon the committee.  I thought it might be useful, in light of the good, long, two-hour discussion the committee had with the members of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission earlier this afternoon, to telegraph the debate a little in discussion.  I wish to make three substantive points to the committee in my opening remarks.</p> <p>  Before doing so, I will state my value position, which is one that is at the core of human rights philosophy.  We are not simply talking about rules and regulations here; what we are talking about is an insight, a value judgment, as to the human condition.  What human rights philosophy is about is a very simple value.  One may accept it or reject it - some people do reject it - but the value is the equal, inherent worth of every human being - his or her equal value.  That is it.  Whether rich or poor, old or young, early developmental stage or late developmental stage, no matter his or her mental capacity - you name it - it does not matter.  That value says all human beings, by virtue of their humanity, are entitled to protection and respect.  They have inherent dignity.  It is not given to them by human rights committees, by members of this committee, as legislators, or by courts; neither is it taken away from them by courts or by legislators.  It is their inherent value by virtue of being human beings.  Can I prove that statement to the committee?  Can anyone who subscribes to this essential core philosophy of human rights prove that statement to the committee?  Absolutely not.  It is not provable empirically, but one either accepts or rejects it.  If one accepts the principle of equal human rights, it has implications in the area the committee is dealing with, namely, the protection of unborn human beings.  We can describe them scientifically as blastocysts, foetuses and embryos and then, when we get to the post-birth stage, we can describe that little entity, which is utterly limited in its relational capacity and absolutely dependent on other human beings, as a neonate but, frankly, that is not very human language.  Young little babies who have recently been born are human beings and small unborn children are human beings.  My essential argument presented to the committee is this: let us stay real, let us keep our eyes open and let us recognise the genuine humanity and equal worth of every human being.  That is the premise on which my remarks are based.  That is my value position.</p> <p>  As I said, I wish to talk about three matters: the Citizens' Assembly's recommendations to the committee, which are totally familiar and which form the subject matter of the committee's establishment; human rights treaties and monitoring bodies; and the recommendations of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  I will speak briefly; I do not believe I will speak for longer than the ten minutes allocated.</p> <p>  The committee is so familiar with the first matter, the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly, that we can shorten that discussion.  I think members will agree that it is notable that the Citizens' Assembly recommends, among a range of other measures, that abortion should be available for no stated reason, on request, and on grounds of disability.  The recommendations do not use the word "disability", but that is how it translates in any meaningful sense if we stay real.  When one talks about foetal anomaly, one is talking about disability.  Let us think about both of these grounds.  The first is abortion in wide-ranging circumstances, without control.</p><p>We have the discussion about the expression, &quot;abortion on demand&quot;.  I do not particularly want to use it necessarily to stigmatise the phenomenon but merely to describe it.  Let us take another expression which is used by those who are enthusiastic for legalised abortion, which is &quot;abortion based on the right to choose&quot;.  I have always been struck, and perhaps the committee has too, that nobody ever finishes the sentence, &quot;the right to choose&quot;.  If the sentence is finished, it becomes not so self-evidently obvious but highly disturbing to any person of humane sensibility: &quot;the right to choose to take the life of another person&quot;.  As a general proposition in our understanding of ethical relationships between human beings, do we accept that anyone has the right to choose to hurt another person or take the life of another person?  It is a proposition which is absolutely contentious, yet in the context of abortion, the half sentence, &quot;the right to choose&quot;, is articulated as though it were a self-evident, obvious good.<br/><br/>It is worth probing this a little and examining precisely what this means.  I say that because the Citizens' Assembly's clearly is a right to choose proposal, the right to choose to have abortion on request.  If one goes back to the basic premise of the humanity of every human being and the equal right to life of every human being, I would respectfully say this is an unacceptable proposition.  The assembly also recommended abortion for disability.  If one is in favour of the right to choose, why would one be against abortion for disability?  What are the moral, justice and human rights objections to it if one embraces the principle that one can have abortion for any reason unstated and not even mention the reason?  Clearly, an unmentioned reason might in some circumstances be abortion for disability.  Regarding those who say they are against abortion for disability but are in favour of the right to choose, frankly, further reflection has to be given in this area.  If the committee thinks about the right to abortion based on disability, I was a member of the UN Human Rights Commission for 11 years and I was in New York deputising for Professor Gerard Quinn, who is the Irish world expert in the area of the rights of human beings with disability.  It was interesting to listen to the discussion on the formulation of the UN Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and especially the area of the right to life of persons with disabilities.  Article 10 of the convention says essentially that state parties recognise the right to life of every human being and guarantee to protect that right without discrimination on the basis of disability.  If the committee is going to address the question of human rights, it is important for it to address that consideration of recognising the rights of every human being without discrimination and specifically without discrimination on the basis of disability.  Manifestly, the Citizens' Assembly violates that human rights protection.<br/><br/>I refer to international human rights treaties and their monitoring bodies.  States can agree or not agree to ratify a convention.  They are perfectly free not to.  They are involved in the UN in the formulation of treaty negotiations in this area.  As chief commissioner Logan correctly said, most of those treaties, if not all, when it comes to the area of the right to life and dealing with areas which could impact on the area of protection of unborn children or abortion, have been discreet in the sense of banning abortion because to do so would mean many countries would not, and could not, ratify the convention.  They leave it open, as she said, in order that each state can make its own mind up to ratify the convention on the basis of its interpretation of what that particular provision means.  Let us assume Ireland is against the idea of abortion.  Ireland can ratify all those various conventions and covenants and has done so.  Another state with wide-ranging abortion can equally do so on the basis that its interpretation will not ultimately yield an outcome which says that what it is doing is contrary to the convention in question.  Its support and ratification is solicited specifically on that basis.  Ireland ratified many of these conventions and covenants before and after 1983.  This is a consistent State policy of Ireland at all stages, and nobody has suggested, nor could they suggest, for a second that Ireland, in doing so, was agreeing to undertake to change its Constitution to introduce abortion.  That is clearly contrary to the good faith basis on which its support and ratification was sought.  None of those treaties provides for a right to abortion.  I outline that proposition with full certainty.<br/><br/>We then move to the monitoring committees.  Each of the treaties has a monitoring committee to police and support its implementation in individual countries, and they do excellent work as a general proposition in encouraging states to adhere to their human rights obligations, which they have undertaken by ratifying the treaties in question, but let us stay real.  I implore committee members that if they stay real, they will have to accept the value system, in the past decade or so especially, of the monitoring body members, some of whom are judges and lawyers and very many of whom are enthusiastic proponents of what might be called a right to choose philosophy.  That is their value system, they are perfectly entitled to it, they hold it conscientiously and those are their views.  The monitoring bodies do not articulate law, judgments or obligations that are based on the treaty, which incorporate a treaty obligation.  The relationship between states in international law and the relationship between international law and domestic law is a subtle system, but given the manner in which it is structured, the treaty is the obligation.  The monitoring committees have certain functions with certain implications, but it does not matter what they say.  Ireland is not required to act in a manner which is contrary to the obligations it took on when it ratified the relevant treaties in question.  If one stays real, one will say, if one is speaking as a legal analyst and not a partisan, the manner in which the monitoring committees have simply wiped off the stage any consideration of the right to life or, indeed, any rights of the unborn child is striking.  If members read the various decisions they have taken and recommendations they have made, the unborn child just is not there.  That is a striking critique that can be made.  One Irish commentator has suggested that the manner in which the committees have operated is so manifestly at variance with what is sound international law that their findings in this area should be regarded as <i>ultra vires</i>.  That is the situation about the monitoring committees.  I greatly respect Ms Zampas.  I have had an opportunity to chat with her and I like her very much.  We disagree on this particular issue.  She has articulated in her very coherent paper many findings of monitoring committees.  These findings represent the values of those committees, do not penetrate domestic law, and are inconsistent with the values which Ireland understood it was importing when it ratified the conventions in question.<br/><br/>I refer to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, recommendations.  The committee has had a long discussion about those recommendations, but if it was contemplating adhering to the commission's proposals, I will spell out in more real terms what they mean.  They mean a right to choose philosophy or abortion on demand.  It does not matter how it is described, it means essentially abortion without any meaningful restrictions.  Abortion based on the test of well-being, which is proposed by the commission, would not be a ground that would constitute a limited ground, and I think the committee would agree.  Abortion based on socio-economic or familial status or circumstance equally would not constitute a limiting ground.  The commission says that the scrutinising process whereby these grounds would be implemented should be as minimalist as possible.  The committee and the commission had some discussion about late term abortions and there is some discussion about that in the commission's submission, but there is no indication whatsoever on the part of the commission that it had any concern with late term abortions from a human rights perspective.</p><p>From a human rights perspective, the commission did not think it appropriate to mention any human rights concerns about an unborn child in the seventh month of a pregnancy.  It talked about the issue but it did not talk about it from a value perspective in regard to the protection of the unborn child.  If one goes through the text of the paper, as with so many of those decisions and recommendations by the monitoring committee of the various treaties and covenants, one will be searching almost in vain for a reference to the unborn child, foetus, blastocyst or embryo - let us not worry about the terminology.  One will search in vain for a reference to that flesh and blood human being who constitutes a human being whose life is worthy of protection.  I think the committee has caught my drift and I hope I have not overstated it.  </p><p> If the committee believes, which it may not, that every human being has an inherent worth and dignity and is worthy of respect, the idea it would contemplate the Citizens' Assembly recommendations to the effect there should be wide-ranging abortion or that it should contemplate implementing the proposals by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, which are effectively wide-ranging abortion, then I strongly recommend it not to take that course of action.</p><p> I will say one last thing, which might seem to be a slight tangent but which nonetheless might be important for future discussion, about the European Convention on Human Rights, which is a regional convention as opposed to global ones from the UN, and the European Court of Human Rights.  My invitation to the committee is to get real and stay real.  The European Court of Human Rights has a problem - I think the committee will agree - and always had a problem with the right to life provision in Article 2 of the European Convention, which recognises the right to life.  How will it, as a political body that has to maintain the support of countries throughout Europe, deal with the right to life?  It is one thing to create a treaty such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child or the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and let each state ratify it with its own interpretation of rights' holders and the right to life.  It is another thing when there is a European convention that actually has teeth, real sanctions and practical political implications.</p><p> What the European Court of Human Rights has done will come as no surprise.  It is not a criticism of it but a comment and I defy anybody to say otherwise.  Over the past 30 years, the court has adopted a political interpretation of Article 2 and a strategy of margin of appreciation by not saying Article 2 has any particular meaning.  Each state has the entitlement to interpret it as it wishes in terms of how it understands rights' holders under Article 2.  That is just about okay from a political-pragmatic point of view.  When one then throws in a consensus doctrine, which is the idea that when a number of states move in a particular direction, the court follows them once they have reached a certain critical mass, then human rights have been moved into the area of majoritarian head-counting.  That is the way the court operates.  It has not done so yet in the context of abortion but there are apprehensions and concerns that it might do so in the medium future.  If a human right depends on whether 30 or 40 countries have adopted a particular strategy, I think the committee will agree it is a form of positivist law.  We have moved well away from the value that there is respect attributable to a human being by virtue of their very humanity.</p><p> The European Court of Human Rights is a political animal.  It operates in a political context and will behave in a manner which it sees as politically pragmatically appropriate.  In the medium term, that presents challenges to Ireland.  What the committee and Ireland should not do is simply roll over and wait for the consensus doctrine to apply in Europe or simply say we will go along with the "Right to choose" philosophy of the individual members of so many of the monitoring committees.  If Ireland believes the unborn child is worthy of protection, it should absolutely assert that right.  When we do get a referendum, as we most likely will next year, that will be the issue.  It will be whether we recognise that unborn children are entitled to respect for their dignity and worth or not.  It is a stark issue.</p><p> Having promised to finish, I will now finish and say I think it was clear from the discussion that lasted two hours with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission that it is a stark choice.  Those so called half-way house grounds are not in practice or intended to be limiting grounds; rather they are grounds that open the door to wide-ranging access to abortion.  They are intended by those who propose them to be so.  That is not in any sense to make a bad faith accusation - they are actually intended to be wide-ranging grounds.  The choice is a stark one however it is described in language.  It is a choice on one side between protection of unborn children based on their equality, equal respect for their mother, the right to life of the mother and absolute assurance in those circumstances that the mother's life is not imperilled in any way and, on the other side, wide-ranging abortion.  I do not believe there is a half-way house in practice, if we stay real.</p></speech>

I am struggling with the presentation.  I do not mean this to be in any way disrespectful to Professor Binchy.  The purpose of this committee is to discuss the potential legal implications of the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  We sought information and evidence from those who presented to us.  Regrettably what we have received from Professor Binchy is opinion and the use of what I would describe as highly emotive language.  I do not think it adds much to our debate or is in any way helpful.  Perhaps we did not make it clear that we sought evidence.  When we hear various decisions but no quotes it does not in any way help us to arrive at conclusions.  The statement Professor Binchy gave us contained a reference to his own personal experience.  That is opinion; it is neither evidence nor information, which is what we sought.</p> <p>  We asked previous presenters to detail for us the grades of risk in terms of health and whether it is possible to define in law terms such as "serious risk" and "grave risk".  Will Ms Zampas address that?  I understand it is difficult but she might be able to give us some information in that regard from her experience.  For the benefit of the committee, will she comment on Professor Binchy's statement that the monitoring bodies have a particular value system and that it somehow influences the decisions they come to or that in some way they are biased.  There was no evidence given as to what the value system is or to how it manifests itself.  Will Ms Zampas give us her view on what that is? </p></speech>

This session is on human rights.  From a human rights point of view - if I summarise without imposing all that material on the committee again - the point I am making is there is a stark choice for the committee, because in practice when the proposed shopping list of grounds are analysed, they amount in intent and effect to wide-ranging abortion.  That is a legal point, not an opinion.  It may be right or wrong but it is a legal point.  The point that monitoring committees have a certain function but that the treaty obligations of the State are somewhat distinct is also legal point which may be right or wrong.  There was legal analysis buried in the presentation.</p></speech>

They are not medical institutions with medical knowledge.  In Europe, in countries where a health exception extends beyond the time limits for abortion on request, the laws do not define it because it really depends on the woman's individual situation.  That assessment is best made in a clinical setting as opposed to by the legislature or, worse yet, in a courtroom.  I think the treaty bodies have viewed it in the same way.</p></speech>

It might be best to ask him.</p> <p>  There was a question on the value systems and a suggestion that they are biased.  I mentioned this briefly in my opening statement.  When Ireland ratifies treaties, for example the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, ICCPR, the Human Rights Committee monitors Ireland's adherence to the treaty.  That is the committee that issued the decision in the Whelan and Mellet cases.  Article 2 of the ICCPR clearly states that the State will fulfil its obligations under the provisions of the treaty to all persons within its territory without discrimination.  One of the treaty's provisions actually creates the human rights body that monitors State compliance.  When Ireland ratified that, it ratified itself to come before a committee that has an interpretive mandate.  By way of example, on its own the right to privacy means nothing - it is just a phrase.  There must be interpretive bodies to define what it means.  Ireland has ratified the treaty which creates this interpretive body and also the optional protocol which Ms Mellet and Ms Whelan used when they filed cases against Ireland.  Ireland agreed to provide that individuals within its territory can file individual complaints against Ireland.  If Ireland were to ignore that, it would ignore the essence of ratification of the optional protocol to begin with.</p></speech>

I will direct more of my questions to Ms Zampas because I think her contribution was very evidence-based.  We are dealing with changing our laws here.  Professor Binchy is obviously entitled to his opinion.  He explained very well how that opinion may be at odds with practically every human rights body on the planet, including with our own Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, and indeed that he is at variance with the Citizens' Assembly.  I do think he should correct his assertion that the Citizens' Assembly recommended abortion for disability.  That is not in any of the recommendations.  He may need to read them again.</p> <p>  Professor Binchy has repeatedly referred to the fact that abortion is a violation of the unborn's right to life.  If that was the case, why does he think that no international or regional human rights body has ever found a country to be in violation of human rights by providing broad abortion?</p></speech>

They are negotiated politically in New York or in Europe as the case may be, or in whatever region we are talking about, and they have this conscious diplomatic, ambiguous language which is used.  It is precisely to allow for ratification by states that have had wide-ranging abortion going back many years and states that are against legalised abortion and that protect the unborn child.  That is the whole strategy that is used by those who are formulating the treaties.  Believe me, that is absolutely on record.  It is not an opinion but an absolute acknowledged fact by everybody who is involved in the negotiation of treaties.  The Deputy can read it and see it for herself.  When it comes to the area of abortion, there is high alert in the discussions and tiptoeing.  Those who are formulating these treaties want them to be implemented.  If they were to have what might be regarded as a pro-life treaty, they would have relatively few ratifiers in the present international climate.  The Deputy is absolutely correct to say that in the international climate, particularly in certain quarters, there is wide-ranging support for legalised abortion.  That is obvious.  We would not dispute that.</p> <p>  I think the Deputy said I mis-described the Citizens' Assembly recommendations.  I actually said there were recommendations based on disability.  I did explain at the time that they did not use that word at all but they used the words "foetal anomaly" and "serious anomaly".  Are we going to be discussing whether Down's syndrome, spina bifida, blindness, or cleft palate are serious enough?  Would some doctors say "Yes" and some "No" in those circumstances?</p></speech>

I am not being rude but we have a time limit.  One could view it as an international political conspiracy whereby everybody is trying to orchestrate a position towards broad-ranging abortion provision, or one could interpret it that Professor Binchy's views are very much out of kilter with established norms in terms of international human rights protocol.  Nowhere, actually, is there a defined right to life before birth, which does not mean that prenatal interests cannot be protected.</p></speech>

The support of those who ratify was sought specifically on the basis that the protection afforded to the right to life was entirely consistent with protection for unborn life.  So it would be absolutely wrong to suggest that none of these treaties contains protection for the right to life of the unborn.  It is absolutely the reverse of that.  These treaties were drafted in such a manner that countries which are against legalised abortion and do protect unborn children should be invited to support them precisely on the basis that they do protect unborn life.</p></speech>

Would he not agree that Ireland has an abortion rate pretty much the same as other countries in which abortion is freely available?  In actual fact, the question is whether people can access an abortion service at home or, as is the case under the present <i>status quo </i>which Professor Binchy seems to be defending, the only people who cannot avail of abortion are those who cannot travel - vulnerable women, women with disabilities, women who are refugees or asylum seekers and so on.  Do we allow people to access health care at home?  Do we allow those who can travel somewhere else to do so?  What is the answer to that issue?  Do we detain women as they do in El Salvador?  I am not sure how we would do that.</p></speech>

However, that does not matter for the purposes of Deputy Daly's argument.  Are abortions taking place abroad?  Yes, they are taking place, manifestly, if we stay real.  Are there any proposals to introduce limitations in that area?  No, is the short answer.</p> <p>  Sociologically, the Deputy is right in what she says and I am sure she is right also in saying that there are disparities in certain circumstances, which by no means explain the entire phenomenon between rich and poor.  Her point is an entirely correct one.  If the protection of the right to life of the unborn child is not important, then that point has huge validity.  If it is important, however, the distinction that the Deputy identified would not be a reason for actually introducing a facility in this country for taking the life of the unborn.</p></speech>

I do not want to engage too much with Professor Binchy but I have one last question and I would appreciate if he dealt with it quickly.  The Professor talked about equality earlier.  When he was campaigning for a "No" vote in the marriage equality referendum, he stated: "True equality never requires the pretence that two relationships with different capacity are the same when they are not.  It never justifies the imposition of a false uniformity."</p><p>Does Professor Binchy not think that the equal right to life of the woman and the unborn is in fact a pretence that their capacities are the same, when they clearly are not?  One is a born, living human being and one is not.</p></speech>

We can exchange quotes later on.  I notice that none of his contribution was referenced but we can deal with that now.  We are trying to develop guidance for changing our legislation.  I would like to ask a question of Ms Zampas.  International human rights law is evolving all the time.  Our challenge here is to change our law to be in compliance with that.  Ms Zampas spent a lot of time dealing with the difficulties of bringing about a restrictive regime or a reasons-based regime.  Will she expand on that?  Would introducing legislation which permitted abortion in cases of, for example, rape, fatal foetal abnormality or serious risk to health satisfy our obligations under international human rights law?  Under international human rights law, when is it permissible to delay or withhold a pregnant woman's access to health-preserving medical care in order to preserve the life of the foetus?  Is it more acceptable if the risk to her health is less severe?  How are those issues dealt with?  Ms Zampas has had experience in El Salvador.  She may like to look at the area of when it is permissible under international human rights law to detain a pregnant person in a hospital or psychiatric facility in order to prolong her pregnancy.</p> <p>  It may also be important to touch on the point which Ms Zampas made in her submission, which was that placing women at the centre does not mean that states should ignore foetal interests.  That is a very important point.  Will Ms Zampas elaborate on it?  How could a state like Ireland protect both women and foetuses in the context of abortion law?  What is the best way of doing that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-04a.158" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Christina Zampas" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017100400002#U01900"><p>I will begin with the Deputy's first question on grounds-based regimes and how they function.  The only one of the 47 member states of the Council of Europe that has a minimum grounds-based regime which international human rights law speaks to is Poland.  Ireland has the second most restrictive law in Europe.  Malta has a total ban, Ireland has a life exception and Poland has these four grounds.  As was referenced earlier by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, there have been three cases before the European Court of Human Rights in respect of Poland's abortion law.  Those cases did not seek an expansion of the grounds but challenged the fact that these two women and one girl, in separate cases, did not get access to lawful abortion services in Poland.</p> <p>  One case concerned a woman's health, one was a case concerning rape and the other case was a foetal impairment case.  These are essentially the grounds in Poland.  In each of those cases, women were not allowed to access abortion and in each of those cases the women who experienced those violations were vulnerable women.  One woman had a disability, another was a child, and another was on a low income.  These are the people who restrictive laws impact.  In each of these three cases, the court found violations of the European Convention on Human Rights in Poland's failure to actually implement its law.  The court said that a right cannot be theoretical or illusory.  It must be real and practical and the state must implement practical measures so that women can access lawful services.  It found that, in these cases, it did not.  In two of the cases, the court also found a violation of the prohibition on inhuman and degrading treatment in not allowing the women access to lawful abortion.  </p> <p>  It is very difficult to regulate a grounds-based abortion regime, first of all because there are usually exceptions in the criminal code.  There is criminal liability, which creates a chilling factor.  It is also very difficult for the Legislature to define a health risk specifically.  Human rights bodies have not done that, and neither has the European Court of Human Rights.  These bodies tend not to go into a medical analysis of whether or not there is a health risk.  They just do not like to do that because most of them are lawyers and not doctors or health care providers.  </p> <p>  New Zealand also has a minimum grounds-based approach and human rights bodies have heavily criticised New Zealand for its multiple provider authorisation.  New Zealand has something like the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 in that the approval of multiple doctors is required.  It is far less restrictive than Ireland but there is still a requirement for numerous doctors to approve.  It really impacts rural areas where doctors are just not available to give approval.  The UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, CEDAW, has called it a convoluted law which strips away women's autonomy and does not really grant them the right to abortion in the cases provided for in New Zealand's law.</p></speech>

Would it be fair to say that the starting point is the issue of accessing health care services?  I believe that the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission was of the view that this should be looked at from a health point of view.</p></speech>

My question is for Ms Zampas.  When she criticises Ireland for not having wider access to abortion, she seems to paint the picture that Ireland routinely puts women's lives at risk because of our laws.</p><p>It is only fair that the true position be stated and acknowledged more often, namely, that Ireland has consistently been one of the safest countries in the world in which to be pregnant.  Ireland is as safe as England, for example, and considerably safer than the US for pregnant women.  Nobody can dispute that those two countries have abortion on demand.  Can Ms Zampas comment on Ireland being one of the safest places in the world to be pregnant?</p></speech>

Most women go to the UK to get abortions but they also go to other places in Europe.  Some even go as far as the United States to get abortions.  They have that safety valve.  It is not a situation like that in El Salvador where women are dying because they do not have the safety valve of travelling to a country where the practice is legal.  However, the case of Savita was known around the world.  She died.  According to some of the reports produced, at least one of the factors that caused the decision not to give her proper care was the criminal legislation and, potentially, the eighth amendment.  To say that there has been no death, that was an unfortunate case-----</p></speech>

What happened to Savita was an awful tragedy.  I know of people outside Ireland who think Ireland is not a safe place for women to be pregnant.  It is one of the safest places in the world for pregnant women and has been over the past 30 years.  The picture the witness is painting is that because of our laws and restrictions, Ireland is not a safe place for pregnant women.  That is the impression I am getting, but consistently over the past 30 years Ireland has been one of the safest places in the world for women to be pregnant.  Does the witness have the same perception as I have?  No country is perfect.  For me and for women who are pregnant, Ireland is one of the safest countries in the world in which to have babies.</p></speech>

I also understand that there have been reports indicating that the eighth amendment has impacted upon the treatment of pregnant women during childbirth.  For women with wanted pregnancies who wish to continue their pregnancy, there have been reports that the eighth amendment has impacted on health care providers' decisions on the quality of care those women receive.  I have read reports of that.</p></speech>

It is difficult to gather that data.  In Ireland, it is also very difficult to determine how many women are travelling.  It is said that approximately 4,000 women are travelling to England and Wales per year, but probably many more women travel all over Europe and there are reports of women going to the US.  There are also women having illegal abortions in the country through use of the abortion pill.  The figure is probably much higher than 4,000 if the situation in every other country that has a very restrictive law is similar.</p></speech>

Does Professor Binchy agree with democracy?  In his language, he appears to disregard the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  We heard at great length the week before last that it was a very scientific process and we can stand over the fact that it was a representative sample of people in Ireland.  I take issue with the very deliberate language Professor Binchy used.  He used the word "disability" where it was not used.  He clarified the position but the use of that word is particularly inflammatory.  He used the words "enthusiastic for legalised abortion".  Again, I have an issue with that.  I do not believe a woman is ever enthusiastic about having a termination.  He is quite dismissive of the right to choose and I take issue with that.  Professor Binchy said that Ireland does not roll over.  The women of Ireland have rolled over for long enough under comments from the witness and various other commentators over the years.  It is high time that we stop rolling over and state that we do not accept the language that we have heard today from Professor Binchy.</p> <p>  I catch his drift, and very much so.  I am staying real.  We had the case of Savita Halappanavar, which is a real case.  Some 12 women leave this country every day.  The witness has absolutely no basis for the strong evidence that our abortion rate is lower than anywhere else in the UK, because those data are not available.  We probably have a higher rate because of our poor sex education and the preventative measures in place to avoid unwanted pregnancy in the first instance.  There are no data for the use of early-term abortion pills.  While I respect the fact that the committee invited Professor Binchy to appear before it, some of his evidence is just his own view.  However, having listened to his evidence, does Professor Binchy think that the provision inserted into Article 40.3.3&deg; in 1992, allowing women the right to travel, should be repealed?</p></speech>

Would the witness agree that a born woman's right is at any time superior to that of the unborn child?  I am sure the witness is also familiar with the PP case.  Does he think the court decided incorrectly and struck the wrong balance on the clinically brain-dead pregnant woman's rights?  I am conscious that this woman has a family who might be listening to this today so I will have to be sensitive.  How does the witness feel about the rights of the clinically brain-dead woman who was pregnant over the rights of the child?  She was approximately 16 weeks pregnant.  Does he think the court should have forced life support for this woman to be continued against her partner's, parents' and family's wishes until such time as the foetus could be surgically extracted from her body?</p></speech>

Ms Zampas said abortion laws framed in terms of the four minimum grounds required by international human rights law did not provide effective access.  Are there any countries in Europe that list these grounds in their laws and how effective, or not, are they?</p></speech>

In a case where a woman's health was in danger, she was unable to access a lawful abortion.  In a case where a 14 year old girl was raped, she was not able to access an abortion.  In another case, a woman was unable to access proper prenatal diagnosis to determine the extent of a foetal impairment.  In all of those cases, the European Court of Human Rights found violations of the right to privacy and in two of those cases it also found that the state's failure to ensure access to abortion violated the prohibition on cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.  That is the only country in Europe which has the four grounds.</p></speech>

First, the expression has been contested in medical journals on the basis that it is not an accurate medical term.  In these circumstances, it is a question of life-limiting conditions where a number of children are born and live for a short period after birth, or for a considerable period in a very much smaller number of cases.  As such, we are talking about life-limiting conditions.  On the basis of a life-limiting condition, is it right from the standpoint of human rights intentionally to take that life, however short its life prospects are, before he or she has had an opportunity to live his or her life?  If one believes in the equal right to life of every human being, one says "No" in those circumstances.  One says that in those circumstances, it is appropriate to protect the life of the unborn child.</p></speech>

I believe the right to choose means one would have bodily autonomy.  It is not a half term; it is a very descriptive one.  It is the right to have a baby and it is the right to control fertility.  It is quite a wide-ranging term and it is very cheap to refer to it as a half statement.  It is about women having bodily autonomy.  Does the witness think there should be anything different about women and men having bodily autonomy?</p></speech>

It is correct to say that if one finishes the sentence, bodily integrity is crucially important.  Unless one is dodging and weaving, the relevant part of the right to choose in those circumstances means the right to take the life of the unborn child.  That is what it is about.  If we are talking about medical care outside that context, we are in entire agreement.  However, if the proposal is that the right to choose is the right to take the life of the unborn child, it is a proposition that needs justification.</p></speech>

What does the witness see as an unborn child having an inherent right to life?  Which one should be protected?  He replied to Deputy O&rsquo;Connell that he does not believe the right to travel should be taken out.  He is saying some people should be able to travel.  In reality it is quite an elitist view of an inherent right to life.  Is it only those in minority groups?  What unborn children actually have that right if it will not be protected at all costs?  This inherent right to life makes the whole argument incoherent.</p><p> The presentation started with a list of premises and a conclusion.  As a philosophy graduate of logic, premise No. 1 fell down when it said that foetal life and human life have an equal right to life.  Everything else fell from thereafter for me.</p><p> I agree with the presentation on disability down to the last sentence.  While I agree with the first part, what about the right to life of people, the child or young girl with a disability who needs to access abortion but cannot travel in some situations due to a disability?  When one talks about the rights of someone with a disability, one is not talking about foetal life and a possible disability they will have, one is talking about a person in the world.  Will Ms Zampas elaborate on that in a human rights context?  If the unborn child has a significant foetal abnormality that is not likely to result in death before or shortly after birth, how can the State's duty to combat discrimination against disabled people be balanced against its duty to ensure women have access to abortion?  Are they comparable in the sense that when we talk about discrimination against disabled people, we are in fact not talking about foetal life?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-04a.245" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Christina Zampas" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017100400002#X00200"><p>Human rights bodies, as I said in my presentation, have recommended that countries ensure access to abortion in cases of severe or fatal foetal impairment.  They go back and forth and are not always consistent.  Looking back at the recommendations over time, they have always been severe.  Lately, they use the term &ldquo;fatal&rdquo; and sometimes they use &ldquo;severe or fatal&rdquo;.  It is hard for a legislator or a committee member to decide for a woman how it will impact them.  These are very difficult decisions.  These are always wanted pregnancies.  They get the determination very late and it is a difficult decision to make.  Women make those decisions, oftentimes with a heavy heart.  We have to keep that real and see that those are not easy decisions for women to make.  They are very individual decisions.</p> <p>  The treaty bodies have never said the foetal impairment grounds should be eliminated in a law.  The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recently issued a general comment on women and girls with disabilities.  It recommended states should ensure access to sexual and reproductive health services, the same as any other women, taking into consideration their disability and their needs.  It never addressed the issue of abortion on the grounds of foetal impairment.  That says a lot in its first general recommendation on women with disabilities.</p> <p>  The best way to address the problem of discrimination against persons with disabilities is to address the underlying discrimination.  Why is this happening?  Society needs to take steps to make the individual's life, but also the family life of the parents, easy.  There should be benefits, social and educational supports.  It is about time Ireland ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities because it would really help setting its policies straight on helping persons with disabilities.  That is the best way to address this.  Restricting abortion on impairment grounds is not going to limit access to abortion.  Some countries do not have explicit foetal impairment exceptions, but they read health exceptions very broadly to include any sort of health issue.</p></speech>

It is astounding that in an area such as a convention on the rights of persons with a disability, that an impairment ground does not interest the committee.  They fail to be sensitive to the fact that there is a ground for abortion based on disability and in terms of a disability convention one would have thought they would have some interest in that.  However, as Ms Zampas rightly said, they do not.  Why?  The reason is that is their value system.  They are perfectly entitled to their value system.  There is no question of conspiracy or bias.  These are words I would not use.  Their value system, however, means that the way they understand human rights in a convention on disability means that they do not see that abortion for disability presents problems.</p></speech>

In the spirit of keeping it real, will Ms Zampas discuss the 12 women who go to Britain each day for abortions?  I am conscious that no after-care services are provided in Ireland for those women.  Will she speak to us about this topic and the implications for those women who travel each day?</p> <p>  With respect, I find Professor Binchy&rsquo;s views quite extreme.  In cases of rape and incest, does he believe the victims should be forced to continue with their pregnancies?  Women are told under pain of criminal sanction that if they take an autonomous decision as to how their own bodies are to be used and opt to abort a foetus, they are then criminalised.  Will Professor Binchy list any other area of Irish law where somebody is required to use their body as subsistence for another person under pain of criminal sanction?</p></speech>

It is the nature of pregnancy.  In pregnancy there are two lives intimately related to each other.  That is the short and rather obvious answer to the first point.</p> <p>  Again, the Senator mentioned it is an extreme position to take the view that every human being has inherent worth that needs equal protection.  It is a position worth considering and one I am sure the Senator accepts in every other area of life.  I am sure he accepts it about ethnic background, mental and physical capacity and in terms of developmental stages.  We do not say that an old person loses their human rights status simply because they are very old.  This is a proposition which we should accept as axiomatic.</p> <p>  Senator Ruane said she did not accept the premise.  She may disagree with the premise.  That is anybody's entitlement.  However, to argue for inequality, one has to say it in clear terms that there are inequalities between people.  It is an argument that needs justification.</p></speech>

That is not something with which most people with common sense would agree.  For Professor Binchy to equate that with people who have been born, it frankly does not make sense on common sense grounds.  It is an extreme position.</p> <p>  Professor Binchy did not answer my other question.  Does he believe victims of rape and incest should be forced to continue with their pregnancies?</p></speech>

Do I believe it would be right that we should have a ground for abortion based on rape and incest?  I do not, first, on the principle I stated there, namely, in those circumstances one has an innocent human being absolutely innocent of the horror of the circumstances of his or her conception.</p><p>If one maintains the position of simple respect for human life, then one does not actually countenance the taking of that human life.</p><p> I would add a pragmatic supplement.  This is something that has emerged in the discussion through the afternoon today.  If grounds were introduced, those grounds would in fact be wide-ranging grounds.  Whatever about the theoretical appeal they might have, in practice those grounds would be interpreted broadly.  Indeed, I believe I am correct in saying honestly that the advocates for those grounds believe they should be interpreted broadly.  As a result, they would be likely to result in wide-ranging access to abortion.</p></speech>

That is a clear long-standing human rights obligation.</p></speech>

The criminal law plays a major role in creating a chilling factor for women in getting post-abortion care.  Women are scared.  If a 14-year sentence is looming over a woman who has had an illegal abortion at home in Ireland or abroad and she needs post-abortion care for a complication, she would ask questions.</p> <p>  Many people simply do not know what the law is or what the requirements are.  Human rights bodies are clear.  Post-abortion care should always be available and doctors should not report women to the police for having illegal abortions when they come in for post-abortion care.  Some countries have done that and there has been heavy criticism by the UN Committee against Torture against Chile, where women were seeking post-abortion care and doctors were calling the police, who came to the medical centre.</p></speech>

I was called out earlier to make a quorum for the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, of which I am a member, and I had to stay for some time.  That is why there may have been confusion.  I apologise to Ms Zampas regarding the misunderstanding and I thank her for coming.  I have listened and read carefully what she has said.  In all her work as an international human rights lawyer has she ever raised concerns about barbaric practices, like the treatment of babies born alive after botched abortions and left to die alone without receiving any medical attention or loving care as they breathe their last breaths?  It is a harrowing image I present, but, sadly, it is a real one.  Is Ms Zampas aware &ndash; she probably is &ndash; that England and Canada are two countries where such abuses routinely arise and have been well documented?  Has Ms Zampas ever taken a stand against such horrific abuses?  Is it the singular goal of Ms Zampas in this area to push for wider access to abortion?  I am deeply concerned at the complete absence of reference to infants born alive after abortions.  What exactly are the views of the guests on that?  It cannot simply be ignored.</p> <p>  When I was out, people on social media and elsewhere made comments.  I got permission from the Chairman to go to a Topical Issue debate.  The D&aacute;il is sitting and other committees are sitting.  If we leave the room, there are only 12 or 13 present most of the time.  People on social media are attacking me for not staying.  I got permission from the Chairman to leave.  She allowed me in before my time, in fairness to her.  That is pretty pedantic and ridiculous.</p> <p>  The guests may be aware of the developments in the United States today, in particular, the passing of the pain-capable unborn child protection law, which would limit abortion to 20 weeks.  It is clear that the international situation is not as clear as some would like to make it.</p> <p>  I take offence at Deputy O'Connell &ndash; she is back now &ndash; for accusing some of us of telling lies.  I am sure it is directed at me and some others.  If that happened in the D&aacute;il Chamber, it would not be tolerated and would have to be withdrawn.  I appeal to her to withdraw that scurrilous remark.</p></speech>

I did not tell any lies and I do not intend telling any lies.  I intend to try to speak about what I feel.  I want to speak like others without fear of intimidation and bullying and being called a liar.  It is profoundly disturbing that this is going on and it is not easy.  If we leave, we are being watched by people and we cannot leave.  That is ridiculous.  Either we are going to discuss the issues here, as Professor Binchy has said, or we are not.</p> <p>  I am shocked at some of the treatment Professor Binchy has got today.

I am not familiar exactly with the references Deputy McGrath is making or how well-documented they are.  If something like that does occur, I would hope that the state would actually step in and investigate it.  The state has an obligation to investigate something if it rises to the level of potential criminal liability.  The state should investigate, prosecute and punish any perpetrators who have created any harm that rises to that level.  In potential malpractice cases, the health care laws would kick in and cases would be filed against the doctors or any of the providers responsible.  Also, administrative law would kick in for such cases and doctors would have their licences removed.  I am not familiar with the precise cases Deputy McGrath is talking about, but if they did occur, I would hope that the law in those countries, in Canada and the UK, would be strong enough to address any harm.</p></speech>

She was the victim of an aborted abortion and was left on a window sill or ledge to die.  Thankfully, she survived.  A caring nurse passing by picked her up.  She came in to tell her story.  There are many cases and there is evidence of it all over the world.  Where is the monitoring committee in those cases?  All this adds to what Professor Binchy said about the role and the status of the monitoring committee.  The committee does not have any real function in dealing with individual countries.  The committee has to be careful in the language it uses because it has no legal standing, as such, other than the treaties that are enacted.</p></speech>

Professor Binchy said that the 1983 amendment of the Constitution gave equal right to life to the unborn and the mother.</p><p>That was the theory at the time, but it was not what happened in actual practice.  We could quote instances, but I do not want to go into them at the moment.  The problem arose when a decision had to be made on how to determine "the equal right to life".  It was found that it was not possible to do this in practice.  The medical practitioners were very quick to admit that it was not possible.  Then a number of amendments or attempted amendments took place.  I refer, for example, to the right to travel.  The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 was introduced to protect the right to life of the mother.

If we were to have a long historical discussion, I would say that the decision in the A, B and C case was mistaken because its factual premises, on the basis of which certain legal conclusions were made, were quite cloudy.  I accept that the 2013 Act reiterated exactly that a woman's life should be protected.  I would have concerns, however.  I opposed the 2013 legislation not on that basis, but on the basis of the suicidal ideation ground, which is an entirely separate issue that I am more than happy to discuss with the committee.  Deputy Durkan has asked me about cases in which clear physical conditions are affecting the mother.  As I have said, that matter was dealt with quite clearly by the decision in the X case.</p></speech>

The first ground provided for in the 2013 Act relates to medical conditions and the second ground relates to mental conditions which can ultimately lead to a serious health condition and, consequently, a threat to the life of the mother.  My presumption is that Professor Binchy conditionally accepts what the 2013 Act says.</p></speech>

I have no difficulty whatsoever with that.  If legislation chooses to say that, there is absolutely no difficulty with it.  The aspect of the 2013 legislation which I found objectionable was that it provided for the new ground of suicidal ideation, as introduced in the decision in the X case.  I opposed that on the basis of the injustice it involves and also on the basis of the empirical non-justification for that ground from the standpoint of actual empirical evidence in the health area.  That is an issue for then.  The committee is now looking forward to the question of whether the eighth amendment, as interpreted in the X case and as applied in the 2013 legislation, should be repealed or modified.  I understand that is what the committee is dealing with at the moment.</p></speech>

If women would like to have such counselling, of course it should be treated like any other health care service and any other decision regarding women's health.  If a woman has a problem with the decision she has made, or with any aspect of her life, the State should be able to provide psychological services to her to help her realise her right to health, including her right to mental health.  I refer to decisions relating to abortion or to any other decisions made by a woman, or a man for that matter.  I think the State should provide appropriate psychological care in such circumstances if that is what the person wants.</p></speech>

Is this not a question of the pregnant individual's autonomy rather than the country's autonomy?</p><p>Does Professor Binchy accept that if the aim of Ireland's abortion ban was to save so-called unborn lives, it is not doing a very good job?  Given that ten women a day are leaving the country and at least three others are having abortions in their own bedrooms in this country, the ban is certainly not working.</p><p>I have a third question for Professor Binchy.  Does he favour forced pregnancy?  Does he favour forcing a pregnant woman who does not want to be pregnant to continue with that pregnancy?  He said earlier that he does not favour injunctions to prevent women from travelling.  It seems to me that he did at one point, when he served as legal adviser to the pro-life amendment campaign, but he just will not get away with it now.  He has said he wants the sources of all claims that are made.  During a lecture Professor Binchy gave in the Coombe in 1980, he said:</p><blockquote>If we are to allow sympathy for the woman to stop us from regarding abortion as criminal... why should that sympathy simply stop at our shorelines?  ...A strong argument can be made that our law should give such effect as it can to the principle that unborn life is entitled to be protected.</blockquote> <p>He accepted that this would cause a lot of criticism, but he felt there was a strong argument to be made for it.  He seems to have changed his mind since then.  Is that fair enough?</p><p>My fourth question relates to a claim Professor Binchy has made about the Citizens' Assembly's proposal that abortion should be available up to birth.  He has suggested that this would lead to abortion with little or no restrictions in place.  Has he not been scaremongering like this for a long time?  He made similar comments in 1992 in response to the ruling in the X case.  He claimed in <i>The Irish Times</i>of 6 March 1992 that the ruling had &quot;introduced an abortion regime of wide-ranging dimensions, beyond any effective control or practical limitation&quot;.  He went on to say that as a result of the Supreme Court judgment, &quot;those who authorise and carry out abortions in Ireland [will be placed] beyond the reach of criminal law&quot;.  Nothing could be further from the truth in relation to the X case.  We have seen how it is practically impossible for a woman to access an abortion by claiming she is suicidal.</p><p>In 1992, around the time of the X case, Professor Binchy was asked whether he thinks suicidal women should be allowed to have abortions.</p><p>He was asked if a woman went on to commit suicide after being refused an abortion, what would he say?  He said that it would be very regrettable.  He also said that there should not be any legal sanctions attaching to travel abroad, which was a change from his previous position.  <br/><br/>Professor Binchy is asking politicians to listen to him but did they not listen to him in 1983 and is that not why we are here today?  He says he favours the equal right to life of the unborn child and the woman, which is practically impossible to adjudicate over in any case.  Was it not his original proposal in the pro-life amendment campaign, PLAC, that: &quot;The State recognises the absolute right to life of every unborn child from conception, and accordingly guarantees to respect and protect such a law.&quot;  I believe that is stated on page 63 of <i>Marital, Privacy and Family Law, Studies</i>, but I can check that.  Is Professor Binchy not in favour of a lot more than he has said here today?<br/><br/>Ms Christina Zampas said that if restrictions are put in place on abortion law, it effectively means that people's human rights cannot be guaranteed.  The witnesses in the previous session said something similar.  Would Ms Zampas be concerned that politicians outside this committee are saying that the type of proposals from the Citizens' Assembly would not be passed by the people and, therefore, they are talking about quite restrictive legislation?  Would that not lead to a continuation of Ireland contravening best practice in human rights laws?</p></speech>

If the Deputy reads the full article to which she referred in the ethical reproduction book, it does not actually constitute a final advocacy position at all.  I very much support the eight amendment, the outcome of the 1983 referendum, and those who favour legalised abortion oppose it very much.  It has been around for 34 years and it has saved many lives in these circumstances.  I completely accept the international realities.  The thing that is wrong with the eight amendment, as far as those who are seeking to repeal it are concerned, is that it does its job, not that it does not do its job.  It has done its job quite effectively, as effectively as we could imagine an amendment, a constitutional protection, would do, in the circumstances of international realities in which we find ourselves.  That is precisely why there is such an attack on it at the moment.</p></speech>

I was not sure I understood Deputy Durkan's question regarding psychological care for women before and after having abortions.  I want to be clear there are no studies that indicate that women who have abortions have psychological problems afterwards because of the abortion.  There are no definitive studies showing that.  I am not sure if that is what he was referring to, and I note he is not present.</p></speech>

It questions women's decision-making agency when states impose mandatory psychological counselling beforehand or waiting periods.  A woman has already usually made a very clear decision on what she wants by the time she seeks an abortion.  I just wanted to make that clear.</p></speech>

I believe it is far better than a grounds-based approach.  We are seeing human rights bodies starting to recognise that.  In terms of the Citizens' Assembly recommendations, serious consideration should be given towards having a proposal which calls for abortion on request.</p></speech>

I want to direct my question to Ms Zampas.  She referred to the first trimester when we were discussing abortion.  The Citizens' Assembly has discussed it and made a recommendation providing for the delivery of certainty.  Ms Justice Laffoy, who chaired the Citizens' Assembly, has appeared before the joint committee.  The recommendations from it are clear.  Some 64% said that, to deliver certainty, there should be abortion right to the very end.  Ms Zampas has mentioned the first trimester.  Given her specialty in human rights law, is she saying it fits better within the first trimester or with what the Citizens' Assembly has recommended?  I am looking for evidence from her to back up what the Citizens' Assembly has suggested.</p></speech>

Human rights bodies have not done that.  That has primarily been left up to the states and there has not been much challenge to gestational limit laws.  It is an area where there is not much jurisprudence from human rights bodies on that.  The committee could consider examining how other European countries handle it.  Most of the 40 member states of the Council of Europe that allow abortion on request range from having a period of 12 to 18 weeks on request.  They allow from ten to a maximum of 18 weeks on request and afterwards they allow for abortion on other minimum grounds.  In almost every country in Europe, the life and health exception does not have a limit.  It is very hard to distinguish between health and life.  When does a health risk become a life risk?  That decision has to be made depending upon the individual situation.  The health care provider and the woman are in the best position to do that.  In almost all countries in Europe, there is no gestational limit for when a woman's life is in danger or when her health is in danger.</p></speech>

It states:</p><blockquote>64% of the Members recommended that the termination of pregnancy without restriction should be lawful.  Of the Members who voted on that Ballot:- 48% have recommended that the termination of pregnancy without restriction should be lawful up to 12 months gestation age only.  <br /><br />- 44% have recommended that the termination of pregnancy without restriction should be lawful up to 22 weeks gestation age only.<br /><br />- 8% have recommended that the termination of pregnancy should be lawful with no restriction to gestational age.  </blockquote> <p>I apologise for interjecting but I wanted to clarify that.</p></speech>

That is fantastic.  One of the reasons I asked that question relates to children in care.  Last week, Ms Mary O'Toole, senior counsel, appeared before the committee.</p><p>She clearly said that a lot of the cases that come before the courts relate to children in care.  That is the reason I ask the question about the gestational period because sometimes it might not be possible to work within the timeframe given that there are courts and care workers involved.  I wonder about the human rights of adolescents and their points of view.  I would welcome the perspective of Ms Zampas on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-04a.362" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Christina Zampas" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017100400002#BB00200"><p>The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has been very clear that adolescents should be involved in the decision-making process regarding abortion and has called for the removal of parental consent requirements.  The latter would include guardian consent requirements.  Adolescents are an especially vulnerable group because of the stigma not just around abortion but also around adolescent sexuality and what that could mean in terms of the relationship with the family and the parents.  There is also the question of their vulnerability in carrying a pregnancy - their physiological vulnerability.  Adolescents are at a much higher risk of having something go wrong with the pregnancy and risking serious disability because of it because their bodies are not formed enough to carry a pregnancy.  That is a medical fact.  I think it is 15 times more likely - I am not sure of the exact number - that something would go wrong.</p> <p>  In light of that, I want to make a comment about Professor Binchy's remark in terms of there being no evidence that adolescents are suicidal when they are pregnant.  Actually, it is the opposite.  There is evidence to show that adolescents who are pregnant and who do not have access to abortion are suicidal and it is one of the causes of death of pregnant young girls especially in countries with really restrictive abortion laws because of the stigma attached, because of their sexuality and their pregnancy.  I just wanted to clarify that.</p></speech>

Members might already have seen the evidence that was given in 2013 by the psychiatrists, whose number  included a range of people of entirely different value systems, and they were not of the view that this ground was an appropriate one.  I think that is a fair summary of the thrust of the evidence that was given.  They are the professionals in the area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-04a.364" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1401" speakername="R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017100400002#BB00400"><p>I repeat my apologies.  As a result of a family bereavement, I was unable to be here earlier.  Professor Binchy is very welcome.  I congratulate him on being a voice of sanity and compassion over the years in an increasingly uncaring world.  His activity on behalf of people with disabilities, his great work promoting the rule of law and helping the rule of law in Africa stands in perfect consistency with his vision of a society that includes everybody.  He has always spoken in terms that really appeal to people of goodwill of all faiths and none and from a purely human rights perspective.</p> <p>  There are two aspects to the question I want to put to Professor Binchy.  First, does he agree that truth and fact are increasingly casualties in this debate?  Perhaps even here today it might be no harm to pick up on some points that were made when I was listening in to the debate.  I think Deputy O'Connell is mistaken.  Professor Binchy might clarify but it is my understanding that the Citizens' Assembly made separate recommendations in respect of abortion on the grounds of disability, so-called fatal foetal abnormality was one recommendation but there was an entirely separate recommendation relating to foetal abnormality or foetal anomaly.  From her question, I do not think Deputy O'Connell appears to realise that is the case.  Clarity is important.  My belief is that the Citizens' Assembly put forward separate recommendations.  Is that also Professor Binchy's understanding?</p></speech>

Let us take Deputy Coppinger's figures in terms of the proportion of drug-induced abortions, and there was reference to at least three others &ndash; compared with ten women travelling.  That is a tragic situation.  Everybody agrees that some abortions have taken place notwithstanding the eight amendment, but it is a matter of fact that, even allowing for imported drugs, Ireland&rsquo;s abortion rates are very low.  The evidence shows, as a matter of fact when one compares it with other countries, particularly our nearest neighbour, that something has caused people not to opt for abortion in circumstances where individuals in other countries do.  Is that not really a matter of fact rather than opinion?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-04a.368" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor William Binchy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017100400002#BB00800"><p>I believe it to be a matter of fact.  I am not a sociologist.  I have not carried out the empirical tests.  That is a matter for somebody who is not, as it were, coming to this issue from a value position to go and do the count.  The wider sociological question of the impact of the amendment on a society - the impact of any legal framework on a society - is a highly difficult and subtle thing to actually work out.  I would have to say that.  Broadly speaking, however, I agree with Senator Mullen, as I think he would agree with me, that the issues do not depend on that fact one way or another.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-04a.369" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1406" speakername="Catherine Noone" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017100400002#BB00900"><p>I will interject to clarify the point regarding the two recommendations to which Senator Mullen referred.  They relate to circumstances where:</p><blockquote>The unborn child has a foetal abnormality that is likely to result in death before or shortly after birth (89%)<br /><br />The unborn child has a significant foetal abnormality that is not likely to result in death before or shortly after birth (80%)</blockquote> <p>Those are the two.</p></speech>

Those issues are important because rather than being so fast and loose about facts in respect of an issue that is life-and-death in nature, it is really important that we strive for clarity.  That means telling the full story.  Going back to the question of abortions having been prevented, it is the case is it not that in Northern Ireland it was claimed that 100,000 lives had been preserved by the operation of the law there that the Advertising Standards Authority upheld the right to state that.  The notion of it being false advertising was dismissed.  I understand it is also the case that an actuarial study in Ireland estimated conservatively that a similar figure of lives, 100,000, had been saved on the assumption that had there not been the eight amendment legislation would have followed at some stage, gradually, to legalise abortion on increasingly wide grounds.  Is that correct?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-04a.371" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor William Binchy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017100400002#BB01100"><p>I believe that to be correct.  However, a simpler test is if the amendment was useless, if it was not actually protecting unborn lives from abortion, I do not believe the campaign to repeal it would be so strong.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-04a.372" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1401" speakername="R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017100400002#BB01200"><p>On the question of human rights, I have heard the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe say human rights do not apply before birth.  Professor Binchy was a member of the Irish Human Rights Commission at one point.  I note with concern that the Convention on the Rights of the Child refers, in its preamble, to the right of the child before as well as after birth but this appears to be completely negatived by what appears to be a clique of people who adopt the cloak of human rights but who, increasingly, are interpreting it to exclude one whole human being at the heart of this debate.  In other words, they see only one life worthy of being accorded respect for human dignity and human rights whereas Professor Binchy and those of his ilk on the human rights scene have always seen two people.  Is it of concern to him that, effectively, human rights are losing their way and are being hijacked by people who do not want to see any rights.  I note Ms Zampas's reluctance to get into the business of gestational limits but surely that very reluctance of the human rights community to talk about gestational limits shows that they really do not give a damn about any unborn child's rights.</p></speech>

It is true to say that the monitoring committees is in favour of legalised abortion in the wide-ranging circumstances that have been described.  That is not a question of a false assertion; that is very definitely what it proposes.  If one were to suggest that it did otherwise, its members would be grossly offended.  It is not to vilify them, to allege that they are biased or have an agenda - that is their approach.  That is their value system.  They attach it then to the human rights treaties and, as Senator Mullen rightly said, the Convention on the Rights of the Child includes in its preamble the reference to the protection of children before birth.  Why was that there?  It was there to attract the support of countries with a protection of unborn life in terms of their laws so that they would ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which of course they did.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-04a.380" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Christina Zampas" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017100400002#CC00200"><p>As I said in my presentation earlier, of which I think the Senator will have a hard copy, no human rights body has ever found a liberal law to be in violation of a treaty provision.  No cases are being brought in this regard, and this is because such bodies recognise that the right to life, the right to health, the right to non-discrimination and the right to be free from torture and other ill-treatment are rights that pregnant women have and that if one takes away the right of a woman to decide, those rights could potentially be implicated.  No human rights body has ever criticised a liberal abortion law or asked a country to restrict its abortion-on-request law.  That is clear.  It is not of late that human rights bodies have not interpreted the right to life to apply to prenatal life; this position goes back to the development of the human rights treaties to begin with, just like with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, CRC.  In every case, including the CRC, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ICCPR, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, there were attempts to include in the text a right to life from conception or later foetal rights and they were rejected by the states that were in committee and adopted the treaty.  There were votes on these matters; they were not just recently decided by all these committees due to their having a certain value base.  States decided this.</p></speech>

Does she think that the preamble to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, in which reference is made to the right of the child before as well as after birth to care, etc., would still be there were it to be drawn up today, given that she has accepted my point that there is no human rights intervention in favour of the unborn against any overly liberal law that she can speak of?  Secondly, given her association with Canada, how can she not be aware of botched abortions there?  Is this just an omission on her part?  She says in very general terms that if the criminal law were to apply, it should apply, but how can she not be aware of - or does she deny - the fact that official Canadian figures showed that over a ten-year period starting in 2000, 491 babies who survived botched abortions were abandoned by medical staff and left to die alone in the corners of hospitals?  Again, I draw her attention to this because I am aware that the question of late-term abortions and babies surviving such abortions has been-----</p></speech>

I am the last speaker and I am not holding anyone else up.  It appears to be the case that the figures are there yet Ms Zampas does not seem to be aware of them.  Can she shed any light on that for me?</p></speech>

I will not answer it again.  Senator Mullen's other question about the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its preamble is a very important one, and the convention does a very good job of protecting prenatal interests.  It says that the best way to protect prenatal interests is to make sure unwanted pregnancies decline and, therefore, that states should have comprehensive sexuality education programmes in and out of schools that are mandatory, evidence-based and age-appropriate throughout schooling, that all forms of contraception should be fully available and affordable to all women, that there should be strong safe motherhood programmes so women who are pregnant with wanted pregnancies can have safe and healthy pregnancies and that issues concerning, for example, spontaneous miscarriages are addressed.  That is how the Committee on the Rights of the Child and many other human rights bodies have addressed the interests of prenatal life, not by calling for bans on abortion or protection of the unborn because we know that such measures do not reduce the number of abortions but only increase illegal abortions and force women to travel.  The WHO is very clear that criminalisation of abortion does not lead to a decrease in the number of abortions.  Ireland would be an exception among the world if its criminalisation of abortion did so.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by my officials, Mr. Brendan Eiffe and Ms Anne O&rsquo;Farrell.</p> <p>  The purpose of the motions is to seek Oireachtas approval for Ireland to opt into an EU regulation amending Regulation (EU) 2016/794, generally referred to as the Europol regulation, for the purposes of establishing a European travel information and authorisation system, ETIAS, for the Schengen area.  The regulation provides for the allocation of new functions to Europol in connection with ETIAS.  The legal basis of the measure is Article 88(2)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which empowers the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, by means of regulations to determine Europol&rsquo;s structure, operation, field of action and tasks.</p> <p>  It is useful to be absolutely clear that the regulation in question is binding on all participating EU member states with the exception of Ireland and the UK.  In the case of Ireland and the UK, the regulation falls under Protocol No. 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  The amending regulation, therefore, requires the approval of the Oireachtas under Article 29.4.7&deg; of the Constitution to opt into the measure.  The committee may wish to note that Ireland previously opted into the Europol regulation this new regulation amends.  The Europol regulation came into effect on 1 May 2017.  Had Ireland not opted into that regulation, it would have been required to leave the Europol system.</p> <p>  The Europol regulation defines Europol&rsquo;s role, enhances the supply of information by member states to it, reinforces the data protection regime applicable to Europol and improves its governance structures.  Before going into some detail about ETIAS, I want to emphasise that the system has no implications for Ireland.  Irish citizens will not be required to use it.  It will not affect Irish citizens travelling to the Schengen area or other EU citizens coming to Ireland.  ETIAS only impinges on this State because Ireland opted into the substantive Europol regulation and is a member of that organisation.  Accordingly, Ireland must be consulted on any changes which may occur from time to time to that regulation.</p> <p>  Following recent terrorist attacks and the migration crisis which has impacted on many regions of the world, including our own, strengthening the EU&rsquo;s external borders has been one of the measures targeted to ensure internal security and to preserve freedom of movement in the Schengen area.  Currently, nationals of around 60 countries worldwide do not need a visa to enter the EU.  However, there is currently a lack of information related to such third-country nationals arriving at Schengen external borders.  Numerous states in the Schengen area have witnessed significant movements of people arising from the migration crisis.  At the same time, there have been horrific terrorist atrocities in several major European cities.</p> <p>  I am by no means conflating these two issues.  It is notable that those responsible for terrorist attacks generally do not come from third countries.  However, I am drawing attention to the two issues to highlight the public safety concerns among citizens in the countries of mainland Europe whose borders are open.  They want to feel better protected by their governments and by the EU.  This regulation is part of a response to this.  Unlike the advance transfer of detailed information required for the visa application procedure of visa-obliged travellers, no such advance information is required about visa-exempt nationals arriving at Schengen external borders.  This means that border guards need to make a decision on allowing or refusing access to the Schengen area without prior knowledge of any security, migration or public health risks associated with persons not requiring a visa.  When the ETIAS commences, this category of traveller will have to apply for travel authorisation through the system prior to undertaking their journey.</p> <p>  All information gathered by the system will be done in full respect of fundamental rights and under data protection legislation.  The proposal follows similar models already existing in Canada, Australia and the USA, among others.  As the EU&rsquo;s law enforcement agency, Europol&rsquo;s mission is to support the member states in preventing and combatting all forms of serious international crime and terrorism.  Its role is to help achieve a safer Europe for the benefit of all EU citizens by supporting law enforcement authorities through the exchange and analysis of criminal intelligence.</p> <p>  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are seconded to Europol and are represented on its management board.  Europol also assists An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in operational matters when required.  Europol plays a key part in Europe&rsquo;s response to the current terrorism threat and has been central to several counter-terrorism initiatives in recent times.  Alongside the threat of terrorism, which can often have a transnational dimension, members will be fully aware that those who engage in serious and organised crime in this jurisdiction frequently operate on an international basis.  Our engagement in Europol is, therefore, of immense value in keeping our people safe and tackling serious crime.</p> <p>  While this particular regulation refers to the Schengen zone only, the reason it has come before the Houses is because of our engagement in Europol.  This regulation amends Articles 4 and 21 of the Europol regulation.  Article 4, which sets out the functions of Europol, is now amended to provide that Europol will be charged with the development and hosting of an ETIAS watch list, the provision of information related to terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences to this watch list, and the provision of opinions following consultation requests by the ETIAS national units.</p><p>Article 21 of the Europol regulation, which currently allows limited access by Eurojust and the European Anti- Fraud Office to Europol data on a "hit, no hit" basis, is amended to further permit access by the European Border and Coastguard Agency on the same basis.  The agency will only be permitted access to Europol data that is relevant to its mandate.  In addition, access will be restricted to seeking information relating to persons who are suspected of having committed, taken part in or been convicted of criminal offences for which Europol has competence or persons regarding whom there are factual indications or reasonable grounds to believe that they will commit criminal offences.  Any subsequent sharing of substantive information must be done in accordance with the Europol regulation and any conditions set by the provider of the information.  </p><p> The aim of ETIAS is to enhance security in the Schengen region with a view to ensuring the safety of individuals travelling through the area, many of whom are citizens of this State.  I think the members of the committee will agree that any enhancement of security in the Schengen area is likely to have a positive impact on the security of the EU generally.  </p><p> A decision by Ireland to opt into the measure would be seen as a demonstration of Ireland's continued commitment to the effective functioning of Europol and the wider security of the EU.  The regulation was drafted specifically to facilitate the opting in of Ireland and the UK . A decision not to opt in will not prevent the expansion of Europol's role where ETIAS is concerned but may result in a diminished role for Ireland within the Europol system.  This would not be desirable and indeed could be harmful to our capacities to keep our people safe and continue our role in combating organised crime.  </p><p> I believe it is essential that Ireland contributes to Europe's fight against organised crime and terrorism.  Playing a full and active part in Europol is a key part of this process.  Our participation in Europol is vital to our national interest and we look forward to continuing to playing an active role with the agency.  I hope, therefore, that the committee will support the motion to exercise Ireland's opt-in to this proposal having regard to the points I have raised or submitted here this morning.</p></speech>

I think we should consider it and refer it, as we are required to do.  I agree with the Minister that we should opt in.  The only question I have for him is whether the UK is opting in as well or whether the Brexit discussions have had any impact on regulations and directives such as this.</p></speech>

The briefing note says there is really no need for us to opt in and that we have nothing to lose by not opting in, with which I agree.  There has been no full comprehensive impact assessment of ETIAS and this is just another rush job.  There are potential implications regarding the right to privacy and the right to data protection.  Organisations like the European Agency for Fundamental Rights have huge concerns about this and that the materials will be used for racial profiling.  This seems to be what it is being set up for - let us be clear about it - and saying "ah sure look, no Irish people are going to be affected by that" is not a good enough reason for us to join up.  There are many dangers in terms of data protection against a backdrop of more global incidences of hacking.  At best, it is a massive waste of money and, at worst, it is an exercise in further surveillance and racial profiling and I do not think there is any benefit for us in joining.  I would be very reluctant to give it any approval.</p></speech>

We need to remember that when one strips out the rhetoric and the bits and bobs, what we are actually talking about is safety for European citizens, including Irish citizens.  The Schengen area is one of the great successes of the EU.  I know we are not a member of the Schengen area because of the historical arrangement we have with the UK and neither country opted into it, but this is just a commonsense approach that any area of a similar nature would like to see in place so I fully support it.</p></speech>

The Minister said that it has no implications for Ireland but I do not agree with that because, obviously, it is proposed to share Irish data with this organisation.  Regardless of whether this process will apply to Irish citizens, the data is Irish.  I would have similar concerns about privacy.  Our party has no objection in principle to the sharing of data but it should be data that Ireland decides to share in and of itself and free of compunction from European agencies.  Ireland should share data, as appropriate, but this organisation and proposal are potentially disproportionate.</p> <p>  The Minister's response to questions raised by Deputy O'Callaghan relating to Brexit was unclear and I would be quite nervous about that because if Britain decided not to proceed, it would mean that British nationals would presumably have to apply through the ETIAS system to travel to Ireland.  Could this be clarified?  There is cause for caution if it is unclear what Britain is doing about this regulation.</p></speech>

The concern that has most exercised members of the committee appears to be the implications or otherwise of the withdrawal of our nearest neighbour, the UK, from the EU.  It has always been the case that Ireland and the UK co-operate closely on immigration matters, particularly those relating to our common travel area.  This arrangement is unique in the EU and it is fair and reasonable to suggest that this will continue.  Indeed we will continue to strengthen our co-operation, notwithstanding the imminent withdrawal of the UK from the EU.  Hopefully, our common travel arrangements will be fully protected.  The indications from the negotiations to date are to that effect.  Both the Irish and UK Governments are on record as saying that our commitment to ensuring that there is no return to what has been called hard borders on the island on the Ireland continues.</p><p>There are excellent relations, which will continue at political and official level on enhancing the operation of the common travel area.  We are committed to this continuing.  The amended regulation will take effect from 2020.  At that stage we will have a clearer picture on the matter of the withdrawal of the UK from the Union.</p><p> In respect of the concerns of Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire on the matter of data, as this particular amendment has no implication for Ireland, our data protection or data retention regime will not change.  There is the European data protection supervisor, that being the competent authority, with which we have already agreed to engage in the matter of our engagement with Europol, and this will not change.  I will be happy to keep the committee further advised in the event of there being any issues of concern as raised by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.  The European travel information and authorisation system applies to non-visa required third-party states.  I do not see how there would be implications that might in any way cause a concern in respect of the privacy of personal data of any of our citizens, having regard to what is before us.</p></speech>

I do not wish to pre-empt what the sovereign Government of the UK will do, but it is likely it will make a decision on this shortly.  Regardless, I believe it is important we exercise our own sovereign decision on this issue, which is why I seek approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

We fully recognise that we need to change.  We need to change our culture.  We need to provide our people with better training, resources and systems.  We need to provide a better police service to the public.  We have commenced a major programme of reforms to deliver those changes and they are currently being accelerated.  In making those necessary changes, it is also vital that we continue to protect and support communities, and while we appreciate the scale of the problems we face, improvements have been made and we still enjoy the trust of the vast majority of the people. </p> <p>  Our public attitude survey shows that the number of victims of crime has fallen in the past year, victim satisfaction has improved, fear of crime is down, and satisfaction with the service we provide is up.  In addition, recent activity against organised crime has resulted in many lives being saved, major arrests being made, and large quantities of drugs and firearms taken off our streets.  These results are a tribute to the great work done by our people, Garda members, civilians and reserves, throughout the country every day.  </p> <p>  I will now address the reports by Assistant Garda Commissioner Michael O&rsquo;Sullivan into issues surrounding the fixed charge processing system, FCPS, and mandatory alcohol and intoxicant testing, MAT-MIT, checkpoints.  These reports found major failings in how we handled both issues over a significant period.  When the former Garda Commissioner was here with the committee in March, she apologised for those failures and I reiterate that apology.  The reports identified unacceptable failures in our systems, processes, internal oversight, supervision, and management.  As Assistant Garda Commissioner O&rsquo;Sullivan wrote, this reflects poorly on the professionalism of the organisation. </p> <p>  We fully acknowledge the damage this has done to public confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  All of us in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must now take responsibility to change our systems, practices, behaviours and culture so these issues cannot happen again and confidence is rebuilt.  It is a collective issue and can only be fixed from the top down and the bottom up. </p> <p>  In relation to the FCPS and people being incorrectly penalised, we are examining all fixed charge penalty notices issued since 2006.  We have completed 99% of that work.  We have written to 11,924 persons who we identified as people whose cases must be appealed.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is working with the Courts Service to ensure all wrongful convictions are appealed.</p> <p>  In July 2017, we brought 67 test appeal cases before the Dublin Circuit Court to be heard by the President of the Circuit Court.  All of the cases were successfully appealed and the Court Service is in the process of updating the records of those concerned and returning fines paid.  A further 3,800 are scheduled to be heard in Circuit Courts in December 2017.  All the recommendations in Assistant Garda Commissioner O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s report in relation to the FCPS are being implemented either internally or through an existing interdepartmental working group. </p> <p>  On the issue of MAT-MIT checkpoints, a number of measures have been taken to address the deficiencies highlighted.  A change to PULSE in August 2017 means that only essential data is now collected.  The Medical Bureau of Road Safety has commenced a tender process for new Dr&auml;ger devices which will improve recording and new and improved training methods are being developed.  We have also adopted a new approach to roads policing, including the introduction of a roads policing bureau, which will assist in this area by strengthening governance. </p> <p>  In addition, checkpoint incidents identified in Assistant Garda Commissioner O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s report that were associated with implausible breath test data have been referred to each of the regional assistant commissioners for further examination.  This process is being overseen by the assistant commissioner in charge of roads policing.  We are also awaiting the report by Crowe Horwath for the Policing Authority and should it identify any additional issues, they will be addressed. </p> <p>  The decision to remove a child from their parents or guardians under section 12 of the Child Care Act is never taken lightly by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Following recommendations contained in the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s report into the two incidents of the removal of Roma children from their families by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, known as the Logan report, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na engaged the services of Professor Geoffrey Shannon to conduct an independent audit of the exercise by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991.  Professor Shannon&rsquo;s comprehensive and detailed report was published on 29 May 2017.  All the findings were accepted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p>  While Professor Shannon&rsquo;s report highlights important issues in relation to training, PULSE data and inter-agency working that need to be addressed, most critically it did not find any abuse of section 12 by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, nor did it find any evidence of racial profiling.  As Professor Shannon wrote, &ldquo;the overwhelming finding in this audit is that Garda members commit great efforts to treating children sensitively and compassionately when a child has been removed under Section 12&rdquo;.    </p> <p>  Since the report&rsquo;s launch on 29 May 2017, we have begun to adopt the report&rsquo;s recommendations.  An implementation plan has been developed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure that all the recommendations are progressed.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to work closely with Professor Shannon to ensure implementation of his recommendations and we have already liaised with him on several occasions on this issue.  The newly established national child protection unit at the Garda national protective services bureau is leading out on progressing the recommendations.  Professor Shannon has also accepted our invitation to assist and participate in future child protection training for Garda members.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in co-operation with Tusla, is in the process of developing a model of inter-agency working which will meet the standards expressed in the report. </p> <p>  I want to give the committee my commitment as acting Garda Commissioner to ensuring the protection and support of communities while introducing the necessary changes to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I and my management team look forward to engaging with the committee in a constructive and positive manner on these and other issues with the joint focus of improving the service An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provides every day that protects and supports communities throughout the country.</p></speech>

I want to echo what Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in said in his opening remarks that it is important always to realise and remember that the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are out every day, often putting themselves at risk, to enforce the law, and keep us safe as a community and society.  In looking at what are major failings, and this committee will do so with the acting Garda Commissioner and his management team in some detail, it is important to keep in mind that it is the same garda&iacute; who have failed us who are putting their lives at risk and have reversed the situation in some of the main areas of crime, particularly in tackling the gangland scourge of recent years.</p> <p>  The heart of why the acting Garda Commissioner is before the committee, and why his predecessor was here, is that what happened is totally unacceptable.  The falsification of data by any organisation is wrong; the falsification of data by the State's custodians of law and order is therefore doubly wrong.  I appreciate the work done by the assistant Garda Commissioner in the investigation of this and some of the practices it has demonstrated, but I will focus on one particular aspect of this although not in a "gotcha" sense.  I recognise the comments by the chairperson of the Policing Authority.</p> <p>  The Garda report and the acting Garda Commissioner's comments referred to the falsification of data being so obvious that there will be further investigation into the actions conducted at a divisional level, but this poses a direct problem.  The members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, through their representatives, the Garda Representative Association, GRA, are effectively accusing the management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of having been responsible for causing this.  Ironically, because they did not state this at the beginning, they are saying that much of this increased falsification came about because of a culture or pressure to raise the figures.  How does Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in propose to deal with a situation whereby management is trying to investigate the matter and then engage in disciplinary measures arising from that, where those who maybe disciplined believe that the ones disciplining them are the ones responsible?</p><p>What actions does Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in propose to take if it does transpire to be the case - I want to be careful in how I phrase this - that, in the words of the Policing Authority's chairperson, there is an indication that, although it might not have been a direct instruction, there was an implied culture that this needed to be falsified by substantially more senior people with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na than the front-line garda&iacute; taking out the tests?</p><p> I cannot see how this process of investigating and drilling down the line will work.  I accept that rank and file garda&iacute; participated in this.  They had to, given that it happened across the country.  However, I am sorry to say that the real failure was a management one, and not just of an individual manager in an area.  It was a complete cultural and management failure to deliver a proper system.  That is what needs to be changed.  That is what Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, his team and the ongoing review of the Garda need to do.  If the GRA's accusation is correct, how does Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in propose to deal with the issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-04a.446" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017100400002#E00200"><p>I will start with the Deputy's last comment.  We have already taken action in respect of the GRA's comments.  We have asked Assistant Garda Commissioner O'Sullivan to seek any evidence, including names of people, so that we can establish an evidence trail, go to those people and get their versions of what is being put out there, that being, management was in some way putting pressure on front-line members.</p> <p>  The Deputy's opening comments were right - it is unacceptable.  However, a distinction is to be drawn with the MAT checkpoints, which are in statute with the purpose of giving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the means to play its part in reducing road deaths.  I would be surprised if any manager in charge of a district or division did not ask and direct everyone under his or her control to engage fully with that process in terms of the enforcement of the Road Traffic Acts.  That is the manager's duty.</p> <p>  Regarding the taking of breath samples where the falsification may have occurred, however, there is no evidence to suggest that anyone at management level asked people to falsify records.  Of course managers would have put pressure on their people to ensure that they maintained acceptable levels of enforcement across our lifesaver offences, which include drunk driving.</p> <p>  Assistant Garda Commissioner O'Sullivan has gone back out and addressed the issue raised by the GRA.  If the committee wishes, he can speak in more detail about his findings in that regard and whether there was pressure from management to falsify records, which is a different contention from the one that managers were just doing their duty and ensuring that the laws of the land were being enforced by the people who had been given the job to do so.</p> <p>  We play a significant part in the enforcement aspect of the three Es, which include enforcement and education.  We play a significant part in the education process as well.  The final E is engineering, in which we also have a part, in that we meet local authorities on a regular basis to ensure that, where we see blackspots emerging, we can let them know about the number of accidents happening there.  With all of that combined, there was a consistent reduction in the number of road deaths during the period covered by the report, that being, from 2006 onwards.  Assistant Garda Commissioner Finn can give the committee the relevant details.  It shows that all of the components together were having the right impact, namely, reducing the number of fatalities on our roads.  As a backdrop to that, however, and where there is supporting evidence of wrongdoing by any member at any rank, I fully accept that people have to be held accountable.</p></speech>

There is a problem with it.  He stated that management in the Garda, particularly at divisional level, was applying pressure to ensure that enforcement took place in the form of conducting the tests to deal with the scourge of drink driving.  One of two problems stems from that.  Either management accepted reports from subordinates that were blatantly false and had such a poor management structure in place that it could not pick up on just how false those reports were, or it turned a blind eye to how false they were or everyone was in agreement.  I acknowledge Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in's point that the figures were decreasing, but it is not credible that a senior management that knew what it was doing within a proper management structure - I keep referring to it as "management" rather than "Garda officers" or whatever - could believe that this level of activity was taking place when there could not have been enough hours in the day, cars on the road at certain places or drivers to stop.</p> <p>  It took months for this situation to come out, and then the Garda investigated and reverted to us.  Members of the Oireachtas and members of the public are being asked to believe one of two things.  Either management was so inept that it could not work within its own structures to figure out what was happening or garda&iacute; actively colluded together to do it.  Either scenario is an awful outcome.  It is difficult to believe that rank and file garda&iacute; continued doing this for so long and it was not picked up on without there being some type of a nod-and-a-wink culture or one that turned a blind eye.  Is Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in saying that did not happen?</p></speech>

If the Deputy does not mind, I will ask the assistant commissioner to outline what he found in that regard during his examination of the matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-04a.449" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael O'Sullivan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017100400002#E00500"><p>The report must be read in its entirety because a multiplicity of factors impacted on what occurred.  I agree that there was a poor management structure.  There is no doubt that it played a critical part.  I will focus on management structures for a moment.  There were divisions that did not have chief superintendents during the period due to the cutbacks.  There were divisions that did not have divisional traffic inspectors.  There were regions that did not have regional traffic superintendents.  The traffic bureau had no dedicated assistant commissioner from 2008 to 2017.  It had seven chief superintendents who stepped in and out alongside their various other functions.  There was no superintendent in charge of operations at the Garda national traffic bureau, GNTB, from 2008 to 2017.  Many of the issues in question were highlighted in previous reports by the inspectorate, including in 2008, but those reports were not implemented because of the period of austerity.</p> <p>  Management was one factor in this situation.  Education was another.  There was no training or continuing professional development, CPD, from 2008 onwards in the areas covered by these two reports.</p> <p>  As to the suggestion that there was no education or awareness, there was an awareness that MAT checkpoints were a critical point of the lifesaver strategy.</p><p>There was no awareness that the recording of breath tests was a measurable outcome.  We found that, across the ranks and associations and all the way up to the top, there was no awareness of the breath test tab on PULSE incidents, where breath tests were recorded.  Consequently, there was no supervision of the data, no measurement and no attention paid to them across the divisions.  It was not any part of any performance management, promotion or career advancement process.  It simply sat there until the issue arose.  I agree that this was poor management but that is the situation in which the organisation found itself at that particular time.</p></speech>

I always find that when organisations make mistakes, the mistake is made in a self-serving way.  I hope An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not go down this route.  I am sorry but the assistant commissioner's answer is unacceptable.  He started by saying that there was a cutback here and a cutback there and that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na did not have this.  He said garda&iacute; were not really aware of the number of breath tests being carried out or that they were part of something which they monitored.  If nobody was aware of any of that, it is very funny that, instead of not recording it or recording little or no information, everybody decided - very conveniently - to record massive increases in the numbers, which suited themselves and a narrative that flattered the activity level of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It was a very self-serving mistake, regardless of who was in place or the lack of management.  Mr. O'Sullivan said he was not aware that it was quantifiable but people did not simply record a zero entry while telling their boss they had been out doing the tests for an hour; they made up an enlarged figure that made everybody look good.  It only takes one or two managers in any place to have some integrity and, when they see something careering off the rails, to call a halt.  Unfortunately, in this area nobody did.</p></speech>

I welcome the acting Commissioner and congratulate him on his new position, which is probably the most difficult job in Ireland at present, whether acting or not.  I wish him well.  In his report, he mentioned that garda&iacute; and senior management had a responsibility to put An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na right and he is correct about that.  He is not alone, though, and the responsibility extends beyond An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the Government, Members of the Oireachtas and oversight bodies.  There needs to be recognition that he is not on his own in having to solve the problems.  Others, myself included, have responsibilities too.</p> <p>  I want to ask some questions of the assistant commissioner, Mr. O'Sullivan, but I first want to recognise another issue mentioned in the opening statement, which was the report of Dr. Shannon on the use by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of section 12 of the Child Care Act.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is subjected to a lot of criticism but that was not the case in Dr. Shannon's report and when the force does things well it deserves to be commended on it.  One of the most extraordinary powers this State has is the ability to take a child away from its parents and Dr. Shannon says that garda&iacute; performed that role admirably and with sensitivity.</p> <p>  Am I correct that the assistant commissioner's report cannot definitively conclude what the reason was for 1.4 million breath tests that were on the PULSE system but did not happen?  He comes up with a number of options which he thinks are likely explanations, one of which is the inflation of breath tests by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Part of Mr. O'Sullivan's explanation for why the figures are inflated is that, after a checkpoint incident, a garda phones up the Garda information centre and is asked how many cars they stopped in an evening.  They may reply that it was 20, 30 or 40.  Was there such a level of unscientific communication between garda&iacute; and the GISC at that time?</p></speech>

I highlight recording issues because there were two different interpretations of how the figures were to be recorded and two conflicting manuals in existence.  There was one at GISC and one with the operational garda&iacute;.  Among my recommendations is that, in future, there is joint training for GISC and the garda&iacute;.  On many occasions we heard both bodies disagreeing on what numbers should go into what boxes in PULSE incidents.  This resulted in significant data error and the figures were out of kilter by 6 million at one stage.</p></speech>

I do not know why we needed to count the number of cars.  They are not counted by the police services in Northern Ireland, Scotland, the United Kingdom or Canada.  I could not find a rationale for it and in fact, having done checkpoints in my time, I would find it extremely difficult to try to perform a checkpoint and at the same time count the cars passing behind me.</p></speech>

If I stopped a driver tonight to check his or her NCT disc and if the NCT disc is in order I tell the driver "Have a good night and good luck".  I do not record that check.

We no longer record all those data to which Mr. O'Sullivan has referred.  We record the basics such as the Dr&auml;ger device number, start number, finish number and the system automatically calculates the numbers.  The garda is asked back to verify if it was ten cars that were stopped for breath tests.  We have changed the system so we will not be recording all the multitude of data and the confusion as referred to in Michael O'Sullivan's report.  That has been put in place since 13 August.</p></speech>

What has An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na proposed?  Is it feasible to go back and start examining some 502,000 checkpoint incidents that took place over a period of eight years to see who did perform their functions accurately and who did not?  Is that feasible?</p></speech>

There is an additional piece of work he has directed local Garda chiefs to carry out on the data that apply to their areas.  We are also awaiting the publication of the Crowe Howarth piece of work.  We should wait to see the outcome of all of that before we decide our next steps.  As I have said, it is unacceptable that people would do what was proposed by the assistant commissioner in his report.  At whatever level to which this may be attributable, those people must be held to account.  That is on the basis of what we know to date but when we get the full information that is required, we can then move on to making decisions about what we will do next in the context of holding people to account.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-04a.475" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1255" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017100400002#G00900"><p>I thank the acting Garda Commissioner and his team for coming in to the committee and I wish him well in his new role.  I also acknowledge the work of Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan in what was a comprehensive report.  As Deputy Brophy has said, it is important that the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality recognises and acknowledges the great work done across all levels of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Reference was made to the public attitudes survey and it is mainly positive.  It is important that this is mentioned because it is difficult in a process of change when one has issues such as this to deal with.  I reiterate and echo the comments made by Dr. Geoffrey Shannon about the sensitive and compassionate use of section 12.  While changes can be made, one of my concerns when this committee engaged with Dr. Shannon was that sometimes, when there is an excessive analysis of this, there could be a reluctance to use section 12.  It is important that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to have confidence in using section 12.  It has been found that garda&iacute; have been using it appropriately.  Tusla also needs to address some of its issues in respect of not following through and giving feedback to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when they are dealing with particular matters.</p> <p>  I shall now turn to the breath test issue.  In his report, Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan referred to the over-ambitious scheduling of mandatory alcohol testing, MAT, checkpoints with local management as a factor in some Garda members inflating breath test figures.  Mr. O'Sullivan's report states, "This examination has found that by failing to review the capacity to carry out the number of ... checkpoints which were being set down for front line members, management were intentionally or inadvertently applying pressure and that this was a contributory cause which lead to the discrepancy between the PULSE and Dr&auml;ger breath test figures."  Does this give some weight to the Garda Representative Association, GRA, line that there was some element of pressure?  Why does Mr. O'Sullivan feel that management made over-ambitious scheduling of checkpoints?  Will Mr. O'Sullivan tell the committee what was the reason or rationale behind that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-04a.476" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael O'Sullivan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017100400002#G01000"><p>The rationale is included in the executive summary; while the outcome was undesirable the focus of management appears to have been the persistent detection of intoxicated drivers and the saving of lives.  There is no doubt in my mind that this was the focus of all the Garda divisions.  The focus was on the enforcement of drink-driving legislation and saving lives.  We know that this was achieved in many divisions across the country at the time.</p> <p>  I will wait for the Policing Authority independent report to come out, but there was a sense that if ten checkpoints were scheduled, five might be done.   If 20 were scheduled then there was a good chance that ten might be done.  I do not agree with this.  I believe we would have been far better off organising two checkpoints to be done and ensuring that the two were done.  It was a perception, certainly from the Garda members to whom I spoke and the GRA representatives, that they felt by having so many checkpoints scheduled, garda&iacute; felt under pressure to achieve the checkpoints and ensure they were done.  At this point I have no evidence of it but in some instances it may have resulted in numbers being entered on PULSE for breath tests that were not completed.  At all times, in everything I found, the genuine aim was to ensure that MAT checkpoints, which are legislated for, were scheduled - as the acting Garda Commissioner has said - to detect drink-driving and save lives on the roads.</p></speech>

This outlines that there was no process of data collection or recording.  How did the Road Safety Authority, RSA, then publish figures for breath-tested MATs for 2007 and 2008?  The RSA said there was 489,029 tests in 2007 and 563,115 tests in 2008.  What was the process of data collection for those MAT checkpoints if the report says that they were not being recorded?</p></speech>

We went back to establish if we could verify any of that information.  I do not have it right now.  I have checked in the bureau where I work and that information is there but it was based on manual records.  Back then we did not have the IT systems to support it and it was based on the reports we got in from the divisions around the country.  Subsequently, we brought in the electronic version to coincide with the 2010 Act where the mandatory alcohol testing checkpoints came in, which had to be prescribed by legislation.</p> <p>  By way of explanation there is a small bit of logic in why divisional officers schedule checkpoints.</p><p>One could not do a mandatory alcohol test unless it was scheduled.  The superintendent had to make out the schedule in advance.  If he or she said there would be just two for the night and the first was not completed for operational reasons, there would be other checkpoints to give the garda&iacute; some options.  Perhaps it was an over-ambitious scheduling, but those checkpoints had to be scheduled and authorised legally before they could be conducted.  That might go some way towards an explanation as to why we scheduled more than we did.</p></speech>

Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan mentioned that there was no performance management regarding mandatory alcohol testing checkpoints and that they were based on reducing road deaths.  This is mentioned in many of the Garda's policing plans.  In correspondence with the justice committee, Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan has said the results of breath-testing were not used as a performance indicator.  He has also said the results of road-testing were not used as a performance indicator.  Is it the case that neither was used as performance indicators?</p></speech>

Nobody knew they were recorded.  Very few people knew that one could access the tab on the PULSE database that would highlight the number of breath tests.  Through all the competitions for promotions in the period in question, in all the competency application forms and in every job description, nowhere was it ever mentioned that a certain number of breath tests is a requirement.</p></speech>

For example, in one policing plan the number of MAT checkpoints and the number of over-the-limit arrests made in Waterford in 2012 are outlined.  In Dublin metropolitan region, DMR, south in 2012, the number of persons breath-tested and the number of MAT checkpoints performed are outlined.  For Tipperary in 2012, the continued use of MAT checkpoints is referenced.  For DMR north central, the number of MAT checkpoints, the number of persons breathalysed at MAT checkpoints and the number of arrests as a result are outlined.  These data were detailed in the policing plans, and part of this is mentioned in the assistant commissioner's report.  The data are listed as actual performance indicators.  How are they incorporated in terms of performance management?  We have the correspondence stating there was no performance management regarding breath tests or MAT checkpoints but in most of the policing plans, there is mention of the number of MAT checkpoints and the number of breath tests performed.  It looks like a contradiction but perhaps the witnesses could clarify it.  There is a lead responsibility.  The policing plans mention chief superintendents and superintendents.  How are those performance indicators incorporated at that level?</p></speech>

The Policing Authority has been very much involved with us in this process since its formation but, as that cascades down to the regions and the divisions and into the districts, we must give a certain amount of latitude to the local management to interpret it in the context of the issues for them in their own respective areas.  We have just started to roll out a formal performance system within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Previously people were not individually measured, or could not be because the system was not there regarding any of these key performance indicators, KPIs, so it would be a matter for local management to decide what they felt were the issues for them in the context of achieving a national outcome, which was directed from the Commissioner's policing plan for a given period.</p></speech>

Does Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in think that performance management process and the KPIs that were detailed in all the policing plans had a contributory role in the inflation of breath test figures?</p></speech>

We have been working on the whole process of policing plans for some time and are trying to embed it.  It is another aspect of our culture and management to ensure that in everything we do, and we do an awful lot in different ways daily, we can capture what is happening.  A very good aid in that context was having a prepared policing plan ahead of time in order that one can see what the organisation needs to achieve and one knows, say, at superintendent level, no matter where they are in the country, that they can see at the end of the year how they contributed to the delivery of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's policing plan as an organisation in order that it is all aligned.  All relevant work that is happening must in some way be recorded in order that we can feed it all back into the centre and measure what has happened in the context of any given outcome we are hoping to achieve.</p></speech>

The review clarification resulted, I think, in the numbers being increased or, in some cases, decreased in about 0.4% of incidents.  That is a role of the review clarification, and there is a chapter in the report on the issue of the vehicles stopped and controlled.  I would not use the word "falsification"; I think it was poor training on the part of both the call-taker in the Garda Information Services Centre, GISC, and the garda&iacute; involved and neither understanding the other's position as to what was required in the various boxes.</p></speech>

I will speak from my experience of working in another area.  Regarding Dr. Geoffrey Shannon's report, I worked with a family who had a child about who they were very concerned and the way the Garda members treated the family was fantastic.  One garda in particular gave them unbelievably good support, more than Tusla, social services or any of the other organisations.  In my own experience in that area, they were absolutely fantastic.</p> <p>  I will not ask any questions about the breath-testing.</p><p>I feel like we have been here loads of time previously and I would like to move on from it.  I would like for it not to happen again and I would like to refer to Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in's comments about the culture within the Garda.  I imagine it is quite toxic and this is of concern.  He referred to the culture changing, better training, resources and systems and providing a better police service to the public.  How will all this happen?  It will be a huge undertaking.  What needs to be done?  What does he intend to do in this regard?  Could he give us an idea?  It would be great to apply the model the Garda uses for children in other areas.</p><p> I am specifically interested in the area of addiction.  I would like those in addiction to receive a little more empathy and compassion from garda&iacute;, as well as older people and victims of crime.  This should be examined because that is where we need garda&iacute; to be to the fore.  We need that feeling of security.  How does Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in think he can change the culture?  What does he need to do around it?</p></speech>

However, we will not be discouraged by that.  At a high level, strong leadership is needed at the start.  Leaders who are convinced of the path they must take are needed and then every member of staff in the organisation, including every garda, civilian and Garda reservist, needs to be on board with the support of their management to achieve what we all know is achievable but which will take some time.  It is not as if we have not started that work.  We have an ambitious programme of reform and renewal, which kicked off last year, because we got a commitment to investment and, as one of the Senator's colleagues said, external support is important for this.  We will not do this on our own.  We have a big part to play in it but we will need the continued support of all our oversight bodies to ensure we leverage and get the best bounce out of every penny invested in the organisation over the coming years with this ambitious programme of reform.</p> <p>  Some of the issues we have had to answer the committee on during our past few visits go back to bad systems and processes, which need to be updated.  I have been all over the country and visited staff at all ranks.  There is a huge level of goodwill among the public because of garda&iacute; going above and beyond the call of duty but we need to ensure the values they bring to the front line and the new code of ethics - it was one of the first jobs of the Policing Authority - are embedded in the coming months and are to the forefront of all our people's minds as they go about their duty.  That applies to everyone in the organisation.  There is a multiplicity of factors and it will not be easy but we have made some gains in that space.  There is a challenge for me, and for my management.  We have to ensure we get out to the people on the front line and ensure they are being supported but we need all of them to make sure we make progress in this area.  It is one of our top priorities that after all the small pieces of the mosaic are fitted together, our overall culture will be the overall winner from that in the context of doing our job in a much more transparent and better way where our ethics and values are easily seen by all concerned to be the backbone of what we do.</p></speech>

It is interesting that the Senator asked this question because we launch our internal culture audit today.  Everybody who works in the organisation will begin today to take part in a culture audit, which is being led by Mr. Singh who can outline the details.  We will identify what makes up the fabric of the organisation and what makes us think the way we think and act and behave in the way we do.  That has not been done previously.  This will be a benchmark, which will lead us to a detailed action plan as to how we can improve on the learning.  All these reports provide us with opportunities to learn and the culture audit will do that as well.</p> <p>  We as a senior management team will undergo training on the code of ethics next Tuesday.  We will provide strong leadership by acting on, and living up, to the nine pillars of the code ourselves.  We will lead that from the front and demonstrate that in everything we do, including every action we take and every decision we make.  From a cultural perspective and from an ethics perspective, we will provide that leadership from the front.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned victims.  We have a great deal of work done in this area and we will continue to improve that.  How we provide empathy to all victims is one area that has shown considerable improvement in our public attitudes survey.  We have victim services offices set up all around the country.  We have a protective services bureau to provide specific highly trained skills to the most vulnerable victims.  In the area of addiction, we have a great deal of work ongoing with other agencies, particularly in the various drug treatment centres in Dublin city centre as a key example.  There is a lot of work going on and all the piecing together will improve bit by bit, day by day, the service that we provide but there will always be room to improve.  This is a process and improvements will always be needed but these are simple examples from a cultural and ethical perspective, as well as from the perspective of victims, of the detail regarding the work we are doing.</p></speech>

In particular, I have witnessed at first hand the impact in my community and in my own locality that good community policing has made.  I am very much an advocate of this model and I am sure Assistant Commissioner Finn can attest to the good impact community policing has had in Cork.  Notwithstanding that, I echo Deputy Brophy's comments.  Many of these issues, some of which we have not touched on such as the financial issues in the Templemore training college, fixed charge penalty notices, and breath tests, are utterly unacceptable and are a poor reflection on the manner in which the organisation has conducted itself in recent years.</p> <p>  I will focus on the fixed charge penalty notice issue.  Since 2006, 146,865 summonses have been issued incorrectly to people who subsequently paid a fine, 14,700 of whom were convicted in court and paid a second fine.  I am aware a process has begun whereby the Garda is writing to all those affected explaining what happened and proposing how to reimburse fines and correct records.  The letters state if they consent, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will commence a process of appealing the fines on their behalf and so on.</p><p>What has been the take-up so far and what will be the cost of the process under way?</p></speech>

It is an ongoing process.  We initially wrote to almost 8,500 people.  We identified another 2,000 while the process was under way and I have written to them also.  I expect the number who wish to pursue an appeal to increase as people take stock of the letter we sent and receive advice from their solicitor on whether to pursue the matter.  As I said, 3,800 have indicated that they wish us to pursue it.  There are many people we have not managed to contact.  We initially wrote to them by registered post.  The letters have now been sent to local Garda stations for efforts to be made to contact them.  We have tracked down almost 1,500 people by chasing up the letters and going door to door to ask whether people have moved house and, if so, ascertain a subsequent address for them.  The process is by no means finished, but a tremendous amount of work has been done.  When I started this process in April, we went back to the very start and widened the scope in order that we would be guaranteed not to miss anything.  We examined every case where there was even a possibility of a person having received the wrong letter or having been prosecuted erroneously.  I think 99% of relevant cases have been identified.  It is a big process which is taking a considerable amount of our time and court time, but considerable progress is being made.</p></speech>

If we were reimbursing those that had been paid, it would be just short of &euro;1 million based on the 8,500 cases the Courts Service examined in approximately September.</p></speech>

I raised with the Policing Authority last week the fact that the <i>Irish Examiner</i>had reported that in several cases people had faced more serious consequences.  The case of a man in Cork who had been incarcerated on foot of a false prosecution, served time in prison and consequently emigrated was reported in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>on 20 September.  Another case it reported involved a person who had been arrested at her home in front of her neighbours and sent to Limerick Prison, which must have been very embarrassing for her.</p><p>The process of contacting people in relation to fines and so on involves a large category of people.  When I raised this issue with the Policing Authority, its chairperson, Ms Josephine Feehily, said it had put the broader question of impact beyond just a conviction on the Garda agenda as long ago as last March and pointed out that the Garda would need to think very seriously about the broader impact on those who might have lost their livelihood or licence and be prepared for actions that might be taken against it.  She would not be surprised if civil actions were to ensue in several cases.  However, she also stated she was not aware of a process having been begun by the Garda to deal with the matter.  There are very serious implications involving the loss of liberty or livelihood or damage to reputation.  Has a process to deal with that issue begun?  Has the Garda prepared for such possible actions and is it aware of how many people potentially faced imprisonment or other serious consequences as a result of the false prosecutions taken?</p></speech>

I do not want to comment on individual cases, but some of the media coverage is not 100% accurate.  No one went to prison as a direct result of a single FCN-type offence.  Anybody who was in court and subsequently ended up in prison was sent there for a multitude of issues, of which an FCN might have been one.  If a person had no insurance or committed another offence with an FCN-type offence, it could have been listed as part of a batch of court outcomes where he or she was sent to jail, but nobody was sent to jail solely for committing an FCN-type offence.  Any situation where a person convicted of an FCN-type offence ended up in jail was as a consequence of also being charged with a series of non-FCN-related offences.</p></speech>

The recommendations cross a wide range of areas and competencies and several relate to civilianisation.  How does the acting Garda Commissioner account for such a significant discrepancy between the Garda level of satisfaction with the implementation of the recommendations made and that of the Policing Authority because clearly where the Garda sets the bar for implementation and where the Policing Authority does are two different places.</p></speech>

That is only a segment of the much bigger programme of work being carried out.  I have mentioned the very ambitious programme of work that includes all recommendations made in all Garda Inspectorate and external reports which have been fed into our modernisation and renewal programme.  A civilian executive director was recently appointed to head an office charged with assisting us in tracking how we are doing on all of the recommendations made.  The Policing Authority decided the level of scrutiny it wished to apply.  We have been talking to it about that matter and will continue in that space.  In some cases there could be a difference in interpretation as to when something was completed.  Some of the initiatives are large and have many components.  It is unacceptable that the Policing Authority would be given wrong information and we want to ensure that is not the case.  It may be a question of interpretation as to when something was completed.  Is it when it is launched and put in place or when every single aspect of the detail is delivered on?</p><p>That could take a few years because some of these initiatives are very complex, they involve information and communication technology, ICT, and to bring in skilled resources from outside.  In order to get it up and running we had to use whatever resources we had until such time as we got the civilian skilled resource to take on some aspects of that role.  We are in conversation with the authority and I welcome that level of scrutiny because it is important that when we go to that forum we deliver an accurate picture of where our modernisation and renewal programme, MRP, is at any given time.  There is so much work going on in that area that it is important to have people internally who can track it for us and the external scrutiny that will call us to account for where we are at any given time.</p></speech>

The gap between nine and 50 is a large number of recommendations on which to differ.  The process of replacing the Garda Commissioner will be lengthy.  What does the acting Commissioner intend to do to ensure that the pace of reform while that is going on does not slow but continues?</p> <p>  Will the acting Commissioner clarify for the committee the exact process for the reopening of Garda stations?  At the Committee of Public Accounts last Thursday he said in reply to one question: "What the Government does is the Government's business.  All I can do is based on what went in and what came back.  There was a need to await the final report, I would say."  The acting Commissioner also said he did as the Government asked him to do.  </p> <p>  I had sight of a response to a parliamentary question from Deputy Farrell on the reopening of Rush Garda station which states: "...the Garda Commissioner is primarily responsible for the effective and efficient use of the resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I, as Minister, have no role in the matter."  It is important to clarify who exactly takes the final decision.  Is it the decision of the acting Commissioner alone on the back of recommendations to reopen Stepaside or any other Garda station?  What is the exact relationship between Government decisions and the acting Commissioner's role in decisions like that?</p></speech>

We have laid out certain milestones which we hope to achieve over the coming 12 months.  This is a five year programme which started last year.  We learn more as we move on and as the environment changes we may have to re-prioritise.  That is part and parcel of every major programme of reform.  We have to ensure that the critical enablers that will allow us deliver on the overall programme are put in place as soon as possible and that includes the civilianisation, the skilled resources coming into the organisation to allow Garda members work on the front line and to take on additional jobs to get us through this phase and to get our own people, who would be employees of this organisation to a level of skill such that they can, once our reforms have been delivered, deliver the ordinary continuing change scheme in a professional and efficient manner.  That is in addition to ensuring that we continue to provide the public with a quality service for its protection, and support communities.  That is our first objective.  That is the day job and we cannot take our eye off that.  We also have to ensure, however, as a second plank that we move on with our modernisation and renewal programme.</p> <p>  Assistant Commissioner John O'Driscoll, who is the author of the interim report, is here.  Last week at Committee of Public Accounts, I said that the programme for Government contained a commitment on the reopening of six Garda stations on a pilot basis.  That came to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It was then a matter for us, based on our knowledge and professional opinion, to decide where these things might happen, based on the high level criteria that came with the correspondence from the Department.  Assistant Commissioner O'Driscoll did that work and he can explain in detail how he approached coming to a conclusion on where those six stations might be.  That is a matter for me as acting Commissioner to recommend.  It is a matter for the Commissioner of the day to decide where those stations are and to recommend them to Government.  Assistant Commissioner O'Driscoll can give more detail on that.</p></speech>

It set down particular criteria: a rural and urban inclusion and premises that remain in State ownership.  The first task was to identify which stations remain in State ownership and that involved interaction with the Office of Public Works, OPW.  A significant number of stations had been sold and those remaining I examined in detail.  In the Dublin Metropolitan Region, DMR, there were only four available to consider.  That made the task in Dublin easier than elsewhere in the country.  The acting Commissioner, when he appeared before Committee of Public Accounts, stressed the importance of local involvement in this decision making and I engaged with the assistant commissioners in the regions seeking their input and asking them to engage with relevant stakeholders.</p> <p>  There is a situation in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na such that of the commissioners who were serving on the day I was promoted in May of last year only one remains.  All the others have been appointed since that date.  I engaged with particular assistant commissioners at an early stage but there was a change in management and in Cork every chief superintendent had changed.  I went back and sought an input from the new management team in the southern region and as recently as 19 September I received a response from that region which differs from responses I received earlier from a different management team.  The emphasis is on ensuring that there is a local input, that I am not the one who is choosing a station in Donegal or west Cork or wherever.</p> <p>  On the basis of the criteria given to us, it was obvious that Stepaside would be number one of the four.  I suggested that if there was to be a second one it would be Rush but there were criteria for circumstances where there would be two stations chosen in Dublin.  The second station cannot be considered as a definite decision until such time as the other stations around the country have been identified.  I expect that I will be able to conclude the work I am doing within the next two weeks.  I can say categorically that no person has come to me asking that a specific station be opened.  I have sight of all the parliamentary questions put by various public representatives about stations to be reopened.  I stated earlier that I believed I would have the report completed on an earlier date.  The then Minister for Justice and Equality in concluding the letter to the Commissioner asked to be kept informed of current developments and she and the current Minister for Justice and Equality have sought that information.</p><p>I have advised them that it has taken me longer than expected; that I have sought additional information from the various regions and all of that will be given in detail in the final report.</p><p> In the interim report I have stated that I believe caution should be exercised in terms of the use of crime statistics as a significant indicator of where a Garda station would be built or opened, because on that basis alone, one would open a station on one day and close it a month later and open up a different station in the following week.  There has been a greater emphasis on population.  I have also emphasised that there is a need to consider that in certain locations in this country at any particular time there is a temporary population, which far exceeds the population of an area, whether that be at Dublin Airport, which has 30 million people passing through it, or Dublin Port, or a college environment.  I have suggested other criteria that perhaps should be taken into consideration when reaching a conclusion.  In any event I will submit a final report to the acting Commissioner in the next two weeks, in which there will be recommendations in respect of six stations.  It will be a matter for the acting Commissioner to decide which stations will be opened and to inform the Minister of that decision and the timeline involved.  That will be determined following additional consultation with the OPW on the expense and level of work required in advance to bring a station into operation.</p></speech>

I do not blame members for raising issues, but I would prefer a scenario where time is put aside for members to ask questions on whatever they like.  As that is not the case, I have opted not to ask the questions in other areas.  Be that as it may, the information we received and the engagement has been extremely useful.  I have always contended that we should consider mobile Garda stations in areas such as seaside resorts.  For example some 1.5 million people visit the Cliffs of Moher every year and the Garda station in Lahinch was closed.  I think there is a very strong case for the Garda station in Lahinch to be opened for a number of months in the year, given the tragedies at the Cliffs of Moher and the numbers who visit the Wild Atlantic Way.  We may have that discussion on another day.</p> <p>  I welcome the acting Commissioner and I am delighted he has the opportunity to lead the force.  It is a great honour for him personally.  I have no doubt he will do an exceptionally good job.  I am sure he agrees with me that it is important that everybody acknowledges the great work that is being done by the 14,000 garda&iacute; on the ground.  While there are serious challenges, overall things are far better than they are in many other countries.  I am sure the acting Commissioner would also agree with me that it is important for all elements in the administration of justice to be on song, that includes the Oireachtas committees, the Policing Authority and the various organs.  That also includes the Garda Representative Association, GRA.  Would the acting Commissioner agree with me that the comments from the GRA did An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na a disservice?</p></speech>

In that context, I include all of our staff because our support staff, back at the ranch as it were, also play a vital role in all of that.</p> <p>  The GRA have a right to represent their members and I respect that.  As I said earlier the challenges we face as an organisation will not be solved by me or my management team alone, we will need lots of help, assistance and support right across the spectrum, including the associations, one of which is the GRA.  I look forward to working with them in moving our reform programme along and in increasing the pace of delivery and the efficient way we hope to deliver it.  All of the associations and unions across the board are critical stakeholders in how we do our business and I fully acknowledge that.</p></speech>

We have been in discussion with Dr. Geoffrey Shannon in recent weeks and have had numerous meetings with him.  We have agreed to implement all the recommendations with slight changes to some of them.</p><p>These changes were agreed in discussion with Dr. Shannon.  Most of the recommendations will take time to implement in full but many have already commenced.</p><p> One of the most important developments in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been the creation of the Garda National Protective Services Bureau.  Many of the issues relating to vulnerable victims, children in particular, have been brought into this unit and expertise has been developed within it.  The bureau also has a specific unit dealing with child protection issues called the national child protection unit.  This is distinct from the Garda national child protection unit because it has been agreed that there will be permanent Tusla involvement in the former.  Having the agencies working together is a key recommendation in the report.  </p></speech>

I know a number of the recommendations are for the medium term but my question was on recommendations that could have been implemented by now.  I assume from the assistant commissioner's answer that none of these has been implemented.  I will assist him on the issue.  Has the recommendation to issue a laminated card to all garda&iacute; been implemented?  Has the recommendation on the recording of information on the PULSE system, which Dr. Geoffrey Shannon designed, been implemented?  Has the recommendation on safety belts and car seats been implemented?  How many of these relatively simple measures have been implemented?</p></speech>

A recommendation was made that a particular amount of information would be provided on the card, which has developed into an accordion style document with considerably more information provided on it.  I understand the card is ready to roll.</p> <p>  We have engaged with our transport section and other expertise on the child seat issue.  It is complicated in so far as there is not a one-size-fits-all seat for children.  A whole series of seats would have to be available to a patrol car.  We have engaged with our transport section to find the best solution for this. </p></speech>

The assistant Commissioner's answer appears to be that none of the recommendations has been implemented yet, although the report was finalised in January and published in May.  While I appreciate the Garda is doing some work on the report, this gives a new definition to the acting Commissioner's words about accelerating the pace of reform, which remains slow.  As we do not have time to continue the discussion of this matter, I will move on to the fixed charge notice.</p></speech>

The whole reason for this was to ensure children taken into care would be conveyed in a safe manner to wherever they were being brought.  That is our absolute priority.  Children do not necessarily have to be brought in a patrol car.  We can arrange transport which has the required specification, for example, if more than one child is involved.  There are many combinations and permutations to this issue.  Our objective will be to ensure any child taken into care is conveyed in a safe manner to wherever he or she needs to go.</p></speech>

The point I am making is that the recommendation has not yet been implemented.  If this issue is as important as the acting Commissioner says it is - I agree that it is important - the recommendation should have been implemented by now.</p> <p>  On the fixed charge notice system, while I know the report on this matter is internal, this has been an unmitigated disaster.  Apart from the consequences the matter will have in terms of people's lives, it will cost the State a fortune in compensation and repaying money, not to speak of the hours garda&iacute; will spend correcting it.  The report basically states that the reason the problem arose was the failure to inform the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na information centre, GSIC, that from December 2014, a driver had a statutory right to be given the option to pay the fixed charge notice without a certificate.  There was, therefore, a breakdown in communications.  Who was responsible for this?</p> <p>  Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan pointed out that there was no training and no overall governance in place.  Who is taking responsibility for that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-04a.554" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael O'Sullivan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017100400002#N00700"><p>That is a very narrow view of a document of 85 pages.  Taking the whole system in its entirety, one should read the Garda Inspectorate's report of 2008, which focused on this area, and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission's report, which also focused on this area.  I stated in my report on the fixed charge notice system that the GSOC report "concentrated on the areas that were causing members of the public to make complaints, however in doing so, the report highlighted areas that would improve the overall operation of the system going forward".  The GSOC report highlighted that the system was not fit for purpose.</p></speech>

A subsequent report by the Garda Inspectorate also highlighted the deficiencies in the fixed charge notice system.  What occurred in the system was that rather than introducing a new system at the time, it was fixed piecemeal.  A gap would appear and be plugged, only for another gap to appear and be plugged.  The system was added to in a piecemeal fashion.  Our recommendation is to look again at the system in its entirety.  It is probable that if the recommendations had been taken on board at the time, these issues would not have arisen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-04a.559" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017100400002#N01200"><p>Is that not the point?  Two statutory bodies reported on this matter almost eight years ago.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission stated the system did not need to be confused as there were too many types of fixed notice charges.  In the intervening years, however, more charges were added to the system.  In 2014, at the height of the scandals into fixed charge notices when the public eye was focused on the issue, the Garda Inspectorate issued a report, yet the Garda is only now looking at it three years later.  Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan states in his report that, in his view, one of the reasons for the problems was the lack of senior staff at the Garda National Traffic Bureau during the period in question.  The GNTB did not have a designated assistant commissioner in this period during which seven different chief superintendents were assigned to it.  This returns us to the issue of responsibility.  Who is responsible for the turnover of management in this area and the failure to fulfil roles.  I ask the assistant commissioner to address the point that an assistant commissioner for organisational development and strategic planning was in place during that timeframe.  Assistant Commissioner Jack Nolan performed this role between 2012 and 2015.  The Garda Inspectorate report informs us that this role, which was filled, has corporate responsibility for GISC as well as information management and data quality issues.  While the GNTB may not have had an assistant commissioner, was it not Assistant Commissioner Nolan's job to oversee the data?</p></speech>

The ICT budget did not exist, hence we had to operate a system on a piecemeal basis which is what created many of these issues.  It does not matter who was watching.  These issues would still have arisen because in my view, and in the view of the other external agencies which examined the system, it needed to be rebuilt, not patched up.  I highlighted the changes in staff.</p> <p>  We should await the report of the Policing Authority which is due in the next week or two.  Part of its terms of reference are the role of behaviour on the various ranks during this period in relation to both reports.  The supervisory environment and the role played by the various supervisory ranks are also part of the terms of reference.  They also include a review and assessment of the process employed, the outcomes of each and the investigations carried out by me.  It would be very wise, in relation to those issues in particular, to await the independent examination which is due next week or the week after. </p></speech>

When I pointed out that there was an assistant commissioner in place who had this specific brief in his portfolio, the assistant Commissioner stated the situation was a little disjointed.  This links to the other point in his report that the PULSE bulletins issued to ordinary garda&iacute; contained extensive and confusing information.  Who designs these systems and who is responsible for them?  Where is the management oversight?  That is the question to which we keep returning.</p> <p>  I will now address mandatory alcohol testing, MAT, because I am conscious of time.</p><p>The first point in that regard is that there appears to be a writing out of the involvement of the Medical Bureau for Road Safety in this from the narrative.  While it is true that there was correspondence from the RSA in 2014 relating to the breath test issue, it took over a year for the Garda to begin an investigation into the matters.  Throughout that time the Garda was involved with the medical bureau, which is responsible for this equipment.  The bureau is not mentioned in the narrative or the report at all, yet the acting Garda Commissioner tells us today, as if it is a great step forward, that one of the solutions is that the medical bureau has commenced a tender process for the new Drager devices which will improve recording.</p><p> Is it not the case that this process started in summer 2015 and, following detailed consultation between the medical bureau and the Garda, the Garda requested some information that it now does not want in that process?  Even though the medical bureau was ready to go with new equipment over a year ago the Garda changed the specification, which will cost considerable amounts of money.  As Professor Denis Cusack said in information we got under freedom of information, it will put back the entire process of procurement, approval, testing and ultimately the supply of the new devices for between 18 and 24 months.  A process that management in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was involved in with the medical bureau to get new devices has been kicked to touch.  Despite the acting Garda Commissioner telling the committee in his introduction that a new system is coming forward as if that is great, he forgets that this was in train two years ago.</p></speech>

It is providing new equipment.  The Dragers we have are over ten years old.  A decade in the technology world means they are totally obsolete.  Undoubtedly, we must replace them.  The Medical Bureau for Road Safety supplies the equipment to us.  It owns them and we use them.  Certainly, what has happened in recent times has caused us to go back to the bureau and use the learning we have acquired from that because we do not want it to happen again.  We have asked the Medical Bureau for Road Safety to change the specifications in some regards so we can prevent what we are dealing with today from recurring.  I was not aware that it will set it back two years.  That is not my understanding of the current position.  The devices have gone out to tender and that tender process is being re-examined.  I am not aware that it will kick it back two years-----</p></speech>

I am relaying my experience in the context of recent meetings I had with the bureau on the procurement process.

That will prevent a recurrence of the difficulties which brought us to the current position.</p></speech>

It could do the tallies on the devices.  There was all the searching around for information on the number of breath tests but the number was actually known if somebody had picked up the telephone and asked the bureau for the tally.  There does-----</p></speech>

However, it does not see itself as a custodian of Garda breath test devices.  It would be adamant in saying, and we would acknowledge, that it is not its responsibility to count how many breath tests we carry out.  That is within our remit and we have changed our IT system to ensure we can be the masters of that, rather than having to go to the Medical Bureau for Road Safety.  The bureau would not see that as its remit.</p></speech>

However, is it not the point that all of these issues come back to a cataclysmic failure of management to oversee any of these processes or systems?  There appears to be a lack of awareness of why they are there.  Take the example of the MAT test.  The report basically states, "we did the internal investigation, we are not really sure what has gone on here but there is a number of reasons that we think it might be so".  One of the issues is that there was no awareness of why this information was being recorded.  I agree that this is a credible answer.  However, who designed that system?  In every other checkpoint operated by the Garda ordinary rank and file garda&iacute; are asked to record where an offence occurs.  They do not record the motorists who have motor tax, just the ones who do not.  What genius came up with the idea that the garda&iacute; would record the cars that went through anyway?  I agree with the witness.  Why would a garda have a problem with ringing up the information centre and saying it could have been 30 or 40?  No crime was being carried out so why would the Garda see that as falsified information?  I do not.</p> <p>  Is it not the case that the issue here is not breath tests at all, but checkpoints?  Deputy Brophy pointed out earlier that a garda would go out on duty and when he came back he would make up the figure when he rang the information centre, because he did not really know what the information was for.  How does the Garda know that he did go out and come back?  How does the Garda know the checkpoint was conducted?  Is it not the case that senior officers were mandated to put up a checkpoint on PULSE?  It had to be put up on the system.  If that was not carried out afterwards, it was supposed to be invalidated.  Certainly, from our experience of talking to garda&iacute;, that often did not happen.  Management should have known.  It would have known.  If the two of us were on duty in the station that night and we got a section 12 warrant and had to drive off with a child, we could not physically have been on that checkpoint that the superintendent told us to conduct.  We simply did not have the manpower resources.  How do the witnesses know that those checkpoints were cancelled?  Based on the reports, there was a pressure to carry out checkpoints.  Can the witnesses credibly tell us that all the checkpoints that are on the system were invalidated if they were not carried out?  Certainly, from our dialogue with rank and file garda&iacute; that was the unspoken pressure.  Nobody wanted to say that the checkpoints were not being carried out.  Is that not really the issue?  It is not about breath tests at all.  Will the acting Garda Commissioner respond to that?</p></speech>

For example, if one were to state that one stopped five cars at a given checkpoint, that might be the absolute truth but they are not the only five cars that passed through because if they were one could be questioned on the random element of how one selected people to be stopped.  That might have been part of the reason that this piece of information was recorded, to show that more cars went through than were stopped for the purpose of breathalysing.  That is-----</p></speech>

The report says that it was paradoxical that the amount of breath tests dropped but the number of checkpoints went up.  The report states this is surprising, but it is not surprising at all if checkpoints were not being carried out.  My contention is that they were not being done.</p></speech>

One of the four, five or six items the assistant commissioner said had some input here was supervision.  Supervision was key.  Supervision is the only way one will know whether what one directs as a manager is carried out.  During those years, a period of austerity when there was a moratorium on recruitment and promotions, there were huge gaps in our supervisory levels and capacity to go out and check.</p></speech>

Regardless of who is in the station, if I have authorised a checkpoint and when I arrive at the station in the morning I find that two fellows were arrested or whatever and there was chaos in the station, it does not take a genius to work out whether the lads could have been out on the road carrying out a checkpoint if they were driving a child to a different county or if they were processing ten people for arrest.  Where is the data on that?  That is far more serious because these are mandatory checkpoints.  My understanding of what has happened here is that this is a far bigger scandal.  This is a problem with checkpoints, not breath tests.</p></speech>

On our site visits to the Police Service of Northern Ireland, Police Scotland, Essex Police and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, we asked them all the same question as to how they ensure the checkpoints are done.  The answer is supervision.  It is glaringly apparent to me and from the report that supervision was absent across all the divisions in respect of MAT/MIT checkpoints.  How do we know they were done?  We would have to go back to Deputy O'Callaghan's question.  Do we look at 502 checkpoints, go through them and listen to the recordings of the phone calls?  That would take 21 years.  The answer is supervision.  There must be adequate supervision and sergeants available at front-line level in the traffic corps and in districts, stations and divisions to supervise the checkpoints.  That is how it is done in other jurisdictions.</p></speech>

I am not blaming individual garda&iacute; for this.  The only way it adds up is that there was pressure, once a checkpoint went up on the system, to say that it had been done regardless of whether it had or not.  That is the only thing that makes sense.</p> <p>  In that context, the witness has said there was a problem with supervision.  Is it now his contention that senior management have lost all authority among the membership?  It was striking that only seven people answered Mr. O'Sullivan's survey on this issue.  By contrast, Geoffrey Shannon had 100% compliance.  Is Mr. O'Sullivan saying they have lost the trust of the membership?  In the context of his claim that this was a supervision problem, why in God's name would he now target individual garda&iacute; and accuse them of inflating breath tests when he accepts that they did not know what the information was for and had no credible idea that it could be involved in any wrongdoing because they were not reporting any crimes?  Surely continuing with that line is incredibly unhelpful and demoralising for ordinary garda&iacute;.</p></speech>

The mandatory aspect was that it was mandatory for the person who was stopped to give the sample.  That is where the word "mandatory" came from.  There was not pressure on people to write down that all those checkpoints had been completed.  In fact, over 40% of the checkpoints on our system are invalidated because they did not happen.  That system was there.  If a checkpoint was not done because a garda was on some other duty, such as escorting a child to safety, it was necessary to mark the checkpoint as being completed.</p></speech>

A checkpoint must go up on the system to be authorised initially.  If it is not carried out, the manual says that if the checkpoint is not done, it must be invalidated later.  I know that.  What evidence does the Garda have that all checkpoints that were not completed were invalidated?  Based on the information they have given me, the witnesses cannot say with certainty that all checkpoints that were not invalidated took place.</p></speech>

If I said I was on a checkpoint and I rang in and gave the GPS co-ordinates of the site - everybody knows the co-ordinates going out on these things - and I said, "I was out here, we stopped six cars, there was no issue", where are the checks to say that I was actually there?</p></speech>

I grew up in an area where people respected the Garda, and I believe that over the last number of years the respect has decreased.   My respect for the Garda has not decreased, but from listening to many people in my constituency I believe it has gone down generally.  The damage has been done over the last number of years, and the final straw was when the fixed penalty and breath test scandals came to light.  They were very badly handled, and it is very important that it does not happen again.  We need better policing, we need changes, and we need to get the public trust and respect for the Garda back.</p> <p>  Acting Garda Commissioner &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in stated that it is very important that this new regime starts from the top down and the bottom up.  I agree with that.  Too many people are blaming each other, and this has to stop.  We need a Commissioner who will lead from the front, will have the trust and respect of the public, and do the job.  I am a firm believer in getting it right first time.  In the last number of years we have had two or three Commissioners who did not get it right first time.  It is very important that acting Garda Commissioner &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in gets the support and the resources that he needs to do his job, and I believe that he should start with a clean slate.  It is fine for him to appear before various Oireachtas committees and different organisations and be constantly battered over what happened in the past.  What happened in the past was wrong, and I know that the acting Commissioner will put a team together to sort out what happened in the past.  It is very important going forward, and to be fair to acting Garda Commissioner &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in we have to give him a clean slate going forward.</p> <p>  It has been stated that crime is down and that drugs have been taken off the streets.  That is a good start.  I come from Dundalk in County Louth.  It has had its problems over the last number of years, and as a public representative I have a very good relationship with Superintendent Gerard Curley, who has done a fantastic job there.  I can only speak from my own experience.  I see many more garda on foot patrol, more checkpoints, and more involvement in the local community.  That means a lot to me.  </p> <p>  The reopening of Templemore has been a big plus.  We are getting more professional garda&iacute; on the beat.  There has been a big issue with garda&iacute; retiring, so it is good to balance the books.  We have to do something to increase the number of garda&iacute; in the force.  Too many garda&iacute; are doing clerical work at the moment, sitting behind desks.  We should increase the number of civilians working for the Garda.</p> <p>  As a former businessman, I would like to know what acting Garda Commissioner &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in's plan is going forward.  Is he only filling the role on a temporary basis or does he actually want to be the Garda Commissioner?  Is he here for the next six, 12 or 18 months to fill the position or is he here to do the best job he can and put his name forward as the next Garda Commissioner?</p></speech>

We have to return to the fact that we serve the community, in whatever capacity we hold in this organisation, whether garda, civilian or reserve.  That is our focus at all times, and that will be my focus.  Any damage to that relationship is a red flag for the organisation.  We have to give it absolute priority, because our success as a police service since the foundation of this State has been built on our relationship with the communities and the fact they have been happy to support us in doing what is an evolving and very complex job.  To the person on the front line, dealing with a local community, the work of a garda may seem very simple.  That is how it should be.  We should be present in the community, be seen, and provide support and visible reassurance to members of the public.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked me what my vision was and where I want it to go.  I want to ensure that for the time that I am leading this organisation that we do not - regardless of what changes might come about - lose that valuable tie that we always had with the community.  That is where our focus will be, through our community policing initiative, and that is a main plank of what we hope to achieve over the coming years.  The name "community policing" might indicate that this is some new initiative that has been taken off a shelf or out of a textbook.  It is not.  This is what we always did.  It is our default position.  We may have to vary or modify it depending on where we are, depending on whether it is an urban or rural situation, but we have to maintain our focus in that community way.  My vision for the organisation is to ensure that with all the change that is about to happen, and is in fact already happening, that we do not lose that.  It is the family silver, as it were, and is something that we cannot afford to lose.  We are the envy of many other police services worldwide, which see the manner in which we can go to our communities for that support when we need it.  I have served in every province of this country, in different capacities and different ranks, and the common thread that runs through all our work is that we have that good relationship.</p><p>At times it dips, of course.  There is much negativity at the moment because of all the issues that have arisen.  That has to have an impact on public confidence.  I accept that but we depend on the individual garda&iacute; at local level to ensure that local confidence is there.  If we combine all that local confidence together then nationally, the public will have confidence in the police service.  We have much to learn and we have lots to do to bolster that confidence but that is what I am setting out to do at the moment.  I made clear at the outset, on my appointment as acting Garda Commissioner, what my priorities were and they go back to my first point about community.  That is where we are - the delivery of a day-to-day service for the people of this country, supporting them and keeping them safe.  Parallel to that, we are moving on as quickly and efficiently as we can, in the context of all the help we will require, including from this committee, to ensure that we get the delivery of cultural change, investment, increased civilianisation and the return of garda&iacute; to the front line who had to come off it to do critical administrative work.  That work is needed in order to ensure that we are accountable but it does not necessarily require those with Garda powers to carry it out.  We are very ambitious in that context and thank the Government for its commitment to an increase in our civilian capacity which will be doubled over the coming years.  We have a very ambitious programme at the moment which is moving on under our chief administrative officer, who will ensure that we get delivery of those people in the fastest possible manner so that we can release garda&iacute; to the front line.  Getting people in from the college and releasing people from desk duty will increase our visibility on the front line.  A lot is happening.</p><p> That is my vision for the organisation while I am in charge over the coming months until such time as a replacement is found.

I also believe that he deserves a clean slate.  Is he ambitious enough, though?  I am a business person and I grew my business because I was ambitious.  Is Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in here for the short term or the long term?  There is nothing wrong with stating that he is ambitious and wants to carry on.  I am sure there are others in the force who would love to have the opportunity to be acting Garda Commissioner but he has the opportunity at the moment.  He is holding the ace.  It is very important for the public to realise that we now have a very ambitious acting Garda Commissioner.  I would like to see Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in here for the long haul because switching and swapping is not good.  As I said earlier, we need to get it right first time.</p> <p>  This is my first time at this committee and perhaps I am making a statement that is too strong.  I do not know Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in very well but I have read about him and have spoken to colleagues about him.  I believe he is in a strong position at the moment.  People have suggested that we should go outside the organisation to find a new Garda Commissioner but I firmly believe that the person who is doing the job, who wants to do it, who understands it and who wants to get the job done is the person who should get the job.  I would not be embarrassed if I were Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in because he has the qualifications and he is entitled to seek the role.  Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in should let people know that he is not in here doing a temporary job but that he wants the job permanently.  He should be given an opportunity to do his job.  The previous Garda Commissioner maintained that she did not get the opportunity to do the job that she was asked to do.  I urge Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in to put his stamp down and not to be afraid to tell people what he wants to do.  He has a job to do at the moment and the people of Ireland deserve to have the right person in that job.  They have a right to feel secure in their homes.  They have the right to feel safe.  It is about time that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na stops getting kicked down the road and stands up for itself.</p></speech>

I would like to start with a question for the Assistant Commissioner Mr. Michael O'Sullivan.  My question relates to the breath test report.  Will Mr. O'Sullivan explain why some submissions from the AGSI and a rank and file garda were dismissed?  In that context, I wish to quote directly from the report, as follows:</p><blockquote>It was believed that managers used increased enforcement levels at a time of reducing resources to improve their promotion profile.  To satisfy Garda management  demands and avoid conflict members reported they felt pressured to inflate numbers.</blockquote> <p>On page 63 of the report we find the following: </p><blockquote>This Garda member also disclosed that there was competition amongst various Garda members that led to generous estimating of the breath tests conducted at checkpoints.</blockquote> <p>These quotes seem to be at odds with the conclusion in the executive summary on page 4, which reads:</p><blockquote>The examination team found no evidence of any tangible benefit which would have acted as a catalyst to encourage Garda members to inflate breath test figures.  There was no career advancement or other obvious rewards to be gained from engaging in this practice. </blockquote> <p>I ask Mr. O'Sullivan to explain why the submissions were dismissed.</p></speech>

My next question is for the acting Garda Commissioner.  I get the impression that there is a deliberate attempt in the report to remove any possible motive for falsifying breath test figures in the hope that people will then not believe that anyone in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could have falsified data relating to the number of breath tests carried out or may even have been expressly or implicitly directed or pressured to do so by their superiors.  It is difficult to accept that such a widespread practice, ongoing for so many years, was not known to senior management.  Action should have been taken in these circumstances, even if we are to reject the evidence in the quotes to which I referred, and accept that there was no express or implicit direction to falsify breath tests.  What does the witness have to say about that?</p></speech>

The only findings I have at the moment are the result of Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan's piece of work.  There is continuous work happening arising out of that report.  There will be another report which, hopefully, will give us some indication as to where the actual issues were and what caused them.  From the outset, on any of these issues, my focus would be on how it happened, why it happened and how we ensure that it does not happen again.  In terms of the last piece, we have to start that work the moment we are aware of the problem.  It is a hugely complex area because of the numbers involved and because it involves the whole country.  While Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan's piece of work is very detailed.  What he is saying essentially is that he has found nothing to corroborate certain aspects but if such evidence comes forward then, as I said earlier, where we have evidence of wrongdoing of any description by whatever rank in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, those responsible will be held accountable.</p></speech>

Why is it that carelessness and estimation always seem to be in an upward direction?  Surely an honest estimate would be too low as many times as it would be too high.  The elephant in the room - the report goes out of its way to avoid pointing it out - is that many garda&iacute; must have acted dishonestly and fraudulently when they provided false breath test figures and that many of their superiors encouraged this to improve their own promotion profile.  Does Mr. O'Sullivan agree that what is really meant when the report refers to inflation or the Garda Representatives Association refers to "elevation" of the figures is a dishonest falsification of crime data?  Is that not true?</p></speech>

There was no career advancement or other obvious reward from engaging in the practice.  Estimation happened in the call taking and interactions between garda&iacute;.  We are not talking about estimation at an upper level.  On the reference to estimation, we know from the recording that there were checkpoints days later.  There were no notes and estimation was used rather than accurate figures.  That is my assumption.  In the report I referred to it as not being deliberate inflation.  We have separated it and put it as estimation.</p></speech>

The former Garda Commissioner concluded her appearance before the committee on 30 March with the following comment, "I will conclude by giving the committee an assurance, as I did at the end of my opening statement, that we will identify those who are responsible and accountable for this and we will hold them to account."  How many disciplinary actions are taking place arising from the two reports and at what rank are the subjects of the proceedings?</p> <p>  It is stated on page 101 of the breath test report: "It is the responsibility of the regional commissioners and divisional officers to have each incident identified fully investigated from a disciplinary perspective if it meets the required threshold".  Given the massive disparity and exaggeration of breath tests between the different divisions - we can compare the figures of 385% in Tipperary and 18% in Wexford - does Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in believe it is appropriate for some of the divisional managers who may have been complicit in the falsification to decide who is now disciplined?  Surely the matter would more properly be handled by Garda headquarters in referring it directly to an independent body such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.  It may also be that Garda headquarters should have referred the action or inaction of the regional commissioners or divisional officers to GSOC.  What does the acting Commissioner think?</p></speech>

The process continues with the data sets put together by Mr. O'Sullivan during his research which has been given to regional commissioners under the stewardship of the national roads policing bureau to ensure consistency across the board.  It is to establish in more detail what the issues look like.  When we get it back, we can move the process further.  We need to get the feedback first to establish exactly what the matters might look like and how we might proceed.  There are large numbers involved and all ranks may be affected, as the Deputy notes.  I agree with the statement of the former Garda Commissioner that where people are found to have done something wrong, they will be held to account, regardless of rank.</p></speech>

We have sent the data back to those responsible in the regions to examine them as they are best placed to examine it.  There may be geographical factors, for example.  We have not asked for any disciplinary investigation to be carried out, but that process is ongoing.</p> <p>  In parallel, the Policing Authority which has been referred to by the acting Garda Commissioner is finishing its independent examination.  Part of that investigation is to consider the role and behaviour of the various ranks during all of this, the supervisory element and the role played by various supervisory ranks throughout the process.  Of course, we must wait until that independent report is published to decide how we move forward.</p></speech>

It was in early 2014 and raised a number of issues, primarily about checkpoints, not specifically breath test data.  It raised issues in a specific part of the country, on which a report was submitted and some further inquiries were carried out.  Later, coming towards the end of the year, we began to do some further work, initiated by my office in the Garda national traffic bureau.  My recollection is that in March 2015 we began to look at all areas, taking in checkpoints and the equipment used.</p><p>The inquiry and the investigation was an initiative by my office in around March 2015.  I am going from memory on some of those dates but that is my understanding and my recollection.  That subsequently led to a more detailed investigation into the breath tests and that is the reason.  That is where it started and how it started.  It evolved from that period.  It began in January 2014 following receipt of correspondence relating to a number of issues in a particular region in the country.  Inquiries were carried out into that.  Following receipt of that, there was some further work done.  Coming towards the end of 2015, we received a final report on that.  We then continued to carry out further inquiries and discussions.  Sometime around early 2015, and I think the date was March 2015, we began to look at the mandatory alcohol testing, MAT, checkpoints, breath tests and the use of equipment.  We did a broader analysis and examination in this entire area and then, as these issues arose, the breath test issue came into focus.</p></speech>

The figures and the data are collated at district, divisional and regional level.  There are various supports relating to that.  In the initial query that went out in 2014 on that specific issue, that was certainly one of the issues.  I know that at different times, queries and questions were asked about this.  We did answer the question that came out in early 2014, and then in early 2015 we asked for the detailed examination which, for a number of other reasons, eventually ended up in the information we have with us here today.  That is how this situation and these circumstances evolved.</p></speech>

The report states there was an 18% disparity in Wexford and it was 385% in Tipperary.  Given the deputy commissioner's position, did he not see fit to query each difference with each superintendent, the one in Wexford and the one in Tipperary, to see how in God's name people in effect lived on two different planets?

The information and results that have come out were as a consequence of the work that I started and that was started in my office.  At the start of that, we did not know what the conclusion would be, so there was a 12-month difference.  We unearthed the information following the work that we did.</p></speech>

That is not what I am at.  There was information.  There were statistics that were available at a regional level.  The discrepancy only became evident as a consequence of the comparative work that was done with the Medical Bureau of Road Safety and with PULSE.  That kind of comparison is not done daily.  We have a set of stand-alone statistics.  It was only as a consequence of the work we did that we were able to draw the conclusions we have drawn here today.  We had individual sets of data.

If we look at this in its broadest context, the primary focus of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is to make our roads a safer place.  We do that in a number of ways.  Primarily we do it through the enforcement of the Road Traffic Act.  We also do it through education.  We avail of the opportunity of press releases to inform the public of not only the role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but everybody's role to be responsible and that working in partnership we can make the roads a safer place.</p> <p>  We have achieved that objective and there has been a considerable improvement in road safety and a considerable reduction in the number of people who have lost their lives.  We need to remember the core and key objective we were trying to achieve.  In the mid-2000s and going back way beyond that, the number of people killed and seriously injured on our roads was much higher than it is at present.  The record of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the other agencies working in this area is to be commended in many respects.  From that perspective the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been well done.  As was mentioned earlier by some of the other Deputies, we have had a considerable reduction in the number of people killed on our roads.  As we sit here today, there has been a reduction in 2017 over 2016.  That is a key core objective.</p> <p>  We continue to focus on the enforcement of the Road Traffic Act on the key offences to save lives.  That is only part of the role.  The work that has been done has been very good and we will continue to do this.  I accept we have made mistakes along the way and that we will find areas to improve.  We will continue to do that next year, the year after and every other year.  The key objective of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was to reduce the number of road deaths and serious injuries and I think we have achieved that.</p></speech>

We had a previous question about behaviours.  They are also being addressed through the culture audit and the code of ethics.  It has also identified an IT fix.  They have been and will continue to be introduced.  It has identified a multiplicity of factors which have contributed to the issue.  Each of those has been dealt with.  We are in the process of doing further examinations, as the assistant commissioner, Mr. O'Sullivan, has said.  We are also awaiting a report from Crowe Horwath and that will also influence the next steps.  Nothing is completed.  However, I have outlined action taken in six different areas.

Three of the four were clustered close together, including Kill of the Grange, Dalkey and Stepaside.  Considering the population around those three stations, it is clear to me that Stepaside was the one.  Further, one station had to be bigger than the other chosen.  I was aware and had discussions with people who served previously in that area.  I knew there had been discussions about the viability of Dalkey in advance of the decision to close it.  Considering all the information, Stepaside came at the top of those three.  Stepaside was the biggest of the four stations and the criteria given were that the next had to be a smaller station.  I would not advise that the next station, being smaller, would be one of the other two in close proximity, which left no option other than Rush, on the proviso that there did not necessarily have to be a second station in Dublin based on the criteria.  It was just that if there was a second station, it had to be smaller.  Rush had the population advantage where criteria to justify it being open were concerned.</p></speech>

However, I have a cautionary paragraph that when I initially looked at Stepaside, crime figures were going up.  When I returned to it and analysts provided me with information, I could see the crime figures going down.  As the acting Garda Commissioner said, it was critically important that we took on board the views of local management.  The local divisional officer, the chief superintendent, recommended to me to choose Stepaside station.  The then newly appointed assistant commissioner in Dublin, Pat Leahy, examined the recommendation from his divisional officer.  The divisional officer made a recommendation which was examined by his regional assistant commissioner and accepted by him.  I then added to it the information received from analysts and I, being the person ultimately to make the recommendation to the Commissioner, also agreed with the recommendation.</p></speech>

It has been framed by Government.  It is comparable to a primary school teacher asking what two plus two is and expecting a student provide an answer of four.  As the witnesses have mentioned, the Government gave them the criteria.  Are they comfortable with the Government dictating criteria about policing issues?  On the independent authorisation as a police force, should it not be for the witnesses to decide what stations they feel are appropriate with their own criteria?  Would Mr. O'Driscoll have been more comfortable, as an assistant commissioner, in dictating the criteria to Government and letting that inform the process of which station should be reopened, rather than garda&iacute; being told what to do?  I gave the primary school example to demonstrate how Garda management has been really framed with this.  I have great pity for members of the force that were before the Committee of Public Accounts last week.  In my view, they have been framed and thrown under a bus by Government with regard to this issue.  The Minister and Department officials should set the criteria to provide answers for this.</p> <p>  As a senior member of the force, would Mr. O'Driscoll prefer to set the criteria and dictate, in his independent management position, what he feels is the appropriate set of criteria as an experienced member of the force, rather than being told what they are?  That cycle and joining of the dots obviously came to the answer of Stepaside.  The witnesses are really just providing legitimacy and cover for Government, which is wrong, in my view.  I am not blaming the witnesses and they are obviously in a compromised position because they cannot comment on Government matters.  If this process was commenced again, would the witnesses prefer to have the discretion to set their own criteria?  They mentioned ports, airports and colleges, but they are not prioritised now because of the parameters and framework proposed by the Department.</p></speech>

I am aware of that.  When it comes to a general election, each party will go to the people and say what it would like to do about policing.  We might prefer one proposal over others but it is a matter for the people to vote the Government in.  Where we have an arrangement such as happened as a result of voting and there has to be negotiation between parties, we also realise that there is negotiation about policing issues and it is in that context that we understand that this proposal was agreed.</p> <p>  On our independence, there may be an element of frustration that I have not completed my report yet.  I think that is because of the independence that we have shown.  Nobody has put pressure on me.  When I have said that I am not ready yet, it has been accepted.  I have submitted interim reports.  When I decided, though nobody asked me to, that maybe other criteria could be examined, I put them in that report.  I believe it is important to include them.  Another issue I raised in it is the mobility project.  The extra funding given to us by Government for technology is going to go partly towards a mobility project which will allow access on the ground by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to databases such as PULSE without having to be in stations.  I give an example from New Zealand in that report and how that has prevented a necessity for consistent returns to stations.  We hope to go on a pilot in the near future to show just how beneficial this will be in one particular city in Ireland.  That should also be taken on board.  I will leave it to Government to examine other recommendations that I make.  It is important to note that when the six stations are chosen, there is also a programme prepared by our housing section for priority for developments of new stations and renovations of stations.  The decision has yet to be made as to where this will slot into that schedule of requirements.</p> <p>  I spent some years working in immigration and was hugely concerned that we did not have a Garda station appropriate to dealing with foreign nationals who, for a number of reasons, might end up in either Garda custody or interacting with us.  I made a firm recommendation related to that and mentioned it in detail in the report.  I understand that the go-ahead is now there to proceed with developing that facility at Dublin Airport which will go a long way and which I sought for many years.  I was very critical about it not existing.  I think that is, in fact, getting significant priority and will perhaps be dealt with ahead of other issues.  We are also aware, and I mentioned it in my report, that the station on Fitzgibbon Street, which I served in for many years, is also given priority because of the gangland and drug issues.</p></speech>

It is a "Yes" or "No" scenario.  It is important.  I know Assistant Commissioner O'Driscoll might not want to answer, but would he be comfortable with a future recommendation from Government to examine a further eight stations that slot around a particular parameter?  Would he prefer to have it by the criteria the Garda is recommending moving forward rather than to be constrained by the criteria detailed by Government?</p></speech>

The Government and departmental officials put two and two together and the Garda had to answer "four".  The Garda was not given the opportunity to set its own criteria and decide where was the appropriate place to open a new station or reopen an alternative one.  Moving forward, it should not happen again.  I accept, however, that Assistant Commissioner O'Driscoll might not want to comment on a political matter.</p></speech>

As, I presume, we are coming to the end of the session, I thank the witnesses, particularly the new acting Commissioner, for the co-operation we have all experienced today.  I am one of those people who believes it is the role of this committee to quiz, interrogate, investigate and put our views to witnesses and for them to answer our questions.  I record again that I deplore "gotcha" tactics in any committee or structure.  Such tactics are designed to ambush people and arrive at pre-determined outcomes.  It is also important to record the fact that the time of senior police officers, the force's top management, is very valuable.  Having to attend multiple committee meetings because they and their members are competing with each other to rehash continuously ground that has already been covered is very regrettable.  It does no service to politics or politicians.</p> <p>  Respectfully, I disagree completely with my colleague who questioned Assistant Commissioner O'Driscoll on the last point.  All Governments of every hue have the right to express an opinion on policing and to communicate.  The Department of Justice and Equality is involved, with its Minister, in the development of policing policy.  Ultimately, that Minister has accountability.  It would be laughable if the Minister and the Department had no say.  It is farcical that political parties which spend hours talking about which post office should or should not remain open would not wish to have an opinion expressed.  The point is well made that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not to be politicised.  The assessment and view of what should be done and how, coming back from the management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, is a vital part of that.  However, there is also a role in the overall structure for the view of the Department and of Government.  That said, I thank the witnesses for the manner in which they have worked with us today.</p></speech>

There is no response to that.  I have a couple of final points myself.  In his opening address, the acting Commissioner stated:</p><blockquote>All of us in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must now take responsibility to change our systems, practices, behaviours and culture so these issues cannot happen again and confidence is rebuilt.  It is a collective issue and can only be fixed from the top down and the bottom up.</blockquote> <p>That is very important.  I agree with colleagues that this is not a situation in which any of us wanted to be.  These are issues which have presented themselves, whatever their genesis, particularly the breath-testing debacle.  As someone who respects An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and has an excellent working relationship with the acting Commissioner's colleagues within my constituency and the divisional areas attaching thereto, it is very important to recognise that some of the points made here today will not wash.  They will not run.  I wish no personal disrespect to Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan, but the point he made about estimation rather than inflation is not one anyone on the committee can buy.  I cannot speak for the members but I listened to them all very carefully.  We cannot buy the notion that this was all just about estimation, which is how such incredibly inflated figures arose.  &quot;Falsification&quot; is the word we have used.  I do not think we are going to fulfil the goal of restoring confidence, to which the acting Commissioner, quite rightly, referred in his opening remarks, in any exercise that is intended to or appears to pull the engine of it all out.  I cannot buy estimation in this instance and inflation.  At the end of the day, the public belief is that there was falsification and we need to get to the kernel of that and discover what caused it.</p><p>Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan's report is not the final word on this.  The Policing Authority's report is yet to come.  Are there any other exercises in train or working on this?  Are there other internal reports or examinations following on from Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan's report or is it the case that we are just waiting on the report commissioned by the Policing Authority?  It is the universality of this.  If it was specific to a particular division, people might think that it could be explained in some other way.  However, this was universal.  Serving members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na all over the country did not just wake up and decide to report inaccurate figures on breath tests.  We need to know the facts as that is hugely important to the restoration of public confidence.  That confidence is, in turn, hugely important to the relationship between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the people it is entrusted to serve, namely the Irish people and Irish society generally.  Can the witnesses clarify the position having regard to other reports?</p><p>The acting Commissioner referred to 3,800 cases scheduled to be heard in the Circuit Court in 2017.  Assistant Commissioner Finn also made reference to that.  In terms of the practicalities, are they special sittings?  What does that do and how does it impact on the already scheduled series of sittings which normally take place?</p><p>I refer also to PULSE and the report of Dr. Geoffrey Shannon on the exercise of functions under section 12 of the Child Care Act.  While he paid tribute to all of those garda&iacute; with whom he had worked and recognised that the highest standards were applied by individual members in the exercise of that power and authority, he was very critical of the systems in operation within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We must look at that.  While we acknowledge the excellent disposition of individual garda&iacute;, there has been a failure to address what is wrong with the system.  The circumstances and whereabouts of 31 recorded children are completely unknown according to the particular focus Dr. Shannon took.</p><p>Has any exercise been carried out over the period since Dr. Shannon's report was presented to the Office of the Garda Commissioner?  Has any exercise been undertaken to establish the current whereabouts of those 31 missing children?  Has an updating exercise been undertaken on the PULSE system?  Can the acting Commissioner add any additional information that might give us a sense that the importance of this report is fully appreciated and that the necessary attention is being devoted to implementing, in a speedy manner, the recommendations Dr. Shannon made?  The acting Commissioner might respond.</p></speech>

As I have stated a few times during the morning, public confidence is critical to what we do.  It is a focus that we have to have.  The work that has been carried out is ongoing.  If the Chairman is asking about the additional work that is happening, Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan looked for an additional piece of work to happen, that is, going out to the regions.  That is what happening at the moment in continuation of Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan's report.</p> <p>  In an external context, we have the Policing Authority and the Crowe Horwath report.  That is what is happening in that space.</p> <p>  I will ask Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan to clarify the matter regarding the estimation.  It is not all in that barrow.  There is also an inflation piece, which is referenced in his report.  He might clarify that.</p></speech>

The first is recording issues, the second is suspected breath test inflation and the third is estimation because that is what we heard; that is what the evidence told us.</p> <p>  Regarding the recording issues, they are significant.  At one stage the discrepancy was 6.4 million, not 1.4 million.  That 6.4 million was solely down to recording issues and recovered overnight.  That goes to show the impact of the difficulties around how all of this data was recorded.  In the midst of that is the suspected breath test inflation but those are the three issues that were highlighted from the in-depth analysis carried out by Dr. Singh's people and from what we heard on the recordings, which we have retained in the Garda information service centre, in Castlebar.  That is by way of clarification.</p></speech>

These will not be contested cases.  We will not be objecting.  We will be recommending that the appeals are allowed because we acknowledge that we are wrong.

The cases in question are included among those about which Dr. Shannon concluded that the overwhelming finding was that garda&iacute; commit great effort to be sensitive and compassionate when they exercise section 12 powers.  In all cases examined, the audit found appropriate restrained use of section 12.</p> <p>  What happened in regard to those 31 cases, and Dr. Geoffrey Shannon makes reference to the fact that he examined 500,000 PULSE records, when a member has a section 12 incident, they press a button relating to category, which says "Child Welfare - Tusla Notification".  They then go on to incident type and choose from a menu including "Section 12, Child Care Act Invoked".  In terms of "Role of Child", they choose "Tusla Notification Concerning".  He got all those records.  A discrepancy was found and 31 were not included there.  That is because, at that point in the process, a number of members picked a multiple case option or whatever.  That was because these incidents related to other incidents so 31 cases had gone into another category.  He had full details of those 31.  He included those in his overall examination and found that those 31 cases were also dealt with properly.  We are happy that, this morning, Maeve Lucas, the executive director of One in Four, when speaking about the report published today, also said that from its experience the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na shows consistency and deals with these cases in a professional manner.</p> <p>  On the extent to which we opened up PULSE to Dr. Shannon, he describes that there is no other equivalent report in the world and referred to the extent to which members engaged with him and were allowed to engage with him.  It is important to point out that we first chose him to be the person to do the report.  We are working through all the recommendations with him and ensuring that we implement them in a way that is satisfactory to him.  I have all the recommendations here in an implementation plan.  That implementation plan is examined at the overall strategy meeting I engage in with Tusla and we are ensuring that every one of those is being implemented.  Obviously, some of them will take longer than others to implement.  Above all, there is no child that he refers to who is missing.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I thank acting Commissioner &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in - or Assistant Commissioner &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in or whatever designation Deputy Fitzpatrick wants to apply to him in the future - and his colleagues for their engagement with us and for their informative contributions.  I have no doubt there will be some aspects that colleagues will not believe we have addressed satisfactorily but we have endeavoured to do our best as committee members.  I also have no doubt that we will have an opportunity to speak at some point in time in the future.</p> <p>  I will suspend the meeting for one minute before going into private session.  I appeal to members to stay with me as we need to get our housekeeping done.</p></speech>
