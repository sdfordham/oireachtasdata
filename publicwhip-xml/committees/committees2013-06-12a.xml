A delegation from the History Teachers' Association of Ireland is present to make a presentation on this matter.  The delegation includes Mr. Gerard Hanlon, president, Ms Gran&uacute; Dwyer, Ms Niamh Crowley, Mr. Diarmaid Ferriter and Ms Catriona Crowe.  I also welcome officials from the Department of Education and Skills who will advise further on this issue.  They are Ms Breda Naughton, principal officer, Mr. Padraig Mac Fhlannchadha, assistant chief inspector in the Department, and Mr. Kevin McCarthy, senior inspector.</p><p>  I draw our guests' attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  The opening statements the witnesses have submitted will be published on the committee's website after the meeting.  Members of the committee are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that I have just outlined.  I invite Mr. Hanlon to make his opening remarks on behalf of the History Teachers' Association of Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-12a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerard Hanlon" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013061200003#C00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for extending this invitation to the History Teachers' Association of Ireland, HTAI.  Those initials in documents refer to the association.  We are very grateful for this opportunity to make our case to the committee.</p><p>  From the moment the Towards a Framework for Junior Cycle document was published by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, this association became gravely concerned about what we considered to be dire implications for history as a subject in the junior certificate.  To that end we began a campaign.  Members might be wondering why Catriona Crowe and Diarmaid Ferriter are part of the delegation from the History Teachers' Association of Ireland.  They are part of the delegation because this is not just a sectoral issue.  It has a broader impact and there are broader implications.  From when we began our campaign, both Diarmaid Ferriter and Catriona Crowe have been intimately involved with the association in supporting it.  They feel there is a large issue here for public discourse.</p><p>  We made a submission to the committee.  It should be said that we support the overall thrust, aims and philosophy in the framework document and I believe the Minister is sincere when he says he believes in the value of history as a subject in the junior cycle, as have all the party leaders.  However, we also believe there is an entitlement to history, which this document does not give.  In that context we made our submissions.  We had an executive summary which had five points, and I will ask the public relations officer of HTAI, Niamh Crowley, to go through that executive summary.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-12a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Niamh Crowley" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013061200003#C00400"><p>Our opening statement is based on the summary which we submitted last Friday.  I sent a PowerPoint presentation but people did not think it was possible to upload it, so I have supplied members with documents from that presentation.  They highlight the key areas we will be discussing.  Members also have a portfolio of other material which is referenced in our summary.  It is on the members' internal website.</p><p>  The first point is the issue of entitlement.  Here in the Oireachtas it is most appropriate to speak about what we believe is the entitlement of every young person to an historical education.  We believe it is essential to our cultural heritage, even more crucially because most people no longer speak our native language in daily life.  It is essential also to empower people in a functioning democracy.  It is not just the History Teachers' Association of Ireland that believes this.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Education and Skills believe it, and the European Assembly in 1996 issued a recommendation, No. 1283, on the learning of history in Europe, in which it said historical awareness should be an essential part of the education of all young people.  I will not quote it in full as members have it in the PowerPoint presentation.  This is the reason the history teachers have been campaigning since summer 2011 for history to remain as a core subject in the junior cycle curriculum.</p><p>  I will briefly mention an argument that has sometimes been made to us, that history is not at present a core subject in all schools.  Traditionally, it was not a core subject in vocational schools, which were set up in 1930 to provide vocational training.  The rules for secondary schools, which provide for a broad general education, included history and geography for all students.  Now, all schools strive to provide a general education for everybody, so this should not be used as an argument to remove history from the core.</p><p>  We are also aware that in the changing school climate, many single sex secondary schools are amalgamating and are coming under the governance of the vocational education committee, VEC, and therefore governed by VEC rules.  However, that is an unintended consequence and not part of educational policy, so we do not believe that should be used to argue in favour of the removal of history from the core.</p><p>  Our second point is that to provide this entitlement, history must be taught and learned as a full subject and not relegated to a short course or a learning experience.  We have outlined three reasons for this.  I will mention them briefly, but they are in the detailed documentation sent to the committee.  First, we believe history is a discipline and to benefit from that, it must be taught as a full subject.  Second, the nature of the study in primary school is necessarily limited by the capacity and understanding of the young people, who really do not achieve the ability to understand abstract concepts until they enter young adulthood.  Third, in secondary schools history is taught by specialist teachers.  For those three reasons it is essential that it be taught in the junior cycle curriculum.  At present, history is usually allocated approximately three periods per week.  All that we ask is that it be given this provision in the core for the three years of the junior cycle.</p><p>  Our third point relates to the practical implications of the framework document.  As Gerard Hanlon said, we agree with the aims of reforming junior cycle education.  We are historians, not Luddites, and we are not opposed to any type of change.  However, at the heart of the framework document is the idea that junior cycle education should be informed by 24 statements of learning.  Having pursued those 24 statements of learning, the framework only allows for three core subjects to implement them.  Number eight is the statement which would apply in particular to history.  Statement No. 8 states that students should value local, national and international heritage, understand the importance of the relationship between past and present events and the forces that drive change.  Yet, when one looks at the appendix at the back of the framework document, one finds that eight different subjects, starting with Chinese, are listed as fulfilling this statement of learning.  There are at least six other statements of learning that could apply to history, but in each case in the appendix at the back there is no requirement that history be chosen as a core subject.</p><p>  A final illustration of this comes from the Department's own PowerPoint information for principals.  The last slide shows an example of a hypothetical student No. 2, which is slide No. 15 in the PowerPoint presentation.</p> <p>In the case of student No. 2, the core subjects are down as English, Irish, mathematics and science while history appears in one option band.  Some schools may choose it and the students will have an entitlement to history but in other schools it may not be provided or, even if it is provided, students may not use it at age 12 when they enter secondary school and make that decision.  It might be said that we are speculating about the negative implications for history but our point is the reality of what happens to history when it becomes a choice rather than a core subject.  We can look at the neighbouring island to see what is happening in England.  England is often cited, along with Albania, as the only European country where history is not part of the core up to the age of 15 or 16 years of age.  History is part of the core until 14 years of age but it is a choice subject for GCSE.  The Historical Association and numerous articles and surveys have reported and highlighted the disturbing class divide that emerges where, in middle-class areas and independent schools, history is well represented while in more working-class areas and schools it has been squeezed out for what are deemed to be more useful and easier subjects.  In Ireland in the current climate of financial restraint and cutbacks, there may be further reasons history will be squeezed or reduced to a short course.</p><p> While all of the foregoing points are universal, we conclude with the historic decade in which we find ourselves.  Last June, the Taoiseach stated: "As we move into the decade of commemorations that stretch before us, from the 100th anniversary of the Third Home Rule Bill, the Ulster League and Covenant, the foundation of the Ulster and Irish Volunteers, the Dublin lockout, 1916, the Somme, and beyond it is imperative that the social, cultural, economic, administrative and political environments that shaped these events be understood."  It would be an unfortunate legacy of the decade of commemorations if, at its end, a coherent study of the discipline of history in schools was not the entitlement of every one of our young people.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-12a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Breda Naughton" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013061200004#D00500"><p>Yes, they are starting at 2 p.m.  I take it the committee members have read the submission so I will highlight key points from the submission.  In October 2012, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, published the framework for the junior cycle.  Today the Department, at the committee's request, wishes to concentrate on the impact the implementation of the framework for junior cycle will have on the learning and teaching of history.  Through comparing education internationally, it has been found that in high performing education systems such as New Zealand, Queensland and Finland, schools have been given greater autonomy and flexibility in the programmes they offer.  When schools in Ireland are implementing the new junior cycle, they too will have the autonomy and flexibility to design programmes within the parameters of the framework, mindful in particular of the needs of their students and their teaching resources.</p><p>  Currently, only 52% of post-primary schools - the voluntary secondary schools to which Ms Crowley referred - are obliged to provide history and geography as core subjects yet over 90% of the students who sit the junior certificate examination enter the examination for history.  There are currently more than 5,500 students who do not present for history in the junior certificate examination.  Schools across all sectors offer history because they have sufficient numbers of qualified teaching personnel in this area and sufficient interest from students.  History teachers attract students to their subject through their love and passion for history and by engaging the natural curiosity of their students in, for example, the lives of people, the origins of the modern world and objects and documents from the past.  History is the fifth most popular subject in the junior certificate examination.</p><p>  The framework will be implemented on a phased basis from September 2014.  For the first time, from September 2017, history will be established as a discrete subject.  It is currently linked to geography, as outlined in the rules and programme for secondary schools.  New specifications for history will be developed by the NCCA and will involve consultation with the key stakeholders and the public.  It is hoped the new specifications will facilitate the development of skills, including critically interpreting a range of texts, communicating, working with others, critical thinking and managing information, particularly through the use of digital technology.</p><p>  As they are designing the new junior cycle programmes, schools will have to be mindful not only of the principles and key skills but also of the 24 statements of learning specified.  These statements describe what students should know, understand, value and be able to do at the end of junior cycle.  The key statement for history is that every student values local, national and international heritage, understands the importance of the relationship between past and current events and the forces that drive change.  For schools, their teachers and their students, the reality of the statement will mean a study of history predominantly as a subject and, for some, they may have the option of studying a short course.  In larger schools, some classes could have history as a full subject for certification and some could have short courses, perhaps for certification but also for non-certification purposes.</p><p>  The minimum time allocated for subjects such as history will be 200 hours or the equivalent of three 40-minute periods per week over three years.  For many schools, this will lead to an increased time provision for history and will allow not only for a deepening of a student's historical knowledge but also of his or her ability to analyse, interpret, write and develop historical skills more thoroughly.  It will also allow for a greater understanding of how historians work.  Short courses, on the other hand, will be designed for 100 hours and will provide an alternative option for other students, perhaps for the equivalent of the 5,500 students who do not study history currently.  Short courses could address local history, aspects of women's history, industrial history or the particular interest at the moment in the decade of centenaries.</p><p>  A number of attempts have been made to modernise the 1989 junior cycle history syllabus.  In 1996, the syllabus was revised and there was a significant reduction in content.  In the mid-2000s, a further revision was considered but not implemented due to the prioritisation of the overhaul of the junior cycle programme itself.  This overhaul led to the publication of the framework last October.  None of the revisions to date have gone as far as many teachers and other subject experts would like.  In many respects, more modernisation has been achieved in leaving certificate history than at junior cycle.  A revised leaving certificate syllabus, first examined in 2006, has placed greater emphasis on source handling, key concepts, personalities and case studies, on social, economic and scientific developments, as well as on matters political and military, student choice and independent research.</p><p>  The implementation of the framework presents an opportunity to recast junior cycle history as a vibrant, student-centred and valuable subject with significant emphasis on the relevance of past experiences to our lives today.  New approaches are likely to provide a host of new opportunities, in history and elsewhere, for students to carry out group or individual project work, including designing tasks, making oral presentations, undertaking field trips, using ICT for research and presenting reports.  The new approach is about quality learning, teaching and assessment and will not, I hope, be based on quantitative learning.  It will be about learning to learn and learning to think.  It will highlight the role of assessment for learning throughout the three years.  Assessment for certification will be at a common level.  The differentiation will be evident in the learning experiences and in the aspirations and expectations for students.  The bar will be raised as the highest grade of achievement with distinction will require a mark greater than 90% , compared with the current 85% for an A grade.  This does not mean a dumbing down of content.  On the contrary, it is about giving our young people the knowledge, skills and values that will enable them to understand and appreciate history and historians.  There will be a dedicated programme of continuing professional development provided to history teachers to enhance their skills and confidence.  That CPD will commence in autumn 2016, a year before the new specifications are implemented.</p><p>  The implementation of the framework provides a new opportunity to recast history as a vibrant, student-centred and valuable subject with significant emphasis on the relevance of past experiences on our lives today and into the future.  It is expected that students' experiences of the new junior cycle history will provide an excellent base for students considering taking history at senior cycle and impact positively in the future on the take-up of history at senior cycle.</p> <p>The role of history in the new junior cycle will be balanced against the contribution of the other subjects, the new short courses and other learning experiences in enabling students to engage with a broad and enriched junior cycle programme that meets the requirements of the 24 statements of learning.  It is the totality of the three-year junior cycle experience that each young person receives that will be important as they progress through junior cycle and continue on to senior cycle and thereafter.</p></speech>

As there are many Members here who are not members of the committee, I will outline the agreed procedure.  The order will be as follows: Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in, Technical Group and Government spokespersons and Deputies and Senators in the order they raise their hands with preference given to committee members.  I will stick to that, if it is okay.  I will ask everyone to keep to a maximum of four minutes to allow everyone to speak.  We can come back to people, if we have the time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-12a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/999" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013061200005#E00300"><p>I join with the Chairman in welcoming the representatives of the History Teachers' Association of Ireland and the Department.  As a former history student at university level, I welcome a former tutor of mine, Professor Diarmaid Ferriter.  I have a very strong respect for the role history can play in one's education and I have a love for it.</p><p>  I refer to the framework for the junior certificate so far and how it is developed.  There are many issues with it in terms of the consultation undertaken with teachers in putting it together.  It is still vague in many ways in terms of what will be delivered at the end of it.  Ms Breda Naughten spoke about what will be in place if the plans go ahead as they are and it sounds very promising.  She spoke about field trips and more IT but schools and teachers are not being given the resources or funding to achieve that.  There is a real risk in terms of how it will play out at school level.  It depends on the background of the school and the quality of education in it.  </p><p>  Ms Niamh Crowley referred to the experience in Britain where history has suffered in disadvantaged schools and the take-up has not been what it could be.  How many students continue to study history at leaving certificate level?  Is there a concern there?  Does it inform learning?  If we are to give students the choice at junior certificate level, how many will decide to study history? </p><p>  Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes the reform of the junior certificate and believes there are many things which can be improved in the curriculum.  However, we need to consider more carefully the impact of each of the decisions we make.  That has not happened in regard to history, in particular, and we need more engagement.  </p><p>  Will the Department outline further what level of consultation took place with teachers before the framework document was put in place?  We should not be in the situation where the document has been published and we are only now giving some in-depth consideration to its impact.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-12a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/984" speakername="Jonathan O'Brien" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013061200005#E00400"><p>I welcome the delegations.  The HTAI has put its case very well.  We also have a concern about this.  The association mentioned the class divide in terms of how things have developed in England.  The one thing which was not mentioned but which is in the submission is the Department's focus on literacy and numeracy and the importance of history and geography in developing them.  There are real concerns about the number of students who will not take history.  If it is a short course and is an option, the numbers will fall off.  We have only to look at what has happened to history and geography in England.</p><p>  We are not focusing on the impact it could have on the higher education sector because if people are not studying history as a core subject at junior certificate level and at leaving certificate level, the numbers studying it at higher level will decline and it will have a detrimental impact on the area.  We should not look at junior certificate reform in isolation because there will be an impact beyond that if this goes ahead.  Do the delegates have any figures or research on the impact in England in terms of people going on to higher education and studying history or courses involving history?  Ms Breda Naughten said 67,500 students were sitting the history examination today.  If this goes ahead, fewer students will take history next year and in subsequent years.  We will continue to see a drop in the numbers studying history.</p><p>  Much of what was contained in her presentation reads well and in theory sounds good but in practice, I do not think it will work.  I do not think a short course is sufficient to provide the background students need in terms of their ability to study history.  There is an old saying that if one does not learn from the past, history will repeat itself but if this goes ahead, we may not even know if history is repeating itself because people will not know what was the history.  The Department is getting it wrong and is over-stating the capacity of short courses to maintain history as a principal subject.  Has the HTAI or the Department figures on how it will impact beyond junior certificate level to leaving certificate level and higher education level?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-12a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1131" speakername="Fidelma Healy Eames" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013061200005#E00500"><p>I welcome the delegations.  It is great they are here making this very strong pitch for history.  Given the fast moving world in which our youngsters live, there is a real danger that they are looking at everything in the here and now and that they are losing the context of our past and present which will inform the future.</p><p>  Does the HTAI see merit in the statements of learning produced by the Department?  I like them but I wonder how they will be assessed.  There are 24 statements of learning and the association is right to say that at least eight of those could include history.  I put that question to Ms Breda Naughten also.  Is the Department open to at least the eight statements of learning, which the HTAI pointed out, including history as a means to achieve those statements of learning?  It states, ".....creates, appreciates and critically interprets a wide range of texts".  Immediately one thinks of English and Gaeilge but it could be an historical text or an historical piece of writing.  If that is the case, who will correct that?  Has the Department thought this through?</p> <p>In terms of the achievement of these 24 statements of learning, how is the Department investing in the teachers and training them and the correctors to correct?  If the Department is going back to the subject-based format, I do not know if that will work.  The Department will have to change everything if it is moving to this new paradigm or construct of statements of learning.  That question is for both sides.</p><p> My second question is for the history teachers.  Many children lose out with history if it is taught as a set of dates and events.  Nothing can match an enthusiastic teacher who really brings history to life.  I attended one secondary school and then went to a different one for the last four years of my schooling.  Without any grinds, nine of us in my class got A's in our leaving certificate history because we had the most amazing teacher who was full of enthusiasm, believed in the subject and did not expect anyone not to like it, while not pushing it on us.  One could hardly see him coming in the door with the pile of books he brought with him for us to read, to broaden the context of the set textbook.  Do the teachers have a fear that the downgrading of the subject, as they call it, will lead to fewer students wanting to go on to teach history?  Do they fear a lesser investment by the Department in the upskilling of teachers?  </p><p> I return to Ms Naughten.  How is the Department going to train the teachers, if they are teaching to statements of learning?  </p></speech>

In a sense, we have gone ahead of ourselves with some of the questions.  By that, I mean that the substantive issue is that history may not even be taught at all.  Students may not actually have the opportunity to experience history.  I will read statement No. 8 again because it is the one that most obviously dovetails into history.  It says the student: "values local, national and international heritage, understands the importance of the relationship between past and current events and the forces that drive change".  Anyone who has studied history would presume that history will be used to fulfil or meet that statement of learning.  However, the Department's own document says students may achieve this by looking at Chinese, classics, CSPE, geography, Jewish studies, religious education or science.  I quote those subjects without prejudice.  There is nothing wrong with those subjects but a school principal, who has 24 statements of learning that must be fulfilled in his or her school, might decide that Chinese will meet statement No. 8 and schedule a short course in Chinese.  History may never be offered as a subject.  In the context of Senator Healy Eames's remarks about the history teacher who enthused her, future students may never actually have such a teacher.  That, for us, is the substantive issue.</p><p>  On the Department's document, we are probably 98% in agreement with everything that the Department has included in its executive summary.  A lot of it is aspirational, however, as some of the questioners have pointed out.  I do not know how it will be fulfilled but we must go back to basics.  History may not be offered to students.  It does not have to be offered under these statements of learning because the Department, in its own document, has given other options to schools to fulfil these statements of learning.  </p></speech>

I agree that they read excellently but they can only be implemented if they are followed through with a broad curriculum.  There are 24 statements while the core is only three subjects, although sometimes when the Minister speaks he includes science.  Science is not officially one of the core subjects but the Minister seems to be unofficially including it.  If there are 24 statements and only a core of four subjects, that does not follow through, logically, to us.  That is where we would find fault with the document.</p><p>  At the moment, the vast majority of students in the junior cycle are taking history.  Therefore, they all have the opportunity to select it for senior cycle and to go on to study it at third level.  However, if one narrows the base, there will be a smaller pool from which students will be able to choose history.  That has been shown in Britain.  If students do not have history as an option at GSCE level, they cannot go on to study it at higher levels later on.  </p></speech>

In fact, in Britain at the moment they are discussing the possibility of making history and geography compulsory again for students up to age 16.  However, one of the problems they have identified with that is that there are not enough teachers in the system anymore.  The number of teachers in the system fell when these subjects were removed from the core curriculum in the United Kingdom.  They now have an infrastructural difficulty in trying to reintroduce history and geography as core subjects.</p></speech>

It is not just a question of the numbers who want to pursue the subject at third level.  There is always going to be a big intake into arts programmes with history being one of the options.  However, it would impact on the amount of people who would feel confident taking history at third level because they might feel that they did not have the necessary skills that come with studying the subject at second level.  That, for me, is a more important issue than the numbers issue.</p><p>  The skills that students of history at second level can amass and the confidence it gives them are critical, particularly the areas of analysis, methodology, evidence and proof.  Having a sense of these and a sense of the broad sweep of history is essential.  One of the difficulties at the moment, for which there is evidence in the UK, is that short courses lead to fragmentation.  Students are looking at often unconnected fragments of history.  That too would impact on their ability and confidence to take on the subject at third level.  We need to be really conscious of what students who study history at junior certificate and leaving certificate level are getting and give them the opportunity to build on those skills at third level.  My great fear is that if they lose the foundation block at second level, they simply will not feel remotely equipped to pursue the subject to degree level.  That will cut them off from pursuing it even further.</p><p>  I wish to link this issue to what Mr. Hogan said at the outset about the broader implications.  I am glad the third level question has been raised.  I do not teach history in a secondary school but I am concerned about the broader implications of what is being proposed, including for third level.  It is important to reflect on this carefully.  Reference was made to the fact that this is an issue for our public discourse and the greater impact that it will have, beyond the question of secondary students going on to third level.  If it is fair to say that the present preoccupations of younger people are a fair barometer of future societal attitudes, then taking history away from them, as I feel will be the inevitable result of these proposals, will leave us in a very worrying situation in the future.  This is not just about second and third level education.  There is a broader societal impact.</p><p>  There is also the question of whether future students will be equipped to effectively analyse the present.  Reference was made to the importance of history in developing an understanding and greater awareness of public affairs, which is an issue of citizenship and of empowerment.  Those questions are also connected to the themes of social and class divides.  The issue is one of history being squeezed but also of who is getting access to the subject and who is not.  The implications are hugely relevant across the sector.</p><p>  We must also consider the question of who history is for.  </p> <p>It could ironically be said that I am here today because I believe history is far too important to be left to historians.  I say that because that is another danger in these proposals, that history will become the preserve of an elite.  There is a great sense of public ownership of history in this country and I do not accept the argument that curiosity is always natural.  It often must be nurtured and encouraged.  That is why the study of history is crucial and that everyone must have access to it.  It is too important to be left to an elite, particularly an academic elite.  I would also link it to the bigger questions that have been briefly touched on.  I have been invited as a historian to join a Government appointed advisory group on commemorations and I am happy to accept the invitation.  It seems to be a particularly cruel irony that at the same time as those sorts of initiatives, and all sorts of assertions of how seriously commemoration is being taken, that we would then have this proposal in front of us on what I consider the downgrading of history during that very commemoration period.  The issue is then one of who steps in the breach.  This is where people must be empowered with the knowledge of the history of the country.  If they do not have that, others will step into the breach to use and abuse and distort history for their own ends.</p><p> I come back to the question of entitlement and empowerment.  It is of particular relevance at present and I link that to the wider issue of heritage.  We cannot compartmentalise these issues.  I have been vocal in the past about some of the proposals for cultural institutions.  All of these are connected so we do not to think in terms of either third level or second level, we must think of the connections between these areas.</p></speech>

Significant consultation was carried out when the NCCA was developing its framework on the junior cycle.  When the framework was sent to the Department, the Minister looked at it and felt it did not go quite far enough.  That was where he changed the assessment, in particular, but the remainder stayed the same.  I know the History Teachers Association had meetings with the Minister and in the NCCA framework document it said they would only study a minimum of eight subjects and a significant plea was made to increase that to ten subjects.  That was taken on board.</p><p>  There are 21 subjects in the junior cycle and they will be implemented on a phased basis.  The best way to describe how consultation will happen is to have a look at the NCCA website and it has the specifications for English, so the viewer can see how the consultation process goes ahead.  It will be similar for all the other subjects.  There will be experts from the History Teachers Association and third level involved in the development of the specifications.</p><p>  There is a commitment to provide funding for the training of teachers in this area of &euro;10 million per year.  There are adverts out at present to get the team together for the junior cycle CPD team, which will be led by Dr. P&aacute;draig Kirk.  It is interesting at the moment that history is not a compulsory subject for 50% of schools but 90% of young people take history in the junior cycle.  That equates to 53,161 last year.  When we go to leaving certificate, however, the numbers drop dramatically, with 11,746 taking history last year.  The drop is already there and we want to make the new specification for history attractive so young people can see it as a realistic option, rather than learning, as some of us did, dates by heart and not analysing and understanding the relevance of what is going on.</p><p>  We have a significant cohort of history teachers in the system and the teachers themselves have high expectations and aspirations.  They realise the importance of their responsibility for encouraging young people to move on from history at junior cycle to leaving certificate level.</p></speech>

Many people in this room did huge work to support that.  One of the challenges we face is that the junior certificate syllabus is not in line with that.  A consequence of that is a significant drop off of students from junior to senior cycle.  Deputy McConalogue asked earlier about the statistics on uptake.  It is hard to track year on year but in 2012, some 53,000 students did junior certificate history but only 11,700 students did it at leaving certificate level.  There is no one in this room more passionate about history than me but look at the comparison with geography.  Some 54,000 students did junior certificate geography in 2012 and 25,700 students did it at leaving certificate level.  That is not the fault of the history teachers.  It is not even the fault of the Department.  The syllabus is overladen with content.  Teachers and students do not know where to start and where to stop.  That is part of the reason that when we revised the syllabus in 1989 it had to be revised again by 1996 and we then tried again during the 2000s.  It is vital we take some of the content and increase some of thinks between junior and senior cycle history.  That is where areas like key skills and other factors in the framework should help us to link junior to senior cycle in a more meaningful way.  We are teaching some leaving certificate students skills in fifth year because there is often not the time to teach the same skills in junior cycle, especially if the timetable is restricted to two or three periods per week.  That is the battle that is being fought.  We must look at the framework as an opportunity to link junior cycle history more to the senior cycle.</p><p>  Bearing in mind the rules and programme only compel 52% of schools to teach history, I have often fought the battle in schools where history is not offered at all to students.  Unfortunately these are often students who are disadvantaged.  I intend to use statement 8 and other statements to my benefit in the future when trying to push that all students must have access to meaningful history.</p><p>  The lack of skills at third level may be the case, although that is not for me to say.  The whole shape of the framework is to enforce the development of literacy, numeracy and other analytic skills in a meaningful way, hopefully by taking some of the content out and increasing the time provision for students who study history.  Right now the maximum I would see in provision for junior cycle history is 200 hours.  That is three 40 minute periods per week over three years.  It will be the minimum in the new stipulation and I must look at that as a really important reinforcement for time to develop the skills that may well be lacking according to the previous speaker.</p><p>  The irony that we may be lessening the importance of history just as we commemorate the decade of centenaries.  Right now, the existing junior certificate syllabus provides for a fairly cursory glance, "an overview" is the phrase that is used, of the period from 1912 to 1923.  I do not know if anyone could claim that we are giving students a meaningful understanding or that we can give students a meaningful understanding of that decade in the time available to teachers.</p></speech>

I will also look at the question of continuous professional development, CPD.</p><p>  The key difference in the new junior cycle is that schools will develop programmes of learning that will meet the requirements of the 24 statements of learning.  The new core of the junior cycle will be the 24 statements of learning.  The 24 statements of learning will be delivered through the programme that schools will develop.  That programme will consist of subjects, short courses and other learning experiences either for the purposes of certification or otherwise.  The reason for this is to ensure the school can develop a programme that will meet the needs of the students in the individual school, and also in accordance with the resources that the school has available.  Therefore, it is not the statements of learning that will be assessed as such; they will be assessed through assessment of the short courses, the subjects and the other learning experiences that form part of the school's programme of learning.  That will be the experience of the students.</p></speech>

It will be very difficult to see how a school can meet the requirements of statement of learning No. 8, particularly when one looks at the elaboration of that statement, which states that using the different types of evidence and materials the student look at the lives of both famous and ordinary people in the past and can see how local, national and international communities change over time, how people act to bring about change and how these changes may be connected with each other and with current events and developments.  It continues by specifying that the student will be aware that he or she inherits the values, beliefs and traditions that go to make up his or her culture and of the importance of respecting the cultures of others.  It is very difficult to see how that statement of learning can be made without giving students the opportunity to engage in historical study.  I know that other subjects are meant there, but it is very clear that this is directly linked to history.</p><p>  A comprehensive programme of continuous professional development will be implemented to support the implementation of the junior cycle, which will commence with English in September 2013.  There is a commitment of &euro;10 million per year for the continuous professional development of teachers, deputy principals, principals and others during the roll-out of the new junior cycle.  Each subject teacher will receive the equivalent of three days' continuous professional development, which will be either on-site or off-site.</p></speech>

Is there any evidence as to why the class divide in England became more pronounced in the choice of history as a subject than in any other subject?  I suppose part of the debate concerns compulsion versus opportunity in terms of the provision of history in a school.  It is interesting that only 50% of schools require students to take history as a junior certificate subject; the assumption that history is compulsory does not stack up.  The statistics provided by Mr. Kevin McCarthy are fascinating; some 54,000 students take junior certificate history and geography, but twice as many students take geography as history at level certificate level.  There seems to be a problem with history that must be addressed in some way.  We are obviously discussing whether these proposals provide an answer.  Is there a sense that the history examination at leaving certificate is too onerous?  It is at least 20 years since I was in the school system - sometimes, in fairness to politicians, one is trying to comment on the system from memory - but I remember that in the leaving certificate the history exam was a writing race, more necessary than the exam.  Does the history examination have a reputational problem at leaving certificate level?  People have spoken about enthusiastic teachers, but fundamentally one needs enthusiastic students.  One is trying to find a balance in giving the students the opportunity to learn something, but what if they have no interest in the subject?</p><p>  We see what has happened to the Irish language.  I am a great believer in the language and I have a degree in Irish, but the major policy failure of the education system, going back to the 1920s, is the teaching of Irish.  It has worked for some people but it has not worked for the vast bulk of people.</p><p>  There is a suggestion that Chinese might be offered instead of history.  How many schools offer Chinese?  Is that a choice that is not necessarily fair?  Will the vast bulk of schools not find it easier to provide history as a subject choice at junior certificate level than Chinese, classics or Jewish studies?  Is that not the reality on the ground because of the number of people who have the capability to teach history?  There is a great opportunity, certainly now that a second year of study is being rolled out for the higher diploma in education.</p><p>  The decade of commemorations was mentioned.  I can remember every land Act from 1870 to the Wyndham Act of 1903.  However, I did not know very much about social history until I went to Dr. Ferriter's class and learned about TB and the housing crisis in the 1940s.  The linear history of Ireland and the national struggle has a history of overtaking the history syllabus.  I want to comment on the depth of our study of the social problems and tensions behind history rather than the dates.</p></speech>

Mr. Hanlon stated his worries that students may not pick history.  It is a case of history repeating itself, because I went to a technical college and neither history nor geography was on the curriculum, more moons ago than when Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in was at school.  We never had an opportunity to study history.  I have spent my life playing catch-up in history and geography.  When I left second-level school I did not know a river or a mountain because we did not learn them.  To this day, if I go to a table quiz I tell the team that I am weak on history and geography.  One will carry what one learns in history and geography right through life.  History does not change.  Once one has learned it and it is in one's head, it is there for the rest of one's life.  It affects one's life if one does not have knowledge.</p><p>  The report on the reform of the junior cycle states clearly that students are happy with history and it is one of the most popular subjects.  I wonder if the witnesses are worrying too much and underestimating the choices students will make  Why are the witnesses worried that students will not select history and geography as subjects?</p></speech>

I have not been taught, instructed or examined by any of the witnesses - maybe I was in the bold class.   I will make a couple of points before asking a couple of questions.</p><p>  A fascinating and positive aspect of this debate, particularly in the context of the framework for junior cycle, is that there appears to be an issue with the teaching of history, whether it is related to the framework cycle or the current position of teaching history.  I ask for all sides to comment on this from a philosophical perspective.  Perhaps we all agree on the issue while disagreeing on whether the framework for the junior cycle is a genuine response to the issue.  As someone who is paranoid, I believe the teaching of history has an impact on political culture, political participation and ideological viewpoints.  The majority of students in the leaving certificate history class of 1982 in the school I attended voted for parties on the extreme left in both elections that year because of a fantastic teacher we had, a guy called Tony Gregory, who taught us for seven years.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh may agree with me on that.  Mr. Gregory had a profound impact on us through his teaching.  I expect Professor Ferriter and Mr. McCarthy will agree with me on the powerful impact the teaching of history can have on one's political outlook.</p><p>  As we water down the teaching of history and move towards adopting extreme Orwellian language, such as the description of history as a "discrete subject", we will end up in a position where history is not taught and becomes fragmented.  As Professor Ferriter stated, we will lack adequate tools to analyse the present.  I am concerned about this, although I accept that a certain amount of paranoia is at work in this regard.  If one considers how we celebrated, acknowledged or commemorated the Easter Rising in 1966 and 1991 and how it is proposed to commemorate the centenary in 2016, we see there has been a different emphasis in each case and that the education system backed this up, depending on what the State apparatus wanted.  For example, one historical figure, P&aacute;draig Pearse, moved from veneration to invisibility in my life cycle.  Neither position is correct and I am not suggesting our esteemed guests would suggest otherwise.  I am deeply concerned about the way in which history is perceived.</p><p>  If one works backwards from Professor Ferriter's comment on the anxiety students may have about taking history at third level, the problem lies not at junior certificate level but at senior cycle.  Neither of my daughters, both of whom attended a VEC school, was offered history for the leaving certificate despite taking the subject in the junior cycle.  There is something wrong with the leaving certificate syllabus when children doing the leaving certificate next year in a progressive school with a diverse socioeconomic profile do not know the names of half the Cabinet.  The reason is not a lack of interest in politics, but a failure to sufficiently enthuse or prepare them to analyse or listen to history.</p><p>  Mr. McCarthy put the matter starkly when he noted the sharp decline in the number who take history for the leaving certificate when compared to those who take the subject in the junior certificate.  Surely there is a much more sophisticated or nuanced analysis than ascribing this fall to a decline in interest.  While it may be that history examinations are essentially a writing race, we must have a much more sophisticated analysis of the issue.  This debate on the junior certificate framework is an important aspect of such an analysis.  I ask the witnesses to comment.  I am concerned that this should not undermine potential citizenship or the legacy of the decade of centenaries that is taking place. </p><p>  I understood from the comments of Ms Naughton and Ms Crowley that the same number of teaching hours is available in the proposed new syllabus for the junior certificate as in the current syllabus.  I may have misheard the details of the proposals in the current framework.  I ask them to clarify if that is the case. </p></speech>

When I was teaching, history and geography were like Siamese twins.  We used to fight about whether they were the majority or minority subjects and whether they would be allocated two or three lessons per week.  In the new scenario geography and history will both be stand-alone subjects, rather than tied to one another.</p><p>  Chinese is currently provided in transition year in a small number of schools.  When we discuss the framework and its implementation with schools, we emphasise to them the importance of using the teaching resources available, namely, history teachers.  It is the responsibility of history teachers to encourage an interest in history among young people as they move from junior cycle to senior cycle.  As Mr. McCarthy stated, the history syllabus at junior cycle is extremely long and difficult, whereas the senior cycle syllabus reflects to a much greater degree the way we want to go.  </p></speech>

I have stated that view on record for the past 12 years and it has not changed.  The subject has been transformed substantially by history teachers.  Previous speakers referred to the years they attended college.  I am much too old to have been taught by Professor Ferriter but I was taught at college in the 1970s by fantastic historians, including Professor Joe Lee and Professor John A. Murphy.  I do not have any memory of studying documents or examining issues such as bias, objectivity, subjectivity and so forth.  That is the type of transformation that has been built into the junior certificate to a certain extent.  However, we are still struggling as a result of content overload.</p><p>  I would be happy if the teachers of history present commented on the leaving certificate.  My gut feeling from the response I have had from many teachers is that they are much happier with the current leaving certificate syllabus.  We are not dumbing down leaving certificate history.  While it is still a serious challenge in terms of the writing required, it is a much more doable and a more positive experience for students than the old syllabus.  Instead of having to leave the examination room after 3 hours and 20 minutes of writing down everything one knows about five topics, students must now answer three essay-style questions, engage with one documents topic requiring some short answers and do a research study outside the examination setting.  While no one denies there is still pressure, there is much less of it in terms of the race against time one had previously.  Perhaps members should sit in on a few history lessons to observe the transformation that has been brought about by many of those present - I am not engaging in pl&aacute;m&aacute;s - in terms of the use of information and communications technology, engagement with primary sources and so forth.  We have to turn the junior cycle syllabus for history into a greater opportunity for this to happen when the specifications are drawn up.  </p></speech>

We are aware that the current syllabus is overloaded.  The new specification, when it comes online, will provide the opportunity to revise and update the current syllabus and ensure that the skills and competences relevant to the study of history will be fully incorporated.  As with all other subjects it provides an opportunity to make it a vibrant learning experience for the students.  There will be an opportunity for introducing projects, field trips, and the opportunity for students to deliver presentations, both written and oral, as part of assessment arrangements and designing tasks.  There is great potential to develop not only the knowledge but the skills which are key to the subject.</p></speech>

Pardon the pun, history is involved here, it is the history of the system.  For many years most voluntary secondary schools in Ireland were run by one religious denomination or other.  As the voluntary secondary schools have to certain extent collapsed, meaning they have gone into amalgamation situations, the governance of those schools has changed but frequently tradition may have continued. The rules and regulations of the Department of Education and Skills require voluntary secondary schools to teach history.  Those schools that still operate under the rule must offer history.  That is the reason so many students study history at junior cycle.  When one comes to senior cycle the range of subjects is much greater.  Compared to when I completed the leaving certificate the range of subjects on offer is vastly inflated.  One takes one's place in the marketplace.</p><p>  There is a perception problem with history.  History is seen as difficult and literate.  We no longer live in a literate culture so it is viewed as difficult and there is a literacy element.  The reason those who opt for it, having gone through the junior certificate examination, is because that interest has been fostered.  Senator Marie Moloney mentioned that when she went to her vocational school, history or geography was not offered.  That is already the situation in schools in Ireland at present.  I know of one school, not far from where I teach, where history and geography are being offered as a choice in first year.  As it is not a voluntary secondary school it does not have to offer history and geography.  That is the position at present.</p><p>  The voluntary secondary schools are collapsing, down to 52%.  Five years ago the figure stood at perhaps 70% and ten years ago there may have been 80%.  They had to offer history and geography.  As they collapse and as they do not have to follow the rules and regulations of the Department of Education and Skills the syllabus is essentially open-ended.  They are now offering history and geography.  This framework document would allow that across the board.  Why might history not be offered?  We are all aware of the harsh economic climate.  As a history teacher retires in a school there may not be a replacement.</p><p>  Redeployment is an issue for many schools.  The resources may not be available as principals juggle with timetables.  That is part of our concern.  We accept the bona fides  of the Department but are concerned about the practical implications of this document as we move forward as opposed to speculation on what might happen.</p></speech>

I am pleased to note so much interest on the part of Members of the Oireachtas on this very important subject.  I am privileged to be present to support the History Teacher' Association of Ireland who are some of the most passionate people in defence of a very important subject that I have ever had the honour to meet.</p><p>  I shall commence with an old clich&eacute;.  It is a quote from George Santayana, the philosopher, who said: "Those who forget their past are destined to repeat it".  We have heard it a thousand times but it is one of the fundamental statements about the value of history.  We are now in that phase of this discussion where we are looking at the value of history as a subject as something that pervades the values of a society.  For example, if the inhabitants of the former Yugoslavia had been taught proper history during the period after the Second World War it is not impossible that what happened when the state fell apart would have been different.  If they had been taught about the complex differences between the different kinds of people who inhabited that territory during that time, they may have had time to come to terms with the dreadful things that would happen to them, instead of something festering underneath and bursting out into a series of shocking atrocities which none of us will forget.  We also have to remember that violence is very much a part of the 20th century, which was a spectacularly violent century and of this country's own history, not least during the decade of what I would prefer to call centenaries rather than commemorations on which we have now embarked, where we need to reflect very seriously on what happened, why it happened and whether other things could have happened instead.  </p><p>  The elephant in the room is the question of why subjects are compulsory in curricula.  It is for two reasons.  Society has decided that those subjects are what we call core subjects that are necessary for the fundamental and basic education of any student.  I know that when I studied at secondary school in the distant past if, at the age of 12, I had been offered the opportunity not to study any further mathematics I would have grasped it with both hands.  I hated and was no good at it.  I was lucky to have good teachers.  I scraped a pass in the leaving certificate and, as a result, I can read bank statements and back a few horses every now and again if I have to, and I can manipulate numbers.  If I had that choice at the age of 12 I would certainly not have taken mathematics.  That is why it is compulsory.  Everybody must have a basic mathematical education.  I would imagine that quite a number of students today, sadly, would not rush to study the Irish language at the age of 12.  I am devoted to the Irish language, as are many members of the committee, but sadly, students may not take it as a subject they would wish to pursue if given the choice.  </p><p>  English is the language that we speak in this country.  It is has got a fantastic literature behind it, as does Irish.  Is it possible that people might decide that Shakespeare is not for them?  Why have we decided that the discipline that relates to the complicated, interesting, joyful, savage past that this and other countries have experienced is something that is disposable when those basic subjects are not seen as disposable?  That is a fundamental question.  I imagine that geographers could ask the same question and with a great deal of justice.  These are the subjects that deal with time and space - two of the things that every human being has a right to know about.  It seems to me to be a fundamental category error to exclude them from a compulsory regime.  We have heard much about the terrible reduction in numbers studying history, from 53,000 in the junior certificate down to 11,000 in the leaving certificate, if I heard Ms Breda Naughton correctly.</p><p>  History is a discursive subject; it requires reading and writing.  It is not necessarily something that fits naturally into the modern age of instant information, although many teachers spend much of their time trying to track the Wikipedia cut and paste that has emerged in the essays of their students and advising them not to follow that route.  My business is primary sources.  Mr. Kevin McCarthy was very eloquent on the fact that primary sources have only recently come into view not only at second level but at third level.  Professor Diarmaid Ferriter would have been one of the pioneers of ensuring that documents are available to people in a popular format.  In order that I do not go on for too long I will give two examples of what they can do for students. One of the most interesting museums in Ireland is Strokestown House museum, which investigates the Great Famine in that area.  It has an outstanding display on the assassination of Major Denis Mahon, the landlord who lived in Strokestown at the time.  It appears to be universally agreed that he was a bad landlord, being cruel to his tenants and carrying out major evictions.  The museum has a series of documents which gives one completely different perspectives on his murder, some Major Mahon's family, some from his tenants, some from the police, all giving a different shade of opinion, none of which is conclusive. </p> <p> One of the great virtues of studying the primary sources of history, which is what it comes down to and which is hugely foregrounded in the new leaving certificate curriculum, is that one learns to evaluate different kinds of evidence, something that is altogether necessary in an era when we are getting vast amounts of information coming at us, often from deliberately poorly-informed sources, including the tabloid press and the dreadful material on the Internet.  There is not much quality material coming at people in a way they can grasp.  This is the opportunity for people, before they lose the chance to do it at all, to learn how to evaluate that material in some way or another and to seek better material if they need to.</p><p> I had the privilege of putting the 1901 and 1911 censuses online free of charge.  I plead that if there is any request to start charging for that resource then we should resist it.  This is one of the great things we have in our country now.  It is available to the entire population and it overcomes many of the class issues that we have discussed at length today.  Secondary school students are using that resource all the time to examine their local areas, the main streets in their towns and not only their family history but the extended history of neighbours and so on in any given area.  They are developing all the basic skills that one needs to be a historian.  These come from reading that rather simple but nevertheless interesting primary source.  The resource is teaching them things about, for example, compassion.  When one examines the census records for Dublin city in 1911 one sees vast levels of child mortality.  Women bore 13 children but only six survived.  This gives one empathy with people in the past which is difficult to come by any other way.  I am Pollyanna-ish enough to believe and hope that it affects people's ideas about poverty in the present as well.  That would be a good outcome.  It also teaches them that there are not always answers to the questions that we ask of the past.  There is no seamless narrative that follows its way through.  History is a bumpy ride.  There are sources for some things and not others.</p><p> Mr. McCarthy referred to the difference between political history, sets of dates and so on and social history, which has blossomed greatly in this country in the past 30 years.  It deals with the interior experience of what it is like to be alive at a particular time.  We get much more through memoirs and novels and so on than we do through history, but history is a significant part of giving us that information.  Do we really want to live in a country where many children over the age of 12 years known nothing about history?  If they know anything about Michael Collins and &Eacute;amon de Valera it is because they might have seen, by chance, Neil Jordan's bad movie on television.  Is that good enough?  We still have serious interrogation to do in this country on our history.  Not all the primary sources are available but we hope this decade will lead to a great improvement in this regard and that we will be able to interrogate and reflect properly.  Let us not shut off the opportunity.  It should not be a choice.  It should be an opportunity for our young people to learn about their past and to benefit from the experience of it.  Let us not repeat slavishly the mistakes made by our next-door neighbours just as they are learning to remedy them.  They are about to put history back on the curriculum in Britain as a compulsory subject and we are about to take it out.  What is that about?</p></speech>

I would know little about theatre, nothing about literature and I would know less about the poetry and drama of this country had it not been for history.  I see it as a remarkable part of our lives.  It should nearly be a compulsory subject, but I cannot really go that far.  It should be available as a core subject to every child in the country.  If I was to define it with my small sense of definition I would say it is the only way left to explain ourselves.  Many other ways do not have its truth.  It is literally the only way back and the only way to explain ourselves, who we are, what we are and how we are.  To take it out of the curriculum or confine it to discrete or short courses is not enough.  I have worked in university all my life and I know that even at a mature level short courses are not always the way to go, even with mature minds.  I do not believe they are the way to go with young minds.</p><p>  Let us consider this document, A Framework for Junior Cycle.  Numeracy and literacy are at the core of it but the Department has left out the third part of the trinity, that is, oralcy, which is not even mentioned in this document, nor are the arts or any of the defined arts.  It seems to have become learning in the same manner as taking television meals.  I fully agree with Senator Fidelma Healy Eames, who I rarely agree with in the Seanad.  Let us consider terms such as "appreciate", "respect", "value", "create", "critically interpret", "understand", "describe", "illustrate", "observe" and "evaluate".  I wonder whether we are talking about the Seanad when I think of these words.  Anyway, the Department of Education and Skills has made these terms into a convenient veil to lay over everything.  Subjects such as history and English have a right to have a reason for their existence under that veil and independent of that veil.  That is the major problem.  They are remarkably important subjects and great subjects with explanations of who, what and how we are.  To put them in any other category is to take them out of the definition of education and I am totally against that.  I believe the Department should reassess this document because in many respects it smacks of what may be termed "television meals education".</p></speech>

I never taught because even in 1986 when I qualified there seemed to be a move away from it.  There were few opportunities in Dublin to teach both subjects.  I was expected to move to some of the voluntary schools outside Dublin and at that stage my political career dictated that I would stay in Dublin.  Perhaps it was a good thing.</p><p>  I was a product of Tony Gregory's teaching.  He sparked a great interest in history in people who otherwise would not have had an interest.  He used to hold a double class on a Friday during the leaving certificate years.  We never spoke about history or the curriculum but he managed to link what was happening in politics and with his career at the time, with Dublin and with Ireland to history in a way that most of us did not understand back then.  It was a joy that we appreciated afterwards.  I can guarantee that no one in that class or the other classes he taught failed at history.  Unknown to themselves the students were learning the true value of history and how it is vital for society.</p><p>  History is one of those subjects that creates the citizen not the consumer.  As people in a republic we should remember that much when we are formulating an education system.  There are certain core subjects which set out our values.  If many people had their way there would only be two core subjects, that is, English and mathematics.  Irish would have been jettisoned many years ago to one of those small topics to which one could dip in.  The attitude is that if one wants to look at Irish one goes to the museum.  It was only as a result of people fighting the attitudes that prevailed that we have made progress.  The argument was that the approach was failing and that compulsion does not work.  However, compulsion does not work if the resources are not matching or if the teachers are not enthused about it.  In such cases it becomes nothing but a chore for young people.  The same could be said of any of the subjects in the junior certificate cycle.  I often say that if it is not broken then we should not fix it but there is no point in fixing it if it will not work.  In this case I firmly believe that this proposal is detrimental to the teaching of history at leaving certificate level in future and at university level as well.  We need to reconsider it.</p><p>  Ms Naughton remarked that we should look at the model for English being developed at the moment.</p></speech>

Therefore, one cannot look at something that will have a higher standing in future in the junior certificate to see where the history syllabus or the teaching of history will be.  I believe the Department representatives should reconsider that.  There are problems with history in the junior cycle.  There are problems in many subjects in the junior cycle and they have nothing to do with the teachers or pupils.  They are to do with the fact that there is a pupil-teacher ratio which is increasing and there are fewer resources.</p> <p>Even in this day and age not every school is computerised so cannot fully use the tools that are now available, whether Wikipedia or all of the original documentation that is online and can be interrogated.  Major moves and investments have been made in this direction over the years but not on the scale required.  If we want to build a society that is well grounded in education that should be done across a range of subjects rather than concentrate on three or four to the detriment of others.  People have said of Ireland that it is great to see pupils who do the leaving certificate having a range of subjects and not concentrating on three or four or fewer subjects as happens in other jurisdictions.  That stands the test of time.  I am an advocate of a greater range and more core subjects.  The core subjects in the past were history, geography, Irish, English and maths.  Civics as it was in the past has disappeared but has come back in a different form and we ensure that people are healthy and fit.  Without a healthy body one will not have a healthy mind.  I urge the Department to reconsider this immediately before the damage is done because once we start this we will end up with the situation that exists in Britain and elsewhere that will take generations to undo because there will not be the people to teach the subject.</p><p> On another subject, Senator Mac Conghail mentioned schools offering history, and others have mentioned the difference between geography and history but one of the reasons is the alternative to history in the leaving certificate course.  That choice is often made by management but if it is tied to French, for example, and French is a requirement for college, people are going to opt for that.  In other cases it is not offered at all.  My son is doing his junior certificate today and the other son is in fifth year and history is not even offered as a subject to him.  I am lucky enough that I have encouraged him to take it and he is willing to do that but he has said that he will drop one of the other subjects that he is doing in school as a compromise.  It is crazy in this day and age that in the school in question it is not offered in any of the three final years.  It is the school that Senator Mac Conghail mentioned.  It is sad and a bad reflection on the school.  I am enthusiastic about history and can go on and on about it.  I am not going to and I am not even going to tie it to the decade of centenaries.  That is not why we need history now.  We need it because it defines who we are and in future it will be more important as the world changes that we have our own identity and understand where that came from.</p></speech>

I may be the youngest person in the room.  This day 14 years ago I would have been starting into my special topic with everything flying everywhere - that was a major operation.  At the time we were a relatively small class doing leaving certificate history, but not because of the teacher.  On the contrary, we had a model teacher who brought history to life in the classroom and instilled in all of us a great enthusiasm for it, a fantastic teacher.  The feeling at the beginning of fourth year, as it was in our school, was that it was too difficult to get points in history for the amount of time we would have to put into it.  I welcome the fact that the exam has become less onerous since I did it in 1999.  The exam was a race against time.  One had a special topic and four essays to complete in a ridiculously short space of time.  It is a vicious circle because when I was in second year at NUI Galway many students who had an interest in history and were thinking of becoming teachers did not take history for second and third year because they felt that the teaching positions were not there as too few students were taking it at leaving certificate level.  The saddest point is that I recall sitting in Professor Gearoid O'Tuathaigh's classes and seeing people who were not taking history in second and third year coming in to sit at the back of the lecture hall.  They very much enjoyed the lectures but were not part of the class.  Usually it is the other way around, people do not show up at all.</p></speech>

The perception remains that it is too difficult to get points.  If there is to be further debate on this issue we should get the perspectives of younger people, those who are sitting the exams or are in the system and find out why there is not a bigger take-up or an enthusiasm to go with history where it is being provided.  To what extent was that done in the preparation of this document?</p><p>  Ms Crowe's reference to the teaching of history under Tito in the former Yugoslavia and the disaster in the post-Tito period was very interesting.  We probably do not need to go that far to see an example of the same pattern.  There are many in this country whose knowledge of the period between 1913 and 1923 was the romanticised version they heard in primary school.  They had no further education on that period.  Perhaps events would have been different on this island if more people had learned the skills of analysis and had a more comprehensive history of our own affairs.  In formulating policy and the discussion here about the future junior certificate course, maybe we have to learn from our own history too.  We need to have further debate on this.</p><p>  The concerns of the history teachers need to be taken very seriously because we have seen time and again that where history is not learned, remembered or is systematically changed there can be disastrous consequences, for example, what is happening now in the UK.  There are so many other examples.  When we were building high rise buildings, high density accommodation here in the 1960s the UK had stopped doing that because it saw that was the wrong way to go.  When railway preservation societies were relaying tracks in the UK in the 1960s and 1970s we were ripping them up here.  This is an area in which it is far too serious to make a similar mistake.  I would call for a rethink of this, further analysis and discussion.  If there has not been widespread consultation with the students who are using the system that should happen too.  Let us learn from them.  Let us find out why there is a fall off and lack of interest and try to address that too.</p></speech>

With regard to Professor Ferriter's point about the importance of knowing the historical context of decisions we make now, Deputies &Oacute; Snodaigh and &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and Senator Mac Conghail and I were at the Constitutional Convention.  When people talk about PR-STV they tend to present it as if it was the odd and eccentric choice.</p> <p>I read Proinsias Mac Aonghusa's book before the weekend.  It was a radical choice at the time to pick PR-STV.  It is good to know the context of the decision and how it has helped to bring minorities into politics.  </p><p> On subject choices, school timetabling is a big factor.  When I was in school three decades ago, if one wanted to study chemistry one could not study history.  I did not study history because my parents wanted me to study science at leaving certificate level, and rightly so.  By studying history for my degree, I defied expectations.  Is there any compromise on this issue with the History Teachers' Association of Ireland in regard to what the Department and National Curriculum Council have decided?</p></speech>

We have a dilemma.  The history teachers of Ireland seem to want one thing.  Could the Department say what it has achieved from this session in terms of how we can marry the different concerns? </p><p>  I refer to the statements of learning.  Can we broaden the number of statements through which history can be achieved?  Who decides that?  Is it the principal or the Department?  It will be critical.  If we cannot offer history as a means to fulfil statements of learning, principals will not set up classes, as it will not be practical. </p><p>  Deputies &Oacute; Snodaigh and Griffin are correct.  It depends on what subject history is being offered against, such as French.  A science subject is now almost mandatory at junior certificate level.  Given where the jobs are, it is also understood that is the case at leaving certificate level.  I want to hear from the Department.  </p><p>  Have history teachers worked with the primary sector?  There is a very exciting revised curriculum at primary level.  The understanding of history is being communicated through documents, newspapers and the census.  I compliment Ms Crowe; I did not know she was responsible for making the census accessible.  It is not just students but ordinary citizens who are finding history exciting and learning about their ancestry. </p><p>  Are we working with primary teachers?  Unless the Department is a little more flexible in taking concerns on board, we will have to do a massive sales and marketing job on history.  It is a subject that is about defining who we are.  As Senator O'Donnell said, it explains who we are to ourselves.  We will lose all of that.  That is the value of citizenship.  Let us not have that as our legacy.</p></speech>

We are arguing the point in regard to its document.  If it argues that history is not a core, cohesive and central subject, we have nowhere to go.  One has to argue it as a core, great, centralised, cohesive, extraordinary and major thought process in the education of young minds.  If one argues that it is outside that, then we are only arguing about whether it should compete with other subjects.  That cannot be the argument, because it brings us somewhere else.  It has to be brought back to the centrality of what it is cohesively, internally and expertly.  One cannot argue it with a veil of appreciation and a value system that one could throw over any subject.  One has to bring it back in centrally.  If that is not done, there will be a piecemeal approach, and it may be done in front of the television as a short course, which I am against for young people.</p></speech>

We are arguing that this framework document will break the cycle.  Even though only 52% of schools legally have to do history, many are amalgamated secondary schools which had history and geography as a core part of their culture.  That is why large numbers are still doing it at junior certificate level.  The framework document is breaking that cycle and creating a <i>tabula rasa</i>.</p><p>  Senior cycle students take seven subjects for the leaving certificate, with English, Irish, maths, and a modern language at the core.  They have to choose three subjects from a vast range.  At 15 or 16 years of age students are moving into different interest areas, such as science or business studies.  They only have three optional subjects and the fact that there is a large drop in the number studying history is not surprising.  </p><p>  We take the point that history is not seen as being as popular as geography.  More students achieve very high grades, such as A grades, in history, but geography is perceived as being easier to pass or to get a C at higher level because it does not involve a lot of reading.  Although the junior certificate curriculum is very interesting, it is overloaded.  History teachers participated in a reform document about ten years ago but it is sitting on a shelf, ironically, because of the new framework document.  We could be teaching a better junior certificate today but it was shelved several years ago.  It was proposed that the course be shortened to incorporate more skills. </p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in will be interested to know that junior certificate students learn about TB in Ireland in the 1940s.  P&aacute;draig Pearse has not been eclipsed in the junior certificate syllabus.  For students who did not have the benefit, unlike Deputy Griffin, of Gear&oacute;id &Oacute; Tuathaigh's teaching in Galway, people might be interested to know that there is an excellent lecture by him on why history matters on our website.  The committee might enjoy it; there is a clip in the PowerPoint presentation we submitted.  </p><p>  The 24 statements ensure that everybody has to have some element of history, but it will not necessarily be a full subject.  It could be a short course.  In articles he has written, the Minister said students in Wexford could study the 1798 rebellion and Battle of Vinegar Hill and students in Meath could study the Norman invasion and Trim Castle.  That is not a full historical education.  A learning experience could be involved, such as a heritage week or fortnight in a school or a museum visit.  Schools could say they are fulfilling the statement of learning by having a learning experience or a short course, but it may not be a full subject. </p><p>  As people said, it could be offered as a full subject or a short course but students might not choose it.  The flexibility of the document is the problem.  We could have brilliant history courses in some schools, but it allows for some students not to have that opportunity or not to choose the opportunity.  The consultation with young people found that they enjoyed learning history but they only knew that because they had had the opportunity to do so.  If they were not studying it they would not know they enjoyed it.  I return to our first point on entitlement.  Every young person Ireland is entitled to an historical education.</p></speech>

Senator O'Donnell was worried about arts and creativity in the framework document.  I would like to bring to her attention the fact that there are eight principles in the framework, one of which is creativity and innovation, and eight key skills in the framework, one of which is being creative.

We are introducing it because we know that the current programme for students is not fit for purpose.  Many students disengage from learning even as early as second year.  Many have their options cut out.  We are talking about ensuring students have a broad and balanced learning experience.  Many students do not study science and there are a number of who do not experience the arts during junior cycle.  As matters stand, some might not even have the opportunity to study a modern language.  It is not only history that is in question but other disciplines also, as referred to by Mr. Hanlon and Mr. Ferriter.  It is important that in the new junior cycle programme there be an opportunity to develop the skills necessary for further study, for learning now and in the future, and developing lifeskills.  As Ms Naughton pointed out, literacy, numeracy and the other key skills underpin the new junior cycle programme, skills such as managing oneself, staying well, communicating, being creative, working with others, managing information and thinking.</p></speech>

They will note also that all key aspects of language learning are captured in terms of communication, in all its form; using language, in all its forms; and the functional aspects of language.  It is a very robust programme of learning, even though is has not yet been finalised and it represents an advancement on the current syllabus.  The same will apply to the other subject areas as the syllabuses are revised.  There will be greater clarity about learning outcomes and an opportunity to introduce new modes of learning and assessment.

The point she made about context in terms of the Constitutional Convention must be the starting point for our understanding of so much.  If we consider what we have been getting to grips with in this country in recent times, all of the reports and revelations we have had and all of the debates we are going to continue to have, there must be substantial historical knowledge available to people to understand and contextualise these debates.  We have heard very interesting contributions here by a number of Senators.  If we are going to talk about Seanad reform or the future of the Seanad, we need to know from where it came.</p></speech>

It is true of all of these pressing issues that we debate, whether it be political reform or confronting difficult aspects of the past.  The point the Chairman made in that context is very important.</p><p>  The other issue the Chairman raised was the question of compromise.  I have crossed swords publicly with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, on this issue and have no doubt about his personal interest in history, but he reassured me and others that as a result of this framework document - to use his words - "history will be embedded in the very heart of the curriculum."  I  have not heard anything today that leads me to believe that statement that history will be embedded in the very heart of the curriculum.  I have heard a lot the words "could", "hopefully" and "is expected".  When we talk about a possible compromise, we need to know what it will involve because it seems as if there is no clarity as to what this will be in practice.  That, for me, is a huge concern because it could result ultimately in there being vagueness such that there will not be the possibility for history to breathe as a subject.</p></speech>

I agree with him.  If history is put up against the only foreign language on offer which is needed for matriculation purposes, it is not good.  Every history inspector in Ireland would say this.  We encourage offering an open choice to students and as much guidance and flexibility as possible, even though the latter may be considered a dirty word in some contexts at times.  It is not good for history to form part of a tied option against the only foreign language on offer.  I am also concerned when I see it up against some of the other subjects on offer.  It may end up being the case that students with more third level ambition will move in a certain direction, depending on the subject.  We strongly advocate offering an open choice to students and not linking history particularly with a subject that forms a requirement for third level.</p><p>  The second point that struck me was the reference to history which Ms Crowley has answered better than I can.  There is a sense that history is too difficult at senior cycle level and that it is too hard a subject in which to get high points, but the statistics do not bear this out.  If one compares the results of the performance of students in leaving certificate history with that in other subjects - I will not mention a subject as I do not want to be shot down by others - the percentage of A1s, A2s and even B1s stands in comparison with that for any other subject.  That is a tribute to the students, the teachers and the leaving certificate syllabus to a certain extent.</p><p>  Regarding the issue of the statements, as a historian, I prefer to use concrete words such as "happened in the past" rather than "what might happen", but we have to be a little circumspect in that the development of a history specification will not start for a while.  I cannot say what exactly will happen.  If we look at the framework and the statements of learning and what links with what, the heading is subjects, short courses and other learning experiences that could contribute.  That is the Department's wording.</p></speech>

It could be a case of dealing with the matter subject by subject.  I accept we are just dealing with history.  I am still not convinced by a one-size-fits-all approach to history.  This session has not convinced me otherwise.</p><p>  I am not a committee member but I wish to make a modest proposal that we invite someone involved with the curriculum in the United Kingdom which now seems to be endorsing it as more of a core subject in the curriculum to see what the experience is there because that information might be of help to the Minister in assessing how history is situated within the curriculum.</p></speech>

That is the type of board of studies, which is what it is called now, that will be brought together.  Much consultation goes on.  A paper will be produced before the process starts setting out what they consider history to be.  That will be taken on board by the expert group and out of that will come another document.

I refer to a Department of Education and Skills presentation for the information of principals and schools.  It was an in-service the Department gave in the spring of this year.  The final slide, as to how one would implement the new framework document said that one would have to have the three core subjects &ndash; English, Irish and maths &ndash; and it suggested that science should be core.  In terms of the knowledge economy I can see science being a core subject and then it gave the options.  One could have history, French or business.  If one requires a modern language for university entrance then the parent of a first-year student will say he or she must take French.  Someone else could say that business is important.  We are also up against the utilitarian nature of education, that subjects will be seen as useful.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh referred to education for citizenship as opposed to for use or for being a consumer.  The Department in one of its own presentations to school principals and deputy principals has offered the example that history could be put against French or business.  For me in a nutshell, that is the problem with the new document.</p></speech>

I have argued that history should be a core subject and the retort was that one must make a decision as there are 21 subjects.  I do not think anybody in this committee or in the real world would suggest that Chinese would be a core subject in Ireland.  There is a range of subjects that one could whittle down into core subjects and secondary subjects for the junior certificate and then society would have to take a decision on which should be core subjects.  The decision should be taken by society rather than the Department on where we want to go as a country in the future.  The argument was whether one wants citizens or consumers.  We have not had the debate, yet we are being forced by changes within the curriculum to accept that is what will happen anyway.  The Minister must be asked to reflect again on the issue and to consider having a bigger range of core subjects for the junior certificate.  My view is that the same should be true of the leaving certificate as well but that discussion is for another day.  At the very least there should be a grounding across as broad a range of core subjects as possible and then one could dip in and out to give a flavour of different subjects so that one could encourage children to expand on their interests because they will have different options once they go to university.</p></speech>

I propose that the committee should write to the Minister with a copy of the minutes of the meeting and outline our concerns on the issue.  We should ask him to re-examine the situation.  There seems to be unanimous concern among committee members and that should be conveyed to the Minister.</p></speech>

First, the committee is entitled to invite a visitor from the United Kingdom, but there are different systems depending on whether one is in Scotland or England, and it will get a very different viewpoint on the way history should be structured.  That is just a matter of information.</p><p>  Second, by way of explanation, when I refer to statements of learning, I am not trying to be vague in any way.  They are the things around which the specific history syllabus will be built.  Nobody is telling the committee that history will be a core subject for every student.  That cannot happen in the framework as it is constructed, but it is tremendously important that those statements of learning are factored into the development of the history specifications.  I do not know the reason the syllabus is no longer being used either, but it is tremendously important that as many as possible of the significant statements of learning are factored into history because it is a wide-ranging, all-embracing and valuable subject, and that must be reinforced by the statements of learning.  They may not necessarily be the ones in the framework because it was only a tentative suggestion that was made.</p></speech>

We have very good history teachers in the system.  It has to be acknowledged that 90% of the students are taking history at junior cycle.  However, the international experience has shown us that it is important that we give schools the autonomy and the flexibility to choose the programmes most relevant to their young people.  It would be very difficult for schools not to teach history to the majority of their students because, first, they have these hugely passionate history teachers but, second, it is embedded in the statements of learning.  However, because of the statements of learning, it will be a requirement now of all schools to provide a history experience and we hope, and I am sorry to use the word "hope", that the majority of schools will take history as a subject.  From a schools perspective, they have to make decisions based on the identification of the needs of their young people and also the teaching resources available for them.</p></speech>

I would suggest that someone like Tristram Hunt, who is both an MP and a historian and who chaired the Ofsted committee of inquiry into this precise subject in 2011, would be a useful person to invite.  We will certainly talk to the History Teachers Association of Ireland and find a way to get him here.  I think that would be very helpful.</p></speech>

She used the word &quot;hope&quot;.  Our <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> is that history will not have to be offered as an experience for a 12 year old entering the secondary school system.  I agree with the sentiments expressed from the other side of the room.  There is a touch of cultural vandalism in this in terms of our own history.  I am not fluent in our native language.  My father was but I am not.  We use history in this country to construct our identity.  It gives us the apparatus of understanding who and why we are.  We are unique in that we have lost our linguistic identity.</p><p>  In terms of reference to best practice internationally, we have researched that.  Every system in Europe, with the exception of Albania and England, requires students to take history to 15 years of age at least.  We have spoken a great deal in recent years about the Finnish education system.  In its upper education second level curriculum, students must take history to 18 years of age.  It is compulsory in Finland.  We are talking about international best practice but it strikes me that we are seeking to deviate from international best practice.</p><p>  I want to express, on behalf of my association, our thanks to the committee for inviting us to come before it.  The debate has been very interesting.  My feeling from this meeting is that the Senators and the Deputies are more supportive of our position than that of the Department.  I would be behind the committee in whatever it can do in this issue.  If it can propose a Seanad debate, while there is still a Seanad, please do.  If it can propose a D&aacute;il debate, please do.  We would ask the members, as we are asking the witnesses from the Department, to revisit this document.  It must be revisited.  In terms of the various statements of learning, it strikes me that several subjects could be put into a core which could meet those statements of learning.</p><p>  I thank the committee.  We are passionate about this issue.  As Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh stated, this is about citizenship and what it is to be Irish.  We believe it is the birthright of every Irish citizen to experience a study of history as they go through the school system.</p></speech>

Apologies have been received from Senators Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Ned O'Sullivan.</p><p>  During the first part of our meeting we will be discussing the nomination of Mr. Conor Skehan as chairman designate of the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency.  I welcome Mr. Skehan to the meeting.</p><p>  I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also draw their attention to the fact that their opening statements and other documents supplied to the committee will be published on the committee's website following this meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise nor make charges against a person outside the Houses, or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  The Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency manages the transfer of land to local authorities under the land aggregation scheme.  It also sources properties under the social housing leasing initiative.  I am interested in hearing Mr. Skehan's views on the scheme and initiatives and how he proposes to develop or amend those during his tenure in office.  I note from the agency's website that its vision is to make a real difference to people's lives by promoting sustainable communities.  Mr. Skehan might elaborate on that vision, which is an issue close to the hearts of many members of the committee.  The development of sustainable communities is an issue close to all of our hearts.  I now invite Mr. Skehan to make his presentation.</p></speech>

I am new to the agency, which is also relatively new and is a combination of previously existing agencies.  From what I have learned during the past month, the agency has already established a clear and valued role in the provision of a more sustainable housing system.  Officials from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government have told me it is the go-to agency for them.</p><p>  Following investigation, I have determined that the agency has an extremely well-articulated system of values that guide its delivery and is committed to service and accountability.  If my nomination is confirmed, I will be proud to be associated with those values.  I have also looked at the agency's governance system and found that there are good governance systems in place which establish clear evidence-based objectives in the fields of promotion and delivery of housing and innovation, supporting management in good housing practice and providing policy advice on research on housing.  The agency is committed to a high level of performance.  Everything I have seen to date suggests that this is the type of organisation which, if my nomination is confirmed, I would be proud to work with.  I would see my role principally as ensuring the agency receives the support and resources necessary to achieve these objectives.</p><p>  The approach I propose to take will be dominated by the lessons I have learned from the previous roles entrusted to me by various Governments.  Those lessons include, to listen to stakeholders and to take an ears open and mouth shut approach in the first instance.</p></speech>

Our economy has been almost ruined by the replacement of home making by house building.  The housing agency will play a role in ensuring this set of circumstances does not recur.  Through analysis and expert, early, honest and public advice the agency has the potential to help ensure we do not again make the mistakes that cost all of us dearly.  Through the encouragement of prudence, compassion, fairness and foresight, the agency can also ensure all households have access to good quality housing appropriate to their household circumstances and in the particular community of their choice.  The agency has a role to play in making this happen.  If my nomination is confirmed, I will be proud to contribute to that.</p><p>  I will take questions or advice from members.</p></speech>

It was established in 2010, mainly to work with and support local authorities, housing bodies and the Department in the delivery of housing and housing services, and to do so principally through facilitating them with their housing functions, advising on policy and policy implementation.  The agency also carries out research on housing policy and does so with scarce resources.  It includes a number of technical experts who provide technical and regeneration services and also underwrite loans for house purchases.  The agency currently comprises 33 staff representative of the core of expertise inherited from the previous agencies.  It recently moved to a new premises.</p><p>  As I said earlier, I was pleased to learn from my initial contact with the agency that it has in place good, well-thought out governance, a clearly articulated set of values and a strategic plan.  Essentially, it is a fantastic vehicle with the engine running and the door open.  On a more detailed level, I have examined current levels of activity at the agency and can go into that in more detail at this point, if the Deputy wishes.</p></speech>

It has been involved with NAMA through the special purpose vehicle, the National Asset Residential Property Services Limited, NARPS.  It is also engaged in the land aggregation scheme which is examining lands from that source.  It is providing advice on the rent framework for the local authorities, providing current updates of housing need assessments, and has updated its housing manual, which is widely used by practitioners in this area.  It also provides assistance in regard to housing assistance payments and loan underwriting services.</p><p>  In terms of technical work, the agency includes a team of architects, planners and quantity surveyors who are involved in regeneration and refurbishment projects, surveys, planning, studies and related work.  It has a small number of extremely well-regarded researchers in the field who are currently working on fields as diverse as Traveller accommodation, homelessness and housing for people with a disability.</p> <p>They are providing research and specific reports on the rental index for the Private Residential Tenancies Board and a review of shared-ownership schemes.  It is a busy agency into the middle of which I am being dropped.  It is a whirlwind of activity, which is constantly being referred to by the Department and whose advice is constantly sought.  It is a real privilege to have the potential to be involved in an agency like that.</p></speech>

We know each other from the preparation of the Kildare county development plan, on the environmental aspects of which he advised not so long ago.  I know he is a sceptic on climate change which is an obvious place to start on the question of what is his concept of a sustainable community.  Clearly, sustainability can be environmental, social and economic.  I see things like linking land use and transportation planning with greening as incredibly important to sustainable communities.  I would welcome Mr. Skehan's thoughts on that.  I have been put in the anti-camp over the years and labelled as being against all development, which is not, of course, the case, on foot of my views on planning communities as opposed to building willy-nilly.  I make no apology for having taken that approach over decades at this stage.  It is an issue that is important to me in terms of the direction the housing agency will be taking.  Mr. Skehan has a long-term connection with Fine Gael as an adviser.  I presume that has been an entirely professional relationship and that he is not a member of the party.  My job is to undertake a bit of scrutiny, which is why I wanted to refer to that.</p><p>  The agency will clearly have a relationship with NAMA.  One of the concerns we have is that there is quite a high vacancy rate around the country, which is not necessarily matched to those areas in which housing is needed.  How does Mr. Skehan perceive that being dealt with?  From a planning perspective and county development plans, does Mr. Skehan have guidance in terms of what should be included to green communities?  The greening question is important given that Mr. Skehan has differing views from me on the climate change issue.  There are other issues, including advice on shared-ownership loans and rent supplement, which it will probably be more appropriate to address after Mr. Skehan has spent time in the agency.  I would welcome Mr. Skehan providing the committee with a broad view on where he is coming from.</p></speech>

If there is anything the agency can do to come back with information to the committee, we would be more than happy to make ourselves available.</p><p>  Deputy Murphy has got to the heart of the issue on housing.  Traditionally, there has been a tragedy in so many sectors to do with our built environment where things are looked at in silos rather than horizontally.  These include the issues to which Deputy Murphy referred in regard to sustainable communities and the location of houses.  Their planning and connection to shops and bus routes are as important as the provision of the bricks and mortar and the roofs over people's heads.  Real sustainable development is about the totality of the energy commitments someone makes because of his or her choice of where to live.  In Deputy Murphy's own constituency there is plenty of difficult-to-reach newly built housing estates which are well outside the bounds of existing settlements.  We now see that people are committed to highly unsustainable modes of transportation to get themselves to basic facilities.  In turn, those issues have deep, long-term implications as communities age and have less access to mobility.  A deep part of moving forward with good planning of housing is to consider the real life cycle, not just of a house but of its residents.  We must ensure that people's homes are fit for purpose for the entire cycle of their lives.  We discovered in work I participated in at the DIT that the majority of people who are over 45 years of age are already living in the house in which they are going to die.  Very few of those people when they bought their house had considerations other than how near they might be to their children's schools.  In fact, they should have been thinking about how dependent or independent they might be in the absence of a car in regard to social services etc., when driving became more difficult.</p><p>  On vacancies and the potential role of NAMA, I have been briefed that there is detailed interaction taking place between the agency and NAMA to examine those issues, including land banks.  The papers being prepared for board meetings show that detailed, ongoing and lively discussions are taking place on those issues.  The core issue with NAMA, as Deputy Murphy well knows, is that the overbuilding of housing took place where there was never going to be any demand.  Those parts of the country east of the Deputy's constituency are areas where the greatest demand already exists.  We are already seeing through increased rents housing pressures building up in east Leinster, where 50% of the population lives.  There are no broad-brush solutions that can be applied equally across the State.  A great deal of prudence and evidence is going to be required moving forward.  One of the delights of the housing agency is that it comes closest to the type of thing we see in governance in Britain where think tanks advise on policy on the basis of real evidence.  It is the closest equivalent I have come across here to that type of independent, evidence-based, research-led facility being available to the Government.  Hopefully, it will make a contribution towards helping to avoid the mistakes we have made in the past.  Perhaps we will have a more sensible approach to housing in the future.</p><p>  The intimidating thing about the agency is that it is full of people who know a great deal more about housing than me and who probably always will.  All I can do is be the conductor of an orchestra which includes a group of very bright, talented and hard-working people.  If I can do that, I will be doing my job well.</p></speech>

It is early days for him and the new agency but he will agree that it will play an important role on oversight, independent advice and co-ordination of housing and sustainability policy.</p><p>  Mr. Skehan mentioned planning earlier and much of what happens now will be retrospective and reactive to the bad planning that occurred nationally.  Mr. Skehan is charged with bringing forward advice based on research on how to make communities more sustainable, which is very important.  He will liaise with other agencies, including the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and others, which have done good ground work.  It is important the work which has been done is co-ordinated in a consistent fashion.  For example, there is a great deal of inconsistency across local authorities on housing policy.  While I recognise that there are varying demands on different local authorities in areas like Traveller accommodation and homelessness, I ask Mr. Skehan to examine the existing housing stock of all local authorities in some research document at some stage.  What is the age of that stock, how sustainable is it and how amenable is it to future needs in the context of projected demographic change?  There are new social demands on local authorities, which are not building houses anymore.  There will be an important role for the agency in that context to bring forward advice on how to meet those demands.</p><p>  There has been a great deal of inconsistency and a failure to develop work on housing, transport, education and sustainable living within communities.  The agency might have a role to play in developing shared solutions across different agencies.  One thinks of energy and renewable technology, about which we speak a great deal now.</p> <p>In the midlands alone, there are proposals for new wind farms but they are proving quite controversial.  There are also ancient or old hydropower schemes.  In Portlaw in County Waterford, more than 300 kW of power was generated in my community in the 1800s.  Zero kilowatts of hydropower are being generated in that community today.  They are the kind of areas this committee and the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency need to look at to resurrect these technologies that were there before and to integrate them into communities again.</p><p> I welcome Mr. Skehan's appointment and wish him well.  I look forward to him coming back when he has had a chance to put his feet under the table, do some research and bring forward tangible advice of which we can all take account.</p></speech>

One of the key things I spoke about at the start was listening.  The role of the chair is to listen.  Obviously, the agency has a role in advising, but part of that advice is to listen to and gather advice from the likes of this committee, so I would very much like the opportunity to come back in future to receive challenges in particular.  Returning to the last set of issues raised by the Deputy, for example, the new social demands relating to renewable energy, it is very appropriate that something like the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency is a focus for challenges for public representatives to demand better, demand more and demand innovation.  That is the type of relationship I would like to foster between the agency and public representatives of all types.  If there is any opportunity in the future to come back when I have more experience, to take some advice and soundings and to be open to challenges, I would welcome it.  That is a very important part of ensuring the agency is accountable and effective.</p></speech>

I know a planning Bill relating to the Mahon tribunal has been on the cl&aacute;r of the D&aacute;il for quite some time.  Would it be beneficial if this planning Bill were brought forward and dealt with?  It would be helpful to Mr. Skehan in his new role.</p><p>  There is the fiasco of housing developments being pulled down, for example, Gleann Riada in my county of Longford.  I am sure Mr. Skehan is aware of it.  This estate was badly constructed and has cost this State a huge amount of money.  Unfinished estates throughout the country are being refurbished, which is costing the State a fortune.  I know NAMA is involved and has said it will purchase more than 2,000 properties for social housing, but it is important that people are vetted for those houses.  Ordinary decent people have purchased houses in housing estates and some agencies responsible for housing have purchased houses alongside those houses and put in the wrong type of clientele, thus forcing out of those estates people who have paid a considerable price for their houses.  This is a significant problem in some parts of the country and is something we do not want to see happen.  Yesterday, I heard of a situation in County Westmeath where a young man on a kidney dialysis machine who bought a house and is paying back a huge mortgage was forced out of his home by thugs on either side of him.  He had to rent private accommodation in another village.  We do not want to see this type of carry-on continuing.</p><p>  The vetting of people for social housing needs to be looked at because it is unfair on the ordinary decent person who purchased their house and is in dire straits paying back the mortgage.  I know it is a small percentage of people who are causing havoc but this type of carry-on must be eliminated and I would like to see a new approach used in vetting people who are homeless.  It is the same people, and it is only a few, who move into an estate and wreck their accommodation.  At the stroke of a pen, officers within a local authority or agency move them on to another part of the country to create havoc in that area.</p></speech>

I learned the hard way from my work with the Peatlands Council that there is the potential to communicate with people on the ground, come across real experiences day to day and ensure the work that is being done both by officials and agencies is required.  It would be part of the remit I would give myself, which is to make myself available to the likes of public representatives to hear from them, ideally on the ground in their constituency.  There is no substitute for going to see the issues on the ground to make sure the agencies are addressing the issues experienced as major problems on the ground.  I welcome the opportunity to see at first hand the type of experience described by Deputy Bannon if the nomination is confirmed.</p></speech>

We gave some added information with photographs to illustrate the exemptions we are planning to make.  These proposals provide for changes to the planning exemptions contained in the 2001 planning regulations in a number of areas.  Section 4 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides that certain development is exempted from the requirement to obtain planning permission, mainly development by a local authority or the use of land for agriculture.  Section 4(4) of the Act allows the Minister to make regulations providing for further development to be exempt where he or she is of the opinion that by reason of the size, nature or limited effect on its surroundings, the carrying out of the development would not offend against principles of proper planning and sustainable development.</p><p>  It is important, regarding exempted development, to find the right balance between the right of the public to comment and input into decisions on developments that may affect them, and the necessity not to burden developers unduly by making them go through a consent process where this may not be necessary.  My Department therefore keeps the planning exemptions under review to seek to reduce avoidable administrative or regulatory burdens and to ensure they remain in alignment with key national policy objectives.  There are four amendments to the regulations proposed.  I will briefly outline the nature of each of the proposed exemptions.</p><p>  The first exemption is for charge points for electric vehicles.  Under the EU directive on renewable energy, each member state is required to ensure 10% of transport energy, excluding aviation and marine transport, comes from renewable sources by 2020.  Electric vehicles, EVs, are central to any plans for zero carbon emissions transportation systems.  In 2010, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources signed an agreement with the Electricity Supply Board, ESB, and Renault-Nissan to support and promote the roll-out of EVs in Ireland, with ESB committed to providing the necessary charging infrastructure.  Memoranda of understanding on a similar basis have also been signed with Toyota, Mitsubishi, and Peugeot-Citroen towards the same objective.  ESB is currently working towards providing a charging infrastructure to support up to 10% of all vehicles being electric by 2020 and plans to complete the roll-out of a nationwide infrastructure by the end of 2013.</p><p>  In addition to providing a national charging base, the infrastructure will ensure optimal integration of EVs with the electricity grid and deliver long-term benefits to the electricity system in Ireland in terms of demand-side management and optimisation of renewables.  As things stand, under current regulations, class 29 in Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the planning regulations currently provides that the installation by an undertaker authorised to provide an electricity service of a unit substation of up to 11 cu. m for the distribution of electricity is exempt from the requirement to obtain planning permission.  In this regard, the Department issued a circular to planning authorities in July 2012 advising that it was possible to take the view that a charging station for electric cars comes within the meaning of the term substation and is therefore exempt.  This view was based on the International Electrotechnical Commission&rsquo;s, IEC, definition of substation, the IEC being the internationally recognised standards body on electrical and technical issues.</p><p>  To put the matter beyond any doubt, the proposed amendment will insert a new class 29A into the planning regulations which will provide an explicit exemption from the requirement to obtain planning permission for the installation of electric charging points, subject to certain conditions and limitations regarding size and advertising, including that the size of any such charging point shall not exceed 3 m or 0.5 cu. m when located on a public road.  This amendment is to some extent intended to clarify and further elaborate on an existing provision.  Class 29 of the planning regulations is also proposed for amendment to clarify that the exemption for a substation under that class excludes a charging point for electric vehicles but includes mini-pillars.  A mini-pillar is a low voltage distribution box less than 0.5 cu. m in size.  The ESB has always considered mini-pillars to be an element of the substation network.  However, the proposed amendment would again serve to remove any potential ambiguity.</p><p>  The second exemption relates to the use of existing electricity infrastructure for the provision of telecommunications services.  Class 31 of Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the planning regulations currently provides that the provision of overhead communications by a statutory undertaker authorised to provide a telecommunications service is exempt from the requirement to obtain planning permission.  The ESB is a statutory undertaker authorised to provide a telecommunications service and it intends to provide such a service.  The ESB has sought clarity regarding the use of its existing infrastructure for the provision of telecommunications services.  The proposed amendment to class 31 clarifies that any body authorised to provide a telecommunications service can use existing poles to carry fibre optic or similar telecommunications cable or erect new poles for that purpose, and it can also attach small brackets or devices - subject to size limitations -  containing spare rolled-up cable.</p><p>  The third proposed exemption relates to works arising from the new septic tank inspection arrangements.  Section 70(<i>h</i>) of the Water Services Act 2007, as inserted by section 4 of the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012, provides that inspectors will carry out inspections of septic tanks and on-site wastewater treatment systems as requested by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, or a water services authority.  Inspections will be based on the national inspection plan, which is provided for under section 70(<i>k</i>) of the 2012 Act.  Under section 70(<i>h</i>), inspectors are required to inform the owner of a treatment system and the relevant water services authority of the results of the inspection.</p><p>  Where a water services authority receives notification that a treatment system is causing or is likely to cause a risk to human health or the environment, the water services authority must issue an advisory notice to the owner within 21 days.  The notice will direct the owner to take the necessary remediation measures and will specify a timeframe for completion of those measures.  Failure to comply with the provisions of an advisory notice within the specified timeframe will be an offence.  Accordingly, the proposed exemption provides that remedial works carried out in compliance with an advisory notice issued by the water services authority are exempt from the requirement to obtain planning permission.  Inspectors will shortly be formally appointed by the EPA, with inspections commencing from 1 July 2013.  It is important that the proposed exemption is commenced in advance of this.</p><p>  The fourth proposed change is a technical correction relating to provisions regarding thinning, felling or replanting of trees, forests or woodlands, not including the replacement of broadleaf high forest by conifer species, and the construction or maintenance of a forest road.  Specifically, the proposed amendment to article 8 of the regulations is to provide that the following are exempted development: the thinning, felling or replanting of trees, forests or woodlands, but not including the replacement of broadleaf with conifer; and the construction or maintenance of a forest road other than the making of a point of access to a public road.  Both these types of development have been set out in section 4 of the Act as exempted development for many years and both are regulated by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p>  The thinning, felling and replanting of trees is regulated under the Forestry Act 1946.  Under that Act, it is generally unlawful to uproot any tree over ten years old, or to cut down any tree without a felling licence issued by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Various environmental checks are carried out by the Department as part of the evaluation of any application for a felling licence.  The construction of private forest roads is also regulated by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, under the European Communities (Forest Consent and Assessment) Regulations.  Private forest road construction projects must obtain the prior written approval of the Minister, as part of which the Department undertakes an assessment to determine the likely environmental impact of the project, in accordance with the environmental impact assessment, EIA, directive.</p><p>  In the case of both consents, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine undertakes consultation with other agencies such as National Parks and Wildlife Service, Inland Fisheries Ireland, An Taisce and local authorities.  Screening and appropriate assessment, if required, is carried out in accordance with the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011.</p><p>  Section 4 of the Planning and Development Act was, however, amended by the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 to clarify and state expressly that no development could be considered to be an exempted development if it could require an EIA under the EIA directive or an appropriate assessment under the habitats directive, which effectively meant that once works are classed as &ldquo;development&rdquo; for the purposes of the Planning and Development Act and would require an EIA or appropriate assessment, they would require planning permission.  It was not intended, however, that this provision should bring tree felling or forest roads back within the planning system in any circumstances, because they are subject to a consent regime under another Minister, as part of which an EIA and appropriate assessment are carried out where necessary.</p> <p>Accordingly section 4(4A) of the Act, also commenced in 2011, gives the power to the Minister to exempt development from planning by regulation, notwithstanding that it might require environmental impact assessment or appropriate assessment, where it comes under such other consent regime.  It is in exercise of these powers therefore that I wish to make these regulations clarifying that the thinning, felling and replanting of trees, and the construction of private forest roads are completely exempt from the requirement for planning, as they always were until the 2011 amendment I mentioned earlier, because they are regulated by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p> I commend the regulations to the committee and look forward to a full discussion.  I believe everybody got the documentation which illustrates what we are talking about in a way that my words might not be able to do.</p></speech>

Does this only relate to cables?  The Minister of State spoke about cables and very small devices.  The exemptions provided to the Garda, for example, resulted in a proliferation of antennae of a commercial nature.  Provided it is not that, I would be satisfied.</p><p>  My second question relates to forests and exemption No. 4, which the Minister of State may have already clarified.  Obviously harvesting rights in our forests is a very big issue at the moment.  So long as it is of a very minor nature it will not impact.  We need to be assured that it will come back through the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine if there is any doubt about it.  Those are my two concerns and if they are addressed, I will not have a problem.</p></speech>

The forests will be fully under the regulatory control of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine.  It was not a problem up to 2011, so it is just to clarify that.  They are just the internal roads and the felling within the forests, which already fall under a full regulatory system within the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine.</p></speech>

It was something that we discussed with the Minister during the debate on the septic tank legislation.  It is welcome to have it for the smooth running of that legislation.  We obviously want to see the roll-out of the electric vehicles and very small power points will be involved.</p><p>  The regulations on the felling of trees are fair enough for large forests.  However, why would a landowner cutting one, two or three trees need to bother the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government on such matters.  While the Minister of State may say it is not necessary, should we consider introducing legislation to allow the removal of a small number of trees without the need to torment the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government about it?  Could that responsibility not be devolved to local authorities under the reform of local government?</p></speech>

The septic tank issue will be on many people's minds in the coming months.  On the second issue, it is not the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government but the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine who will be responsible.  The regulations cover trees that are more than ten years old.  It is generally unlawful to uproot any tree more than ten years old.</p></speech>

However, it is crazy that something like this would have to come to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine for the Minister to authorise.  It is an issue that could be dealt with by the local authority, subject to consultation with the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the other bodies mentioned here.  This is not something that needs to come to central government.  The Minister is seeking things to devolve down to local government and this is one of them.</p></speech>

The Deputy might also consider tabling a parliamentary question to the Minister on the matter.  I cannot give the Deputy a direct answer on the matter today.</p></speech>

I also believe these exemptions are quite reasonable and practical and I welcome them in their entirety.  It is very pragmatic to have an exemption where the upgrade of a septic tank is required.  There was considerable scaremongering and misinformation initially when the septic tank legislation was proposed and I am glad to see the Government's practical approach to remediation of septic tanks.</p><p>  The need for other infrastructure such as telecommunication cables and electric charging points indicates the new technologies that are facing society.  The Electricity Supply (Special Powers) Act 1926 provided that the ESB and others could erect poles and infrastructure.  Rural electrification would never have happened and we would never have seen the developments we have seen in the country.  I welcome today's proposals because we need extra electric vehicle charging points and new telecommunications infrastructure.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify that only authorised bodies can install such infrastructure.  Is there any right of consultation with such authorised bodies in advance of installing such infrastructure?  It would be a good idea that these authorised bodies be required to consult with people who may have concerns.  If they prove they have consulted and explained the need for such infrastructure that is well and good.</p><p>  Before the Minister of State came in we had a discussion with the housing agency which now has responsibility for sustainable communities.  Previous planning exemptions applied to micro wind turbines.  There is potential for further renewable energy projects, not just with wind turbines but also with small hydro schemes.  I mentioned one in Portlaw in County Waterford where in the 19th century more than 350 kW of hydroelectricity power was generated on the River Clodaigh and now no hydropower is being generated.  In the future we should consider providing planning exemptions for such hydro schemes to encourage their development.  Another hydro scheme being developed on the River Glasha in County Waterford has to go back through the planning process because there are issues with grid connection.  The bureaucracy around it makes it very difficult.  Perhaps this can be addressed through regulation or perhaps in the broader planning perspective.  However, we need to try to improve access to renewable energy technologies such as hydro schemes.  The Minister of State and her Department would have a role in that, as might this committee.  People trying to develop sustainable energy face practical barriers and I am using hydroelectricity as an example.</p></speech>

The regulations apply to any body authorised to provide telecommunications infrastructure, so it is not just the ESB.  The Deputy made some suggestions about micro wind turbines and smaller hydroelectric schemes.  These are constantly under review so if other exemptions are required, we would be open to any newer ones that come along.  However, obviously we need to get the balance right; we do not want to exempt things where neighbours would justifiably have a right to comment.</p> <p>We do not want to move too far in one direction or another.  Any sensible proposals will be considered.  The Deputy suggests there are other ways of providing renewable energy.  While this issue may not come within my remit, the Government would certainly be open to examining it.  Technology is constantly evolving and we would be pleased to examine any new proposals which would be suitable for exempted development.</p></speech>

However, the convoluted nature of the planning process makes it difficult for proposers as they have to provide a large amount of information.  Moreover, once they obtain planning permission, they must seek grid connectivity from the ESB which may not match up.  As a result, they may have to engage in the planning process again as changes they have made may be considered to be material in nature.  The planning process must show some flexibility towards hydroelectric schemes.  In the case of the Glasha hydroelectric scheme in County Waterford, no objections have been lodged and fisheries bodies and others have all expressed support.  However, the proposers must engage again with the planning process because the system is so rigid.  I am bringing to the Minister of State's attention the fact that people are developing new technologies that would help us reach the renewable targets Ireland must achieve by 2020.  We must think outside the box by revising the planning regulations and laws to try to assist such individuals, where possible.  Environmental impact assessments have been done and objections have not been lodged.  The system is rigid and outdated.</p></speech>

I reiterate, however, that we must get the balance right because we have seen how lax planning got the country into trouble in the past.  For this reason, we must ensure a balance is struck between the interests of communities and economic development.  We are seeking to improve the planning system and make it more coherent in respect of foreshore.  We are also considering new guidelines on wind energy, which is a matter of interest to many people.  We are trying to respond to the issues that are emerging, particularly in the area of renewable energy, and we are open to new technologies.</p></speech>

I shall deal with both amendments and I shall first deal with amendment No. 23.  As Deputy McDonald has stated, the deletion of the words "or otherwise" would narrow the possibility of a contractor to take into consideration costs that could arise from obligations linked to a contract, but not contained in the contract.  For example, a subcontractor may damage something on the site while carrying out work which could give rise to a legitimate cost for the contractor.  That is a consideration for us when not accepting amendment No. 23.</p><p>  Amendment No. 24 deals with enforcement in the event of a non-response to a payment claim.  The matter was raised on Second Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I have been advised that an obligation under the contract to make an interim payment is a contractual matter that can be enforced in the courts.  In the context of the current Bill, if a payment has not been made the contractor, or the subcontractor, is entitled to sue because the contract must cover staged payments.  The Bill also provides the contractor, or subcontractor, with another mechanism to take action by suspending work if they so choose.  For that reason we do not believe that the amendments are necessary and also given the fact that the contract is already in place and provides for obligations on all parties. </p></speech>

The value of the legislative framework is to make explicitly plain the parameters for the parties.  I accept that people have recourse to the courts and can sue.  Part of the logic behind this initiative is to minimise recourse to that type of procedure for time and expense concerns and to give comfort and certainty to contractors that moneys will be paid.  My view differs from the Minister.  I believe that it is necessary to insert in the legislation an explicit provision that the party must pay the amount in full.  Such a provision would strengthen the legislation and goes to the heart of the reason and rationale for introducing the Bill.</p></speech>

That is the ultimate power that we are creating here.  Hitherto, that power was not in place for people or only in an unenforceable way.</p> <p>In the circumstances to which the Deputy refers, everyone agrees the whole objective is to make sure that person gets paid.  The section under discussion at present, section 4, is all about making sure in respect of payment claim notices.  In the aforementioned circumstance, a person who has not been paid is entitled to suspend the work and go into adjudication mode, which would produce the result everyone seeks.  Consequently, the Government does not believe it necessary to be as explicit as Deputy McDonald has outlined; the view is that it would complicate the existing provisions set out under section 4.  However, I agree with the Deputy, in that we are all at one about how we are obtaining this objective.  This is the reason this new departure, as I described the adjudication process, is the means through which these disputes will be resolved.  We will deal with the threat of going to adjudication in a later section but in itself it provides the incentive for contractors and subcontractors to sort out this issue, which hitherto has not been in place.</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct, in that the Government has learned a lot from the UK legislation in the original first draft, the second draft and now effectively the third draft.  However, the Government's legal opinion is it is not necessary.  Consideration can be given to whether, in the context of a more detailed statutory instrument, one would make that more clear.  I have given that commitment in my contributions thus far.  However, our clear legal advice is that in respect of primary legislation, this provision is not necessary.</p></speech>

However, where there is a failure to respond to the payment claim, there is a strong case for using every lever one can to incentivise the honouring of that amount and that is the purpose of this proposal.  While the Minister of State has not said this, it in no way compromises any of the other procedures or processes envisaged in the Bill.  It in no way undermines the spirit of the legislation and I believe it strengthens it.

Unless this suspension limit is withdrawn, it could undermine fundamentally the driving purpose of the legislation, as instructing subcontractors to go back on site to continue working for a main contractor who is withholding payment for work already completed does not make any sense.  It could be perceived as a sort of capitulation to rogue operators, the very people who made this legislation necessary in the first place.  In the event that work has been completed, this allows for the option of withdrawing the obligation to provide operations and maintenance manuals or commissioning certificates.  If the job has been completed but a payment dispute arises, the phrase &quot;any or all of its obligations&quot; could cover the withholding of operations and maintenance manuals or certificates.</p></speech>

While amendment No. 27 is in my name, I understand members will deal with all three together.  I might first deal with amendment No. 25 and then members can discuss the other two amendments because I am accepting the premise of amendment No. 26 tabled by Deputy McDonald.  However, as I am proposing my own amendment No. 27, I might set out to the sub-committee the reason the Government is opting for its own amendment and not that tabled by Deputy McDonald.  I accept precisely what she is suggesting because it was a key point to emerge from the discussions by Members over the last number of years.  In the original legislation, the provision was for 14 days and everyone has accepted that limit was unacceptable.  I gave a commitment on Second Stage that I would respond on this subject, which has resulted in amendment No. 27.  However, this does not take away from amendment No. 26, as tabled by Deputy McDonald.  I will go through the reason the Government is tabling its own amendment later.</p><p>  Amendment No. 25 is a proposal by Deputy McDonald to delete the phrase "work" and substitute "any or all of its obligations".  The scope provided in the legislation for suspension of work was examined carefully in the context of developing the legislation.  It is important that the right to suspension is limited to the individual payment dispute to avoid the possibility of a contractor being able to suspend work on other sites on which the contractor has been paid.  The power to suspend any or all of its obligations would have health and safety implications, which could pose a serious risk for fellow contractors working on a site.  It is for this reason that the right to suspend work is limited to the phrase "work".  If I may, I will give the Deputy an example.  When I asked earlier what was the reason the Government could not accept this amendment, I was given an example.  A scaffolder erects scaffolding on a construction site and then goes into dispute with the main contractor.  While that dispute is going through the adjudication process and is being tested and argued out, the scaffolder still has obligations.  They are not so much work obligations as obligations under health and safety regulations to make sure the scaffolding is in a good condition or is maintained because it exists on the site.  As for limiting this to the question of work, there is a wider application on sites and such an application will exist as one goes through the process of adjudication or is contesting what that adjudication is about.  This is the reason the Government cannot accept amendment No. 25.</p><p>  In respect of amendments Nos. 26 and 27, I will propose amendment No. 27, which is a substitute for amendment No. 26 tabled by Deputy McDonald.  The current provisions, which require the unpaid subcontractor to return to work after two weeks, even though he or she may not be in receipt of payment for work carried out, favours the main contractor.  There is no doubt about this and I made that clear on Second Stage.  I am amending this provision to provide for suspension, following notification in writing giving seven days' notice of the intention to suspend work.  This suspension can continue until referral of the payment dispute for adjudication and following an adjudicator's award where the award has not been paid.  The amendment provides for a more balanced solution, while not prejudging the outcome of a payment dispute.</p><p>  This was a key issue in the original Bill to which many Deputies referred in the Chamber and which was most unsatisfactory.  Effectively, people would have been obliged to go back on site without the dispute having been resolved.  Having listened to the industry and having listened to the points Deputies on all sides made about this issue, the Government amendment No. 27 deals with a key outstanding issue that was contained in the original assessment of the Bill by the industry itself.  I hope it meets with the favour of colleagues today.</p></speech>

This consultation highlighted a number of matters relating to the Bill that required further clarification.  Chief among those concerns was the provision in the Bill that limited the effectiveness of the adjudication process by making the adjudicator&rsquo;s award binding, providing the award is not appealed.  This provision was included to provide protection to the State in the event of insolvency of the payee.</p><p>  During the Second Stage debate a number of speakers also asked for the provisions to make the adjudicator&rsquo;s award binding, that is, payable even if the award is appealed to arbitration.  I have taken on board the concerns and the amendments I table today will mean that adjudication will be binding and apply equally to private and State contracts.  The adjudication provisions contained in the Bill are vital to the proper functioning of the legislation.  In a sense, they give the legislation the necessary teeth to provide a swift and cost effective means of dispute resolution.</p><p>  Four big issues emerged from the Second Stage process and this was one of them.  I did give an indication at the time that we would do this and that is why we are moving on this grouping of amendments which I hope will meet the support of colleagues.</p></speech>

The purpose of the panel of adjudicators is to offer parties who cannot agree on an adjudicator the possibility of having an adjudicator appointed to resolve the dispute.  This is an important provision as it provides a level and open playing field for both parties to a payment dispute and prevents either party from using the selection of an adjudicator as a means of delaying the adjudication process.</p><p>  The Bill already provides the Minister with power to issue a code of practice on the required experience, role and functions of adjudicators and the adjudication process itself.  Section 6(4) on page 9 states that the parties may, within five days, beginning with the day on which notice under section 6(4) is served, agree to the appointment of an adjudicator of their own choice or from the panel appointed.  I understand Deputy McDonald&rsquo;s point that concern exists.  I have heard it said by existing panels of adjudicators.  They are concerned that they might not be used or be open for use.  There is nothing to prevent people agreeing to have their own adjudicator appointed.  In the same way, section 6(18), which I highlighted previously, states that the parties to a dispute may at any time agree to revoke the appointment of an adjudicator and the parties shall be jointly liable.</p> <p>If the parties agree to an adjudicator, they do not need to come near us for panels of adjudicators.  We think the legislation is flexible enough to provide for that.</p><p> On the argument about a code of conduct, there are already powers for the Minister to do that.  The Deputy's thinking is more appropriate to a statutory instrument, where we would set out all of the obligations for the adjudicators and how they are to be selected.  The concern has been raised by some professional bodies, which I suspect is the motivation behind the amendment, that in some way they will be shut out of the new process.  That is not the case, we need their experience and know how.  They know the dispute resolution process and have the experience.  In no way will they be shut out of the process.</p></speech>

Subsection (5) states that failing agreement between the parties under subsection (4), the adjudicator shall be appointed by the chair of the panel selected by the Minister.

It is not the intention and if that was set out in the legislation, we could look at it but as I understand it, it was never the intention of the Minister to appoint individual adjudicators, it is simply to appoint the chair, who will then appoint adjudicators.  That subsection gives the devolving power to the Minister to appoint the chairmen.  If the Deputy thinks we should look at this again, I will do so.</p></speech>

My amendment refers to public procurement in capital projects to the value of &euro;1 million or more.  The Minister of State knows that in other jurisdictions, social clauses have been deployed.  They might be legally tricky and must be balanced against EU legal requirements in procurement directives but I will press the amendment to underline the importance of addressing the issue of social clauses.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-12a.318" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/974" speakername="Pat Breen" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013061200002#A00400"><p>I remind members, witnesses, in particular those in the Visitors Gallery, to ensure their mobile telephones are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting as they cause interference even in silent mode with the recording equipment in the committee rooms.</p><p>  I welcome the Secretary General, Mr. David Cooney, from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade who is present to discuss two reports relating to European Union matters as provided for by the European Union (Scrutiny) Act 2002.  These reports contain a historical review of the main legislative actions and developments for 2012 and also contain a forward-looking element giving an overview of the next six months of the EU Presidency.  The Secretary General is accompanied by Mr. David Donoghue, political director, Ms Anne Barrington, director general, Europe division, Mr. Pat Kelly, director, Middle East unit and North Africa unit and Mr. John O&rsquo;Grady, development co-operation division of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p><p>  This is not the first time the Secretary General, Mr. Cooney, has come before us to discuss matters with the committee but it is the first time he has come to discuss the reports.  The discussion with the Secretary General is an important part of the committee&rsquo;s scrutiny of EU matters, which come within the remit of the committee.  Among the many areas covered by the remit are such policy areas as the European neighbourhood policy which fosters EU relations with its nearest geographical neighbours both east and south and EU relations with the wider world, which include areas of particular concern to the committee such as developments in Syria, the Middle East and Africa.  It also includes the current proposals for the financing of the EU external action programme and the European development fund which were considered in detail by the committee at a meeting of Department officials in 2012.  The witnesses are all very welcome this afternoon.</p><p>  The Secretary General&rsquo;s statement was circulated to committee members earlier today and I am sure some of them have downloaded it.  Much ground is covered in it so I do not think he should read it.  Instead, I suggest Mr. Cooney would make a few brief introductory remarks and then we will take questions from members.  I will advise him on privilege.</p><p>  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or an entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p></speech>

As the Chairman said, we have prepared a substantial statement and like him I did not see any point in taking up the time of the committee by reading it into the record or seeking to run down the clock.  The point is to allow members to question me and my colleagues.  We will do our best to assist them and answer the questions.  I invite members to address the report and issues flowing from it.</p></speech>

I appreciate that he forwarded his statement to us in advance of the meeting.  He mentioned the success of the chairmanship of the OSCE.  I compliment all involved in the success - the T&aacute;naiste and the Secretary General and his colleagues in the Department.  The decision was made in 2009 that Ireland would hold the chairmanship in the second half of 2012 and it shows the long lead-in process and preparatory work that must be undertaken to ensure a successful chairmanship.</p><p>  With regard to the European external action force, some time ago I recall the European Parliament was critical of the ineffectiveness of the service.  Mr. Cooney used the phrase in his script "continued to establish itself during 2012".  Could he elaborate on that?</p> <p>Is it gaining more recognition or appreciation?  Does it deserve more appreciation from European parliamentarians with regard to its effectiveness?</p><p> As was noted in the opening statement provided, Syria is the humanitarian issue of our generation.  At successive meetings of this joint committee, members have raised this issue and their former D&aacute;il colleague, Mr. Barry Andrews, has appeared here in his capacity as chief executive of GOAL.  Oxfam and other NGOs also have been in contact with the joint committee regarding the frightening humanitarian crisis, both in Syria and in the entire region.  Some national coverage on Irish airwaves in recent days again has highlighted the particular difficulties and pressures in Lebanon and other adjoining countries.  It is disappointing that the European Union has not been able to agree on the arms embargo issue and that this has changed in respect of France and Britain.  Can the witnesses elaborate on whether there are ongoing efforts at European Union level, with the forthcoming Council of Ministers meeting, to again highlight this humanitarian issue?  Members all have had the opportunity to meet a representative of the opposition groups, who outlined in graphic detail the huge abuse of individuals and are aware of the many millions who need humanitarian assistance and that more than 100,000 people have been killed.  The position is frightening, as is the lack of international response.  This joint committee has reiterated constantly its appreciation that the Government, through its overseas development programme, has continued to give more assistance to that particular region.  I understand the European Union has been the main contributor.  Is pressure being put on the other international players to play a much-needed and improved role in providing badly needed humanitarian assistance to that region?  Some time ago, when the US Secretary of State, John Kerry, met his Russian counterpart, they indicated they would try to get talks under way in Geneva.  Are there indications of momentum or impetus being given to this initiative?  The failure of the United Nations to achieve a resolution obviously is extremely disappointing.  However, all members must be deeply concerned with regard to what they read and see in the national media and through correspondence they receive from individuals.  As the Secretary General noted in the opening remarks he forwarded to the joint committee, it is vital that the humanitarian disaster and catastrophe in that region is addressed in a much more thorough way by the international community.</p></speech>

I will begin with an issue that was not really addressed in the statement provided, that is, the situation in Turkey, which is on members' minds after watching on television the scenes that unfolded last night.  Amnesty International held a protest outside the Turkish Embassy today in respect of the attacks on peaceful protesters in which one can see the gas and so on.  Aside from the impact on everyone concerned - this certainly is having an impact on business, investment and so on - what impact does the Secretary General believe this will have on the application to join the European Union?  Many concerns and issues were raised with regards to human rights and so on but having seen it so graphically on screen last night, the witnesses might comment on this issue.</p><p>  As for the situation in Syria, like everyone else I am horrified with what is going on and in particular with the humanitarian crisis in the camps.  It is not helpful that some states appear to be pushing ahead with regard to more guns, greater supplies and so on.  I do not think that will help in a civil war.  I acknowledge Ireland has taken a strong position in this regard and note that Austria is taking a very strong position regarding the lifting of the ban.  It is talking about pulling out its troops, who are serving with United Nations on the Golan Heights.  Do the witnesses believe this issue is showing cracks within the European Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy?  On the humanitarian crisis itself, how many countries - particularly European countries - have pledged to help?  Do the witnesses have details of what European Union countries have reneged or thus far have not fulfilled their obligations in this regard?</p><p>  In respect of the Palestinian issue, Ireland has a positive position on what is happening in that part of the world.  The T&aacute;naiste has stated there is no consensus within the European Union regarding the ban on settlement goods.  There is talk of introducing a labelling of Israeli settlement goods and while I do not believe that goes far enough, will the Government work to put this proposal on the agenda at the next European Union Foreign Affairs Council meeting?  The witnesses might provide an update on the labelling issue and might provide an overview on the ban.</p><p>  The issue of Mali was mentioned in the statement provided.  I have serious reservations regarding Ireland's involvement in what is clearly a civil war taking place there.  Recently, the Malian Government attacked Tuareg areas in northern Mali.  While serious social and economic grievances obtain in respect of that entire region, Ireland appears to be taking the Government side in this regard.  While one is told it is about al-Qaeda and other things, the Tuareg in this area clearly have legitimate grievances.  There have been criticisms in respect of the Malian Government and serious human rights abuses have been raised by the United Nations itself.  The European Union clearly appears to be adopting a one-sided approach to this conflict.  Broadly, is the European Union doing anything to address the legitimate grievances of the Tuareg people in that region?</p><p>  Finally, although it is not mentioned in the opening statement, I refer to the position in Bahrain.  While uprisings in different parts of the world are being discussed, what is the European Union's position, in particular with regard to the arrest of human rights workers, lawyers and so on?  It is one of those areas of conflict that always are being pushed to one side.  Is the European Union adopting a formal position on events there and on the concerns all members have in that regard?  It is a small country that clearly has a sectarian regime with regard to the treatment of a large proportion of its population.  Almost on a weekly basis, one hears of people with a human rights background being arrested and imprisoned.</p></speech>

On the European Union external action force and the general influence of the European Union with regard to its neighbours to the east and the south, to what extent has the European Union developed a recognition of its authority, strength or influence in the area?  To what extent are the European Union institutions working on that?  Similarly, in respect of the ongoing situation in Syria, has Ireland unilaterally or together with the European Union and the United Nations, tried to establish safe havens or safety corridors of some kind in Syria with a view to addressing the serious human rights issues that continue to be brought to the attention of members on a daily basis?</p> <p>For example, have the EU and UN institutions learned anything from the experiences of the war in Bosnia all those years ago when it became apparent that as long as perpetrators were secure in the knowledge that there could be no retribution, they would continue indefinitely to pursue their objectives?  Have the various institutions of the European Union and United Nations at all levels examined the possibilities to the fullest extent possible in this area?  If not, the belief will remain that in the absence of any intervention of an influential nature, the atrocities continue.</p><p> What is the general attitude to Iran within the European Union on both trade and the development of nuclear weapons?  To what extent has Ireland, unilaterally or through the European Union and the United Nations, established common ground with a view to a common approach to the position in so far as the development of weapons of mass destruction in Iran is concerned, and to what extent is a serious effort being made to monitor such development?</p><p> To what extent has European scrutiny within the national parliament been co-ordinated to complement the European concept of cohesiveness and progress in the same direction at the same time and to the same extent, and to what extent has it been noted the degree of dissension within some European Union member states in respect of the focus on the original ideals of European integration and the European project?  I do not want to mention individual countries, but there are a number of countries in which there is considerable growing Euroscepticism from which, if allowed to continue indefinitely without addressing the issues that appear to be causing the problem, disillusionment will develop and there will be a situation down the road in five or ten years, or perhaps even less than that, that would lead to a break-up or weakening of the European project in a way that would make it impossible to operate.</p></speech>

In a sense, I will be speaking on the basis of the little bit of research I did on this huge tome.</p><p>  As a public representative, I welcome this opportunity to engage with Mr. Cooney's eight officials around these important issues of concern to Europe and to the world in general.  To touch on the last point raised by the previous speaker on oversight, there is a debate ongoing about the Seanad and we have had a debate here.  We also have had a debate at the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs.  To follow through on Deputy Durkan's position, is the Department happy, given the existing political structures of multi-seat constituencies and the demands on the time of backbenchers, that we have an opportunity to seriously and assiduously study our obligation under section 2(5) of the European Union (Scrutiny) Act 2002 to look at the draft EU legislative proposals on foreign policy?  These impose considerable responsibilities on any elected public representative to study the EU proposals.  We as a nation are not managing and, equally, other member states are not managing to do this.  I seek Mr. Cooney's opinion on that observation, which has been made previously by witnesses here.</p><p>  Having studied some of the aspects of the report on which I congratulate Mr. Cooney for its comprehensive nature, he might explain how matters are developing around the common European asylum system.  Mr. Cooney will be aware that we are being criticised increasingly about the direct provision allowance system.  I am dealing with asylum seekers or persons looking for residency here who have been in direct provision for over eight years.  Not only are they in direct provision for over eight years but they are rearing new families within these-----</p></speech>

I would argue that there cannot be anything more relevant to the committee than that.</p><p>  Syria has been touched upon.  One's heart bleeds for the citizens of Syria.  It is a terrible humanitarian crisis.  I congratulate the European Union, which provided &euro;400 million.  We, ourselves, provided &euro;9 million in humanitarian aid.  However, I would like to think that we take a balanced approach to those who constitute the Syrian opposition.  The report is rightly riddled with condemnation of the Assad regime but I have been reading reports that would make one vomit of atrocities being carried out, not only by President Assad's forces but by those who claim to be the liberators.  I refer to arbitrary executions, beheadings, throat-slittings and unbelievable barbarity.  Can Mr. Cooney tell us whether Ireland's position at the European Union is to push at the International Court of Justice to ensure that with all of these criminals - be they President Assad's criminals or the opposition criminals - we must take a balanced approach to the activities of those acting in a war zone?</p><p>  I will further ask Mr. Cooney about Iran which has been touched upon.  We hope the Iranian people have a successful election, which is imminent.  I seek his advice.  He may or may not be conscious that we are lobbied continuously by a group which claims to be the Iranian liberation movement, the Iranian government in exile.  We get correspondence continuously from them and they are lobbying within and outside the Parliament.  Given that Ireland was fairly well represented at the group's last Paris meeting, where a former Taoiseach led a delegation comprising Labour Party members, Fianna F&aacute;il members and Independents, what is the position of the European Union?  This group claims to have a foreign affairs committee and a government in exile of the National Council of Resistance of Iran.  Perhaps Mr. Cooney's position on this organisation might help Members of the House who are signing petitions being proffered by this organisation as to whether we should now align ourselves as a country with its demands.</p><p>  I have mentioned Bosnia-Herzegovina previously at the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs.  It is a tragedy.  I know the region well.  I knew programme refugees from Tuzla who had been bombed by the Serbs.  Or was it the Croats?  I forget who bombed them, but they were taken as programme refugees.  They all did very well educationally and in business.  Those Irish Bosnians are very concerned and are lobbying hard for a complete review of the policy of Europe towards Bosnia-Herzegovina.  I ask Mr. Cooney because there is correspondence from the group.  It seems it is pointing at us as a nation and Europe as a collective, stating that we should be doing more.  Would Mr. Cooney support that argument or would he see that perhaps some of the main players are the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina, who seem not to be moving forward at the same pace and who are being left behind by Serbia, and Croatia which is now practically a full member of the European Union?  Would he give his analysis of what is happening in Bosnia-Herzegovina and what is the solution?</p><p>  On Macedonia, it seems that the simple issue of the Greek response to the name Macedonia is holding up progress and creating such difficulties.  I understand the Greeks have a veto on the name but with the collective wisdom of an institution as large as the European Union, there must be some way around this in order to progress matters so that the name is not the issue that holds them up.</p><p>  I will conclude by touching on-----</p></speech>

I do not know how many members have read this report.  It is extensive.  It brings me back to the argument of whether we have the time and facilities to do this serious scrutiny of legislation.</p><p>  On the last three areas, Albania holds elections this month.  So does Mongolia.  I wish both of them a happy outcome.  My feedback from Albania is that matters are progressing.  Mr. Cooney might give us an opinion.  Perhaps he must wait until after the election for the OSCE to decide whether or not they were fair but I understand matters are progressing there.</p><p>  This report covers something that has been the bane of my past two and a half years, that is, to understand the international players acting on behalf of Europe and humanity in general.</p> <p>There are the United Nations and the European Union.  Other bodies include the OSCE and the Council of Europe.  Interestingly, both have "parliaments" of elected representatives.  There are 56 countries affiliated to the OSCE.  The document states there has been a study of the relationships between the organisations.  The officials will be aware of the conflicting reports of the OSCE and the United States on election monitoring.  The parliamentary assembly produced a report that was different from that of the OSCE.  This ridiculousness on the part of an international body with such high status must not be allowed to continue.</p><p> Zimbabwe is the forgotten country.  Ireland has a policy on Africa.  Although Ireland is a small country, it has considerable influence in that continent.  Do the officials believe we could use the professional skills of the Department in conjunction with those of individuals in Zimbabwe who have been educated by Irish missionaries - they include Mr. Mugabe - to work bilaterally, thereby achieving more than we would if we waited for the European Union to move?  There is a highly educated workforce and Zimbabwe is a country of immense importance.  Could we achieve greater understanding between the political forces there if we proceeded bilaterally?</p><p> Mr. David Donoghue will be familiar with the Khodorkovsky case because he was at a presentation I attended at which reference was made to it.  I refer to the relationship with Russia.  We dealt with the Magnitsky case and received rather undiplomatic correspondence from the Russian ambassador.  Will the delegates advise us on how best we should approach the Russians?  Russia is a very important country.  When one bears in mind the oligarchs, individuals such as Khodorkovsky, the Magnitsky case and Boris Berezovsky, the man who died, how does one square the horror of the events surrounding the oil and gas barons and the oligarchs with our development of a relationship with Russia?  We want to develop warm and cordial relationships with it.  However, we are disappointed that the very pleasant Russian ambassador should have written such a negative comment to us when we were dealing with the Magnitsky case.  He threatened that Ireland would not benefit from the adoption process that we had been negotiating for the past ten years.</p><p> I hope the officials have noted my questions because it could be another year before I will have the chance to ask them again.</p></speech>

There was a report in the past week or so alleging Irish taxpayers' money was being used in Ethiopia for abortion providers.  Will the officials comment on this?  Is it true?  If so, is the practice being continued?  Is there anywhere to which we are sending taxpayers' money to provide for what is an inhumane abuse of human rights, namely, abortion?</p><p>  With regard to the situation in Syria, I have noted the officials' comment that the United States and Russia are endeavouring to convene a conference.  Some of us saw some of the refugee camps in Lebanon in January.  The message we received from both the refugees and political interests in Lebanon, including the President, was that there was a real need for engagement to achieve a negotiated solution to the problems faced.  I was pleased with the line the T&aacute;naiste and Ireland took with regard to not providing arms for either side in the conflict.  What is occurring is inhumane.  Obviously, the provision of arms is fuelling the conflict and not resulting in a solution.</p><p>  My third point is on the Middle East.  I welcome the commitment in the report on tackling the threats to the viability of the two-state solution and trying to increase the size of the narrowing window.  Some of us will be in the region next week and hope we will have an opportunity to see what is occurring at first hand.  Did the issue of banning of imports from the settlement areas arise at EU level?  Israel will need to be induced or driven, probably in equal proportions, if we are to resolve this issue.</p><p>  My colleague has covered EU-Russia relations.  Russia is a very significant player and the European Union is its biggest trading partner.  Obviously, we are very dependent on Russia's energy supplies.  With regard to visas and human rights, was the case of Sergei Magnitsky raised by the EU side?  If so, what was the outcome?</p><p>  I agree with everything said by Deputy Eric Byrne on Bosnia-Herzegovina.  EU enlargement will lead to circumstances where Bosnia will become more isolated than it has been.  While I can see the political difficulties that arise, the citizens of Bosnia really deserve better than for us to allow that to happen.  The T&aacute;naiste has recognised that there is a threat of renewed conflict in the area.  Therefore, the country merits focus and much assistance.  The European Union has a part to play in that regard.</p><p>  I compliment Ambassador Anderson and her staff at the United Nations on their tremendous support and participation with regard to the arms trade treaty.  The latest figure I saw suggested over 68 countries had signed up.  This means that the treaty is now in effect, as 50 signatories were required.  The more countries that sign, the more the terms of the treaty will be adhered to.  This is essential to so many of the conflict areas we have encountered.</p><p>  My last question is on one of the smallest states.  When is it planned to reopen the embassy to the Vatican?</p></speech>

The Secretary General can now understand the reason I asked every member to ask questions first in order that he would not have to reply to each individually.  I am not saying he can duck or choose questions, but that he should do his best to answer as many as he can.  Many of the themes were similar.</p></speech>

Since a number of issues were raised, I will take one at a time.  I might make a point and then refer it to my colleagues because they might have something to add.</p><p>  The first point, raised by Deputy Brendan Smith, was on the European External Action Service, of which there was some criticism but not by us.  The creation from scratch of a foreign service in the European Union was a significant undertaking.  The whole point of the service was that its staff would be drawn in equal proportions from the Commission, the Council secretariat and the member states.  There are different administrative cultures in the various bodies.  The whole system had to be set up physically.  It is headed by two very able civil servants, Mr. Pierre Vimont from France, the head of the service, and Mr. David O'Sullivan, the chief operations officer.  Mr. O'Sullivan may be known to some of the members since he started out as a third secretary in my Department.  Subsequently, he became Secretary General of the European Commission and then a representative in Geneva and elsewhere.  The European External Action Service has extremely able staff.</p><p>  We meet secretaries general of the foreign ministries of the 27 EU member states every six months.</p> <p>While two or three years ago there was a great deal of criticism of the service from many of the larger member states, at the last meeting in Vilnius about three weeks ago - the meeting is always held in the country taking up the Presidency rather than in the country holding it - there was mooted, if any, criticism.  There is a real sense now that the EEAS is working, although it is still a work in progress.  I was recently in Indonesia, where I received a superb briefing from the EEAS in Jakarta.  I was extremely impressed by the whole team, as I was when I met them in Zimbabwe last year.  For example, it is possible for accredited diplomats from Singapore to go into the EU mission in Jakarta and work there on a hot desk basis.  It is an effective arrangement. </p><p> The EU is establishing a presence for itself internationally.  That the EU High Representative now represents the Union abroad is a big factor in this regard.  It has changed the way the EU Presidency works.  Although I would not say the EEAS is by any means perfect it has made significant strides.  I am confident it will become more efficient and effective as the various ingredients of the service coalesce around its operating systems.  From what I have seen in terms of the reports from the services, it has a high quality and dedicated staff although there are issues to be resolved.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-12a.336" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Cooney" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013061200006#E00300"><p>That is an issue discussed at all meetings of secretaries general.  One of the reasons for my going to Jakarta was to examine the possibility of setting up a small mission there.  While doing so might be possible, there are downsides in that a country cannot operate its own consular activities out of an EU mission.  For a country like Ireland, it can be expensive to collocate.  We have low overheads in terms of operation.  While an EU mission would have high security risk, we have a low security risk.  Therefore, if we bought into its operation we would end up having to pay high security overheads.  Such issues need to be considered.  </p><p>  Irish embassies and missions travel extremely light, in terms of staff, resources and overheads.  While on the surface it might seem a no-brainer to join with the EEAS it will not always work out because it can be quite expensive to do so.  The EEAS has rather high overheads in terms of security and other operating costs.  We are looking at it and are certainly open to it but much depends on what one wants to do.  My own assessment is that if one wants to be taken seriously in Asia one has to take oneself seriously.  In the EU we can operate one person-one diplomat missions because everybody knows who we are.  We are all members of the EU and are not trying to put on a show.  Anyone who wants to do business in Asia and wants to make contacts must have its own identity and a reasonably decent residence to which to bring people.  Different assets are required in different places.  </p><p>  We are very much open to the idea but it does not automatically follow that because there is an EEAS mission it is the natural host for everybody else.  I believe the EEAS is doing a good job.  It proposes to review its operating regulation in the next year with a view to doing things better.  I would give it a good mark for its efforts to date.  A lot of the criticism was borne out of over-expectation.  People thought it was possible to just wave a wand and create an EU foreign service over night.  It takes a little longer than that.  The EEAS is not perfect but it has done well.</p><p>  On Syria, the situation there is hideous.  On the political situation and where we are, it is complicated.  Often the presentation is simplistic. It is not quite as simple as there are good guys and bad guys.  Almost the entire international community, including President Putin, recognises the Assad regime was the cause of what happened.  The protests against the regime were the result of a failure to reform and respond to the demands of the people.  The attack on the people by the Assad regime was unacceptable and appalling by any criteria and it continues.  </p><p>  Deputy Byrne's comment that it is not all one-way traffic is true in that atrocities are being committed by both sides.  The EU recognised this at its main meeting.  It also condemned the atrocities committed by opposition groups, while pointing out that it still believed the balance of unacceptable human rights violations rested with the regime.  There is no doubt but that all parties are involved.  There is now also, unfortunately, an increasing ethnic-religious element to the conflict.  It is no longer a matter of people protesting against the regime.  Deep divisions are now emerging between the different communities, which will make it even harder to put the country back together if and when some type of peace is restored.  </p><p>  It is correct that the international community has put its weight behind the convening of a conference embracing all parties on the basis of the Geneva declaration of last year.  It is rowing in behind the American and Russian Governments.  The west has not gotten involved militarily - at least overtly.  This is different from what happened in Libya.  Russia is clearly involved in arming the Assad regime.  It believes it has a significant strategic stake in Syria.  Unfortunately, the situation is not without parallels to the type of cold war conflicts which occurred prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union, in which there were seemingly interminable conflicts with one side backed by the then Soviet Union and the other backed by the west.  </p><p>  On the EU position, we very much regret that the EU was unable to continue the arms embargo on Syria.  The Government believes that sending more arms into Syria is adding fuel to the fire.  To be fair to those who took a different approach, I do not believe their analysis is that sending in arms will make matters worse.  Their approach appears to be based on the fact that Assad will not deal until he feels under military threat.  There are people on the opposition side who say that because it appears that the Assad regime is in the ascendency in the military conflict there is no point in having a conference because Assad will not deal.  However, we are of the view that sending in more arms to what is already a violent region will not assist the situation.  On humanitarian zones, our analysis is that any military external intervention of that nature will only heighten the conflict at this stage and could broaden it.</p> <p>The humanitarian situation on the ground is appalling.  There are huge numbers of Syrians living outside Syria in Turkey and Jordan.  The T&aacute;naiste has visited Turkey and the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, has visited Jordan.  Ireland has been to the fore in its humanitarian effort and has contributed &euro;8.5 million.  We have just committed a further &euro;1 million.  We are doing our part.  It is true to say that some states that have committed money have not followed through as assiduously.  I am not sure that is the case among EU member states, but I do not have the figures with me.  My expectation would be that member states have followed through.  If I can establish the position on contributions from EU member states, I will forward the information to the joint committee.  As can be seen in the answers the T&aacute;naiste has provided in reply to parliamentary questions on Syria, Ireland has been very vocal about its expectation that countries will follow through on their commitments.</p><p> This is an extraordinarily complicated situation.  Clearly, we have been to the forefront in terms of the ICC and supported the Swiss initiative calling for those guilty of crimes against humanity to be referred there.  Crimes against humanity have been committed.  That should apply to people involved on both sides of the conflict.  We would be happy to see that being pursued by the Security Council of the United Nations.  Even when the conflict is over, as it will be one day, those responsible should be pursued.  If I have omitted anything on Syria, I would be glad if members let me know.</p><p> The next country on my list is Turkey, where a very disquieting situation has emerged.  Turkey is a candidate for membership of the European Union and we are in negotiations on its accession.  Ireland has traditionally been a supporter of Turkish membership.  We must recognise that Turkey is a country experiencing change.  It is change that is necessary if it is ever to become a member state of the EU.  One of the most striking aspects of the change we have seen is that we now see the emergence of a real civil society in Turkey.  Many of the demonstrators are members of civil society who are making a statement about the kind of society they want to see.  Not everything we are seeing about Turkey at the moment is negative.  Clearly, there are a number of aspects of any functioning democracy.  One aspect is the rule of law, another is the right to peaceful assembly, and a further right is the right to demonstrate peacefully.  As the T&aacute;naiste has recently said in replies to parliamentary questions, we regret that the Turkish authorities appear to have ignored the appeals of the European Union to act with restraint.  Some of the things we have seen on television and the heavy-handed response of the police in some cases - which has been admitted by the Turkish authorities, who have promised to investigate - are matters of regret.  We have also seen scenes of violent demonstrators attacking police and property.  Some believe that these are not demonstrators but are in fact <i>agents provocateurs</i>, which remains to be determined.  It is a worrying situation.  It is clear that the overwhelming majority of the protestors are totally peaceful in their intentions but have been met with what one would have to call heavy-handed and violent treatment from the security forces.</p><p> What is the impact of this on Turkish accession?  Turkey is a country in transition and the Government continues to see it as a future member of the European Union.  We support Turkish membership and, during our Presidency of the Council of the European Union, have been doing our best to reinvigorate the accession process and open Chapter 22 of the enlargement process on regional policy.  We should not reject Turkey because of what is happening but need to make our views clear that we find the police reaction disturbing and inconsistent with EU membership.  That does not alter the impact of where we would like Turkey to be.  I am quite convinced that the vast majority of the demonstrators who are on the streets and being manhandled by the police would like to see Turkey's progress to EU membership continue.  The EU represents the kind of society many of those protestors would like to see.  It is a difficult moment but the interests of those who want to see Turkey continue to move forward would not be best served by bringing down the shutters on the enlargement process.  Hopefully, this situation is simply a step backwards in what is otherwise a forward progress.</p><p> I have not talked about the Austrian decision to pull out of UNDOF, the UN observer mission on the Golan Heights.  The Austrian decision was provoked by a serious deterioration in the security situation.  It is an unfortunate development.  Obviously, the Austrian Government must take the decisions it feels are necessary, but the international community, through the United Nations, will have to do something to plug the hole.  UNDOF is a significant and important peacekeeping presence.  The UN is working very hard to identify a troop contributor to fill the gap.</p><p> Deputy Crowe asked if the Syrian arms embargo issue revealed cracks in EU policy.  While it does, we must be realistic about it.  We do not have a common EU policy on every issue.  We strive very hard to have one but all of us retain the right on occasion to say &quot;No, we cannot go along with this.&quot;  We must recognise that, as there have been many occasions, particularly regarding the Israel-Palestine issue, on which Ireland has been the member state saying it cannot agree to a position.  We are still at the stage of best endeavours and it will be a long time before we are in a situation in which we agree on everything.  Ireland, including the members of the committee, will want the State to take a very firm position on some issues which would require us to say to our partners that we cannot agree to a common position.  The Israel-Palestine issue is one on which we have a clear national position which we are not prepared to abandon at this time in favour of a common EU position.  While it may be inconvenient in the case of the Syrian arms embargo, we must recognise that we are sometimes the member state that is holding out.</p> <p> We have been very much to the fore on the issue of Palestine and settlement goods.  Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad have been very active in demanding that we take that position.  The T&aacute;naiste has taken that forward in the EU and we have made progress.  The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy commissioned a study of this and we have brought it to the EU table.  The T&aacute;naiste has been very clear that he does not expect any unanimous endorsement of this.  If we are realistic, we must expect that to be the case.  What may emerge are guidelines that those countries who so wish can follow.  That will be a positive development.  We clearly wish to see a common EU-wide policy on that but, for the reasons I set out, that may not happen.  We will continue to be active.  We think citizens have the right to know whether what they are buying is a good produced in Israel or an illegally occupied Palestinian territory.  That is where we want to go.  The T&aacute;naiste is determined to continue to take a lead on that.</p><p> The situation in Mali is very complex.  We must look back to where this conflict came from.  The origins of the recent conflict effectively arose from a Tuareg uprising against the Malian government.  Many people feel the government in Bamako did not take sufficient account of the particular identity and regional diversity of the Tuareg minority.  There have been previous Tuareg uprisings that were fairly heavily put down by the Malian forces.  The Tuareg forces got the upper hand and the <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i>that took place in Bamako arose from the fact that the Malian government forces were effectively collapsing in the face of the Tuareg military campaign.  Some people ask why we are supporting a government that is the result of a <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i>.  The situation in Mali did not arise because of the <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i>.  Although we do not support it or agree with it, the <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i>was, in effect, a response to the disintegration of government writ in Mali.  With our EU partners, we are involved in trying to support a process, which is now governed by a UN Security Council resolution, to put in place a new dispensation in Mali that will have support across the country and recognise ethnic diversity.  The reason Ireland is assisting with the EU training mission is precisely to develop armed forces in Mali that are capable not only of keeping peace and order but of doing so in a way that respects the ethnic diversity and human rights of people in all parts of Mali.</p><p> In respect of the humanitarian situation, we have been putting money in there.  Ireland announced at the donor conference on 15 May that we would not only give more money but support human rights monitoring.  We are in dialogue with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to identify specific ways in which we can support that work most suitably.  The UN is putting together an integrated, strategic peacekeeping mission in Mali that will cover not just military but police and rule-of-law aspects and will replace the current African mission.  It will be a major undertaking but, again, Ireland will be very supportive of that.  We certainly feel there can be no long-term solution to the situation in Mali without addressing the situation of the Tuareg and recognising their human rights and particularly regional diversity.  Does anybody else wish to speak about Mali?  </p><p> Again, the situation in Bahrain is very complicated and difficult.  Bahrain is a particularly sad case because it was to the fore in the Arab world on many fronts, particularly in terms of the openness of its society and its recognition of women.  I remember when I was ambassador to the UN, the ambassador of Bahrain was elected as president of the General Assembly, one of only three woman to be so elected.  It fell to me by coincidence, as head of the Western European and Others Group at the time, to welcome and recognise this.  This was a time when Bahrain was being lauded as a model for other Arab states to follow.  Sadly, we see that it is a country riven by religious division.  The Government has made very clear its unhappiness with and condemnation of the events that took place there and the ongoing crackdown on and abuse of civil and human rights activists.  We support the effort that is under way to enter into a national dialogue.  Dialogue is the only way this will be resolved peacefully.  I cannot see it being resolved in any other way at the moment.  </p><p> The EU has also expressed its criticism and condemnation of what is happening.  It is probably true to say that not all member states are as outspoken as we are on the issue but we do not miss any opportunity to raise our concerns with Bahrain.  We see that it is a situation that can be turned around with the right policies.  It is not a lost cause and we urge the government there to take the right path.  Does Mr. Kelly wish to say a bit more on the EU approach?  Is there anything he would like to add?</p></speech>

The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy has commented on it and it has attracted quite an amount of attention in the European Parliament.  The EU is trying to be supportive of Bahrain as it goes through a difficult transition and has offered assistance to the process of national dialogue to try to further that.  Progress has been slow because it is seen as the best hope for Bahrain and for introducing reforms, particularly the recommendations of the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry, which made strong recommendations about the need to safeguard human rights.  We are satisfied that our EU partners share our concerns about the human rights situation.</p></speech>

Clearly, they are at different stages of development and of the relationship.  The most advanced is Ukraine, although there are still some issues before we can get to the point of signing an association agreement.  The Ukrainian authorities have undertaken to do a range of things such as rectify selective justice, deal with the issues that were identified in the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, ODIHR, election report, and a range of matters including addressing the issue of Mrs. Yulia Tymoshenko.  They have to do a number of things.  An EU parliamentary delegation is in Ukraine working to see if a bridge can be built between Ukraine and the EU so that by next November we, as EU members, will be in a position to sign the association agreement, which would be a very significant step in Ukraine's prospective looking towards the EU.</p><p> The other members of the Eastern Partnership are at different stages of the relationship but are more or less progressing.  There are issues with Belarus which will need to be addressed.  The human rights situation there is obviously of significant concern.  The EU has been very active in focusing on building up democratic institutions with the southern neighbours and supporting the efforts towards democratisation, and that effort will continue in the coming period.</p></speech>

Again, this was an unfortunate situation.  Nobody wants it to be that way, certainly in the West.  The concerns about Iran's nuclear programme are not confined to the US and Israel.  They are very real and they are shared; we share them.  The work of the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, has given rise to serious and justified concerns.  The international community, which is grouped in this three-plus-three formation, has tried extremely hard to engage genuinely with the Iranian authorities to seek to make some progress on this, and it has not been forthcoming.  The sanctions have been applied very much as a last resort and we, the international community, have made every effort to try to apply them in a way that will not harm the Iranian community.  It is very difficult to apply sanctions that have no impact on people on the ground, particularly when one has to keep winding them up to a higher level because one is getting no response.</p><p>  There are elections in the next few days.  We sincerely hope they will lead to a more enlightened approach on the part of the Iranian Administration, because the long-term situation is extremely worrying.  The last thing one wants in the Middle East is another state with nuclear weapons.  The international community is very much trying to avoid that, not just because we do not want another such state but because there are some in the region who have made it very clear they will not tolerate that and nobody knows what the repercussions would be.  At all costs we want to avoid military action and see Iran fully re-integrated into the international community as a country that is co-operating on nuclear policies and is free from sanctions.</p></speech>

I asked a parliamentary question about this.  While the sanctions are intended for one purpose, the repercussions are that the ordinary, poorer Iranian people are suffering because of them.  One wonders about their impact on the political world.</p></speech>

Mr. Kelly might be able to come back to the Deputy on that.  If Iran is ever on the agenda of the EU Foreign Affairs Council, the People's Mujahidin of Iran always has a big demonstration in Brussels.  It is able to mobilise people in the expatriate community.  We have expressed concerns about it in the past.  It has been guilty of a number of very violent outrages and deaths.  It does not command any real support within Iran.  That said, there is a particular situation with regard to Camp Ashraf in Iraq, where we and other members of the international community have been active in trying to deal with Iranian refugees based in Iraq who are opposed to the Iranian regime but no longer have the support of the Iraqi authorities.  We are active on that front but, as an organisation, while it represents a strand of opinion in the expatriate community, we do not regard it as providing the future course for Iran.  One cannot get away from the fact that the regime government in Tehran still enjoys a substantial degree of support from within the country and we feel the solution to Iran's difficulty rests within the country through reconciliation and a more open and democratic system.</p></speech>

The People's Mujahidin of Iran has no support base of any substance in Iran but the diaspora supports it to some degree.  Could the Department of Foreign Affairs officials explain their views on such important people as Mr. John Bruton speaking in Paris, ostensibly on behalf of Ireland and other parliamentarians, and the interesting presence of very senior military generals, among others, from the US military, and their involvement with this group?</p></speech>

That would have been a litmus test of what support it had in Iran.  Why did they reject it if there would be no support there for it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-12a.351" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Cooney" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013061200010#J00100"><p>Unfortunately, they rejected many candidates, including some senior figures within the governing elite.  I believe they were rejected because they did not like opposition, even from within their own cadre.  If the Mujahidin had been able to put up its own candidate, it would have been a test of the support.  I could comment on why US generals were there.  I do not believe it is a secret that the United States is not supportive of the regime in Tehran and would be only too happy if it were to fall one way or another.  On the issue of Mr. John Bruton addressing it, he is probably still a politician at heart.  I know he acted as EU ambassador in Washington, but I suspect he is more of a politician than a diplomat at heart.  The Deputy will need to ask him why he was there.</p></speech>

There is a considerable expatriate community outside Iran, which is very active and well funded.  As often happens with expatriate communities, they would be very happy to see regime change in their home country.  There are differing views as to how that should be achieved.  As of now, the People's Mujahidin of Iran has foresworn military activities.  Therefore, it would now present itself as a political movement rather than a military movement, which begs the question as to why US generals are there.</p><p>  Have I covered everything?</p></speech>

We have answered a number of parliamentary questions on Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Progress has been very disappointing.  Progress appeared likely and there seemed to be a coming together before the elections at the end of last year.  However, it has dissipated.  Nobody wants to see progress in Bosnia-Herzegovina more than we do, but as we have pointed out in answers to the more recent parliamentary questions, at the end of the day only the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina can resolve this matter.  We cannot circumvent arrangements on the ground.  Unless and until the people can come together and implement meaningful political structures and introduce the necessary reforms, we are not able to move forward.  That country needs to get itself ready for EU membership; that is effectively what I am saying.</p><p>  The same applies to Macedonia.  The name is an issue, but the progress for which we had hoped on the political front has not been as forthcoming as we had hoped.  The political leadership needs to take matters in hand.  There has been more constructive engagement on the name issue of late and one is hopeful progress can be achieved.  If that were the only obstacle to progress, that would be one thing, but there are things that need to be done on the ground.</p><p>  Again, there are positive signs on Albania, but we are not there yet.  All of these countries need to join the European Union.  The Union will be better when they join, but they need to introduce the reforms necessary to be able to be members of it.</p><p>  I was in Zimbabwe last year to view the situation on the ground.  On our return we actively tried to get the EU embargo lifted.  Everyone we met there, including people who had been the victims of torture, said sanctions were not working.  There was a partial lifting of sanctions.  It is a country that still has problems, but Ireland is engaged bilaterally and we are more than ready to get engaged to a much greater extent once it has a stable political system.  We are awaiting the new constitution.  We have to see elections, on which there is much riding.  However, we are more than ready to become engaged with Zimbabwe on a bilateral basis.</p><p>  As Mr. Donoghue knows more about Russia than I will ever know, I ask him to answer the points on Russia and the Magnitsky issue</p></speech>

The issue of whether to impose sanctions on those involved in his death is one that has been discussed in many parliaments.  Our view has been that it is an issue we should raise every time there is a summit.  There are two summits a year between Russia and the European Union and we have been active in ensuring this is done.  We will continue to be active in that regard.  Our view is that this is the way to have a longer term effect on Russian authorities on the issue.</p></speech>

All I can say is the relationship at EU level has been transformed.  From an Irish perspective we have been very active and our ambassador in Hanoi has been appointed on a non-resident basis.  He has been there several times with companies, and a scoping mission is due to go out in several weeks to examine how we might develop or introduce assistance in Myanmar through the Irish Aid programme and how we might look to expand our trade connections.  It will be a mixed delegation with people involved in trade and development.  It is very positive but we recognise we still have problems and issues to address and we are very keen to help the authorities in Myanmar to do so.</p></speech>

The first part of the meeting continued for longer than we expected and I apologise.  I am sure the witnesses listened to what the Secretary General and his team had to say, which was of interest to them in their work.</p><p>  I welcome the following: Mr. Hans Zomer, director of D&oacute;chas; Mr. Jim Clarken, chairperson of D&oacute;chas and CEO of Oxfam; Ms Lorna Gold, a member of the board of D&oacute;chas and head of policy and advocacy of Tr&oacute;caire with which the committee has very good relations; and Mr. Sorley McCaughey, head of policy and advocacy of Christian Aid Ireland.  They are all welcome and represent a broad spectrum of our NGOs under the umbrella group of D&oacute;chas.</p><p>  The meeting will deal with two important aspects of development policy.  There is growing awareness of the fact that poverty reduction cannot be achieved by aid alone and other policies such as trade, agriculture, climate change and migration security have the potential to make positive and negative impacts on the poor in developing countries.  Recognition of this important principle is fundamental to our search for policy coherence for development.  When I addressed the conference on this issue at the European Parliament in April I drew on the 2006 White Paper which stressed that coherence is about more than vetting decisions for a potential negative impact on development.  It is also about harnessing the potential throughout Government for ideas and actions which can contribute to sustainable global development and the objectives of Irish Aid.</p><p>  I am glad to see this principle recognised and brought to the fore by the new policy document, One World, One Future, which we launched at Irish Aid headquarters recently.  There is growing consensus that policy coherence for development should be at the centre of the post-2015 development agenda.  This meeting is timely in the context of the post-2015 scenario, particularly in view of the UN special event on the millennium development goals which will take place in New York in September.  I hope our discussion today will be a useful contribution to the formulation of Government policy and ultimately EU policy in advance of this very important UN event.  It is also in advance of the G8 meeting which will take place next week in Fermanagh and at which these issues will be raised also.  I am delighted the witnesses have come before the committee prior to this event and I know Mr. Zomer was anxious to be here.</p><p>    By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>  I apologise for postponing the meeting last week but the witnesses would probably have been speaking to an empty house, and we certainly want to make this much more relevant to the committee so its members are part of the discussion.  All members of the committee have an interest in this area.</p></speech>

In the interest of time I will be very brief.  D&oacute;chas represents a broad spectrum of NGOs.  As members may know, we represent 51 organisations which work together through D&oacute;chas and learn from each other and improve practice in our efforts to eradicate global poverty.  Our 51 members are supported by 700,000 people, employ 4,000 staff and 400 volunteers and work in 70 countries.  They bring to bear this experience and breadth of expertise to inform their views on their work and government policies and how these policies support or potentially obstruct our work.  My colleagues illustrate this range of expertise and without further ado I will hand over to them.</p></speech>

We have welcomed the launch of the new policy and D&oacute;chas and the individual agencies will put together comprehensive responses to it.</p> <p>There was a very long consultation process which was run in order to develop the idea in the first place, and that was welcomed.</p><p> We welcome a number of key areas, such as the strengthening of human rights language, as we have advocated this, and the strengthening of gender language, particularly the reference to inequality, access to assets, women smallholder farmers and education etc.  There is also the pledge to be open, transparent and accountable.  Within this there are areas of concern that will require development over time.  The implementation of the policy is where the rubber will hit the road and we certainly want to engage in that process.  There is a really good opportunity for the committee, as an oversight body, to have an opportunity to consider this and the key areas of concern.</p><p> There is the issue of policy coherence, what it really means and how the whole of government policies can either enhance development effectiveness or cause damage to it.  That is something in which this group can have a really important role and help in ensuring there is no damage.  The Chairman has mentioned his own interest in that respect and I know others will have very strong views on that too.</p><p> Climate change is a new theme within the policy but we are concerned about the language in that, including adaptation and the lack of a sense of commitment and responsibility in terms of mitigation.  This concerns what we as Ireland will do and what is our responsibility.  Those types of issues must be strengthened to ensure we deliver.  It was mentioned in the introduction that the policy speaks of going beyond aid, as we know aid is not the solution to global poverty on its own.  Nevertheless, aid is important and we are not in a position to move beyond aid just yet; we will not be able to do so for quite a long time.  The aid budget has seen a dramatic cut over a number of years to a point where it has been reduced by over a third.  The commitment from the Government is to remain stable at approximately 0.5% of GDP and move to 0.7% of GDP when we can afford it.  That is a change in language from the original policy and it is moving from the 2015 commitment.  We would encourage this to happen as soon as possible.</p><p> There are two areas the committee would like us to address.  We have been heavily involved in post-2015 discussions and Ireland plays a key role in co-chairing September's important event in New York.  That will speak to what the new framework might look like and we have been very involved in feeding into that in many ways.  It is important to recognise that this is a moment to acknowledge how far we have gone in delivering the millennium development goals and what can be done between now and 2015.  It is not over yet and we can accelerate progress.  There is plenty more to be done and it is not a case of just drawing a line under the process.  Today we will discuss the post-2015 framework and how that will change the way we think about development.  We should not forget that we are not yet done.</p><p> With regard to policy coherence, there are several areas of which the committee should be aware, and we will illustrate some practical examples.  The committee may have heard of them but not seen the implications they have on our development efforts.  They will continue to grow over time and the importance of the committee's role within this will be developed.  It has a specific mention in the policy and we are very interested in the committee's thoughts and how we can support it in the work it must do in the area.</p><p> I will now hand over to Mr. McCaughey, who will speak about policy coherence issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-12a.385" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sorley McCaughey" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013061200012#L00200"><p>I will get straight to the issue.  The new Government policy on international development, One World. One Future, was launched very recently.  It rightly recognises that the actions to promote poverty eradication and sustainable development globally go much further than just overseas development aid.  The primary responsibility for delivery of overseas development aid rests within the Irish Aid section of the Department but the policies and priorities of other Departments have a significant impact on development outcomes, which has been clear because of recent examples such as the focus on taxation.  Christian Aid has documented many times that developing countries are losing much more to tax evasion, facilitated in part by the abuse of the current international financial regulations, and another example is the poverty impact of bio-fuel policies promoted in part by the department of communications, energy and natural environment within the EU, which is having a detrimental consequence on hunger and food insecurity in countries around the world.  The commitment to increasing or growing bio-fuels across the world is resulting in a modern day land-grab, with greater carbon emissions, as traditional growth is being cut down and replaced by bio-fuels that will power vehicles in this part of the world.  These are clear examples of an incoherence in policy that is having a detrimental effect on developing countries.</p><p>  I could not help but notice a reference to our emerging relationship with Burma, with the director general referencing our approach both from an aid and trade perspective.  This encapsulates the challenges to be faced by implementing an effective policy coherence strategy and what is driving the priorities behind the relationship with Burma.  Will policy coherence for development be prioritised or will it be subservient to a more trade-focused approach.  We must be mindful of such issues in a policy coherence context, and there are many other examples of incoherence of which we must be aware.</p><p>  Policy coherence for development is not a new idea and it is meant to address the way Departments can tend to work in silos and without any great mindfulness of what other Departments are doing.  As the 2006 White Paper mentions, it is meant to harness the potential across government for ideas and actions which contribute to sustainable global development and the objectives of Irish Aid.  That would be at its best, although we are falling quite far short of that now.</p><p>  As signatories to the Lisbon treaty, the Government has taken on the responsibility to ensure greater coherence between policies so as to ensure the policies in one area do not undermine development co-operation objectives.  The following may be a set principle that should be maintained regardless of where we are economically as a country.  Ensuring policy coherence is also a value for money issue and a means by which Irish taxpayers can be confident that aid is being delivered and spent in the most cost-effective way.  Our efforts with Irish Aid should not be undermined by the efforts or policies of another Department.</p><p>  Since 2006, successive Governments have taken up a number of measures to promote greater policy coherence and the interdepartmental committee for development was established in 2007, with approximately 14 meetings since its inception, averaging three a year, although the frequency has diminished recently.  The initial intention was for it to meet six times a year, with non-governmental organisations to be briefed following meetings to invite their views and comments.  We are falling somewhat short on that as well but there could be new momentum in support of that.</p><p>  Two of the more interesting developments in support of the policy coherence agenda have been studies commissioned by the Irish Aid advisory board with Trinity College to understand the main areas of policy coherence.  Some 91 recommendations were made but it is unclear, as yet, as to what extent they have been absorbed or implemented by the relevant Departments.  In 2011 the advisory board again commissioned Trinity College to develop a framework of indicators for monitoring policy coherence for development across eight areas, and that framework needs work and discussion.  It is encouraging that in the new policy document there is a reference to the need for indicators to measure the effectiveness of policy coherence for development in future.</p> <p> The new Irish Aid policy represents a modest improvement on the issue of policy coherence, although there are some concerns.  The policy shifts alignment away from PCD towards a whole-of-Government approach.  There is only one reference to the legal requirement of PCD and that is in the context of obligations under the EU.  Our view is that while this whole-of-Government approach is useful, as it refers to one of the key processes through which policy coherence can be achieved, it needs to be linked very closely to policy coherence.  Otherwise it could risk becoming confused or subject to other non-development interests.  I refer to the Burma example.  Another concern would be that given the increasing language around building synergies with the private sector, there is a greater need for clarity on policy coherence for development as a driver of the whole-of-Government approach.</p><p> The new policy also makes provision for the interdepartmental committee to be strengthened.  It will become an oversight body for policy coherence, will develop targets and indicators and will identify specific policy areas on which to focus.  It will produce biennial reports for the Cabinet and this Oireachtas committee.  This is a very positive move in the right direction, but there is a number of additional measures we believe must be addressed as well.  It will require sufficient political backing and institutional support.  This is not an easy issue, otherwise it would have been done a long time ago.  Policy coherence challenges Departments to do things in a way they have not previously done them and it will require the highest level of political commitment if it is going to work.  Given that the agenda spreads across a number of Oireachtas committees, greater parliamentary oversight will be absolutely essential.</p><p> If the interdepartmental committee in its current guise is to have a greater role, it must become more transparent.  The means for engagement in its work must be made clearer.  In particular, the choice of policy issues, the indicators adopted and the criteria for resolving policy incoherence must be made clearer.  When issues of incoherence are identified, what will be done with them and how will they be addressed?</p><p> I will finish with some concrete suggestions for the committee on policy coherence.  We propose that the committee take a much more proactive role in the Department and the interdepartmental committee.  Can it review the proposed areas for consideration, its implementation plan and the indicators to track performance?  Can there be greater engagement from the interdepartmental committee with NGOs?  To date, only D&oacute;chas has appeared before the committee, yet policy coherence regularly features in civil society work in areas such as trade, tax and food security.  Similarly, engagement with Irish Aid partner countries could also be strengthened.  This would constitute a viable means of assessing policy impacts on developing countries.  As of yet, the committee has not received formal presentations from partner country representatives and the developing country component has yet to enter into the Irish PCD institutional structure.  A question the committee could ask is, on what basis will the interdepartmental committee have oversight of PCD and how will it exercise that oversight role?  Again, this refers back to the need for a high level oversight role for this committee.</p><p> Finally, given that this committee's remit only extends to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, will the biennial report also be discussed by other committees, jointly by relevant committees or, given the scope of the issues, perhaps by an Oireachtas debate?  In this context and given that this is a cross-departmental issue, we are of the view that the Taoiseach has the key role in both providing the leadership and the oversight for this process.  I will conclude with that, although there are many other issues to discuss.</p></speech>

I will talk about the post 2015 framework, the negotiations that are currently under way at the UN and Ireland's engagement in that.</p><p>  Over the past 12 to 18 months, D&oacute;chas and its members have been involved in a number of initiatives to feed into the current negotiations on what will succeed the millennium development goals that were signed in 2000.  These goals are due to expire in 2015 and current negotiations at EU and UN levels are on what framework will succeed the millennium development goals.  Irish civil society has been one of the leaders in this, in terms of civil society in the north.  We have had a leading role in the Beyond 2015 coalition and we have been engaged in many thematic consultations at UN level.  We have also been deeply engaged, through the coincidence of Ireland's EU Presidency at this time, with shaping the EU position for the EU summit in September.</p><p>  In addition, D&oacute;chas has hosted a series of discussions and hearings at Irish level involving local civil society and domestic NGO organisations to address what Ireland's role in building a better world could be in the post-2015 discussions.  It is the only place in the world, as far as we are aware, that international NGOs and national based organisations have come together to adopt a joint set of conclusions around what should be in the framework.  We have been pleased with the striking similarity of what people here are asking for in the framework and what we are hearing from our various partners in the developing world.  I will briefly mention the principles people are seeking.</p><p>  The first relates to addressing growing inequality within societies and between countries.  The second is related to the importance of having government and governing structures that are open to citizens' needs.  The third is about balancing social and economic models of development that respect environmental boundaries.  The fourth principle is about the universality of a human rights based framework which should underpin all decision making.  The final principle is the importance of ensuring that economic activity benefits people and not the economy for itself.</p><p>  With regard to Ireland in its role as Presidency, we acknowledge that the Government has played a really positive role in this negotiation to date.  As Presidency, we put into practice some of the principles around policy coherence which Sorley McCaughey just mentioned.  The Presidency has shown that where innovation is needed, even at EU level, policy coherence can be brought forward.  It has done this in very practical ways, for example, having joint Conclusions between two sets of European Councils, such as the environment Council and the foreign affairs Council.  Rather than negotiating two different agreements around the 2015 framework, it brought the different Council groupings together and produced one set of Conclusions that both Councils then agreed.</p><p>  Ireland will play a key role in the UN event in September.  It will co-host the event with South Africa at the UN.  Ireland is in a very important position, even beyond the EU Presidency.  The Council conclusions on post-2015 are very strong and one can see the influence that various civil society groups have had on them.  Particular strengths of the European conclusions are the human rights based language and approach adopted in them, the strength of the gender equality language and an acknowledgement of the need to move beyond GDP as the sole marker of progress in a new framework and to look at what other indicators of national progress can be used in the framework.  There are some weaknesses, including the lack of timeframes and solid commitments on how the EU will show leadership and strong commitment to action before September.  Showing leadership and commitment, particularly around financial commitments on development aid, is a key marker in terms of the success of the UN process and how the UN process could go in the September summit.</p><p>  I have outlined Ireland's role in the EU conclusions.  As we draw closer to the September summit, countless reports are coming out and there is the beginning of negotiations between governments on what the negotiated position might resemble in September.</p> <p>We have some concerns about the direction it is taking.  The first is whether the strength of the EU position on human rights will make its way into the negotiated final text.  There are moves to water down the language and this applies in particular to the language used with regard to gender equality.  The second concern is that while there is rhetorically a commitment to sustainability, looking at what is beyond growth and finding other indicators that can be used, the high-level panel report commissioned by the UN Secretary General fails to address the incoherence between trade, regulation of business and foreign direct investment, especially in respect of environmental sustainability.  There is a sense that the approach is a rhetorical acknowledgement of the issues on the one hand but a business as usual approach on the other.  One can see this in terms of the language of the report and the moving away from environmental sustainability towards sustainable growth.  There is confusion in the language.</p><p> The final concern is our view that the agreement must be universal, with differentiated responsibility but equal accountability to the global framework.  In the last round of the millennium development goals, one goal applied to northern donor countries, NDG No. 8, and included commitments to trade, aid and debt cancellation.  The commitments were never adhered to and the indicators for them were very weak.  Now, it is proposed there will be 12 goals, the 12th of which will be the northern commitment to a global enabling environment.  These commitments must be strengthened, in particular the commitment to trade regulation, climate change and development finance.</p><p> On the topic of what this committee can do with regard to the post-2015 process, the Chairman referred to the EU position on September.  Our understanding is that the position has been agreed and signed off and it is now moving into intergovernmental negotiations.  This committee could have some joint sittings to cover this and while other relevant committees could scrutinise the EU position and Ireland's position on that.  This might not be possible before September but beyond September the negotiation will take place until September 2015.  Once it goes into intergovernmental negotiation, there is scope to engage the Government and relevant Departments.  If possible, it should be some process that involves more than this committee alone, although that would also be valuable.</p><p> The second point concerns Ireland's role in the United Nations Human Rights Council.  Our membership of the council could play a key strategic role in strengthening and sustaining the human rights language in the post-2015 framework.  It might be possible for the committee to engage with the human rights unit and to encourage it to take up the issue of human rights within the post-2015 framework in the United Nations Human Rights Council.</p><p> The third point concerns the event in September and the importance of having Oireachtas representation at the summit.  We have also spoken to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on the question of engaging civil society.  It is very important, given that key negotiating positions are being decided at EU level.  There is a danger national-level parliaments could be left out of the negotiating process.</p></speech>

They have challenged more traditional thinking on the topic.  Trade is a considerable way out of aid.  When we look at the extent of the wealth in the developing world, such as oil, gas and minerals, alarming is too mild to describe what is being lost to the developing world.  The developing world could solve all of our problems in the West if it was done in a fairer way then has been the case.</p><p>  We know about tax avoidance and evasion and there is no doubt we are seeing a new colonialism.  The new colonialism includes trade agreements that are less than fair to developing countries.  Some of the reasons include the lack of capacity of the Governments to negotiate fairly, corruption on the part of Governments that negotiate and do so for themselves, and the severe lack of parliamentary oversight.  Even when new regimes come into power and one expects better things from them, they fall into old habits very quickly.</p><p>  I refer to the greater capacity of multinational companies to work systems.  We know they are profit driven and whether they are European, American or Chinese, corporate interests are their gods.  Policy coherence is going to be very difficult.  We are not in the best position to talk about the basic principle of countries being able to decide on their economic policies.  We could serve as an example of how not to do it.  We can promote what is being called economic democracy.</p><p>  Bio-fuels are a major issue and we cannot give with one hand and take with another.  There must be a stronger voice for, at the very least, achieving the 5% target.  The target figure should be 0%.  There has not been enough emphasis on labour rights becoming part of trade agreements in a binding way.  There is need for support within communities.  I attended the Mary Robinson conference.  There was a great voice from people who had come from the developing world.  They know what to do and they know what they need.  They need extra capacity.  They need support on complex legal processes involving their land.  This is something we can build in.</p><p>  Wearing the hat of the Association of European Parliamentarians for Africa, AWEPA, we are starting joint monitoring teams and I hope this is something we can bring to the two countries with which we are starting.  Deputy Crowe is involved with Tanzania and I will be in Mozambique.  We will take with us the points that have been made here and it can be part of a real and meaningful discussion with the politicians we will meet from those two countries.  I know some committee members are coming to the AWEPA conference at the end of the month.  We can engage African parliamentarians when they are here and challenge some of their thinking.</p></speech>

It is hard to respond to it.  Mr. Jim Clarken mentioned the need to put on paper how all of the aspirations expressed in the document will be implemented.  The Minister has indicated that the next step is to publish an implementation document.  That is coming but the point is well made.</p><p>  Policy coherence is a huge area and it is hard enough to get policy coherence within one country.  Then, it must be done throughout the EU and the rest of the world.  On bio-fuels alone, the EU policy was introduced with the best of intentions and was seen as an environmentally-friendly measure but it took years to get it introduced and it is now a big ship that must be turned around.  There were unintended consequences, which have been recognised, but turning it around will also have consequences for European farmers.  It will take time to completely undo what was done for the best reasons, which turned out not to be the best idea.  Environmental policy changes all the time in any event when things like that happen.</p> <p>At least there is a recognition that there is a major problem in regard to tax evasion.</p><p> On the millennium development goals' which are very close to my heart, I have raised a number of the issues involved by way of parliamentary question or Topical Issue debate with the Minister.  There was a move to change the language used in terms of a commitment to gender equality, maternal health and reproductive rights.  There was pressure from other European Union countries and the last meeting on 28 May agreed a draft EU position and the language was changed.  I was pleasantly surprised to see quite strong statements being made.  It will go to the Environment Council of Ministers on 18 June and be formally adopted by the General Affairs Council on 25 June.  I was conscious that in our role as President we really would have to push this issue and I am reasonably happy with what has been agreed.</p><p> The European Union will have a significant input into what will eventually come out of New York, but it is something of which even little Ireland which will no longer hold the Presidency must be mindful and continue to push at every opportunity.  The committee is very committed to doing this.  As was said, we are not yet done.  It extends to 2015.  Are there 15 objectives?</p></speech>

Policy coherence for development was mentioned.  It seemed to be a strong thread throughout all of the presentations.  The inter-parliamentary committee and the need for it to be transparent were also mentioned.  From the delegates' experience of looking at other countries, have they identified, through their analysis, a model of best practice that could be applied in Ireland, which might be of interest to us and which we could promote?</p><p>  The delegates mentioned transparency, value for money and so on.  I am sure it was inherent in what they said, but an important component is ethical values underpinning policy which was not mentioned.  That should be a strong component of anything we do.  In terms of value for money, do the delegates undertake evaluations of the aid they provide in terms of effectiveness and the value they achieve and make recommendations to improve these in the future?  </p><p>  I picked up a comment on Irish Aid partner countries.  I have raised this issue before, but perhaps I was not clear about the answer because I am inclined to raise it again.  In the European Union in which many countries play their part and are keen to do so there should be more military type co-ordination of how we do this.  I know emergencies occur where it is all hands to the pump to drive things, but in other areas one could target or focus on a geographical area in order that everyone is not focusing on the one area, leaving many others neglected.  Specific areas of aid delivery should be looked at.  For example, some countries would be in a very good position to provide aid and be particularly expert in the field of education, while another might have expertise in a different area.  Important in all of this is confidence.  The delegates mentioned the need for the State and the private sector to play their part.  </p><p>  I raised the issue of the situation in Ethiopia where Irish aid had gone towards abortion services.  Many taxpayers would not be happy about this and it could affect their propensity to donate funds to organisations.  </p><p>  An issue which came up in the not too distant past with NGOs was the salaries being paid as some appeared excessive.  The issue of administrative costs as a proportion of expenditure often comes up.  Norms and good standards need to be developed.  In Uganda money intended for good causes ended up in areas in which it was never intended to be spent because of corrupt governance systems.  Will the delegates comment on this?  </p><p>  I think Ms Gold mentioned language and Deputy Olivia Mitchell endorsed the point I will make about the strength of the European Union around human rights and the language being used.  I think Ms Gold mentioned gender equality, while Deputy Olivia Mitchell mentioned maternal health and reproductive rights.  It is essential that basic and fundamental human rights are part of the process.  However, I have concerns that there is a danger of ideology-driven conditions being included which have nothing to do with benefiting countries but which are all about exporting ideologies, some of them feminist.  I am a strong opponent of abortion.  In Britain and the United States just under one in four pregnancies is aborted.  I am told that in New York one in two pregnancies is aborted.  These are not the kinds of thing I would like to see exported as part of our aid package to countries which have better values than we do in these areas.  We need to challenge some of the language used.  While on the surface it may seem like language that is very soft and tenable in some ways, the intent behind it is far from soft and the interests of the populations and people to whom the aid is being given.  That needs to be challenged, but, unfortunately, the United Nations is highly deficient in this area in which it should be strong.  If one goes back to the 1948 Convention on Human Rights, how far that organisation has strayed from the interpretation of the vision at the time is very significant.</p></speech>

I do not think we do this often enough.  Officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade appeared before the committee to talk about its ambassadors, but the goodwill ambassadors for Ireland are clearly the members of these organisations.  The transformative nature of their work is fantastic.</p><p>  I refer to the document sent to us on 5 June.  It states poverty reduction cannot be achieved by aid alone and that as "development" is a broad and all-encompassing term, the Government needs to consider how it will impact on the development objectives.  Rather than members asking the delegates questions, they challenged us in many of their questions.</p> <p>In fairness, the questions being put to us have not really been discussed, to my knowledge.  Perhaps they have been discussed at Government level or perhaps I missed a committee meeting at which they were discussed.  We have not dealt with the question of how we are going to scrutinise and co-ordinate this work.  In that context, this committee has been challenged by the questions posed today.  I genuinely do not know how we will deal with this.  It is one of the big weaknesses of our system that interdepartmental co-ordination or co-operation is very difficult, if not impossible.  I do not know how we will co-ordinate the work of the various Departments that are relevant here.  There is an enormous amount of work to be done in this regard and that work needs a champion, whether it be a Minister or an official.  Someone needs to pull the whole thing together.  That is probably a discussion for another day.  Perhaps the Department of the Taoiseach could be the lead department, although I do not know if the Taoiseach himself would have enough time.  Certainly, someone needs to take it on.</p><p> We know that reducing poverty and lifting people above the $1.25 per day income level is extremely important.  We must focus on the question of income poverty and, in the context of the post-2015 framework, we must focus on those who live on $2 per day, $4 a per day and so forth.  How important is the question of income inequality in the context of the post-2015 framework?  What targets should be set and how will progress be measured?  I do not know the answers in this regard.  Where will we be at the end of this process?  I ask the witnesses to give their opinion on Ireland's policy document, One World, One Future.  What, if anything, has been left out of that document?  What has been ignored or overlooked in the context of the post-2015 development framework?</p><p> On the issue of income inequality, recent events in Bangladesh hit the headlines here and changes have been made to the terms and conditions of some employees in the garment sector there as a result.  Those dreadful events had a big impact and served as a wake-up call for the West in terms of how our purchasing decisions can have an impact on the quality of life for those in developing countries.</p><p> In the context of climate change, I am interested in the witnesses' views on the carbon credit system, whereby richer countries buy carbon credits and dump their waste in Third World countries.  We buy carbon credits from developing or Third World countries while continuing to pump out fumes and so forth but the planet is still suffering.  The world is still getting warmer and this does not make sense to me.  I have seen film footage of nothing but miles and miles of palm trees being grown to feed our ferocious appetite for fuel.</p><p> What do the witnesses believe the Irish Government can do to make Irish Aid more accountable and transparent?  I ask that question against the backdrop of what happened in Uganda recently.  How do we make EU aid programmes more accountable and transparent?  Scrutiny by these Houses may be of some benefit but are there other options we should consider?</p></speech>

In that sense, I am in catch-up mode.  In that context, I thank D&oacute;chas for assisting me by providing some clarity on the issue.  I also educate myself by attending Irish Aid functions, the most recent one involving Ms Mary Robinson in Dublin Castle, which was very interesting.  I thank the witnesses for praising the Government's policy document, One World, One Future, and for their constructive contribution today.  However, I am still struggling to understand what we can do.  The oversight issue is extremely complex.  The witnesses suggested that this committee should be overseeing the work of the interdepartmental committee.  The question of the scrutiny of EU positions was also raised.  While I do not wish to speak for my colleagues on this committee who may feel they have more time for scrutinising, I can say from my experience over the past two years that there is not even sufficient time to scrutinise the EU documentation we are obliged to scrutinise.</p><p>  We are all very conscious of the millennium development goals and the new goals that will come into effect after 2015.  Ireland is a small country which is praised highly for its development goals and its Irish Aid programmes.  However, one must put our contribution in a global context.  In terms of aid to refugees in Syria, for example, Europe has contributed &euro;400 million, while we have contributed &euro;9 million.  If one takes the aid budget of all countries into consideration, Ireland is only a minnow.  Therefore, I must ask how we can have the influence the witnesses are calling for in terms of the 12 new goals that will be set.  As I understand it, those goals are predicated on the enormous budgets of the EU and the UN.  This is a small committee that also deals with trade, among other things.  The committee does not just deal with Irish Aid and our overseas aid programmes.  I am doing my best to understand how we can reach policy coherence here.  I am relying, in that context, on our Chairman, who has vast experience in this area and who will guide the committee.</p><p>  I have two specific questions for the witnesses.  First, is GOAL now an affiliate member of D&oacute;chas?  My second question relates to an issue that is frequently raised and which was referred to by my colleague, Senator Jim Walsh, that is, fertility in the context of women's rights and human rights.  I understand that Christian Aid is an affiliate of D&oacute;chas.  We have occasionally had witnesses in before this committee explaining such matters to us.  We had, for example, a lesbian leader from Uganda who explained that attempts are being made in that country to change the law to allow for the execution of lesbians and gays.  The witnesses were very critical of the role of the Christian churches in Uganda, and indeed I have heard that replicated in the context of other countries.  It appears that Christian organisations, be they evangelical or Catholic, are very unsympathetic and do not assist such people in upholding their human rights.  I ask the witnesses to comment briefly on that.</p></speech>

Senator Walsh's questions were probably most particularly directed at me in terms of the oversight of NGOs and the co-ordination of aid.  We always maintain that the co-ordination of aid needs to happen on site, that is, in the recipient countries.  In most countries, there is an effective government and it is our role as NGOs to co-ordinate through government structures, either at national or local level.  However, in some situations, the task of co-ordination overwhelms governments, usually in a crisis.</p> <p>In those cases, there are co-ordination mechanisms through UN agencies and there is also self-regulation of the aid agencies.  In the humanitarian sector we do this on a thematic basis.  We call these things clusters, so organisations working on water or shelter projects would get together, usually under UN leadership.  Many of the structures are in place; people just do not see them.</p><p> There was a question about the overheads of NGOs and the salary levels and whether there were norms and standards.  There are standards, but it is up to each organisation to set its own level of remuneration for its chief executives.  We say they must be transparent about that.  If anyone is unhappy about the levels of salary, there can be an open discussion.  D&oacute;chas members have all signed up to a code of conduct on corporate governance which sets explicit standards on transparency and accountability that we demand of our members.  We offer an invitation to anyone in Ireland - particularly the committee, as law makers - to test us to see if the information we are providing is adequate for the committee to judge whether too much is being spent on salaries or other overheads.  I would argue that overheads are not a helpful measure of the impact of an organisation.  The best measure of the quality of a development NGO is to ask the people we are serving if they are happy with our work.  That is difficult for practical reasons, so we look for proxy indicators.  The overhead levels, however, are unreliable.  What one organisation refers to as an overhead, another organisation might call a programme cost.  There is probably a case to be made that the organisations with higher overheads are more effective because it means they are investing in research and quality control in the evaluation the committee is looking for.  Most of us would feel restrained because people would say these are overheads, we call them quality control costs.  I will send the committee the material we have on the demands on an NGO and I suggest that overheads and administration costs are not a good starting point.</p><p> Corruption often arises as a concern when discussing development aid.  The vast majority of corruption in the world does not happen in an aid context, but in the interface between government and private sector.  Research shows the net benefit of development is that it reduces corruption.  That is not to say there is no instance of malpractice in the sector - this is a high-risk business - but Irish development NGOs have the structures in place to reduce the potential as much as we can.  The bottom line is that overseas aid helps to build those checks and balances in the countries we are working with to reduce and fight corruption.</p></speech>

It is not easy.  We must be committed to it and acknowledge that it is important and that it must happen somehow.  Other countries have done well in this area, such as Sweden and the Netherlands, and we can learn from good examples elsewhere.  We are committed to coherence; it can really enhance the good things Ireland has done through the aid programme, working with its partners.  At the same time, we acknowledge the detrimental effects it can have if it does not work properly, and then look at how we can come up with an appropriate mechanism.  We have made some suggestions today and, as a sector, we would be more than happy to engage in a positive way to provide some suggestions and ideas and work with the various bodies involved.  We have experience throughout the world of what works well.  </p><p>  We welcome the comments from Deputy O'Sullivan on our work on trade and biofuels.  People talk about trade being a way out of poverty but we must be careful about linking trade and development.  We have a long, proud history in the field of international development of our aid being untied.  It does not come with conditions, and we stand over that.  When trade is linked with aid it must be done in the positive sense.  It must be a two-way street, where it is not just about Irish trade missions and creating opportunities for Irish organisations but creating opportunities for developing countries to trade with us.  We must enhance that.</p><p>  The ethical value underpinning this policy is the human rights approach and we must agree the fundamentals on human rights, as we try to do.  I take issue with using feminist ideology when we talk about women's rights; women are 50% of the world's population and they are much more likely to live in poverty.  We believe that if women can be supported properly in working their way out of poverty, the face of poverty will be changed and it will be reduced and ultimately eradicated.  We are talking about the right to own land and funds, not to be beaten and to give birth safely - childbirth is still the biggest killer of women in some parts of the world.  We must be careful not to narrow this down to a particular contentious issue; we are talking about women's rights across the spectrum, including reproductive rights.</p><p>  We must think about climate justice.  It involves responsibility.  We work with developing countries to help them adapt to climate change, but it cannot be left up to those countries entirely to come up with ways for them to survive the damage we have done to their environment through what we have done in the last 50 or 100 years.  It must also be our responsibility in terms of how we change the way we continue our development.</p><p>  Deputy Crowe's point about $1.25 per day is very important.  We talk about 870 million people living in extreme poverty, who are going hungry tonight, but just above that another 1 billion people are not far off that.  The concept of inequality being a driver of development goals must be a fundamental part of our policy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-12a.408" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lorna Gold" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013061200017#Q00300"><p>Deputies Mitchell and Crowe raised the complexity of policy coherence for development.  Where do we start with it?  We acknowledge its complexity and the fact that it is cross-departmental makes it a complex and entrenched issue to get traction on.  Where other countries have been successful is in prioritising, and we are lucky to have the huge study that was commissioned in 2009 and again in 2011 with recommendations.  Trinity College has done the hard work in terms of identifying where the difficult issues lie.  This committee could play a key role in prioritising one or two key issues where there is a demonstrated policy incoherence that is core to the mandate of the committee and bringing in the relevant people from the Department or interdepartmental committee.  It could even carry out its own research to drill down into where incoherence exists.</p> <p>It might be a good idea to look at where other governments have got this right.  I do not know if the joint committee has the scope to invite representatives of a committee in another country that has coherence policy to learn how they address this policy.  No country is perfect at it, but some countries put in place institutional processes to facilitate it.  I appreciate it is very difficult, especially given the limited resources and the way that things are currently set up.  Tr&oacute;caire has done research on this and we will be launching it in the coming week.  We will invite the members of this committee and others to a round table discussion on the institutional frameworks for policy coherence in the near future.</p><p> In response to questions on the effectiveness of aid and our evaluations of the aid, I know from Tr&oacute;caire's perspective, and that of other organisations that are recipients of Irish Aid funding, we are obliged to produce regular evaluations and an annual report to Irish Aid which is based on a results-based framework.  This looks at the impact of our work across the world and is very detailed in its analysis.  It is available to anybody who would like to look at it.  We are getting much better at looking at how we monitor our impact as opposed to the outcomes of the work we do. </p><p> There is an international process - I am not sure if members are aware of it - around aid effectiveness.  Senator Walsh talked about the multiple actors engaged in aid in different countries and it can seem incoherent and there is a lack of collaboration and harmonisation of policies.  This issue has been acknowledged by the OECD as far back as the early 2000s but since the late noughties there has been a process to improve aid effectiveness on a number of different levels such as lead countries, lead agencies on different thematic issues and in different geographic areas.  Irish Aid could discuss the intergovernmental process around that.  As development NGOs we are involved in a parallel process which links in with a set of principles called the Buis&aacute;n principles which are about how NGOs will in a sense improve our own effectiveness.  This is internationally agreed.  Hans Zomer has been involved in the process and when Mr. Justin Kilcullen retires from Tr&oacute;caire he will take up a role as ambassador around improving aid effectiveness across the world in civil society organisations.</p><p> Deputy Crowe raised the issue of inequality in the post-2015 framework.  We are bringing this to the fore in relation to the framework.  At present there are no goals but the high level panel report proposes a target of zero in the number of people living on $1 a day.  That would be an improvement of 50% on what was set in the millennium development goals but as he said, people live on $2 and $4.  When we start to move towards the higher level we get into the bigger issue of global inequalities and how one addresses the sustainability around the universal framework.  Where does one draw the line in terms of the post-2015 global framework?  My view is that we need to set universal goals that are indicative but individual countries have a right to set their own goals.  What is applicable to India might not be applicable in terms of a goal in sub-Saharan Africa.  There needs to be flexibility.  The millennium development goals were never intended to go down to the national level, they were to be set as a global level framework.  I think they have learned there needs to be flexibility around the framework.  Likewise, Ireland should have its goals.  We need to have our own goals that are indicative along the lines of what comes after the millennium development goals but they need to be appropriate to the Irish context.  My colleague, Mr. McCaughey, will address other issues.</p></speech>

We are a long way from getting to where it becomes impossible.  There is a great deal we can do in the meantime to improve our performance in that front.  To give a very practical suggestion as to what can be done in the meantime, in 2011 the OECD, IMF and the World Bank made a recommendation to all OECD countries that they conduct a spill over analysis of their tax policy to ensure it was not impacting negatively on developing countries.  That has not been implemented or acted upon by the Government as of yet, but it is a very practical example that the committee might consider pursuing in support of policy coherence.</p><p>  On the issue of carbon credits, Christian Aid and some of the organisations would share the concerns.  On a more positive note, we were happy that the Irish climate Bill does not include the provision for carbon offsetting in the heads of the Bill.  </p><p>  I am not quite sure if I understood the question but in relation to Christian Aid and lesbian people in Uganda, all I can say is that Christian Aid works with people of all faiths, religions, sex and gender.  We do not discriminate on any basis.  We work with people in pursuit of the fulfilment of their human rights, the entire gamut and spectrum of human rights.  We work with human rights defenders who are in many cases under pressure on the basis of their sexuality, ethnicity or race.  I am not familiar with the particular case mentioned but our position would be to support any marginalised group which is under pressure from authorities or groups.</p></speech>

I am sure your view is reflective of other NGOs as well.  The committee will visit Uganda later in the year.  This is more a Government policy than an NGO policy, and we will be dealing with it ourselves when we visit Uganda to have discussions with various NGOs and Government officials.</p><p>  I thank the witnesses sincerely for their contribution.  We have been given food for thought.  Their ideas are very interesting but obviously will need further discussion.  I will be there with the committee to meet the witnesses on where we should move forward post-2015.  The year 2015 is the target for everybody at present.  The meeting in New York in September 2013 will be important.  Obviously the goal will be to try to ensure that countries of substance and means will achieve their millennium goals by 2015.  That is very important.  The Irish Aid document, One World, One Future: Ireland's Policy for International Development<font color="#222222">,</font> is a very important document as we go forward.  I hope we will get a more detailed analysis of that document from the witnesses in the future.  The Minister of State, Deputy Joe Costello, will appear before us in the next two weeks to discuss that document and other issues.</p><p>  I thank the witnesses sincerely for coming before us.  A great deal of work will arise from the contribution of the witnesses.  The members are up for it but we probably need more resources.  It gives the committee more work, but we know that the NGOs value our work.  That is important as well because we value the work of the NGOs.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-12a.419" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2013061200003#E00300"><p>Thank you, Chairman.  I am happy to introduce the motion.  I thank the committee for delaying until 11 a.m. this morning as, unfortunately, I had a Cabinet meeting which took somewhat longer than anticipated.</p><p>  The existing prison in Cork, whose main cell block dates from the early 19th century, is no longer fit for purpose.  Conditions in the prison are particularly poor; the prison does not have in-cell sanitation, it lacks the basic infrastructure required of a modern prison system and suffers from chronic overcrowding - all of which have been strongly criticised by the inspector of prisons and places of detention and the council of europe committee for the prevention of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, CPT.  The Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention is of the view that the maximum capacity of the prison should be 146 prisoners.  However, the prison has typically accommodated 270 or more prisoners - 80% more than its design capacity.</p><p>  Early in my appointment as Minister, I visited Cork Prison and saw at first hand the chronic levels of overcrowding and inadequate physical infrastructure.  I subsequently instructed the director general of the Prison Service, Mr. Michael Donnellan, to come up with proposals to address these serious issues as a matter of urgency.  A strategy entitled, Unlocking Community Alternatives - a Cork Approach, was submitted to me early in 2012, following which I announced that I would proceed with the implementation of the strategy to address overcrowding and accommodation issues in Cork Prison.  The Prison Service was given approval to proceed to prepare detailed plans for a new prison in Cork city adjacent to the existing prison on Rathmore Road.</p><p>  The main purpose of the new prison facility is to replace the substandard prison accommodation in Cork and, in particular, to provide a modern prison facility designed on the principle of rehabilitation and resettlement.  The construction of a new, modern prison in Cork will eliminate the practice of prisoners having to slop out, provide adequate and suitable accommodation for all prisoners in accordance with our national and international obligations and will also provide the infrastructure necessary for the education and rehabilitation of prisoners thus enhancing public safety.  Building on the site adjacent to the existing prison will also ensure value for money for the taxpayer.  Deputies and Senators will be aware that the Cork Prison visiting committee recently expressed concern in its annual report for 2012, which I published, about the archaic and Dickensian conditions in some parts of Cork Prison and has welcomed the Government's commitment to a new prison in Cork.</p><p>  The day-to-day design capacity for the new prison complex is approximately 275 spaces for prisoners based on double-cell occupancy.  The prison will have a peak accommodation capacity for 310 prisoners but that will only be reached in emergency-type circumstances.  All of the cells will be of a size acceptable to the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention for double occupancy and all will have integral toilets and showers.  I am satisfied that the planned capacity of 275 prisoners is adequate for the needs of the prison's catchment area.</p><p>  The development will consist of buildings of a floor area of approximately 15,000 sq. m on a site of approximately 2.64 hectares.  The buildings will be one, two or three storeys in height.  The secure facilities will be bounded by a standard height prison perimeter wall approximately 7.2 m in height.  As can be seen from the illustration of the building it is effectively a H shape.</p><p>  Development consent for the proposed new prison development in Cork is being sought under Part 4 of the Prisons Act 2007.  Part 4 sets out a special procedure that may be applied for the purpose of determining whether consent should be granted to larger prison developments.  The purpose of the 2007 Act was to provide a more open and transparent mechanism for major prison developments under which an environmental impact assessment meeting EU standards must be prepared and where the Houses of the Oireachtas make the decision whether to grant development consent.  This is done in the form of a resolution, which we are discussing today, which must be then confirmed by an Act.  The confirming legislation can only be published after the resolution has been passed because the dates of passing of the resolution must be included in the text of the Bill.  The initial stages of the process have already been progressed.  On 30 June 2012,1 issued a direction under section 18 of the Prisons Act 2007 that Part 4 of the Act is to apply to the proposed construction of a prison on a portion of the site used as Cork Prison.</p><p>  The Director General of the Prison Service appointed the Sweett Group to carry out the environmental impact assessment.  The assessment was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 8 November 2012.  On that date, public notice was given of the proposed prison development, the environmental impact assessment and visual representations of the proposed development were made available to the public and observations and submissions were invited.  The Prisons Act 2007 provides for a six-week consultation period.</p><p>  A rapporteur, Mr James Farrelly, was appointed to prepare a report identifying the main issues raised and summarising the submissions and observations received.  His report has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and published.  The purpose of the report of the rapporteur is to identify those who have made submissions, identify the main issues raised and to provide a summary of the submissions and observations received.  There is no provision for the rapporteur to comment on the validity or otherwise of submissions made nor is there any provision for him to make any recommendations.  Twelve submissions, including a detailed submission from Cork City Council, and several petitions were received as part of the public consultation process, which raised a number of issues and concerns about the proposed development.</p><p>  To facilitate the Houses of the Oireachtas in their consideration of the matter, the Minister must lay before the Houses a document stating the location, purpose and size of the development, its land use requirements and an estimate of any residues and emissions expected; an environmental impact assessment, visual representations of the exterior of the development, and the report of the rapporteur.  I took the opportunity to lay a document, in accordance with section 26(3) of the 2007 Act, setting out my observations on the environmental impact assessment and the rapporteur's report.</p><p>  Moving from the background documentation to the proposed resolution, which is to be considered by the joint committee, the resolution is the consent required for the Cork Prison development to proceed.  It is, in layperson's terms, the planning permission for the prison.  It follows the format prescribed by section 26 of the Prisons Act 2007, including the requirement to list the main measures taken to avoid, reduce or off-set any possible significant adverse effects of the development on the environment.  It also details an alteration to the original proposals that I have made in response to concerns expressed during the public consultation process and sets out the conditions that are to be complied with in the construction of the prison.</p><p>  Before turning to the details of the issues being addressed, I repeat that while the resolution is the planning permission, it must still be confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas before it takes effect.  If the necessary resolution is passed, I will introduce a two-section Bill to confirm that resolution and give it statutory effect.  A fundamental principle of the design and location of the prison has been to minimise and mitigate the impact of the development.  The environmental impact assessment goes into considerable detail on the mitigation measures proposed to minimise adverse impact on local residents.  The public consultation process and the rapporteur's report identified specific concerns on the part of local residents.  In so far as is practicable, further measures are being taken to address these concerns.</p><p>  Visually conditioned concrete with a light-coloured finish will be used on the sections of the perimeter wall most visible to the public.</p> <p>In order to address a specific concern raised during the public consultation regarding the impact on residential property adjacent to the proposed development, I propose to alter the development, in accordance with section 25 of the Prisons Act 2007, by providing for the reduction of the height of the perimeter wall around the horticultural area at the northern end of the site to approximately 5.2 m.  This alteration is set out in the resolution.</p><p> The Irish Prison Service will draw up a good neighbour policy which will provide a framework under which the concerns of local residents during the construction phase can be fully dealt with.  The Irish Prison Service project manager will act as liaison officer and will set up a local consultation group to address any issues that arise during the construction period.</p><p> A construction environmental management plan will be drawn up by the principal contractor and approved by the Irish Prison Service and implemented in keeping with best practice.  The implementation of a traffic management plan will form a key part of the construction environmental management plan.  The contractor and the Irish Prison Service will liaise closely with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Cork City Council and other interested parties in preparing a traffic management plan that will minimise the impact of construction traffic on local residents and businesses.  It is expected that there will be no increase in vehicular or pedestrian traffic once the new prison is operational.</p><p> As regards security issues, the existing prison is the only closed prison in the State that does not have a prison standard perimeter security wall.  As the new prison will have such a wall and will also have an outer <i>cordon sanitaire</i>secured by a 2.5 m fence, security risks will be significantly reduced.  I would like to emphasise that in the context of some concerns expressed by local residents.  This will be a more secure prison in the context of the perimeter walls and the other constructions to take place than is the current prison.  In saying that there has not been any major security issues, in practical terms, in recent years with the current prison.  The need to prevent drugs or contraband being thrown into the prison from outside was also carefully considered in the design of the prison and informed the positioning of perimeter blocks, wall and building heights and distances of recreational yards from points outside the building.</p><p> With regard to privacy issues, the CCTV system will be restricted to ensure that it is not used in a manner that facilitates viewing into residential property.  That is something about which local residents should not have concerns.  In addition, obscured glazing will be used in all windows overlooking neighbouring residential property.</p><p> In order to mitigate noise pollution and dust during the construction of the prison, the perimeter wall will be constructed before construction of the prison building begins.  Extensive noise, vibration and dust monitoring will be undertaken during construction.  An extensive professional programme of vermin eradication will be undertaken on the site and its environs in the weeks immediately preceding the commencement of the works.</p><p> As regards local infrastructure and services, the Irish Prison Service and the selected contractor will engage fully in discussions on drainage and water supply with Cork City Council at detailed design stage.  Sustainable urban drainage design system principles will be applied to the site.</p><p> As there is a need urgently to proceed with the project because of the chronic overcrowding and inadequate conditions in Cork prison, I am anxious for the resolution to be passed by both Houses before the summer recess so that tendering for the construction of the new prison can proceed.</p><p> This is a major development in the context of our Prison Service in providing a new modern, fit for purpose prison to meet our needs in this area.  I am pleased that I have available to me the funding required for this project to proceed.  I thank my Government colleagues for their support with regard to this particular project at a time when we know that money is scarce, but it is of huge importance if we are to deal with the issues of offending and reoffending, meet our international obligations, ensure that people are treated in prison in a humane way and that we are in a position within the Prison Service to do what is necessary in providing supports, and ensuring that those who are returned to the community from prison are less likely to reoffend than has been the case in the past.  It is important that we have this type of new modern prison facility, which I hope would receive the full support of members of the committee.</p></speech>

For his information, a number of the committee members visited Cork Prison last year and we were struck by the need, as the Minister has suggested, for major changes to be made.  A 19th century building does not lend itself to any major redevelopment and therefore I personally believe what the Minister is doing is correct.  We saw the overcrowding and the conditions in the prison and it is urgent that this be done.  I am fully behind this proposal.</p><p>  I am also interested in Unlocking Community Alternatives - a Cork Approach, which links in with one of the reports the committee sent to the Minister on penal reform earlier in the year.  We are anxious that the review the Minister has undertaken would progress.  It is very welcome that this is happening and as a committee we are glad to be able to feed into that and assist in any way possible.  Deputy Mac Lochlainn is on his own.  Does he want to ask any questions?</p></speech>

We desperately need a new prison and therefore we are very enthusiastic about this proposal.</p><p>  In fairness I note the Minister has gone some way to addressing the planning concerns.  I presume that is the reason the Act was introduced in 2007 because where a prison is built is always a contentious issue.  We had an opportunity to see the new site and to get a flavour of some of the challenges.  A number of the issues are outlined in the summary from the rapporteur including proximity of houses to what will be huge walls and so on.  I note the Minister has gone some way towards addressing those concerns.  </p><p>  We support the motion.  We must move as quickly as possible to the construction of a new prison and also to meet our responsibilities to rehabilitation and adhere to international best standards.  I do not know if it is possible to determine if there is more we can do to address the residents' concerns about noise during construction stages.  Some of them spoke about the possibility of window replacements in the houses.  I urge that we do all we can to address the residents' concerns but it is in the public interest for us to proceed.  With the caveat of the Minister doing what he can to address residents' legitimate concerns in the area, I support the motion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-12a.423" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2013061200004#F00400"><p>I thank the Chairman and Deputy Mac Lochlainn for their comments.  I very much value members of this committee visiting our prisons.  At this stage I think I have visited all the prisons in the State and done so quietly without any media palaver.  I thought it was important that I meet all our governors and have an opportunity to see conditions.  I took the opportunity to talk to some prisoners when I visited the prisons and many of those working in the Prison Service.</p><p>  Without a doubt we had to do something about Cork Prison.  It is a great pity that at a time when the State was more flathulach with money this development did not occur at least ten years ago but, nevertheless, I very much value the support of the committee in what we are doing.  We are very conscious of concerns of residents.  That is the reason we have responded in the way we have and the reason we will have in place a senior official to engage in liaison with the residents if issues arise during the construction phase.  The purpose of building the outer perimeter first is to ensure that once it is constructed, the internal construction works have as little impact on local residents as is possible.  I am happy to say to the committee, and particularly to Deputy Mac Lochlainn who raised the issue, that we will maintain that liaison and try to maintain good relations.  I am conscious that when a new building of this nature is being constructed there is always some local concern.  The reality is that this will be a much better facility than the current one.  It will provide greater security as opposed to lesser security.  </p><p>  In the context of the region generally and Cork in particular, the provision of such new facilities, the other work we are doing within the Prison Service such as the community based measures for dealing with offenders in Cork, and the pilot scheme we have running are all designed to try to ensure we reduce reoffending and that, where possible, people can be rehabilitated within our prisons while at the same time properly serving the sentences imposed by the courts.</p> <p>People are imprisoned for very serious offences and the general community must understand the State will play a role in deterring people from offending.  However, having played that role, it must do what is necessary and in the public interest to try to ensure people do not re-offend.  This is all part of what is necessary and I greatly welcome the joint committee's support in this regard.  When the project is complete, I am sure members of the joint committee will wish to visit and have a look at what is there.  There will be two phases in that the construction phase must be completed, after which there will be the fitting-out phase.  At present, the projected time for opening the prison is in or about the spring of 2016.  Were we able to achieve that quicker, I would be very happy for us to so do and I reiterate I appreciate the joint committee's support for what we are doing.</p></speech>

Clearly, it cannot be used for what it has been used for in the past.  As to whether it can be used for some other purpose or something in the public interest or whether what I expect would need to be some fairly dramatic internal change within the building could result in it being available for some alternative use are matters we can consider in the future.  However, we are a couple of years away from being obliged to make decisions in that regard.</p></speech>

The purpose of today's meeting is to continue the committee's examination of the topic of recognition of Traveller ethnicity.  I welcome Dr. Robbie McVeigh and Dr. Jim Mac Laughlin.  I thank them for coming here today and for their assistance to the committee in its deliberations on this topic.  The format of today's meeting is that they will be asked to make a brief opening statement of approximately five minutes' duration picking up their main points and then we will have a question and answer session.  I ask everybody to turn off all mobile telephones because they interfere with the sound system here.  That includes mine.  It is not fair on the staff who must listen, etc.</p><p>  Before we begin, I draw the attention of all witnesses to the position on privilege.  Witnesses should note that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Dr. Robbie McVeigh is on first and I call on him to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I will speak to the opening statement provided to the committee but I will keep it to five minutes.</p><p>  In trying to help the work of the committee, I thought I would focus on two experiences that I had, essentially as an expert witness on this issue.  I suppose that is important because it is sometimes quite difficult, as members will see in the statement I made to the committee, to find a case against Traveller ethnicity.  In both of those processes there was an attempt to construct that case and it is important for the committee to hear that as far as it is possible for me to represent it.</p><p>  In the first one, I am talking about an experience specifically focusing on Traveller ethnicity in Northern Ireland and work that I did for the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights which addressed the issue of Traveller ethnicity alongside other issues.  In the second one, I was an expert witness in a court case in London which was addressing the question of the principle of whether Irish Travellers should be protected under the Race Relations Act in England and Wales.  In both of those examples, I was an expert witness supporting the position on Traveller ethnicity but there also was an expert witness making a case against it.  That is why I think the documentation is important in terms of the broad discussion of the issue.</p><p>  In terms of subsequent discussions, there have been three arguments in opposition to Traveller ethnicity.</p> <p>The first is that it would not be good for Travellers and that it would be politically reactionary.  The second is that it would be just too costly for the State to recognise Traveller ethnicity.  The third, the one I will engage with substantially and which we can discuss, is that Traveller ethnicity is not proven.  It is argued there is just not enough evidence to make the judgment.</p><p> The question of whether recognition of Traveller ethnicity is good for Travellers is one for Travellers to answer.  Overwhelmingly in Ireland, North and South, Travellers support the recognition of Traveller ethnicity.  This is a valid position to hold.  I would not argue that one should not provide that analysis, but it is not the same as the question as to whether Traveller ethnicity should be recognised.  It is an argument about the politics of holding the position.</p><p> On the point about recognition being too costly, there are two points to be made.  The first is that cost is not the primary way in which people should make decisions about issues of justice.  Second, when one considers the consequences of recognising Traveller ethnicity, both in the North and across the water, one realises there were no great costs.  Travellers were more centrally incorporated into an infrastructure of anti-racist work and practice but the immediate costs were not great.</p><p> Let me address the question of whether we need more evidence, although I will not reiterate the point I made in the court case.  If one considers the evidence in detail, one must conclude that the only case one can construct in opposition to Traveller ethnicity is that there should be less evidence, and that there is too much evidence in support of the principle.  As I stated, if one wanted a very tangible, immediate example &ndash; I could go through them in detail &ndash; one would look to the Westview Cemetery in Atlanta, where one finds the grave of the founding father of the Irish Traveller community in the United States.  His gravestone states he was born in Ireland in 1830.  The really important implication is that Tom Carroll and the other Travellers who emigrated to the United States took Traveller culture and ethnicity with them.  It was clearly formed before the Great Irish Famine, an Gorta M&oacute;r, so there is no question but that the identity or culture was established at least in the first half of the 19th century.</p><p> If we examine the London County Court judgment in detail, it will be evident to us that the issue of the long-established history was probably the most difficult for the court to engage with.  Once it accepted the existence of that long history, it was very hard to make any case against Traveller ethnicity in terms of the established principles of Mandla <i>v</i>.  Lee, the British court case that set out what needs to be established in deciding whether a group has an ethnic identity.  The judgment of the judge in that case was correct.  His conclusions are included in my submission but I will speak to them very briefly.  The judge concluded:<blockquote>Our conclusions therefore are that of the two essential characteristics, namely the long shared history and the cultural tradition, we are satisfied that both these criteria have been sufficiently satisfied.</blockquote>Therefore, Travellers in Britain sufficiently met the two key criteria for constituting an ethnic group.  The judge considered some of the other elements of ethnicity and found that they were broadly established.  We can discuss these if the members want.  The case was heard in 2000.  In the intervening period, I have heard nothing that would weaken that case.</p><p> The most significant legal intervention has moved us in another direction.  I refer to the recognition of the Scottish Travellers as an ethnic group.  Given that Irish Travellers are an ethnic group in England, Wales and the North, and that Scottish Travellers are recognised as an ethnic group, it becomes even more difficult to argue that Travellers in the South of Ireland should not be or cannot be seen as an ethnic group.  We can discuss this if the members want.</p><p> My final point is very important to the broader work of this committee.  The issue of denying the ethnicity of Travellers has much wider implications for the reputation of Ireland as a country that respects human rights and equality across the world.  I do a lot of work on these issues across Europe.  I note that people are conscious of the denial of Traveller ethnicity at various international bodies, and this has consequences.  It is important to realise that when the denial of ethnicity is carried out, it should be carried out very carefully and thoughtfully, and it should be done with an awareness of the historical and contemporary implications.</p><p> As I have stated many times, people need to realise that the Nazis denied traveller ethnicity, gypsy ethnicity, in Germany.  This was one reason for the <i>Porajmos</i>, the genocide of gypsies and other travellers in the Nazi period.</p><p> There is no question but that the ongoing ethnicity denial by the State reflects badly on it.  There is no question but that it does our reputation damage among the international community.  We need to be very aware that in discussing a matter that, in a more immediate sense, is about the circumstances of Irish Travellers in Ireland.</p></speech>

I am a development theorist and political geographer.  I find it a bit strange to be here because I am working on a book outlining the history of anarchism.  Someone said to me that many of my research interests are not central to my discipline, geography.  I always seem to be studying people at the edge.  I have studied emigrants, Travellers and European gypsies, and I am now studying 19th-century anarchists.</p><p>  My perspective is a little different from that of Dr. Robbie McVeigh in that I take a very theoretical approach to the problems of Travellers and European gypsies.  Previous speakers spoke very much from an activist perspective, which is very important, but I have been aware of the need to raise the discussion about racism against Travellers and put it into a longer historical and theoretical timeframe.</p><p>  I have identified three stages in the evolution of anti-Traveller racism and the process of Traveller ethnogenesis.  The first stage occurred around the second half of the 19th century, which I call the Darwinian half of the 19th century.  Darwinian ideas such as the struggle for survival and the survival of the fittest, in addition to imperial expansion and nation building, were among some of the very powerful forces that were driving European and Irish history at the time.  The Irish nation that was constructed in the second half of the 19th century was constructed in a very exclusive fashion, not just in an inclusive fashion.  It was meant to include various interests, particularly the hegemonic ideas of the Catholic Church, as we all know now, and substantial farmers and businesspeople.  In that period, Travellers were excluded.  I regard 19th-century nationalism as  a root cause of anti-Traveller racism historically.  It is also a root cause of a process of ethnogenesis among the Traveller community.  In the second half of the 19th century, the Travellers in this country had much closer relations with society, particularly rural society, than they have today.</p> <p>I also work on the emigration issue.  Many of the people who emigrated from Ireland to cities such as Glasgow, Edinburgh and Liverpool and the other industrial cities of northern England were branded as Travellers because very often they were indistinguishable from them.  The point I am trying to make is that in the 19th century the social distance between Travellers and members of rural communities in Ireland was much closer than it subsequently became and the process of nation building meant Travellers were looked upon as a blemish on the face of the Irish nation.  They had to excluded because they were considered to be a people a country did not want to advertise if it wanted to take its place in the league of nations in the 19th century.  </p><p> The second half of the 19th century was a rich period in the development of Travellers' identity and history.  However, that history was written out for a couple of reasons.  We all know that history tends to be written by the victors, with victims tending to be excluded.  During the period about which I am speaking Travellers, gypsies and nomadic people in general were not considered to have a history or identity.  They did not have a history because history was understood in a evolutionary sense in that people had to be going somewhere, progressive and coming from a state of under-development and capable of development.  Travellers appeared to be eternally poor and under-privileged and appeared to live in a mythical rather than an historical time.</p><p> The second important period in the evolution of Traveller identity was around the 1960s.  It was a gradual period of awakening.  During this period Travellers behaved much like rural people in that they left the land and moved to the cities, including Dublin, Limerick, Cork, Galway, Derry and Belfast.  As stated by Dr. McVeigh, it is important that it is recognised that many of them also moved into the urban areas of England, Scotland and the southern states of North America.  The 1960s and 1970s were a testing period in that it was the time when Irish society was desperately rushing towards modernity and in that rush it was anxious to distance itself from Travellers.  This was followed by renewed denigration of Travellers in Irish political discourse.  They were seen as the unwanted and, to use a phrase from the Welsh poet, Dylan Thomas, an unmeltable ethnic minority who refused doggedly to do under.  </p><p> The period from the 1960s to the 1980s is important because during this time the resilience of Travellers came to the fore.  They stuck it out in the hostile urban environments and managed to hold on to their own identity.  Another reason this period is important is at the time Travellers still lacked a voice.  As once stated, there are people who can speak and those who have to be spoken for.  The people who spoke for Travellers in the 1960s and 1970s tended to be priests, nuns and activists in the philanthropic area.  They tended to take a condescending attitude towards Travellers and looked on them as wards of State.  The struggle for ethnicity on behalf of Travellers is a struggle to move away from this attitude.  </p><p> I come to the third stage which began in the 1990s.  Members of this House have contributed to this stage, in particular individuals such as former Deputy Liz McManus and former President Mary Robinson.  There is a growing awareness of the distinctive problems faced by Travellers and an attempt to make recompense for our neglect of them.  From my point of view, what is crucially important about the period from the 1990s to the present day is that it gave birth to what the Italian cultural theorist Antonio Gramsci called "ethnic intelligentsia".  Travellers, particularly Traveller women, since the 1980s have been speaking clearly and articulately about themselves.  The birth of this ethnic intelligentsia has been important in the articulation of a sense of Traveller separateness and identity.</p><p> I would like to speak about the current situation in a European context.  It must be recognised that we are speaking about a minority who want recognition rather than a minority who are seeking to establish a separate state.  We are not speaking about ethnic separatists.  For example, they do not present a challenge to the territorial integrity of the State, rather they are an indigenous minority who have a long history and long residency in this country, despite the fact that they have been outcasts.  They are seeking to remain in the country.  As alluded to by Dr. McVeigh, the development of a Traveller sense of identity will need to be transnational and incorporate Travellers who are in Britain, Northern Ireland, North America and parts of western Europe.  </p><p> Travellers view their ethnicity as a lodestar of cultural capital, a lifeline that will prevent them from going gently into the good night, to which I referred.  They are fighting for their ethnic distinction and they are not alone in doing so.  A recognition of Travellers' ethnic distinctiveness and culture will need to incorporate all Travellers, not only impoverished Travellers.  This must be viewed as something that will bring to the fore closet Travellers.  Like I am sure others in this room, I know a number of Travellers who are hidden.  With a future oriented sense of ethnic identity, these closet Travellers may come to the fore, which is to be welcomed.  It will add to the cultural mix and the articulateness of Traveller identity.  We should be encouraging a sense of multiculturalism in Ireland.  A number of years ago I acted as Santa Claus for a Traveller group in Cork and I was struck by the number of Traveller children who wanted to be just like other children in that they wanted to become doctors, actors, nurses, teachers and so on.  Travellers are not seeking to separate from Irish society, rather they are seeking to join it but to remain as Travellers.</p></speech>

The delegates may be aware of the situation in County Donegal where, following confirmation that a Traveller family was to be housed in a settled part of the town of Ballyshannon, the response of a number of politicians was pretty much a call for an apartheid-type system in wanting Travellers to be kept apart from and not housed in areas in which settled people lived.</p> <p>What followed was the burning of the house by persons unknown.  All right-thinking people across the State were appalled by the incident.  However, there were a number of debates on local radio in the area before the house was burned.  One report I followed was on <i>The Journal</i>website which is part of the social media phenomenon of reporting news.  I am sorry to report that 90% of the members of the public who rang radio stations or posted on <i>The Journal</i>website supported the politicians' comments.  In other words, they supported apartheid against Travellers.  Traveller representative groups tell me that the racism they face on the ground has never been worse.  Evidently, they face resistance to the fact that there is a distinct, separate Traveller culture and complete ignorance of Traveller history and origins.</p><p> I am no expert student of Irish history and I am probably an amateur student like many people, but I know that everyone in the room of Irish origin comes from a nomadic background at some point in his or her history.  We evolved from nomads into modernity over hundreds of years to become urbanised and have our little piece of land.  I do not disagree with the thesis set out by Dr. Mac Laughlin.  I read his book on the subject last Christmas and it is a really important contribution.  It reminds the settled community that this is from where we have come.  Travellers have stayed loyal to that way of life and part of it for much longer.  </p><p> What are the delegates' ideas about how we start the process of education?  We must twin the debates on ethnicity with a comprehensive education programme in the settled community.  We have put programmes in place to support the Traveller community, although there have been huge cutbacks recently which need to stop.  We must put the money back in place.  How do we educate the settled community to understand this is from where they have come in order to build a bridge?  How do we take the many fine writings of the delegates and get them out there?</p><p> Are there comparisons to be found?  There is empathy among progressive people for Native American culture and Aboriginals who were the nomadic peoples who had their way of life violently uprooted by greed and the idea of manifest destiny.  Is there a comparison to be found in that context in terms of resistance to any other way of life among dominant communities?  Obviously, it is not directly comparable, but are there lessons to be taken?</p></speech>

I have given that up as universities have become instrumental.  I found undergraduate and postgraduate students very receptive when I put on courses on racism and spoke about racism against Travellers and European Gypsies.  There was a great take-up of such courses and I am very hopeful about these kinds of programme.  I was asked about education packs for schools.  There is a greater degree of receptivity to discussion on these issues among younger people than among the older population.  That emerged in the way younger people reacted against a well established Irish comedian who did not go down too well when he made terrible remarks about Travellers.</p><p>  On Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn's point, I would not focus too much on the extent to which we were all nomadic.  My point is that Irish nationalism has historically been about land and the struggle for the independence of the island.  It has been about farming and agriculture.  Travellers who did not have a stake in the land were excluded from this.  As they did not have a stake in the land, they were considered not to have a right to be citizens of the nation.</p><p>  The affinity of Travellers with North American Indians and other nomadic peoples can be worked on.  However, it might present more problems than solutions.  We do not want to racialise Travellers.  Basque separatists have been trying to do this and have gone to the extent of suggesting their blood type is quite different from that of any other European people.  They have tried to say they are Europe's original people.  I would be careful about that.  However, I note the links between the nomadism of Travellers and that of North American Indians.</p></speech>

Ethnicity carries with it a recognition of the dignity of a culture, which is missing if one simply regards Travellers as a sort of <i>sui generis</i> population which cannot be explained in terms of any other analysis except that they travel.  Currently, directly or indirectly and by implication, Travellers are a separate group in terms of equality legislation.  Ethnicity is vital to that process.  There is no question in the North.  As I said in the opening statement, Northern Ireland did not become a paradise for Travellers because they were recognised as an ethnic group.  The recognition meant that whenever anti-Traveller racism happened, it was understood and addressed appropriately by the criminal justice system, politicians and others.  Recognition provides a paradigm through which to understand statements such as those the committee is discussing.</p><p>  My position on nomadism is slightly different from Dr. Mac Laughlin's.  There is a fixation on the origin of Travellers and people always want to know what it is.  The origin question is central to every discussion on Traveller ethnicity.  It is a valid question, as is the question of from where settled people come.  What one sees in Ireland is the emergence of two ethnic groups.  At one point, everybody in Ireland was nomadic.  The really interesting question is at what point most of us became urbanised and settled.  One sees there a dialectic between two ethnicities, rather than a fixation on the origin of Travellers and whether they are really indigenous and survivors of pre-Celtic Ireland.  There are valid questions to be asked about this, but it is equally important to ask, if we are settled people, from where our identity came.  An important point on nomadism in the context of the committee's broader discussion is that Travellers are economically commercial nomads, which is different from hunter-gatherer societies and pastoral nomadism.  The latter societies could exist without a relationship with any other community.  Traveller society is commercially nomadic and based on exchange with other people.  At its best, there has always been a positive synergism between the services Travellers provide and what non-Traveller, settled people have wanted.  The type of nomadism Travellers have is a little different.  We can have a further discussion on this, but for now we should be aware of it as the context for addressing Traveller nomadism.</p><p>  A discussion of Traveller culture and history emerged in the court case.  People need to be aware of it if they do not know anything about Traveller history.</p> <p>As I said before, the long shared history of Travellers was a core issue for the court, but it was accepted that if Traveller culture existed as an autonomous, independent, defined ethnicity before the Famine, that was enough to tick that box.  Cultural tradition on its own was not really contested in that court case.  People accepted that the cultural differences that are manifestly there with Traveller culture in comparison with settled culture are real, different and recognised.</p><p> With regard to common geographical origin, they are all Irish.  With regard to a common language, Gammon or Cant is spoken by Travellers.  With regard to a common religion, most Travellers are Catholic but the way they practise their Catholicism tends to be very different from the way settled Catholic people do it.  We have had a separate parish for Travellers in Dublin, which is an indication of how different that religious practice has been with a particular focus on pilgrimage and so on.  While there is a common religion between settled and Traveller Irish people, the way this religion has been practised is very different.  With regard to being a minority, this is so self-evident that it did not really bear any discussion.  There is no question that Travellers are a minority in terms of wider Irish society.  All of those criteria were ticked in that court case and are part of that project of educating the wider settled population about why Travellers are different and the history they carry with them.</p></speech>

Dr. Mac Laughlin spoke about an ethnic intelligentsia among Irish Travellers and how Travellers have clearly shown themselves capable of raising political consciousness about Travellers' issues.  We have met some of those Travellers here in this committee and we have all been blown away by their commitment, vision and confidence in themselves.  I would love to see more of that coming from the Traveller community.  Does Dr. Mac Laughlin have any ideas about how we can create more leaders because I want to get away from the charitable aspect seen in the 1970s and 1980s when the local priest or schoolteacher spoke for the Travellers?  I have seen that on the ground.  There are tremendous, educated Travellers within the Traveller community who are visionaries.  My committee colleagues and I have witnessed it here at first hand.</p><p>  Dr. Mac Laughlin also raised the issue of the internalisation of feelings of social inferiority among some sections of Traveller society, which has been mentioned by Travellers' groups who have appeared before the committee.  This feeling of social inferiority seems to be a major problem in the Ireland of 2013 because of negativity and racism.  We are seeing issues around drugs and mental health emerging.  Is this due to the internalisation of a feeling of social inferiority among Travellers?</p><p>  I have a few questions for Dr. McVeigh about broader anti-racism measures and how the fact that legislation exists in Northern Ireland and England does not mean there is a warm house.  It is like a protection barrier when there is a crisis.  How does one create a warm house?  I have heard similar comments made about northern Nationalists during the past 30 years in the North.  They always felt it was a cold house for them.  Given the conflict in the North and the Good Friday Agreement, there could be some linkage and we could do something to develop it.</p><p>  In respect of Dr. McVeigh's point about the Nazis, genocide and criminalisation, he said the denial of ethnicity is not an abstract academic debate but a practice grounded in genocide.  The number of Gypsies wiped off the face of the earth by the Nazis during the Second World War is often blacked out of history.  We regularly hear about the Jews.  Is there a figure Dr. McVeigh is aware of?</p><p>  With regard to education, if we are talking about inclusion and protecting the rights of Travellers, it must not start at second level because I know many second level schools do brilliant work on Travellers but they are working with 14, 15 and 16 year olds.  Many of them have been lost so my point is that the focus should be on preschool and primary schools.  There are good primary schools that do much work on Travellers' history and culture and bring it into the broader curriculum, but it is not done as a national plan, which could be very important.</p><p>  Looking across the table at us as public representatives, is there anything else we can do to support the inclusion of Travellers in the Ireland of 2013?</p></speech>

Historically, we saw communities as including everyone.  Of course, the way community has been constructed in Ireland has been quite exclusive.  What I am suggesting is that the prettier, more gentrified and more commercially minded Irish towns became, the less welcoming they were to Irish Travellers.  My inspiration for starting out in this was a woman called Anne Doherty from Cork who was one of the founding mothers of the Traveller Awareness Group.  I always had a policy of never talking to Travellers unless there was another Traveller present.  Anne and a friend of hers, Chrissie O'Sullivan, were among the first members of this ethnic intelligentsia about which I am talking.  What does one do to increase the size of that ethnic intelligentsia?  One makes more places available, as was done in the US in the 1970s and 1980s, through a programme of positive discrimination to make more places available at third level and diploma level for Traveller women but particularly for Traveller men.  We need to see more Traveller men involved in this organic intelligentsia.</p><p>  The second point was-----</p></speech>

I would argue that one of the strategies they use to transcend the terrible conditions they find themselves in, not so much in the inner city but in these terrible places where they live on the urban edges of contemporary Ireland, is to go on the road again.  We must challenge at every opportunity portrayals of Travellers that are highly negative.  We must get back to the old simple thing of accentuating the positive.  I will not go into the song.  Otherwise, this negativity that surrounds Travellers will be exaggerated.  Many people benefit from that.  It must be admitted as well that the way Irish political culture has evolved over the past 30 years has meant that there are votes in anti-Traveller racism.  It has been good politics historically to support those who are vehemently opposed to having Travellers in their constituency.  It is a very easy way to play to the political crowd.</p></speech>

The activists and leadership about which Deputy McGrath is speaking were part of a generation that emerged from Pavee Point and the Irish Traveller Movement, ITM.</p> <p>Those young people were graduates of properly funded public programmes that were supported by the State and the European Union.  If one wants to do that as a project, one must do it with a similar issue in the North.  It was modelled on the Pavee programmes but it does not happen without public funding for those projects.</p><p> In so far as I am an expert an Travellers, most of what I learned was from Traveller leaders and activists.  It was that very first generation of people I met, Nan Joyce and Michael McDonagh in particular, to whom I owe a huge debt of gratitude.  Michael McDonagh went with me to visit the Travellers in the States and I would not have got access to that community to report back to people here on the reality of Traveller ethnicity in the States if he had not been with me.  That leadership has always been there but needs to be recognised for the wonderful national resource it is.</p><p> On the second point about the so-called warm house, I included this in the opening address but it bears repeating.  When the task force report came out in 1995, this country was a beacon for progressive measures on Travellers for a State and a Government, and for properly funded NGOs that took the situation of Travellers seriously and addressed what it would mean to have a proper partnership to bring Travellers into a more equal relationship.  The truly shocking thing is that we have moved backwards from being a beacon for the whole of Europe.  People were looking to the model, not just to the NGOs, the Irish Traveller Movement, ITM, and Pavee Point, and what the State was doing around the task force and the genuine political work that was done around that.  The really sad and depressing thing is that we have moved backwards from being a beacon for people to being at the bottom of the pile in terms of bad practice.  It is hard to say that but it needs to be said.  This country has done it before and we need to go back and establish the principles that led to that high-water mark of the task force on Travellers.</p><p> The third point was about the Holocaust.  There is much discussion and debate on the UNESCO figure of 350,000.  Some Gypsy activists have put it as high as 1 million.  There is something depressing about arguing over the figures, but the UNESCO figure is 350,000 people, so it is a real genocide.  There is no question about that.  Related to that on the warm house point, we have a Holocaust memorial day but one will very rarely find any discussion of the situation of Irish Travellers in that context, and that is where one begins to think about the more positive things that can be done.  It is very important that when we remember the Holocaust, we remember there were Travellers - not just ethnic Roma or Gypsies but also indigenous Travellers across Europe - who were part of that genocide.  When we do educational work, particularly with young people, that is a glorious opportunity to connect it to the reality of Traveller lives.</p><p> The Donegal case was mentioned.  Time and again over the past 30 years doing the work I have done, one hears remarks made about Travellers that are explicitly genocidal.  One of the first things I did in Belfast was to challenge the notion that it was right for a councillor to say Travellers should be sent to the city incinerator.  I do not think that remark would be made now but those remarks were retained in the North at that time.  South of the Border we have had people saying Traveller men should be castrated, that Travellers should be sent to the Aran Islands or tagged.  These are measures which have genocidal implications and which were used in the genocide of Traveller groups, and that is why the point about the abstruse academic debate is so important.  This is about genocidal practice, not about what a couple of nutty politicians say.</p><p> That brings me to the politicians.  While it is true that many people have made interventions mobilising anti-Traveller racism, in the work I have done across political parties, particularly in the South, people have provided leadership on this issue as well, and that needs to be recognised.  From every party in the South at different times, people have gone out on a limb to do the right thing, even though there were no votes in it.  We need to recognise that as well as challenging people who make outrageous, negative statements about Travellers.  There is a point about accentuating the positive in that as well.  At the core of this, in terms of what the political project is, we return to the point about ethnicity.  Ethnicity is a practical and symbolic intervention which begins to turn around the process, so we needed to do that and move on.  That creates the context in which politicians of good will from all parties can do the right thing.</p></speech>

It is great to be in the presence of such great academic warriors and men who clearly practice solidarity and understand the meaning of that.  My first question comes from the phrase Dr. McVeigh uses regarding making the case for "ethnicity denial".  That is very clever.  This committee is working on a report and I am wondering if Dr. McVeigh could recommend any people who could come before the committee who could make that case for ethnicity denial.</p><p>  Through his stories Dr. Mac Laughlin clearly explained how racism has never been worse.  Given that fact, if the core to the political project is the recognition of ethnicity, perhaps both the witnesses could say a few words providing the evidence about how a recognition of ethnicity could lead towards a significant reduction in racism.  That would be important for us to hear.  That is largely what they are offering us, but I ask them to say it clearly.</p><p>  The task force report was published in 1995, which is around the time I had just started working professionally in public policy circles, so I remember it very well and the importance of it.  Why did we lose the lead we had then and what needs to change for us to recover that?  Where are the resistance points that can help us in the work we do?</p></speech>

Ethnicity denial means what it says on the tin.  It is about saying not every group is an ethnic group.  At one level, every time there is a court case about whether a group is an ethnic group, somebody on one side of the court is practising ethnicity denial, and that is fair enough as part of the court case.  Travellers have done that at least twice in a court context and the courts have accepted that Travellers constitute an ethnic group.  In that context it is quite perverse for a Government to continue arbitrarily, without much recourse to evidence that I can see that is in the public domain, to assert that a group is not an ethnic group when all the evidence in the public domain supports the notion that it is an ethnic group.  It looks perverse in that context and does us damage in terms of international goodwill because people are aware of that going on and do not understand the practice.  It would be useful to explore it with an international lawyer and we had some discussion around this at the Dublin conference earlier in the year.</p><p>  At the very core of that point is a process I mentioned from the UN Human Rights Committee regarding the mission to Rwanda.  This is a really significant case which was reported last year.  Rwandans, post genocide, said they did not want to recognise ethnicity in the state because the recognition of ethnicity in some way was part of the process of genocide.</p> <p>They had a legitimate reason for making the case but the UN stated that even in that context it is inappropriate to do this.  Plenty of other international mechanisms have considered the issue of how ethnicity works but that for me was the definitive case.  Even where there is a clear, legitimate and understandable case for making the case for ethnicity denial, it cannot be done.  If that is the case, to bring it back here to this context, the notion that one would do it perversely in the face of court judgments recommending it should be done, it starts to look embarrassing and is embarrassing in terms of any practising international lawyer who looks at the non-case that has been made.  I apologise for dwelling at length on this.</p><p> The question as to why it has got worse is a very important and interesting political one.  I am not sure it has completely - some things have got better and other things have got worse.  One of the factors has obviously been that ironically, Ireland has become a much more multicultural country in the period since 1995.  So to some extent the good will that was there in terms of specific focus on Travellers was spread much more widely in terms of the opening up of the country to a much more genuinely grounded notion of a multicultural Ireland.  However, in the process the centrality of Travellers to understanding ethnicity and racism in general in Ireland has been lost.  Obviously in a broader sense that is a good thing.  It is great that we have this new multicultural Ireland, which provides a new paradigm in which to further integrate Traveller equality.  However, it is one where the political profile, if one likes, moved down the agenda.</p><p> That links to the question about the task force.  Part of it would be to go back - the committee is having that discussion with the Traveller activists and leadership - and look at the dynamics of creating a context in which everybody from different parties bought into the notion that something progressive had to be done.  I believe we have moved beyond that.  It would be interesting to return to the years before 1995 and ask what was different then.  A core part certainly is that anti-Traveller racism was the only game in town in terms of ethnicity and racism, and that clearly is very different.  So we have to reimagine a different notion of a multicultural Ireland which includes Travellers but includes all these other groups as well.</p></speech>

We are concerned here with ethnic group or subgroup.  How can we identify who is and who is not part of the group?  I will be a little facetious to emphasise the point.  While we are not concerned with passports, how can we say that one is and one is not?  Where is the line drawn, as there is blurring here?</p></speech>

In the Kiely case I mentioned, the defence in trying to claim there was no discrimination first claimed that Travellers were not protected under the Race Relations Act, which is why the case was heard, involving my evidence.  That was its first defence.  It then moved on to claim that these people were not Travellers at all.  All of us would recognise them as Travellers - they were Travellers.  If that had ever come before the court, I think there is no question they would have been recognised.  Certainly once the defence lost the point that Travellers were not protected, it then went on to claim these people were not really Travellers.  That is a matter for every court to decide.  It is not just true of Travellers.  Somebody might present as Jewish, Irish or whatever to a court and claim to have been discriminated against on that basis and the court would then consider the substance of whether he or she belonged to that group - it would be a matter for the court.  Here it is about the principle of whether Irish Travellers as a group qualify for protection under the legislation.</p><p>  I do not know how much time the Chairman wants to spend on it.  It is interesting to hear what Travellers would say.  The Traveller witnesses would be much more interesting and embedded in terms of their sense of how they know somebody is a Traveller or not a Traveller.  In the days when bars displayed "No Travellers" signs, the barperson was able to make that distinction and other people are well able to make that distinction also.  There is a complex process where it is not based on skin colour but the sense of ethnic difference and identifying somebody ethnically is quite a subtle one although it is also very real.  One knows from accent, from a particular way someone presents oneself, where somebody comes from and from their names.  Put all those things in a bundle and at that point the court would be able to decide whether a person was a Traveller, but we all do it all the time anyway.  It is not an exact science, but it is a normal part of establishing ethnic boundaries that happens all the time.  It is not particular to Travellers - it is there with Irish people too.</p></speech>

I can give two classic examples.  During the Second World War, many people did not want to be ethnically identified as Jewish.  The Nazis and other races had a process to put people through in order to decide whether they belonged to an ethnic group.  It was one that had terrible consequences for people.  However, I can think of the example of Julian Amery who was not really Jewish, but in solidarity with Jewish people identified as Jewish and ended up in a concentration camp as a consequence.  It is a complex process, but it is essential to the process of ethnicity being established.  It is not just to do with Travellers or non-Travellers.</p></speech>

I will take a wider theoretical perspective on that.  Historically those ethnically-defined people who were seen to have a right to self-determination and political autonomy had to be substantial, white, capable of self-supporting, and economically powerful enough to move into that 19th century world of large nations and even larger empires.  What we in Ireland and throughout western Europe are now talking about is that the nations that got to be built were not really nations at all but were multi-nations.  They had entrapped within them minorities.  We can think of the Nationalist minority in Northern Ireland, and also Scottish and Welsh nationalists.  We can think of Basques and Tyrolese.  We are talking about ethnic minorities.  These are small groups of peoples and we are talking about a quite small minority in this country.</p><p>  The term "closet Traveller" goes back to what I mentioned earlier about us having such negative images of who Travellers are, just as historically, Irish people were painted in the 19th century.  The historian L. P. Curtis wrote about the way we were either apes or angels.  Among this, albeit small, Traveller population there are very many highly articulate and cultured people.  Encouraging the process of ethnogenesis would certainly be a way to speed up the conveyor belt to bring those people further to the fore.</p><p>  Looking at the wider dimension, I can think of very few cases throughout western Europe, Latin America and other parts of the world where the granting of the recognition of ethnic identity did not greatly enhance the self-confidence and the sense of value these people have.  We could be greatly surprised at what might emerge in the future from Irish Travellers in that regard.</p></speech>

I was attending another meeting.  I welcome Dr. McVeigh and Dr. Mac Laughlin whom I know by reputation.  I am delighted to see them both here and I thank them for coming before the committee.  I read their papers in advance of the meeting and they make a very strong case for recognition of Traveller ethnicity and this is very much to be welcomed from my point of view.</p><p>  Several points sprung out at me from the papers and if they have already been addressed I apologise.  The onus of proof being on those who take the ethnicity denial position is a strong argument to make because it is not an evidence-based position.  There tends to be an assumption that the entire onus of proof is on those making the case for recognition so this is a useful argument and point which has been teased out, particularly in Dr. McVeigh's paper.  The anomaly whereby Travellers lose recognition when crossing the Border from Northern Ireland is also a strong point with regard to the duty of equity of recognition of rights on both sides of the Border, which sometimes we overlook but which was very much in common currency at the time of the original Good Friday Agreement.  We should bear this in mind.</p><p>  I welcome my old friend and long-term activist Rosaleen McDonagh, who is in the Gallery.</p></speech>

Many UN mechanisms are completely based on self-identification so if one tells a committee one is a member of a group, <i>ipso facto</i> one is a member of that group.  We are already asking for a much higher standard of proof than many UN mechanisms but there is no harm in this.  It is right and proper that if groups are to be protected from race discrimination then it should not be an arbitrary process.  The English courts took it seriously because they do not want anybody to just be able to turn up and state he or she is a member of an ethnic minority and therefore has suffered discrimination.  The Race Relations Act in Britain was transforming legislation and was defined precisely to protect ethnic groups and not other groups who may be discriminated against in different ways.  This is why it is important that we bring a rigorous evidence test to the question.  As I stated at the start, but it bears emphasis, if I were paid to be devil's advocate it would be hard for me to construct a case against Traveller ethnicity.  There is too much evidence with court cases and everything else.  The only position the State can have is to continue to deny it without providing evidence to support this position.  It is an intolerable position.</p></speech>

With regard to the CERD process the State has been asked to change its position and it would be important to state we accept Travellers are a minority and proceed on this basis.  The reason for the specific naming of Travellers in the North in the Race Relations (Northern Ireland) Order 1997 was precisely because people did not want to wait for 20 or 30 years for clarity on the issue.  There is every case for having specific legislation which would name Travellers in precisely the way they are named in the North.  People are broadly happy with this description.  It clearly protects Travellers, but does not open up the category of Travellers to other groups which people do not want to see included.  It is the obvious model for domestic legislation.  People have also looked for a court case.  There is no question the North was right to specifically name Travellers because if this had not happened the ambiguity which exists in the South could have continued for years.</p></speech>

I remember examining it before.  It picks up on something in Dr. Mac Laughlin's paper on different phases of anti-Traveller racism.  He points out that in the 1980s and 1990s legislation was introduced to tackle anti-Traveller racism.  It strikes me this legislation named Travellers as a specific group and anti-Traveller discrimination is one of the nine grounds whereas ethnicity is a separate ground.  At the time it was progressive legislation and Dr. Mac Laughlin marked this when tracking the development of the State's treatment of Travellers.  It was also a fudge because ethnicity is one of the nine grounds of discrimination and would have encompassed anti-Traveller discrimination.  As a practical point we must examine this.  If the State were to recognise ethnicity of Travellers would we need this separate ground in the equal status and employment equality legislation?</p></speech>

My reading of it is that if the Government were to change the position and make it clear to CERD it was reporting to it with Travellers included as an ethnic group, the issue would fall because anyone who contested it in an ordinary court case would have to refer back to what the Government stated on ethnicity.  If legislators want to be very safe, as they did in the North, they would use a clause similar to that in the Race Relations (Northern Ireland) Order 1997, which includes a definition of Travellers which Travellers are happy with and, by and large, everyone else including those concerned about the extension of protection to other groups also accept.  It is a tight definition which works.</p></speech>

During our last meeting and today we have found out about a long shared history and a rich cultural tradition, common language and literature.  We heard examples of these on the previous occasion and as Deputy Finian McGrath stated, we were all quite impressed with it.  Speaking for myself, and perhaps some colleagues, I was ignorant of this.  One of the witnesses stated if he had gone to the United States without having been accompanied by a Traveller he would not have gained access to the community there.  There is a sense that settled people are excluded from this tradition and history.  It might be useful for us to explore this further.  What is in the common parlance is Travellers as troublesome people who steal things and get drunk.  I was taken by a point in Dr. Mac Laughlin's submission with regard to demoralisation and despondency particularly among young male Travellers.  I was also struck by the point on commercial nomadism being taken away and being left with a certain amount of deprivation.  On the other side some Traveller traders are extremely well off.  There are a number of contradictions and issues in the general mindset of people which need to be teased out and addressed.  These perhaps lead to the fears which lead to the racism alluded to by Deputy Mac Lochlainn earlier.  Will the witnesses comment on these points?</p></speech>

In the 1990s when I was working on this issue, journalists brought to my attention very forcefully that it is important to recognise that Travellers, just like any group, are not uniformly poor and do not all suffer from despondency.  There is social stratification within the Traveller population.  There are processes of exploitation of Travellers within the Traveller population and it is very important to recognise this and that we do not take a 19th century view that these are the innocent people in Irish society.  This certainly is not the case.</p> <p>What was the other point?</p></speech>

That is obviously not the case in many instances but it is the perception out there.  It is a perception in many areas and it can lead to the kind of reaction to which Deputy Mac Lochlainn and others alluded.  I know it is a controversial issue but we must speak about it because all of this links together.  With regard to ignorance of the long history and cultural tradition, I would love to know more about those topics as they strike me as being rich and interesting, and some members of the committee may want to learn more about that at a later stage, as it seems fascinating.</p></speech>

Our ignorance is our own fault but I am arguing that in the context of the way the 19th century nation got to exclude not just Travellers but the sons and daughters of the poor and the slum dwellers.  A Nationalist discourse took a conscious decision to construct a nation in a particular way.</p><p>  Another point worth making is that we are talking about ethnicity as if it has no link to place or economy.  It is very clear that Travellers today, unlike those in the 19th century or even the 1940s or 1950s, have fewer economic roles in contemporary Ireland.  That is unlike the past that we saw in rural Ireland, and my mother, who grew up in a rural environment, had clear memories of Traveller women coming into her house.  My father remembered Traveller men coming through the area and working on the land, etc.  We could see similar practices in places like Hungary, Romania and the Czech Republic, where gypsies have a clear function in society.  Since the 1990s and particularly now, Travellers are suffering from an economic depression that is pulling their community asunder.  We must recognise the economics of ethnicity.</p></speech>

The two most economically successful groups of Travellers I have seen are Rathkeale traders and Travellers in the United States.  They are doing very well economically, although that does not mean other issues are not ongoing.  The most striking thing about those in the United States was that the houses looked like something from Dallas.  It is a simple way to describe them.  The older Travellers we met thought it outrageous.  Much money is being spent building massive houses but because these people are nomadic and on the road all the time, they are in the houses for about a month per year.  There are internal dynamics in the community in that regard.  Whatever stereotype people use about Travellers in the United States, it is not that they are poor, as they are very affluent.  Commercial nomadism works for them and many of the Rathkeale families as well.  The notion that it is over is not true and with other support, it might be developed.</p><p>  At the same time, the Chairman is correct in suggesting that there are some categories of Travellers who will not be nomadic in the classical sense ever again.  That does not stop them being Travellers and although nomadism is part of being a Traveller, it is not a definitive element.  If anything Travellers without nomadism need much more support in integrating into the broader vision of multicultural Ireland which we spoke of earlier.  It is fair to recognise that some Travellers are involved in anti-social activity at some points but so are some settled Irish people.  I have heard arguments from Travellers in the North that there were no Travellers in the H-blocks on either side when the Troubles were ongoing.  I do not think any Traveller can be held responsible for the economic crisis we are experiencing.  Whereas individuals may sometimes behave negatively, that is true of all ethnic groups.  Where people behave in such a way, the normal course of formal and informal legal sanctions take their place.  It is no different for Travellers than for any other group.</p><p>  I wanted to make a point earlier which is a nice way to begin to sum up.  When asked about what we can do, there is a town some of us know very well in the North where the Tidy Towns competition is fetishised.  It has always occurred to me that there is something striking in the absence of Travellers from the process.  If somebody suggested there should be a halting site in the town, the first response would be that the town would never win the competition again.  Politicians and others must start to rethink what this means, as a tidy town should have a proper provision for Travellers integrated into the community.  At least for one year the competition might exclude towns without a proper provision for Travellers.  At one level the town would be tidier if it did not have a halting site but we must rethink how we see Travellers and their place in society.  It is an obvious way to do it.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to address the committee today.  I will not give the entire official speech because members might like to spend more of the limited time we have asking questions.  I know a briefing note has been circulated to the members and I hope it has been helpful.</p><p>  Mr. Gerry Raleigh, on my left, is the new director of the National Office for Suicide Prevention and he will take questions on the new strategy for the office.  Members are probably very familiar with Ms Geraldine Fitzpatrick, as this is her fourth time to be here this year.  Ms Sandra Walsh has a specific brief in the mental health area and Ms Fitzpatrick has overall responsibility in the Department for the area of mental health.</p><p>  As members will note from the briefing document, the numbers for suicide have actually reduced.  We will not have this year's numbers until next year.  That is the mechanism for how we gather our statistics.</p> <p>We have several campaigns running, such as Safe Talk and Assist.  I will only mention items I believe will be new to members in respect of what we intend to do.  Mr. Gerry Raleigh will take members through the new strategy.  We have had several representations in regard to introducing Safe Talk into secondary schools and are looking into that - that is not in the briefing note - and considering, first, whether it is appropriate to do it and, second, whether it is logistically possible.  Ultimately, given we have introduced a system in co-operation with the Department of Education and Skills regarding a whole-of-school approach, it seems the next step would be to consider whether we should introduce Safe Talk to an appropriate age group within the second level system.</p><p> The launch of Reach Out by the HSE's national office for suicide prevention has worked to raise suicide awareness by developing a wide range of awareness and training programmes which include the development of the Safe Talk and Assist training programmes that train participants to become more alert to the possibility of suicides in their community.  We were discussing this earlier and it seems we are now training up to 3,000 people a year.  Naturally, those people will have an effect on those around them.  We are making progress.  The Mind Your Mental Health and Let Someone Know awareness campaigns highlight the need to look after mental health.  We are not where we need to be but are making progress and moving in a positive fashion, with the movement always being forward.</p><p> The programme also funds campaigns targeted at specific groups within the community, for example, the farming community, through farm television.  These programmes have been well evaluated in terms of impact.  The focus of these national campaigns is to assist the individual to understand the importance of looking after his or her mental health and to seek help at times of stress.  Once these campaigns are up and running, however, it is essential that when people reach out for that help, it is available to them, especially so when they find themselves in distress.  I thought it very interesting that yesterday Senator Norris spoke about his mental health after the presidential election, saying he found it very difficult to realise he was so distressed and actually needed help.  That is also an issue.  Where does one turn when that happens?  The message has to be very clear, with a clean line, as to where the access point is and where people can be delivered on to a more appropriate service.  Sometimes this may be very low level.  Perhaps the GP can do it or counselling or psychology will work.  However, there are other times where more intensive interventions are needed.  We are looking at all these approaches.</p><p> The Headstrong and Jigsaw programme is available at ten sites throughout the country.  This innovative youth mental health programme works with young people, communities and local services to change the way Ireland thinks about youth mental health.  People may know this programme in their own area.  The Chairman has one in his area and so does Deputy Nolan.  There is also one in Tralee.  Anybody who has this service realises its value.  There is self-referral from the street, and no matter who one meets on that premises, they are people who have training in mental health.  The person giving the cup of coffee or answering the telephone has that training.  The more intensive appropriate service is available afterwards.</p><p> Schools are a key setting for the promotion of mental health and well-being of young people and they are in a position to identify young people experiencing emotional difficulties.  The Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills work closely with the HSE and the national office to develop guidelines for mental health promotion and suicide prevention in post-primary schools.  These guidelines, published in January, provide a clear framework, with information for schools and agencies supporting schools on how to address issues of mental health promotion and suicide prevention.  That whole-of-school approach must be the way to go.  We cannot foresee which person in that school is the one the young person in crisis finds most appropriate to approach.  It may not be the teacher or the guidance counsellor and it may not be the principal, so everyone in the school needs to have that training so that when the crisis occurs, they will know how to respond. </p><p> I acknowledge the tremendous work being carried out by many of the voluntary and statutory agencies in providing services for those who may be experiencing a personal crisis.  That crisis may very well be severe, in other cases it may not be, but nevertheless it is a crisis for that person.  We cannot dismiss any of the circumstances in which people find themselves.  In these difficult economic times, with increasing demands on services, it is important that we work together and link our resources in an effort to tackle this serious issue and create an environment that is enabling rather than disabling for people in distress.  Mr. Raleigh will talk about the number of groups we have that are prepared to help in any way.  These are groups that usually arise out of personal or community tragedy.  Co-ordination is key.  There are the national groups, such as the Samaritans, Console, Aware and others, which all do tremendous work, under contract, for both the HSE and the Department of Health.  We have all that but there are also the smaller groups.  Everyone must have the same message.  The Government will never be able to be in every town at every street corner, so it is these smaller local groups that do such a tremendous amount of work.  We must ensure they have the support and the single message, and that they can link into the other services when more than their support is needed.  That is very important.</p><p>Last year we launched a programme with the Samaritans which will roll out very shortly - I believe at the end of June-----</p></speech>

Up to now the Samaritans had a lo-call number with Eircom, but the organisation was carrying the cost and clearly could not continue to do so.  The other thing we discovered was that very few people are now using landlines.  Anybody in distress, young people in particular, were using mobile telephones so that number was of little benefit to them.  We got the five mobile telephone providers together and they have agreed to fund the single number, 123116, the Samaritans' new number, which will roll out on a pilot basis for a few weeks in a particular area.  The service will then be stopped and evaluated.  That is the internationally recognised number and will be a signpost for other services.  Sometimes we do not see what is going on behind the scenes but the five mobile providers have been very helpful in this regard.  They see it as something that is good for them too.</p><p>  We have doubled the budget for the national office.  A figure of &euro;8.1 million had been available and now &euro;5 million has been provided by the HSE to fund resource officers for suicide prevention, a self-harm liaison nurse in hospital emergency departments and local suicide prevention initiatives.  Public and political concern has increased around suicide and there is a perception we are not being sufficiently active in suicide prevention.  In this regard the HSE and the national office have been reviewing the activities of the office to ensure we make the most of available resources, including looking at best practice internationally to inform evidence-based decisions.  Recently, as a result of enormous public interest, I contacted the national office for suicide research for discussion.  I never take that public interest as a criticism.  I believe it is a good thing.  It encourages all of us to do better.  I wanted to talk to the office representatives.  We had heard Germany and Scotland were doing much better than us.</p> <p>I asked the office what we were doing wrong.  Its answer was clear - we were doing the same as the countries I have cited.  For example, our Reach Out strategy is identical to the German and Scottish strategies.  We need to give it time to bed in.  We need to be more open about this issue and co-ordinate.  Dr. Ella Arensman asked me not to interfere with the strategy and to give it time to work.  We may need to do something different in terms of promoting the message and the contact number, that point of clean access.  If one is in distress, there are so many doors now that one could become confused.  Mr. Raleigh will discuss the clean access and I will happily take questions.  I may have left some matters out.  I always view these occasions as an opportunity to interact with the committee.</p></speech>

Some of the reports have cited a number of causes of suicidal ideation.  For example, there tends to be a greater level of suicidal ideation among the unemployed.  There is only so much that can be done on the suicide prevention side.  Have there been studies of how much it can achieve?  The Minister of State's office will not undo the unemployment crisis.  Are their limits to what she can do in her role?</p><p>  The Minister of State referred to the organisations, many of which are located in Galway.  Normally, the people involved come together and set up their organisations out of good will and terrible experiences.  How can the plethora of organisations be co-ordinated?  Often, the people involved have stepped forward because they believe a gap is not being closed.  How can the Minister of State work with them?</p></speech>

This issue should be more to the fore.  Although it has been discussed more frequently in recent years, this is regrettable, as there has been an increase in the number of suicides for a variety of reasons.  Good work has been done.  For example, and as Deputy Nolan mentioned, people can come together with the best will in the world and try to set up helplines.  In my area, I spent a night clashing with locals who wanted to set up a helpline because of the tragic case of a 14 year old girl.  I tried to persuade them that there already were helplines and that they had not thought it through.  The worst thing in the world would be for a helpline to be set up only to have it fall away two years later.  I tried to persuade them to negotiate or liaise with existing providers to determine whether an additional helpline could be set up under the latter's remit.  Eventually, that is the route people took.  They channelled money through existing services.  Sometimes, the best will in the world is not the most practical approach.</p><p>  The remit of Reach Out: National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention is from 2005 to 2014.  Is it intended to review this strategy?  Has a group been set up to ensure that there is no gap in it?  We have moved on a great deal since 2003 and 2004, when the strategy was being drafted.  We have more services and information on the situation.  The earlier we put together a follow-on strategy, the better.  The service problems we have mentioned could be highlighted so that communities could have a greater understanding of the shortfalls in services, how those services should be funded and how suicide prevention can be better integrated into the education system, sporting bodies and everyday society.</p></speech>

There may be years in which it does not happen or suicide deaths do not flash on the radar.  Suicide has been an issue across the world.  We simply did not count incidents well or acknowledge them to a great extent.</p><p>  We need to capture information on who is dying by suicide, most notably large numbers of young men.  Unemployment and the recession have had an effect, in that the age groups involved have moved from the 25 year olds to the 45 year olds.  This pattern has settled again.  All of the research tells us that there is a brief period in which we can do something for people who are in distress, lack hope and do not believe that they have anything worth living for.  It is important that they know where to get help.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh was dead right.  If something has happened in a family or community, people may believe that it happened because services were not available and, therefore, they must produce those services.  We must get the message out that a service is available, there is a clear line of access and people do not need to set up their own groups or helplines.  One can understand why they do this, but a major concern is whether their message is right.  One needs to be careful when advising people who are in a vulnerable state and when directing them towards another party.  I could not agree with the Deputy more.  It is awkward when a Member must tell someone who has stepped up to the plate and offered to help that the person's proposal would not help.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-12a.502" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1003" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2013061200005#E00500"><p>I thank the Minister of State.  I do not have much to add.  From what I can see, she is taking the issue seriously and analysing it to determine how best way to minimise the incidence rate.  As she stated, this problem cannot be eliminated.  I agree with her comments on streamlining and easy and correct access points.  This is a major issue.  Generally speaking, people are somewhat intimidated by the prospect of engaging with the State, bureaucracy and so on.  If they are in a vulnerable situation, it is even more of a problem.  An easy, widely recognised and trusted point of access through which they can get help and support would be key.</p> <p>Nothing will ever eliminate the issue completely, but if we have that, hopefully a significant number will know there is a place to go when they feel that sense of despair.  We must work on that and co-operate to achieve it.</p><p> With regard to the impact of the recession, there are two categories closely connected, namely, those affected by the impact of the recession in terms of unemployment and those affected by the disproportionate impact of unemployment on young people, young men in particular.  They may be more affected by the perception that if they are out of work, they are somehow useless and have nothing at all.  We must focus on this area.  In the context of the unemployment crisis, this goes way beyond the Minister of State's Department.  The focus is on young men in particular, but also, due to the impact of the recession, it is on people who have lost their jobs who now face financial pressures and wonder what is the purpose of their lives.  We must also focus on this group, which is being hit disproportionately, and consider how we can engage with them.  This means there must be some integration with social protection services to ensure consideration of this issue in people's engagement with those services.  The mental health and suicide prevention services available must be flagged and must feature strongly in people's engagement with the Department of Social Protection.</p><p> In regard to unemployment, the Minister of State has said that the figures have decreased slightly recently.  A recent study suggested that Ireland and Greece in particular had been hit very hard and that, since 2007 and 2008, there had been a 17% increase overall in suicides in Greece and a 13% increase in Ireland.  It is welcome news that unemployment is stabilising and decreasing slightly, but are we only coming down from the peak rather than the pre-recession period?</p></speech>

Reach Out as a strategy is part of A Vision for Change, which is supposed to conclude in 2014, but that is not set in stone.  The previous plan we had for mental health was a 1983 plan and the one previous to that was a 1940 plan.  I do not intend to maintain a similar gap and shortly we will put together a group of people who will look seriously at what should come after A Vision for Change.  Now we have put in the resources, we must consider what exactly we want.  This strategy will include a review of Reach Out.  The review has already started and Mr. Gerry Raleigh has done an in-depth analysis of it.</p><p>  In response to Deputy Boyd Barrett, there is good research informing us that for every 1% increase in unemployment, there is a 0.75% increase in the suicide rate.  We have the figures and in 2003, for example, suicides numbered 497, of which 111 were female, which is significant because women do not usually follow through.  This figure reduced slightly in 2004 and again in 2006 and 2007.  However, it rose again in 2008.  Therefore, Deputy Boyd Barrett's point is relevant, because it was in 2008 when the bubble began to burst.  The figure rose again in 2009, but reduced in 2010.  It rose again in 2011 and reduced again slightly in 2012.  The Irish population is very small compared with that of Greece, France or other European countries, and if anyone from those countries looked at our total numbers, they would probably not be very impressed, but for us the figure is unacceptable.  It is a fluctuating number.</p><p>  The amazing thing regarding young men committing suicide is that until recently, they were usually students and recession was not a significant factor.  The benefit of research is that we can look at the figures.  We were all quite shocked to see how many students were involved.  These were people whose whole lives were ahead of them.  They were at college and living the dream, but there appears to have been an absence of hope and a feeling that there was nothing worth living for.  Suicide is quite a complex issue and is not one that lends itself to just one strategy or a one size fits all approach.</p></speech>

A strategy was developed in 2004 and then Reach Out began and this saw a decrease in the trend.  However, the figures then moved in the wrong direction and in recent years the highest rates came in 2009.  As the Minister of State has said, these higher figures raised particular concerns around young and middle-aged men.  While it is a small comfort, we are seeing a stabilisation in suicide rates across these age groups in the past couple of years.  The most recent official figures we have are for 2010.  We suspect, on the basis of the provisional figures, there will be a slight increase in the figures in 2011 and a slight fall again in 2012.</p><p>  There is a modest parallel reduction in the rates of self harm being reported in our accident and emergency units.  Over the past couple of years we have seen a stabilisation of the figures and some reduction.  We take no comfort from these figures because they are still too high.</p><p>  On the question of a national strategy, a recent WHO document begins on a positive note and states that suicide is largely preventable.  The document speaks about the international evidence regarding the importance of community.  One factor we have seen in recent times, arising perhaps from the economic situation, is the strengthening of communities.  From my perspective, the community is one of the key positive tools we can use to support vulnerable people and help them get over the crisis they face.</p> <p> As the Minister of State noted, we are in the process of reviewing Reach Out which, in its time, was a visionary document.  There is nothing in it, or nothing omitted from it, that does not appear in the German, Scottish or New Zealand strategies.  I have taken time in recent weeks and months to try to see what is working well for us.  We will evaluate the document before it expires and are looking to develop a framework for a thorough evaluation.  In comparison with Scotland's Choose Life programme, and the German programme in particular, weight is given to implementation planning.  One thing we are examining in the office is how, at local level, in an effort to reduce the level of fragmentation and ensure services are evidence based, there will be standards of safety around what actually happens when a person looks for help.  That is framed in the context of a local plan.  Defining "local" is a challenge we must get to, but it should be as local as local needs be.  We must base our service planning for the future on that basis, on a bottom-up, top-down approach which reflects local needs but has a framework that allows for the commissioning of services that are safe and are evidence-based in the community.  Behind that we must support local communities so that people are clear about where to go when they need help.  There must be a very strong and robust communication strategy.  </p><p> One of the challenges we face in the office is a call from the political system and from society and communities.  We understand this; it is a very strong campaign.  We will act but the actual campaign needs to signpost people in the right direction, where help exists and is readily available.  That is the challenge.  There are three pillars to what we are considering.  One is around help seeking.  We must do this in the context of understanding our mental well-being, as individuals and as a community.  What does our mental health look like?  When it is compromised how might we feel?  Where do we go to look for help?  It may be that some people do not have the capacity to make that call for themselves.  We must have people in the community who can put their hand on their neighbour's shoulder and say, "I think you're struggling and you need help".  That is why the importance of programmes like Assist and Safe Talk are so relevant when they are used appropriately and are available.</p><p> Help seeking is about encouraging people to ask for help when they are compromised. There is a second aspect but I will jump to the third, which is about health giving.  This is about when people knock on the door and seek help, ensuring the help is there in a co-ordinated way.  This could be going to one's GP and saying one is feeling a bit off, asking what one should do.  The GP must have the time and the capacity to understand this.  GPs are excellent.  They see the majority of people who are in distress or coming into stress, much more so than any of the second level services.  They must be equipped and supported to signpost and assist people along the way.  It goes on.  The continuum of services develops in an integrated way.  Although there may be a lot of fragmentation in the system, I believe everybody has a role to play, be it in the help-seeking domain or in help giving. </p><p> The third frame, mentioned by one of the voluntary service providers in the context of our developing our communications strategy, is around help taking, or receiving help.  For men in Irish society that is a particular challenge.  Much academic research has been done on masculinity and the preservation of the self.  There are different catch phrases.  It is about how to access the male population, young or old, in a way which allows people to ask, comfortably, for help.  There are two straplines that appeal.  One is about face to face communication, which many men do not do well.  They do side to side, or shoulder to shoulder.  These may be clich&eacute;s but they are important.  The use of community and the development of community groups must be used.  I refer to sporting clubs, the GAA and different community groups where men interact.  I do not wish this to predominate as a male issue, because it is not one, but there are challenges in how we present services to people so that they will be comfortable in accessing them.  We will try to build a new national strategy around those three platforms.</p></speech>

I know the Minister of State takes this issue seriously.  Too often, at least where I am from, it is a tragic situation and seems to happen across the demographic, including gender, etc.  We all have experiences in life of dark periods so we try to fathom how a person gets to that point.  One point the Minister of State noted is that it is hard to see this.  My gut feeling is that suicide is preventable, as Mr. Raleigh said, but it will be with us, for the very simple reason people choose it.  That ties in to the concept of help taking mentioned by Mr. Raleigh.  The witnesses will hear opinions from us.  We grapple with this issue but we are not experts.  However, when one sees what happens in the wake of a suicide - a wife left to rear children by herself, families devastated - I sometimes wonder about it, though not from a point of view of guilt or anything like that.  I am familiar with the work of Console and all the brave families of bereaved people and their friends who come forward to battle this, to say this death will make a difference, this person did not die in vain, they are going to reach out to people and tell them to reach out and get the help they hoped their loved one might have received.</p><p>  The situation is many-pronged.  We have described different people, whether they are from a particular age group, as mentioned by Deputy Boyd Barrett, or others who find themselves in all kinds of circumstances.  Therefore there must be different ways to reach out to these people and elicit a response.  Sometimes I wonder if it is more empowering to be told something, that even if right now I have a feeling, that feeling will pass.  I can make a choice and be told it is my choice and that, no matter what my bank account is like, or my job, or what anything is like in this life, there is always hope.  That should be reinforced in people.  It is always darkest before the dawn, as the Minister of State remarked.  There is a darkest point and then it passes.  We know about the dark points.</p><p>  I believe the stories of the families are important.  Of course they do not proclaim the heartbreak involved but they might talk about the facts and figures.  I can only imagine that the situation comes down to what a person answers to the question, "How is my mental health - what does it look like when it is good, when it is bad?"  This depression becomes a reality, it does not become, "Well, I am like this, but there is something else".  It becomes the person's life.  There is a vortex he or she seems to be drawn towards, the inevitable.  That is a lie, however, because there is a choice.  The reaching out part seems to be about the person knowing help is available.  I cannot profess to know the ins and outs of all the services in my area but it seems they are there, and there are groups around.  The reaching out and the acceptance of this appears to me to be a particular problem.</p><p>  I agree with the Minister of State that it is a loss of hope which has fractured our society.  We may be able to understand this loss in the context that as we become more modern and cosmopolitan life is more and more about the individual and individual successes.</p> <p>I can see how, with people going to college, it is in many ways great to get an education, but there are so many other facets to the human being aside from a career, car, family or job.  These are external factors and anything else is being lost.  It is a consequence of the Celtic tiger, which was not just an economic phenomenon, but rather a belief system.  As a result people believed they had no value if they could not pitch themselves in any of the areas I have outlined.  That is also a lie.</p><p> That is the issue and it is exacerbated because of the way things are in a recession.  In life and politics we may strive towards excellence but we will never be perfect, so we must consider the positive aspects.  I would like people, even those in the Opposition, to say that we must work on those.  Politicians and community leaders have a powerful platform and if they choose to dwell on despair, the vulnerable people who only hear messages on the radio or in the newspaper will be sacrificed, sometimes just for quick political gain.  I am not trying to be na&iuml;ve about the way politics or opposition works but sometimes we should be able to say we have a lot going for us in the country, and we only have to look outside the island to see how valuable is the freedom of our democracy.  In the Third World we can see real problems.</p></speech>

When this Government engaged in the cuts affecting our career guidance teachers in schools, I met representatives of many groups.  I was shocked.  My understanding was that these people guide students in their career but it was frightening to see the number of young people who had psychological issues and mental health problems and who saw these teachers as the first point of contact.  What upset these people was not that they were in many instances to lose their jobs, but rather that they were being redirected to mainstream teaching, leaving a void in many schools around the country.  The young people used to be able to turn to a person for a chat.  In many cases, the young person did not go to the teacher for career guidance but rather because the teacher had the luxury of time, he or she would use that time to engage with young people, notice them and spot issues that a busy teacher running to a class would or could not.  This is an important aspect that the Government should consider.  The cuts were too tight to the bone and I was not being sensationalist when I stated that at the time.  I said what I did because I believed, having listened to the teachers, that the move could cost young people their lives because they could miss early intervention when a problem arose.</p><p>  It is time for a process like that used by the Road Safety Authority, RSA, to deal with the problem, as has been mentioned by others.  When intolerable numbers of people were dying on our roads, it was deemed correct to set up the Road Safety Authority to tackle the issue.  Much money and resources were put into tackling the problem and, overall, it has worked and brought down the number of deaths on the road.  Considering that the number of people using the roads is increasing, the initiative has worked far more successfully even than people might realise.  There are many agencies doing excellent work and we have come a long way but it is time for a system based on the RSA, with publicity being provided and bringing all the agencies together under one umbrella, to get them to work together.  That is really important.</p><p>  It may take me half a minute to tell this story but it would be good for a Minister of State to hear it.  I appreciate she does her clinic work but it is always good to hear a story from the ground.  As an example of what people are going through, today I had a telephone call from an individual suffering from lifelong mental health issues.  The person receives excellent care three or four days a week but must travel to the counselling himself.  It keeps him together.  He told me he is missing many days of treatment and when I asked him why that was so, he told me that I know where he lives and where he must go.  It is a round trip of perhaps less than 40 miles.  His problem is that he does not have money to run his car and he had often hitchhiked because he could not put petrol in the car.  If he could not get anybody to carry him to his appointment, he would stay at home, meaning it was a bad day for him.  It is nice for the Minister of State and her senior officials to hear this as it is a true story which I only heard today.  It is frightening what people are going through.  There is help available for that person and people rang him to see why he could not make his appointment.  He operates on the tightest of budgets and could not afford to travel to get help.  It is nice for the officials to hear that story as it conveys the impact of the current crisis and the financial constraints on people.</p></speech>

I am sure she remembers the Private Members' motion that the Technical Group moved in its first six months in the D&aacute;il, which was not put to a vote.  A marker was put down as to what we would like to see happen and we left it at that, although we indicated the issue would be revisited.  I have an interest in this area from a personal perspective as I suffer from mental illness and I contemplated suicide at one stage.  I have made it quite clear in speaking about this that one of my biggest fears was approaching the mental health services.</p><p>  It is interesting that the Minister of State noted that &quot;when people reach out, there should be help&quot;, and nobody can disagree with that.  She continued that &quot;the environment should be enabling and not disabling&quot; and, again, nobody can disagree with that.  She also stated that &quot;all we can do is ensure people will know what to do or exactly where to go&quot;.  I wish I did not have to say what I must say but people do not have that assurance in my county.  People may say it is parish pump politics to speak about one's own county but it is not; it is the area I know best and it is the issue people are coming to me about.  Far from feeling reassured, for the past three weeks in all the local newspapers, there have been true articles that do anything but reassure people.  I will give the Minister of State a taste of what people are saying.</p><p>  I am sure she has read the <i>Roscommon Herald</i> this week and she knows what is going on in Roscommon psychiatric unit.  The paper carried the story of a person who had a family member there when the incidents took place, and I hope the Minister of State is aware of what those are.  Can the Minister of State imagine what this is like for the staff, patients and families?  We tried to bring this up in the D&aacute;il but it was repeatedly refused a spot as a Topical Issue, including today.  The staff are doing terrific work and we do not want them criticised but they are working in appalling and understaffed conditions.  This must stop right now.  The authorities were told there would be problems and there will be more of them.  I am pleading with the Minister of State to get this appalling issue addressed immediately.</p><p>  It may be the same across the country but in Roscommon people do not feel safe about the prospect of approaching the mental health services.</p> <p>We have a situation where the local services are losing staff because they need them in the psychiatric unit and people do not have the service locally.  We know the knock-on effect.  They end up a little worse and in many cases have to go into that hospital, which they do not feel safe going into.  I hate having to say this but they are right in not feeling safe about going there. Something needs to be done.  The fears I had all those years ago have not been allayed.  I wish they had, but it is clear that psychiatric services are still the poor relation in our health services.  Nobody has contacted me to tell me that their brother, son or sister had been left on the side of a road and left for a year with a broken leg with nobody taking any care of them as their health deteriorated and they died.  Yet that kind of situation is happening to people.</p><p> We talk about why people end up with mental health problems.  We have a situation in the psychiatric unit of Roscommon County Hospital where the workers are starting to develop mental health problems because they are under such huge stress.  There is a public meeting in Roscommon town tomorrow night to discuss all this.  We do not really know where to turn.  This is not picked up as a topical issue.  It is not about me or Deputy Naughten, who also put in a request.  It is about us trying to do something about this.  It is an end-of-pipe solution.  I would love to talk about the reasons people end up there but I do not have the time.  When people end up at the end of this pipe it seems they are just being sent into the sewer.  What is happening about this?</p><p> I come from a family some of whose members have had to undergo forced shock therapy in a variety of different scenarios and I am not seeing that this kind of situation is improving; it has not improved.  I fear for anybody who has to use the mental health services in my county and I want to know that the Minister of State is going to do something about it.  The last thing I want to hear is somebody suggesting this is some sort of political football.  It is not.  It affects me, my family and my neighbours.  Up until now, I would have said the Minister of State talks an amazing talk.  I do not know who is stopping her doing the walk I believe she wants to do.  It is not happening and I would like something done about it.</p></speech>

This is very important.  I forgot about it and I should not have.  Does the Minister of State realise that we have a situation in the psychiatric ward of Kerry General Hospital where workers were recently attacked?  Very unfortunately three people were seriously injured.  In case the Minister might think that was a one-off occurrence, it has been happening since St. Finian's and St. Peter's wards closed and it is because we do not have a secure unit in the psychiatric ward of Kerry General Hospital.  That situation must be addressed as matter of urgency.  I thank the Chairman for allowing me.</p></speech>

The plan is, and A Vision for Change clearly states, that we will have a community-based mental health service as the big institutions that existed are to be closed.  They have been closed and that is important.  As Dr. Dermot Walsh told me when he came in to talk to me, we had 22,500 people in institutions in Ireland.  We could not possibly have had that many people with that type of acute mental health issue.  That could not have been the case.  There must have been something else going on there and we do not want to leave that situation to continue or go back to it again.</p><p>  We have a National Office for Suicide Prevention in the same way the Road Safety Authority, RSA, is the national office for road safety, but they are two entirely different areas.  It would be lovely if we could introduce laws to prevent people from self-harming and dying by suicide.  None of us wants to go there.  The RSA can operate effectively within its remit.  It can improve the road network and introduce penalty points.  That has an impact on people's behaviour.  We do not want to do that for suicide.  We did that for too long.  It was not beneficial and none of us wants to go back there.  We have a National Office for Suicide Prevention and people must stop talking as if we did not.  What works in the RSA would not work for suicide.  If people would sit and think about it in an in-depth way, they would realise that.  I would appreciate if people did think about it in a serious way.  It is insulting to continuously talk in this fashion.</p><p>  On career guidance teachers, we introduced a whole school approach.  We recently had a group of people over from Sandwell to talk to the Irish College of General Practitioners, the ICGP.  We have done research with the ICGP and it produced a DVD that will go to every GP in the country.  It refers to depression, suicide, how to recognise it and what is the best approach to take.  The people who came from Sandwell take a whole community approach to mental health.  They bring in the churches, school, traffic warden, anybody in the community who has interaction with other people on a regular basis.  They convinced us that it is a whole school approach.</p><p>  If a student has a difficulty and acts out in class, as happens every day of the week, it may be because the student does not want to be in school, but it may be for another reason as well.  There may be some underlying issues.  Does a person in that situation really want to be going to the one office that is identified as the place one goes when one has a problem?  Surely it should be about being able to approach anyone in the school.  What if one does not get on with a particular individual in the school?  Are we saying there is nowhere else to turn?  Career guidance teachers have done an incredible job in this country, both doing their own job and being an open door to children who are distressed, but it must be more than that.  There must be a whole school approach.</p><p>  I am not certain I can give Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan any answer to the issues he raised here today but he can take my word that I will take a serious look at it.  Given that people sometimes find themselves acutely distressed, clearly incidents will occur.  The professionals who work in the area are conscious of that.  They are definitely well-trained in the management of those issues and when they go into this highly-skilled profession they know there are dangers associated with it.  They are less than in some other areas.  Deputy Healy-Rae also raised the point of assault, but the accident and emergency department of any hospital on a Saturday night could be equally dangerous.  We must be conscious of that.</p><p>  I dispute what Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan said about warning people against approaching the services in Roscommon.  I will look at the issues to which he referred.</p></speech>

I am city manager of Waterford City Council and acting chair of the transportation committee of the County and City Managers Association.  Mr. Tom Coughlan, Clare county manager, is currently indisposed.  I am accompanied by Mr. John Mulholland from Kilkenny County Council, who is director of services in transportation, and Mr. John McLaughlin, director of services with Donegal County Council.  All of us have been through the mill in terms of road maintenance and area engineers and have some degree of experience in these matters.</p><p>  I will give a brief ten minute presentation on the broad background to the issues under discussion and to place the local and regional road maintenance programmes in the context of the overall funding position, which is obviously not very good.</p><p>  At national level the reduction in Exchequer funding has been extreme over the past several years.  In 2007 investment in maintenance of our roads was in the region of &euro;700 million but that figure has decreased to &euro;400 million in the current year.  Members will be aware of the recent announcement by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government of an additional &euro;50 million, for which we are very grateful to say the least because the money is necessary.  However, even though the additional &euro;50 million is a great help we remain concerned about the overall investment proposition in the longer term.  The proposed figure for next year is closer to the &euro;300 million mark, which would be less than half the necessary level of investment to hold the road infrastructure together.  We acknowledge the fiscal context but we are worried about the investment context.  International institutions such as the World Bank argue that a failure to invest in road maintenance represents a significant deferred liability.  To draw a simple analogy, a stitch in time avoids significant damage.  The current overall investment level is a case of loaves and fishes.  Local authority contributions to road maintenance amount to approximately &euro;100 million.  This figure has declined somewhat due to pressures on local finances but it has been of that order for a number of years.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-12a.544" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Mulholland" time="09:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013061200003#G00300"><p>I will speak on the subject of maintenance cycles.  Members will be familiar with the operation known as surface dressing, whereby chippings and bitumen are applied to road surfaces.  This process is generally carried out on a cycle of seven to ten or 12 years and is important not only for skid resistance and public safety but also for preserving the integrity of the road.  Many people observe in their daily travels the operation known as strengthening, which involves the application of tarmacadam layers to the road to protect the asset.  This operation is prioritised based on the condition of the road surface.  Current levels of funding only allow for 40% of roads to be completed in these cycles.  They are desirable cycles but we are currently dipping below them.</p><p>  Additional pressures on the road network include winter maintenance.  The application of salt or grit to roads makes them safe for motorists and allows the ordinary conduct of business during the winter.  A significant level of effort has been invested in this work by local authorities and the National Roads Authority, with the co-operation of the IFA and other community interests, over the past several years and we are now at a fairly decent standard.  The pressures of reduced funding will have an impact in that we will not be able to meet some of the targets currently in place, particularly given that the motorway network will be maintained by contractors over the coming period.</p><p>  Health and safety issues can be considered under two headings, first, for the workers on site and, second, for motorists and people in the vicinity of roadworks, such as local communities, farmers trying to access lands and local businesses.  Heavy loading has an impact on the road network, particularly local and regional roads.  This will be more manifest in the years ahead, particularly in the agriculture and forestry sectors.  The lifting of the milk quota in 2015 may have implications for access to remote farming areas where progressive farmers try to increase dairy yields.  We already know of cases in which creamery suppliers have difficulties entering local road networks.</p><p>  Material prices on the wholesale market for macadam and asphalt have escalated between 2008 and 2013.  Bitumen emulsion, which is more commonly known as tar, is the liquid material applied to a road prior to the application of chippings.  This product has also increased in price in the last two years.  Prices have escalated since our troubles first became apparent.  The price of stone has also increased.  The upward trend in the price of bitumen based products from a base year of 2005 to the present has put significant pressure on shrinking budgets.  The one factor that has seen a fall is the labour input due to decreased human resources and rates of pay.  Generally, however, the materials required have increased in price.</p><p>  How do we prioritise roads for investment?  Volume of traffic is a critical factor.  It makes sense that roads on which the majority of people commute to work are prioritised for investment to ensure the road surface meets a reasonable standard.  Engineering inspections can be visual or based on limited testing by means of various devices to examine road conditions.  This generally applies in the case of regional roads but local roads tend to be assessed on the basis of visual inspections for cracking, potholes, rutting and problems in the wheel tracks where heavy loading occurs.  The maintenance cycle also involves a prioritisation exercise.  For example, people in a particular county will know which roads have been treated over the period in question.  There could be gaps of ten or 20 years during which roads were not treated.  Local representation also plays an important role, whereby communities, elected representatives and others may be able to identify specific problems.  These representations are noted and form part of the decision making matrix.</p> <p>Members might not be aware that each local authority, probably on a three-year cycle, adopts a multi-annual programme.  These programmes are approved and sent to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  That is the baseline for investment in the years ahead.</p><p> On the funding categories for regional and local roads, obviously regional roads are the priority because they carry the most traffic.  They are also the lifeblood of most communities in the context of business, trade and tourism.  Funding for these roads is provided by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in respect of strengthening, surface dressing and discretionary maintenance.  The latter involves maintaining drainage ditches, cutting back roadside vegetation and repairing defects.  Unit rates and efficiency are a priority for strengthening and surface dressing.  We must comply with particular unit rates that are specified and agreed with the Department.</p></speech>

The term "MapRoad" provided in the next slide relates to the overall platform for road management in respect of the regional and local road networks.  Within that there is a pavement management system module.  I wish to provide members with the American definition of what constitutes a pavement management system, namely, "a systematic method for routinely collecting, storing, and retrieving the kind of decision-making information needed to make maximum use of limited maintenance [moneys]".  That definition lies at the forefront of all of this.  We are moving towards an evidence-based system for assessment rating that complements the work to which Mr. Mulholland referred.  The latter system was developed in Wisconsin, USA, but is being adapted for Irish conditions by the local authorities, the Department and some outside experts.  It will come into force this year and it relies on standardised visual inspections which are supplemented by a certain amount of machine testing to validate the results.  There is a scoring or rating system, with ten representing what is best.  The system is quite simple, cost-effective, easy to use and practical.  The road network throughout the entire country needs to be rated by the end of 2014.  Significant work is already under way in this regard and we will see evidence of this later.  Very good progress has been made with existing staff in local authorities.</p><p>  Two people are required to operate the system.  One drives the car and the other uses a hand-held device to record scores for the relevant road.  In practical terms, a two-person team can cover approximately 150 km per day.  In the context of Donegal, which has approximately 6,000 km of roads, the ten different areas into which it is divided can be covered by the various engineers in four full-time days.  This could even be spread out over a longer period.  As members can see, therefore, the system is quite practical.  There are close to 100,000 km of roads throughout the country, so machine testing would not be needed and neither would it be practical or cost-effective.  The visual rating system is very good for assessing roads, however.</p><p>  I accept that the chart currently on screen is difficult to read but it provides the necessary information.  At the very top of the chart, designated by the number 10 and the colour green, are the roads which are in first-class condition and which only require routine maintenance from time to time.  At the very bottom of the chart, designated by the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4, are those roads which require either completely new structural overlays or rebuilding.  The challenge we face is to try to identify the latter roads to assess what might be done about them.</p><p>  The next slide shows, in map form, what has been done to date in County Donegal.  Members can see quite an amount of green on the map.  There is a need to validate the work being done in this regard throughout the country in order that everyone will be on the same page in the context of their interpretations.  Standardised training and manuals have been provided.  The work will be validated during the next year or two to ensure a score of 8, for example, will mean the same thing in all counties.</p><p>  The next slide contains a map of a particular electoral area in Donegal which shows the position in greater detail.  Members can see there are quite a few blues and reds.  It is possible to provide very good analysis in respect of the different scores and the number of kilometres involved.  It is a good decision-making tool.  Further developments are already under way in the context of, for example, assessing what would be required in terms of investment to improve a score of 7 to one of 8.  There are many ways in which one can consider this matter and we hope the system will be well used in the future.</p><p>  The next slide shows the MapRoad system on our road management tools function and illustrates how we are moving more towards technology.  This is the accident database and the one on screen shows the position in south Tipperary.  There is such a database for every county.  Unfortunately, the system indicates that last year there were 162 fatalities on our roads.  These are tracked through the Garda system and then transmitted to us.  The red dots denote fatalities.  This is a tool by means of which we can target improvements to where they are most needed.</p><p>  The next slide shows the history of works in south Tipperary.  Mr. Mulholland referred to the multi-annual programme.  The work that is done and the year in which it is carried out is logged into the system and the various colours on the map show different roads that were done at different times.  This is a useful tracking tool.  If, after a number of years, there is a failure in respect of a road, it is possible to identify when the work was carried out and the materials that were used.  This provides very good information.  The provision of such information within the system is a requirement throughout the country.</p><p>  The next slide shows the machine-mechanical surveys.  This allows us to superimpose visual ratings onto the stretches of road that are tested by machine and to carry out comparisons.  The machines rate more than just the visual condition of roads.  They also take into account the roughness of the surface, skid resistance and a number of other factors.  All of the information is superimposed and the most important ones are placed at the top.  This assists in prioritisation.</p><p>  The final slide shows the position with regard to bridges in Galway.  Bridges are also logged into the system and rated.  It is difficult to see on the screen but there are some bridges which are in very poor condition, which have been damaged, etc.  They are all rated.  Some of the bridges which form part of the regional and local road network are quite old and are in poor condition.  Obviously, it is necessary that such bridges should be in a serviceable condition.  Information on these bridges is contained in our system along with a number of other items.</p><p>  The system involved is both very structured and evidence-based.  There has been very good co-operation between local authorities and the Department in the context of seeing it through to completion.  One of the beauties of it is that the scoring system is quite easy to use.  People who use the system adapt to it very quickly.  We expect it to be used much more in the future and to yield good results.</p></speech>

Some of the new technology has obviously proven to be extremely helpful.</p><p>  Before I open the floor to questions from members, I must apologise in advance for the fact that I will be obliged to leave in the next few minutes in order that I might make a contribution in the D&aacute;il.  Prior to doing so, I will pose a couple of questions.  Obviously, the funding for local and regional roads comes from central government and local authorities also make a contribution.  The figures appear to show that there is a major difference between the amounts contributed by the various local authorities.  What is the reason for this?  Will our guests provide a figure in respect of the actual upkeep of roads as distinct from that which relates to the upgrading of regional and local roads?  They may have already provided that figure during their presentation but perhaps they might remind us of it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-12a.548" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1022" speakername="Dessie Ellis" time="09:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013061200004#H00400"><p>I thank our guests for their presentation.  It is difficult to see how we are going to maintain high standards in view of the cuts that have been imposed and the fact that funding has almost been halved since 2007.  In the context of the &euro;50 million provided by the Minister recently, will our guests outline how this money will be prioritised?</p><p>  I had already heard about the rating system to which Mr. McLaughlin referred.  How are roads on which many potholes can be found rated?  The committee received a presentation from residents in County Meath who maintain that there are more potholes in their area than in any other locality throughout the country.  I do not know if that is true but they certainly made a very strong case about the number of potholes in their area.</p> <p> Some local authorities can raise funds more easily than others.  The road structures in Donegal are much longer and its local authority would not have the same resources as a local authority in another county.  How does the mechanism for getting the funding work?  Does the authority have to make a special case for extra funding because of the road networks?  I mention Donegal for a reason.  The north west has a high percentage of accidents in general, and Donegal and Tyrone appear to have a much higher accident rate.  In terms of the linkages, the north west has not had the same motorway provision as other regions but has that had a major effect?  Ordinary local roads are used more in Donegal.  It does not have the main carriageway.  What is the witnesses' opinion of the size of the problem that is causing?</p><p> Regarding the maintenance of roads, in Waterford, Dublin city and such areas there are issues with ramps.  I am aware special funding was given to Dublin City Council to deal with ramps not of a proper standard that literally disintegrated in the recent severe winters.  Have the witnesses experienced that in their areas?</p><p> The local authority contribution has been reducing, and the contribution from the witnesses' organisation has been reducing also.  They will get certain powers to raise money under the property tax measure.  Will that help them in future in terms of meeting some of the road improvement targets in their areas?</p><p> What unforeseen problems do the witnesses envisage arising?  We cannot predict weather in the future but do we have a reserve to deal with problems?  We have had to have stockpiles of salt and so on in the past.  Do the witnesses have a contingency plan to deal with that?</p></speech>

Deputy Harrington, Senator Mooney and Deputy Phelan have indicated.  I will ask Deputy Walsh to take the Chair shortly, and if other members wish to speak, they might indicate that.  Mr. Walsh might wish to take these questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-12a.551" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Walsh" time="09:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013061200005#J00300"><p>We will share them, if the Vice Chairman does not mind.  In terms of the variation in the overall local funding, the reality is that the capacity of different local authorities varies significantly.  The rates base, for example, is a significant player in that.  Many rural counties would struggle in terms of having the financial capacity, and they have many so-called "have to" spends, be it in the water area or other contracted areas.  The capacity varies dramatically across the country.  The members will not find a manager or any elected body of councillors in the country who would not wish to spend more on their roads, but the reality is that the capacity is not there.  The capacity to increase funding, for example, does not exist and has not existed in reality for the past three or four years and, as a consequence, there is that variation.  That is a reality driven by simple financial circumstances.</p><p>  We are not entirely clear, as of yet, about the influence of the property tax.  The local authority system would welcome the capacity for local communities to contribute and to help decision-making in terms of the level of investment.  In terms of the dependence on Exchequer funding for road maintenance, there is a myth that local authorities do the road maintenance.  The reality is that for the past 15 years the ratio of Exchequer to local funding has been approximately seven or eight to one.  Currently it is probably down to a ratio of four or five to one or three or four to one.  Historically, there has been a dependence on Exchequer funding.  In terms of our current capacity, the necessary spend per annum is in the region of &euro;500 million to &euro;600 million.  There will be consequences three, four or five years down the line.  It takes a period of time for that to show.  We have been lucky that there has been reasonable investment during the Celtic tiger years, if I can use that phrase.  That is standing us in good stead at the moment but there is pressure and a build-up of potential that is negative, and our opinion is that will demonstrate itself three, four or five years from now.</p></speech>

How would that emerge?  In terms of the other figures, the smallest spend or contribution from the local authority seems to be in the rural counties.  One would imagine that the rural counties would have a higher number of local and regional roads.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-12a.553" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Walsh" time="09:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013061200005#J00500"><p>It is just that.  It depends on the level of commitment in other areas as well.  Anything from water funding to all the other commitments in other areas can sometimes have a bearing on the capacity.  The reality is that the rural counties have a very small rates base generally in relative terms.  They depend on the local government fund for the majority of their funding.  The other reality is that that funding has been decreasing significantly in recent years.  The capacity varies with the counties but I assure the Vice Chairman that there is not a manager or elected body that would not choose to put more resources into the roads area if they had the capacity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-12a.554" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Mulholland" time="09:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013061200005#J00600"><p>To answer the Vice Chairman's question on the amount of money purely for upkeep, out of the approximately &euro;350 million allocated this year, there is approximately &euro;77 million from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for what is known as upkeep.  One would have to add to that another sum of approximately &euro;80 million or &euro;90 million from local authorities, which rounds off at approximately &euro;160 million per annum across the State for ordinary upkeep.</p><p>  Regarding Deputy Ellis's question about the &euro;50 million announced last week, local authorities have not been advised yet as to where that money will be allocated, but I expect it will be along the lines of the traditional divvy-up in regard to restoration, improvement and some discretionary maintenance.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-12a.555" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McLaughlin" time="09:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013061200005#J00700"><p>I will pick up on Deputy Ellis's other questions.  He spoke about the rating system for potholes.  From what the Deputy described, it is a severely potholed road.  Members cannot see the chart but I will read out some of the ratings.  Rating number 2, which is second from the bottom, describes a road with many potholes on which it is very difficult to drive.  That progresses up to where between 10% and 30% of the road would have defects.  I will pass around the chart later, and if the Deputy looks at pages 46 and 47, he will be able to determine whether those ratings fit the type of road he is describing.  That should give him the rating.  The key is getting people around the country on the consistent rating system.  There is no point in one county purposely scoring high or low.  That is why independent auditing and some machine testing is done to validate.  We will pass around the chart later and the Deputy can see from pages 46 and 47 where the road he describes fits in.</p><p>  The Deputy spoke about the mechanism for extra funding.  Mr. Mulholland spoke about the usual divvy-up, to use his word.  From time to time we have compiled reports, even before this system of rating, of the condition of our roads as people see them and sometimes seek additional funding based on the condition.  We did it after the two recent severe winters and made submissions to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and so forth.  While some money was released under that, it is difficult to tie the two together with delegations lobbying Government and so on.  It is difficult to get extra money at a time when money is not readily available.  That is acknowledged.  It comes down to making the most of what we have available.</p> <p>In recent years the Department has offered extra flexibility in terms of using grant headings in a different manner to deal with the worst problems and perhaps bring roads up to a serviceable condition as opposed to a very good condition.  Mr. Mulholland spoke about the &euro;50 million.  I understand that if necessary some flexibility will be afforded for us to revisit the programme we outlined.  This is all subject to providing adequate justification for making a change, which is sensible enough.</p><p> Deputy Ellis spoke about the north west and I acknowledge the high level of accidents, although it has reduced over the past year.  We have a special, small countrywide programme which is prioritised based on the number of fatalities, with scores assigned, to tackle the worst black spots in the country.  It runs alongside the bigger programmes and is intended to fix, within reason, locations which are of particular danger.  Linkage to the north west is a major issue because there is no motorway access, no rail link and limited air links.  Regional access to the north west is very limited and this affects our future with regard to economic development and jobs.  It is a burning issue.  We are hopeful the motorway from Derry to Dublin will get the go-ahead.  With regard to using local roads for local access, it is true one uses the roads one has.  We focus most of our moneys on regional roads, and national roads have their own programme.</p></speech>

With regard to winter maintenance and reserves and stockpiles of salt, my local authority, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the NRA have procured salt supplies in recent years.  We have a stockpile of salt and I am satisfied we are in a healthy position in the case of events such as those which occurred two and three years ago.  However, this takes a slice from our roads funding.  We have had to up our standards and this has come at a cost with regard to the routine restoration or maintenance of roads.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-12a.559" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/995" speakername="Noel Harrington" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013061200006#K00400"><p>I welcome the witnesses.  I have great sympathy for the managers with regard to health and safety legislation because the buck stops with them.  They could be before a judge on a criminal matter before they knew where they were.  It is a very pressured and difficult environment in which to work.  It would have been helpful if Engineers Ireland or an engineer had come before the committee to discuss this matter because roads are not the only function of the managers.  They run local authorities and roads are a part of it.</p><p>  The lack of national infrastructure in the north west was mentioned.  I live in the south west and I must travel ten miles before I access a national road and then the motorway.  We do not have a rail system or an airport.  Cork Airport and Kerry Airport are 70 miles and 80 miles away, respectively.  I am familiar with many of the regional, local and tertiary roads in Cork.  Ideally, roads are not laid down, they are built.  The best roads I travel on have foundations and were built from scratch and maintenance is less of an issue.  For decades, money and funds in the country was tight and then we had the Celtic tiger.  What is the opinion of the witnesses on how we dealt with building roads rather than continually laying surface on roads with no foundations?  If the clock could be turned back, would they do it differently?</p><p>  What is the relationship of the management in the organisation and various local authorities with Engineers Ireland and the director of services or county engineer?  My impression is that engineers come with a very large bill which must be shoehorned into the funding available.  At any stage did Engineers Ireland or the engineering sector put forward the idea of continually putting two layers of tar and chip on top of roads which do not have adequate foundations is the way to go?  Is it necessary because of a funding issue?  What if somebody had taken a decision 30 years ago to rebuild the roads infrastructure as opposed to resurfacing it every summer?  From travelling around I know one can be thrown left, right and centre in a car.  Truck and van drivers have complained <i>ad nauseam</i> that certain roads have deteriorated not because they have not been dealt with by engineers or local authorities, but because they have no foundations.  This is a fundamental issue with regard to local and regional roads.  Has any assessment been done?  If the witnesses agree this is a problem, do we have a way to measure its scale?  Do we have a figure on how much it would cost to put it right?</p><p>  I welcome the progress made and I apologise for missing the beginning of the presentation.  I welcome the initiative taken and the technology used to identify and recognise where roads are satisfactory or in need of attention.  Various engineers would have had this information in their offices, but for decision making it is now in one place and I look forward to standardisation.  I presume the purpose of the exercise is to have standardisation throughout the country, whereby the idiosyncrasies of what individual engineers believe is required are removed and a standard and uniform approach is taken to road reconstruction and maintenance.</p><p>  Do the witnesses have a view on the investment in our motorways which has taken place in the past two decades?  It has been significant and has sucked up a very large amount of resources.  It is welcome and we have a fantastic motorway system, albeit all leading to Dublin.  Do the witnesses agree it has sucked investment from rural areas?  Will it lead to a problem with road fatigue?  Have we factored in how the motorways will be overlaid, whether in five or 15 years time?  Have we factored in significant extra investment to maintain standards and safety in our motorway system?</p></speech>

I come from County Leitrim and I suggest the road network in Leitrim, which has very few national secondary roads, is superb.  It amazes me that our road network seems to be of a significantly higher standard than that of many other counties, including those around us.  I am curious to know why this inconsistency exists.  It cannot just be about the rates base.  Does it have to do with the priorities of county managers or engineers?  Do county managers speak to each other about what they do?</p> <p>On a related point, most people from the North take a certain road south through the midlands.  I take it regularly.  The thought was put into my head when south Tipperary appeared on the screen.  The road runs from Athlone to Ferbane and Cloghan, where one cuts off for Borrisokane.  It must be the worst road.  It was built in Famine times and I doubt that a penny has been spent on it since.  Why is there not more consistency between local authorities as regards spinal roads such as this one?  They are essential for smooth and efficient transport.</p><p> In the context of the councils' overall funding, are they concerned about the standard of our road network?  We seem to have reverted to the 1980s, the time of the last economic recession.  As those who remember it know, it took 20 years for local authorities to return to where they had been before the 1980s, given the lack of money available for road maintenance.  Is the councils' concern being relayed to the Government?  Like me, I am sure that our guests do not want to hear that there is no money in the kitty.  Money can always be found, particularly for investments of this nature.  It is not like investing in a service - it is a question of the country's future.  What are our guests' collective opinion in this regard, what lobbying are they doing and how effective have they been in convincing the Government of the requirement to spend more on road maintenance?  Otherwise, we will need to rebuild roads, as Deputy Harrington stated.  If councils continue to be starved of funding in this regard, we will be back to square one in another 20 years.</p></speech>

I welcome the association's initiative, which will lead to a standardisation across the country.</p><p>  In terms of heavy loads, what effect do quarries have on our roads and is there any initiative to ameliorate some of the damage?</p><p>  I welcome the prioritisation. The score sheet seems to be an evidence-based approach to each road's treatment and requirements.  That there would eventually be a database of every road in the country and the condition of same is welcome.  It has been mentioned that traffic volume is critical.  Perhaps our guests can allay my concerns in this regard.  When we discuss roads with people, we get the most grief from those living on tertiary roads.  In this context, local improvement schemes and community involvement in roadworks, CIR, schemes seem to be the way to go.  What is the status of such schemes?  Are the councils making provision for them or have we moved to a minimum safe distance approach that is, that the roads are just about able to exist?</p><p>  The economic situation presents difficulties.  Mention was made of budgetary flexibility.  Can more flexibility be achieved?  What autonomy will the councils have to dedicate local property tax, LPT, moneys to the roads?</p><p>  What effect do oil prices have on the cost of the road materials that the councils use?  Even a slight increase seems to have a considerable effect.  Are the councils satisfied that the Department understands that there may be a problem if we do not maintain our roads to a certain standard?</p></speech>

We have been through the mill as area engineers.  I was an area engineer in the 1980s when there was no money.  Potholes and so on caused many sleepless nights.  There were no resources.  We are not quite at that point yet, but there is a risk of reaching it in three, four or five years.  We have given our key message to the Government and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the officials of which share it.  Indeed, the Minister also shares it on balance.  In terms of Exchequer funding, the question is how to cut the cake at national level.  I understand that the Department shares our opinion, in that the current level of funding is probably only 50% of what is required to maintain the road network.  This situation is tolerable for one, two or three years, but there will come a transition to the doomsday scenario described by Senator Mooney, after which the curve in terms of the amount of money needed to recover will increase.  This risk must be addressed in the next year or two if we are not to create a negative demand scenario.</p></speech>

I used the term "a stitch in time".  Although it is lay man's language, that is the situation.</p><p>  Regarding the approach taken to infrastructure in the Celtic tiger years, I appreciate that the length of our road network presented a difficulty for the political system as much as it did for engineers and managers.  We inherited it from the time of the horse and cart in some respects.  The benefit of the interventions during the Celtic tiger period are evident in the ratings.  Many rural roads were strengthened with substantial foundations, which is the language used by Deputy Harrington.  Some of the roads that were corrected in this way are now taking heavy loads, for example, milk tankers, but were a skin of stone and built for the horse and cart.  We have recovered somewhat.  Other interventions cannot be made and mapped until some foundation work has been done.</p><p>  Our regional road network was left in a better place by the Celtic tiger.  Many tarmacadam-based interventions were made in regional roads.  This is manifesting itself in the rating and testing.  I am not claiming that every pound was spent necessarily or correctly, but there has been a dividend.  If we did not have it, we would be in a very poor place.  We could not sustain the current level of maintenance spending and the deterioration would be more obvious.</p><p>  Investment in motorways is a public policy decision.  From our point of view, motorways serve the highest levels of traffic.  In this regard, an advantage of the new construction is that there is no immediate maintenance cost.</p> <p>The immediate cost of maintenance, the structural overlays - described by the Deputy as built roads - are designed for 20 and 30 year life cycles.  Strengthening and other substantially costly interventions will come 20 years down the road, rather than in the next five or ten years.  We all hope we will be in a better place then.</p><p> However, there is a small issue in terms of the standard of maintenance.  The NRA is moving that project to contract and there will be very significant maintenance standards for motorways, which comes at a cost.  Again, in terms of detecting most of the traffic, the majority of our visitors use motorways, for example, and on balance I would say that is the right approach.  Ultimately, it still is a big cake that has to be cut and yet, because the cake is not big enough, the issue of prioritisation remains.  </p><p> I appreciate I am not answering the point on consistency between local authorities satisfactorily.  I would not know the detail on Leitrim versus the neighbouring authority, for example.  There can be any number of reasons for the situation there.  Historical road conditions or investment going back 20 years could have a bearing on the condition of a road.  If that foundation or investment had been made 20 years ago a section of road could be otherwise.  At some level we can accept the accusation of some lack of consistency across boundaries - I would accept and acknowledge that - but what we are trying to do as a sector through the Lutz committee and others is what Mr. McLaughlin was outlining, namely, to start highlighting that.  This will be a very transparent system - it will give indications on ratings and scoring, will be very visible across county boundaries and once we reach that point it will be available to the public generally, to elected Members and local members.  That will help in terms of consistency.  In terms of issues such as winter maintenance we have greatly improved consistency.  One will not find gritting, salting and such items breaking down at county boundary lines.  Again, it is about reaching standards but it comes at a cost.  </p><p> I refer to lobbying for more money, which we are doing.  I will address one final point, the community employment schemes, and then leave the rest to my colleagues.  As a sector, we would be very clearly of the view that we are happy to be working with a labour activation scheme.  We would be very happy to take significant numbers into routine road maintenance areas but let us be clear there are issues with the unions in terms of allowing that to happen.  We would see drainage, for example, as an imperative in this area and would believe it should happen in current circumstances almost as a moral scenario.</p></speech>

We would welcome it and work with it.  In current circumstances, for example, in regard to the community involvement scheme, we are very happy to work with anything that will bring additional resources.  That resource does not have to be money.  For example, many members of the farming community have a resource in terms of plant and machinery.  We will work with any local communities to try to bring added value to the overall pot, such are the current circumstances.  As a society and a community we need to do that and we broadly take that view.  I apologise for rambling.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-12a.572" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Mulholland" time="10:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013061200008#M00400"><p>I will cover some of the points Mr. Walsh did not get to and will try to do so as quickly as possible.  Deputy Harrington asked if we have carried out an assessment of the amount of investment required on regional roads - the answer is "Yes".  A report was finalised last year which indicated that 39% of the country's regional roads required structural intervention.  The cost can vary so I cannot give a figure but, as a percentage, that figure seems about right.  If one looks at the soils classification map of the country it gives a large clue as to what areas will be susceptible to road failure.  That is simply an engineering principle and fact.  We all regard investment in motorways as being very profound, one that will have dividend and yield in the years ahead, not alone for driver safety, which is already to the fore, but also in regard to consistency of transport of goods and people around the State.</p><p>  Senator Mooney asked if we were concerned about the standard of the road network.  Yes, we are, and we continually make representations in that regard and present cases to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the National Roads Authority.  The two examples the Senator cited were about standards.  One might come from a very high standard of road to a lesser one which can be a difficulty for drivers, in particular for people who are unfamiliar with the area, given the road depreciation.  That is picked up under low-cost accident remediation works in many cases.  There has been a significant investment there.</p><p>  I refer to Deputy Phelan's queries on the co-operation we have with quarries, forestry owners and the like.  We all know those various employers are going through difficult periods and margins are tight.  However, we do try to establish codes of practice with them in regard to the roads they use, asking them to use the proper ones even though it might mean a couple of miles out of the way - depending on where one is, it could be 15 miles in some counties.  We ask them to use the better roads to get in and harvest their timber or take out their stone material.  It is not always easy.  Sometimes they sub-contract the driving duties, and so on, but we continually try to establish that link with them. </p><p>  Traffic volume is critical.  I take the Deputy's point about class 3 roads and local communities but that also comes into the equation.  Over the past ten years in particular there may be families settled in an area who have schoolgoing children at bus routes and this is factored in, in terms of representations on top of the engineering inspection conditions.</p><p>  Are we satisfied with the flexibility?  We have written to the Department and the NRA for the past two years regarding flexibility.  That was reciprocated with a positive response in January in the roads grant allocation, something we were very glad to see.  It allows councils at this time, when money is not really available, to apply lower-cost solutions to attend to immediate difficulties.  We know there is an underlying issue with some structural deficits.  I point out to Deputy Harrington that even the best built roads in the world need to be maintained on a regular basis.  For example, roads in the United States that were built to a very high standard in the 1950s are suffering huge degradation at present.  </p><p>  The Chairman's question referred to community involvement in roadwork schemes.  I would regard that as a most beneficial programme that must be sustained.  It varies from county to county as to how much local communities and councils avail of it but once it is applied, and people get to know the system, there is value for money and local solutions can be applied in a more timely fashion than would happen while waiting under a roads programme.  We see it as something that needs to be maintained.  Certainly in our experience it is a very good scheme.</p></speech>

It was a very reasonable question - why not rebuild all the roads to full standard?  It is really down to cost.  While everybody would love that, it would not be possible to pay for it in its entirety within one or two generations.  As part of examining the system we looked at what has been going on in some other countries, with some outside help from people who have worked in Wales, Scotland, New Zealand and the United States, as Mr. Mulholland mentioned.  I worked on the roads in the US for 13 years so I am quite familiar with the situation there.  No developed country can rebuild all its roads within a generation or two.  What some people consider at times of little money is that although the highest standard cannot be achieved for all roads, it is possible to do more to reach a reasonable standard.  That is counter to what the Deputy said but there is a balance.  This system will give us those options in time and then it will be a matter of making decisions - what do we want to do?  Do we want to spend &euro;4 million per km, or spend &euro;100,000 per km and do 40 km?  Those are trade-offs and require information and options and for the implications to be clear for those making the decisions.  That is all I will say on that point.</p><p>  Senator Mooney mentioned Leitrim, which is close to Donegal so I might as well comment.  I would know some of the Leitrim roads and I share the Senator's view.  In fairness, when we look at the maps of places in the country we have done so far there is quite a bit of green.  That is a snapshot in time.  If one did nothing, a point Mr. Mulholland made, those green areas would deteriorate more and more.  It is a matter of what can be done to hold them.  The scoring system we have will, hopefully, bring consistency.  Ultimately, the big decision is whether money should follow the bad roads or be given out under traditional practices.  Those are the decisions ahead of us as a country.</p><p>  Mr. Mulholland answered the point about heavy loads.  In fairness, cars do not damage roads with their weight.  Rather it is the heavy vehicles.</p> <p>There is a balance between companies trying to make money, business and jobs, as well as urban and rural concerns.  Mr. Mulholland spoke of a code of practice and that is the best and most reasonable way to go.  It will never be a perfect world for everybody.</p></speech>

It seems to be inconsistent, as some counties use bitmac and others use chippings.  Why is there an impression of inconsistency?  Surely it would be more sensible to adopt the most efficient type of road surfacing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-12a.576" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McLaughlin" time="10:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013061200009#N00300"><p>Everybody works to the same NRA road works specification across the country but different materials can be selected from within those.  The best of these would be hot-rolled asphalt, as seen on national roads, which requires a firm base and a good foundation.  It cannot be put on roads liable to settlement because it cracks.  Although it is the best and most expensive, it would not be useful to put it somewhere it does not last.  Dropping down a level would bring us to bitmac, or dense bitumen macadam, with surface dressing of tar and chips.  That is the next grade and it is a bit cheaper; it also has more flexibility and goes a bit further.  The lower grades would be referred to as wet mix with surface dressing, which goes even further and is more pliable.  That is used to a greater extent on local roads.  That is the reason we see differences between motorways and national, regional, local and tertiary roads, although they all operate to the same specification.  We should also mention the issue of keeping water off roads, which is very important, especially for unbound materials.</p></speech>

Although I thought we would have managers, we have engineers, and the session has been very informative.  That may be facetious.  Where local authority managers have come from an engineering background, do they dedicate more resources to roads?</p></speech>

We are on the transportation committee but it is accidental that we come from an engineering background.  We are conscious of the particular needs and demands of asset investment, and not just for us.  It could be related to water, sewerage or other areas, although there is a transition at the moment.  The current fiscal environment - local as much as national - is controlling choices greatly.  Managers are often accused that we present budgets and estimates to the elected members on a council but we do so with the view of having them passed, so we have regard to members' views, which operate along a continuum.  It is about capacity more than anything else and the current fiscal environment does not allow for more resources being allocated to roads.</p><p>  Different councils and managers may have different priorities and economic development, for example, is a key priority.  Every manager would share the concern that if we do not keep the infrastructure right in some way, we will not have economic development, either in rural or urban settings.  We need to keep a basic level.  Members have mentioned forestry and quarries, which are all part of economic development.  Our function is to keep roads as arteries primarily for societal use but they must also serve economic development.  We genuinely try to prioritise on that basis.</p></speech>

There was a specific point about the use of community employment schemes and there is a trade union issue.  Without reopening the debate, I believe I am right in arguing that the trade union's view would be that it is the council's obligation to provide staff.  We are in a new environment and in the rural areas from where most of us come, there are people willing and able to work on community employment schemes, so it is a no-brainer that there should be some sort of accommodation between unions and local authorities.  Could we have a role in that regard in urging participating parties to come together on the issue?</p></speech>
