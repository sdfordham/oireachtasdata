    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-21a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2017032100002#B00400"><p>I am very pleased to accept the invitation to meet with the committee.  This is a valuable opportunity to review how we are progressing with the current challenges and opportunities presented across the various sectors in agriculture, food development, marine and forestry.</p> <p>  Budget 2017 demonstrated the Government&rsquo;s firm commitment to the agrifood and marine sectors, recognising the challenges faced by rural communities and the ongoing challenge of Brexit.  In 2017, the Exchequer contribution to the Vote of my Department will amount to &euro;1.468 billion.  This is &euro;1.23 billion in current expenditure and &euro;260 million capital expenditure when a &euro;22 million capital carry-over is taken into account.  This represents an overall increase of almost &euro;120 million over last year and recognises the role the agrifood sector continues to play in our economic recovery.  The agrifood sector has performed strongly in recent years with Bord Bia estimating that exports reached an estimated &euro;11.15 billion in 2016.  This represents a new high for exports and market growth of over 50% since 2009.  In addition to the funding received through the Department Vote, in 2017 Ireland will receive some &euro;1.2 billion in direct funding from the EU for the basic payment scheme.</p> <p>  My key focus for 2017 is on maintaining farm payments and protecting vulnerable farm incomes against market volatility, supporting sustainable investment and jobs in rural and coastal communities and strengthening the sector to meet the challenges of Brexit.  I have prioritised the ongoing implementation of the rural development programme and the seafood development programme, and fulfilled the commitments in A Programme for a Partnership Government in relation to sheep welfare.   I have also continued to provide support to forestry, horticulture, the various State agencies under my remit and the horse and greyhound racing fund.</p> <p>  The UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the European Union undoubtedly presents an enormous challenge for the Irish agrifood sector.  The UK is by far our largest trading partner.  In 2016, we exported &euro;4.8 billion worth of agricultural products.  Ireland is also the UK&rsquo;s largest destination for its food exports, which were worth &euro;3.7 billion in 2016.</p> <p>  I and my Department have been actively engaged in assessing the impact of the referendum vote on the Irish agrifood sector, consulting appropriate stakeholders and engaging with relevant politicians and institutions.  This work is being done in conjunction with the overall Government response co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach.  In response to the challenges posed, I have undertaken a number of important steps within my Department, which include the establishment of a Brexit response committee and a dedicated Brexit unit.  I have also created a stakeholder consultative committee which is complemented by frequent and ongoing contact with representative organisations and companies.  I also hosted three meetings under the all-island civic dialogue process.  All these opportunities for consultation allow me and my Department to establish the issues of critical concern to industry stakeholders.</p> <p>  The impact of Brexit on the food industry has initially been in terms of currency volatility and uncertainty, presenting challenges to maintaining hard-won markets and a need to intensify the process in recent years of diversifying into new and emerging markets which offer good potential for growth.  In line with their market intelligence and promotion mission, Bord Bia has responded quickly, engaging with companies and developing a four pillar strategy to provide food and drink companies with market information, advice and practical supports. The four pillars are managing volatility, obtaining consumer and market insight, deepening consumer engagement, and extending market reach.  The additional &euro;2 million being provided in 2017, which builds on increased funding in recent years, will enable Bord Bia to undertake a number of activities in 2017.  These activities include an export marketing strategy programme to help individual companies to maintain and grow their position in the UK and diversify their market reach, research to identify priority market opportunities, participation in three new trade fairs in Asia, and increased presence at key food shows such as Gulfood, where space will be doubled, and Anuga in Germany.</p> <p>  The activities planned build on the supplementary market and business support programmes which were developed by Bord Bia following the United Kingdom referendum and for which additional funding of &euro;1.6 million was made available to Bord Bia in 2016.   Bord Bia is also planning to almost double its drawdown of EU promotion funds to &euro;1.9 million, mainly for activities focused on China.</p> <p>  Skills are an important element in delivering market related research and services.  In 2016, sanction was given to Bord Bia to recruit 20 additional staff.  The recruitment programme is well advanced, with just four positions to be filled in 2017.</p> <p>  I am engaged in a series of bilateral meetings with my European Union counterparts which are aimed at building alliances to ensure agrifood and fisheries issues are at the top of the EU negotiation agenda.  I want to discuss and gauge the importance of Brexit to these member states and assess the degree to which they could support Ireland&rsquo;s efforts to have these issues specifically and adequately taken into account in the negotiations.</p> <p>  I have just returned from a series of such bilateral meetings in Germany, Netherlands and Denmark and I will be having meetings in Estonia and Poland at the end of the month.  I have plans to meet other European Union Ministers next month.  I am also in regular communication with the Commissioner Phil Hogan and my officials have taken part in meetings with the Commission and the Barnier task force.</p> <p>  I am also very committed to continuing a very strong focus on trade promotion in 2017.  I have participated on trade missions to the Gulf states this year which has enhanced and improved our existing levels of market access, and I am also considering a range of other destinations for the remainder of 2017.</p> <p>  Last October, I announced a ground-breaking measure for the agrifood industry in the form of a cashflow support loan fund.  Developed in conjunction with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, by leveraging EU and Exchequer funding totalling &euro;25 million to deliver a total loan fund of &euro;150 million, it was designed to support highly flexible loans for up to six years for amounts up to &euro;150,000.  The interest rate applying is 2.95% and the product, which became available in January, was made available to livestock, tillage and horticulture farmers.  This innovative loan scheme provides farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital and allows them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, such as merchant credit or overdrafts, contributing to the ongoing financial sustainability of their farming enterprises.</p><p>The scheme is administered through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank and they will report on progress to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI on a regular basis, although no official returns have been received by my Department as yet.  However all of the banks have confirmed that they have applications up to the amounts available under the scheme.  There may be some residual availability but this will only emerge as applications are processed and loans drawn down. <br/><br/>I am very pleased at the very positive reaction by farmers to the scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low cost flexible finance.  I hope that the commercial banks will respond positively to this demand by reducing interest rates and providing more flexible terms for cashflow loans in the future.  I plan to meet the chief executives of the banks shortly to discuss this and other issues relating access to finance in the agrifood sector. <br/><br/>A key priority for 2017 is to prioritise the ongoing implementation of the rural development programme and the seafood development programme and to fulfil programme for partnership Government commitments.  I have also continued to provide support to forestry, horticulture, the various State agencies under my remit and the Horse and Greyhound Fund. <br/><br/>The &euro;4 billion rural development programme provides vitally important stimulus in the Irish rural economy.  In 2017 rural development funding will increase by more than 21% from &euro;494 million to more than &euro;600 million. <br/><br/>In 2017, the agri-environmental scheme, GLAS, will benefit from additional funding.  Applications under the first two tranches of the GLAS scheme resulted in almost 38,000 farmers being approved into the scheme in its first year of implementation.  Furthermore, just under 14,000 applications were received for GLAS 3 which closed in mid-December last.  Approvals have now issued in respect of over 90% of these applications, with the remaining applications currently being examined by the Department with a view to issuing further approvals where appropriate.  This will bring the overall participation levels in GLAS to well over the targeted participation level of 50,000 farmers. <br/><br/>The 2016 payments represent the first full year of payment under GLAS.  At the end of December 2016, there were approximately 37,500 active participants in the GLAS scheme, of which over 86% have now received payments valued at over &euro;112.9 million.  Further payments are issuing on a weekly basis where all the required validation checks have been successfully passed. <br/><br/><b></b>The sum of &euro;52 million will be available for the beef data and genomics programme in 2017.  I believe that this innovative scheme will accelerate the genetic improvement that will drive efficiency and increase profitability at farm level and enhance our reputation as a world leader in sustainable food production. <br/><br/>I have provided &euro;50 million for the TAMS II scheme in 2017.  There has been a significant level of interest in the six investment measures that had already opened under the TAMS scheme with more than 10,600 applications received to date.  Approvals are issuing on an ongoing basis after the closure of each tranche.  Approvals have now issued to over 6,400 applicants. <br/><br/>This month I opened a seventh measure focusing on tillage.  Through the Tillage Stakeholder Forum I am aware of the issues facing the tillage sector including the effects of a poor harvest in 2016.  This new TAMS II measure includes capital investment measures which will assist the sector in supporting the use of the most modern and efficient equipment and facilities to enable the tillage farmer to improve competitiveness.  I would encourage all tillage farmers to examine the provisions of the scheme as I am confident that this new measure will provide a strong platform for investments on tillage holdings.<br/><br/>Some &euro;25 million will also be available for payment to over 20,000 participants in the beef, dairy, equine, sheep, poultry and tillage knowledge transfer scheme.  The implementation of the scheme builds on the knowledge and skills base of farmers in key areas and focuses on profitability and sustainability and also important issues such as farm safety and farm succession planning. <br/><br/>I have fulfilled the programme for partnership Government commitment with the introduction of a scheme for sheep farmers and a budget of some &euro;25 million has been provided.  The scheme provides support of &euro;10 per ewe to farmers with breeding ewes flocks.  Farmers are required to undertake two actions in each year of the scheme, with actions to be chosen from a menu of actions linked to lowland and hill type flocks. <br/><br/>The &euro;241 million European maritime and fisheries fund operational programme, launched in January 2016, will be further rolled out in 2017 with an increased total budget of &euro;43 million made available across my Department and its agencies.  This investment will fund a range of programmes including capital investment in the seafood processing, aquaculture and fishing sectors to foster growth in production, value and employment, and to enhance sustainability and competitiveness. <br/><br/>I have also made &euro;85 million in funding available for the food safety animal and plant health work performed by the Department.  While we have seen some savings under this heading in recent years due to the reduced instance of disease it is important to remain vigilant and defend out health status and keep our food standards at the very leading edge. <br/><br/>This is a very brief overview of the range of measures that apply in the agrifood and marine sectors for 2017 and I look forward to the discussion and questions from committee members.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-21a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1350" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2017032100002#C00300"><p>I have a number of questions arising from the Minister's opening statement.</p> <p>  The Minister spoke about the significant uptake for low cost loans.  In my opinion the reason for the huge uptake in loans is that farmers' incomes in all sectors are under pressure.  They saw the loan scheme as a safety valve to try to reduce their exposure to high cost loans.  I am not ridiculing the scheme.  It was a worthwhile scheme while it lasted.  I remember tabling a question to the Minister at the end of January asking when the scheme would be up and running.  The money only lasted three to four weeks.  Many dairy farmers have contacted me to say that it came at a time when they had not time to focus on visits to the bank, and by the time they got around to make the call to the bank, the money had run out.  Is it possible to run another scheme with similar funds because I am sure the demand is there for it?  Second, loans under the scheme were to be for a six year term, however, the banks have shown a reluctance to give a term of that length to their customers.  They have been trying to force their customer to take shorter term loans from this scheme.  That is running counter to what was envisaged under the scheme.  The scheme was to help farmers with their cashflow, to get rid of their merchant credit and to allow them put their affairs back in order during the six year period.  The hope is that the product price would improve to help the balance of payments.  There has been a reluctance by the banks to give people the low cost loans for that six year term.  The Minister stated in his opening statement that he will meet with the chief executives of the banks.  I would like him to drive home the points I have made because what they are doing is against the spirit of the scheme which was to allow farmers to make repayments over a longer period and do it at a low cost and keep their overdraft in place.  I know of cases where banks have told individual farmers that the loan is for merchant credit and they will only give it to the farmer for a two year period.  That defeats the spirit of the scheme.  Additional money is needed for another scheme like that one.  It is absolutely essential.  The demand for this low cost loan scheme shows the pressure that farmers are under.  The banks were trying to tailor the scheme to suit themselves rather than their customers.</p> <p>  I can leave my comments on Bord Bia until later.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-21a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1350" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2017032100002#C00500"><p>Chairman, I might come back in again.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-21a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2017032100002#C00600"><p>On the same point, it is important that the Minister and his officials understand that the banks are not making this money available for a term of six years.  It is ranging from two to four years.  Numerous people have come to me who would like to have the opportunity to avail of a six year term, but the banks have tried to split the amount into a number of different timeframes for different usages.  In truth we anticipated that it would not be overly cumbersome but the banks have refused quite a few people.  It is as important for the Minister and the Department to have the analysis on how many people the banks have refused, the reasons for refusal and any other information the Department can acquire.  If a person is refused a loan under this scheme, does he or she have the opportunity to go to the Credit Review Office to have the decision reviewed?</p><p>If the Bank of Ireland has allocated all the money, but a decision is under review, is it possible for that person to get a loan at 2.9%, or will he or she fall into a different category?  From my experience when a bank's provision for low interest loans is gone, it is tough luck as the money is gone.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-21a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1370" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2017032100002#D00500"><p>I am not surprised by the banks.  I hope the Minister and his officials will not be taken in by them.  They have ridden roughshod across the general public for a long number of years.  They are doing the same thing in this regard.  I understood the loans were to be structured in such a way that people who wanted an interest-only loan for a number of years, could do that.  Obviously I would not advise that, because I believe one is better off to get tickling at the capital, if that is at all possible.</p> <p>  In fairness to the Minister, this is a worthwhile scheme and time has been spent in framing it, however it is useless if the banks are behaving as banks do notwithstanding that they have two floors of foundations under them rather than one.  Are the banks not making money from this scheme?  I am sure they are making money from it.  Banks never do anything without making money.  This is such a successful scheme, however a number of farmers would benefit if the Minister could widen its availability, particularly in terms of what is up ahead.  Would the Minister consider expanding this scheme?  I know that the downturn in prices for tillage in the past number of years has brought this scheme to the fore.  I genuinely hope the Minister might extend it.  </p> <p>  The banks appear to be found wanting again, but that is no surprise to me.  The promises and commitments they make are just rhetoric.  I believe the scheme should be subject to detailed evaluation and assessment.  The Department together with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland should have a major input into this assessment, it should not be left to SBCI alone.  Deputy D'Arcy is correct in asking for the reasons that loans were refused and the number of refusals.  It should not be a two liner, but a detailed response on the reasons that low interest loans were refused.  How will we help those in need who were refused low interest loans?</p></speech>

Obviously there was some European money put into the scheme as well as State funding.  It was leveraged by taking in additional funds from the SBCI.  The overall objective is that loans would be available every year balanced out over the six years.</p> <p>  The feedback that I am getting is similar to what other Deputies have been getting, is that in many cases the banks are limiting the loans to one year or two year term loans.  Therefore what happens to the value of the overall fund in years two, three, four and five?  Will it not be drawn down in those instances?  If the full amount of the fund is lent in year one, once one gets to year two, those who received a one year loan are out of the system.  There should be some unspent funds that could be budgeted into year two.  Similarly in years three, four, five and six, is the money in the fund not being leveraged and drawn down?  Is the money not in the system as a result of the fact that short-term loans were given at the outset?  Is the full scope of the loan being drawn down in later years?  For example if &euro;3 million or &euro;4 million is lent out for two years, once it comes to year three, will the banks be able to lend money to somebody else for another four years?  I am not clear on how the system works.</p></speech>

I have a question on the same issue.  I wish to raise the inconsistency of the banks.  I know that AIB have dealt locally with all the farmers, however, if one applies to Bank of Ireland, one will get a text message three weeks after making the application, to be told that a bank official will be in contact in a number of weeks, as they are dealing with the loans centrally.  I know that several Bank of Ireland customers are still waiting for a response, having applied before the deadline.  We are now coming into the busy farming season, when farmers need cashflow.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-21a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2017032100002#D01200"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for their questions.  It is important to recall the reason the scheme was necessary.  In a nutshell if one goes back to the first quarter report of the Central Bank of Ireland in 2016, it did a league table of the cost of credit across the eurozone member states.  Ireland was firmly rooted in the relegation zone in terms of what people were paying for credit here relative to Austria, which had the most competitive rate at 2.2%, if memory serves me correctly.  That is shades of the point made by Deputy Penrose.  The banks have always managed even in difficult times to make its Irish customers pay a premium rate.  There are many reasons for that and I do not want to go into them today.</p> <p>  When we received the &euro;11 million as part of the EU compensation package last year, which was available across all the livestock sector, our thinking was that spreading the money thinly would not give anybody anything of benefit.  We added &euro;14 million of Exchequer funding and leveraged &euro;150 million at the interest rate, which was 2.95%.  The terms and conditions of the scheme is that loans are up to a maximum of six years, but banks were taking account of individual circumstances.  I know that some loans were approved for a period of six years; there are loans that were approved for 12 months; and, there are loans for every period in between these timescales.  The banks had discretion in terms of their individual clients.  There were options for interest-only loans, and a term of up to six years.  </p> <p>  The applicants have access to the Credit Review Office.  In terms of managing their loan portfolio, each individual bank will need to manage that.  From my personal experience of dealing with the Credit Review Office, they turn the reviews around quickly.  In regard to a person who was refused a low interest loan and went to the Credit Review Office, which overturned the bank's decision, I do not imagine the bank would be in a position to say that all the money from the fund is gone and they have to hold funds, pending an outcome of an appeals process.  We will take a great interest in the experience of this loan fund.  We will learn who drew down the funds, the sectors that were funded and the average size of the loans.  From hearing the experience of those in my constituency, my information is that the average loans tend to be in the region of &euro;20,000 to &euro;30,000.  There might be some at the very top end, but most are in the average band.  I think it shows there is a pent-up demand.  For those banks outside the three banks that were participating - AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank - there is evidence they have responded competitively in terms of other products geared at the agriculture sector.  That is what we wanted from this.  In many respects it would have been a goad to the banking industry to step up to the plate and provide access to funding.</p><p>We will be tracking this and we will get details of the profile, the average loan amount and the average loan in due course.</p><p> On Deputy McConalogue's point, if the fund is given out but it is paid back in 12 months, that does not mean the fund is not there.  There is &euro;150 million of loan approvals, whether over 12 months or five years, and that is the term of the loan product.  We await with interest the full profile returns from the sectors that were involved, including the size of the loans, in order to see what lessons we can learn from it.  Generally speaking, I believe the experience has been a positive one.</p></speech>

The idea of the &euro;25 million, which is part State-funded and part EU-funded, was that it would ensure that overall pot of &euro;150 million over six years and it provided the basis on which the lower interest rate could be had from the banks.  When the SBCI loan was announced at &euro;150 million, my expectation was that this would mean there would be &euro;150 million of potential credit in the system for up to six years, although people would obviously be paying it back over that period.  Let us say that all of the loans are approved and that there is &euro;150 million in the system and that &euro;50 million of this is lent for one year only, then by the time the second year arrives, there will be only &euro;100 million of loans in the system.  Obviously, money will be paid back over time, for example, by the third year if some of it is lent for a three-year term.  That is my point.  My understanding was that the structure of the loan was such that it allowed for six years.  If it is the case that a certain amount was budgeted in that way and if a certain amount of it is just one-year, two-year or three-year finance, can that then re-enter the system and can it be re-lent by the banks under this SBCI scheme?  This would mean that any money lent for a one-year term could potentially be re-lent for up to five years to somebody else.  Otherwise, the loan is diluted and is not of as much value to the farming community as it had appeared to be when it was initially launched.</p></speech>

Banks have forced men to take shorter terms than they wanted.  I know of numerous people who wanted a six-year term but this has reduced to four, three or even two years in some cases.  The farmers saw the availability of cheap credit over a period and believed it would ease cashflow problems to pay the money over as long a period as the scheme allowed.  I cannot understand why the banks have done this.  The scheme was designed to be a six-year scheme with, as has been said, an option that the first three years would be interest-only, if the client so desired, although, like Deputy Penrose, I do not think that was such a good idea.  I do not understand why the banks have forced customers to take shorter terms than were envisaged under the scheme.  The scheme was to ease a farmer's cashflow and help him to get back on the rails when he was under pressure to clear current debt levels.  I would like the banks to explain why they have refused clients who wanted a six-year term and forced them to go for a significantly shorter term.</p></speech>

The Department keeps a record of all beneficiaries who would have benefited from <i>de minimis</i>payments up to now.  It then had to keep track of whether the subsidy element that was available if this loan exceeded the &euro;15,000 threshold over a three-year period.  That is important.  I would imagine that very few people are impacted upon by this and that the level of subsidy would only possibly kick in for people who are taking out a loan at or near the maximum amount.</p><p>On Deputy McConalogue's point, the &euro;25 million that went into it was not part of the capital that was borrowed, it was actually a subsidy to the cost of the loan scheme and the interest rate.  Once the capital is loaned out and the subsidy is available to the beneficiary - whether it is over one year, five years or six years - and the loan is repaid, the capital is not available for a second or third time.  For example, if the original loan is for three years, the capital is not available for three more years.</p><p>I take Deputy Cahill's point that people wanted five or six years and ended up with half of that or less.  Under the scheme, the interest rate was subsidised and other elements made it more cost effective, and people did not need the deeds of the farm because it was an unsecured loan.  Apart from that, however, normal terms and conditions applied in regard to the banks' criteria and assessment of a loan application.</p></speech>

This was a scheme the Department brought in to give the opportunity for a six-year term for cashflow issues but the banks forced clients to take significantly shorter terms.  The banks have done it and got away with it but I cannot understand why they were allowed to do so.  If the farmer wanted a six-year term and the scheme allowed for that, why should the banks have the prerogative to force him to take a shorter term?</p></speech>

However, there are farmers getting much greater loans at much higher interest rates for machinery, and with one quarter of the paperwork and effort that is going into this loans process from the same banks.  Somebody has complicated this nicely in order for the banks to benefit.</p></speech>

It did not state that every loan applicant was entitled to six years.  The State's input was to subsidise the loan and address a market gap.  It was not a question of the State getting into the banking business.  It was unsecured credit, a subsidised interest rate, an option for interest only, for a maximum of six years.  That did not mean that every loan was going to be approved at six years.  After those elements of the scheme were designed any individual loan application was subject to normal banking considerations.</p> <p>  Valid points have been raised.  This has been in many respects a maiden voyage for the Department to address a gap in the market.  Broadly speaking, the interest in it has proved that it was a wise route to take in terms of the funding we had to play around with.  As soon as we can gather and collate the information we intend to do that and see what lessons we can learn from it.  At this stage we cannot draw those conclusions and it would be wrong to do so.  The questions are: Why was it one, two or six years in different circumstances; what sectors benefited; what message do we take from the fact that it may have been excessively dairy and tillage rather than beef and is there another issue to be addressed in other sectors?  The &euro;11 million that the European Union, EU, put into it has to be drawn down by the end of September 2017.  That is the absolute deadline by which we will have all the data.  I suspect, given the level of interest, that it will be much earlier than that.  Establishing the approvals, drawdowns, rejections, the reasons why and who benefited, what the terms were and the conclusions we can draw from all of that information are important exercises from our point of view.  We will undertake them in conjunction with the banks involved and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, at the earliest possible date. </p></speech>

Why would the banks reduce the time a client wanted?  The longer it was for a client with cashflow difficulties the better for the client.  What did the bank gain by forcing him to take a third of the length of time he wanted?  There has to be a gain for the banks.  It definitely was not a gain for the clients.  The banks have not operated the scheme in the spirit the Department intended.  I have no issue with the Department.  The banks have manipulated the scheme for their own benefit.  Reducing the term of the loan is not in the client's interest.  The longer he had the cheap money, the easier it was going to be for him to get his cashflow right.</p></speech>

That was the State's input.  Thereafter it was subject to normal terms and conditions.  We see that in a few weeks the fund has been drawn down completely.  We await the information from the individual banks and the SBCI to see what lessons we can draw from that, the sectors, the size of the loans and their terms.  We want to know what lies behind the terms between one and six years, all for future purposes.</p> <p>  With &euro;14 million of Exchequer funds and a total cost of &euro;25 million to subsidise it, this has not been a cheap product but it has identified a gap in the market and driven others to be more competitive.  Until we get the full information on the drawdown we will not be able to answer all the detailed questions.  I will meet the chief executive officers, CEOs, of the pillar banks and it would be appropriate for the committee to meet with them too on that and many other issues.</p></speech>

There will be lessons to be learned from it and engaging with the banks will be important.</p> <p>  The Minister, however, could give more clarity in response to my question.  The Department, with the SBCI and the banks, structured and put this scheme together.  The perception at the outset was that it would be available to farmers for terms of up to six years.  The Minister has outlined that the &euro;25 million ensured the cost of that lower interest rate for terms of up to six years.</p></speech>

The only way that would not have been utilised is if the Department, working with the banks and the SBCI, had factored into its figures the fact that a proportion of these loans would be for a one, two or three year term.

To play devil's advocate, if all the loans were to be handed out over two years, in two years' time that &euro;150 million would be out of the system and it would be normal bank lending again.  That would be the extreme end of it but I want to be clear on whether the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine had clear targets and guidelines in terms of the proportion of loans that could have different terms.</p></speech>

In structuring a loan portfolio like that we would have had to engage with the banks, as the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, did, and said that this is what we want to achieve.  In terms of the profile of lending across various sectors, there would have been sufficient experience within SBCI and my Department to ensure we got the best result possible for the &euro;25 million.  We could not state definitively how many applications would come in for one year, five years or six years.  Ultimately, in terms of the individual banks, that became a decision for the banks to make.  Our subsidy was to ensure that the interest rate, the term of the loan and the unsecured nature of it made it more attractive than anything already in the marketplace, but we await the outcome on that.</p></speech>

In terms of plant, I am using this example to make a general plea and I ask the Chairman to allow me some scope in that regard.  The usage of quads on farms is becoming very dangerous.  The number of people killed or paralysed per annum is far too high.  I spoke to a health and safety specialist who made the valid point that if there was a device on a building site that did as much damage as quads every year, it would be banned.  There was a tragedy in my own area in the past week involving good friends of mine who lost their son.  The number of accidents on these machines is too high.  I am not saying quads should be banned but the Department, with the Department of Finance, should be able to do something to improve safety.  The only way to improve safety is to get rid of them.  There are much safer vehicles available.  The Gator buggies are much safer.  They are slower, wider and they do not turn over to the same extent.  For a period of time the VAT and VRT on those vehicles should be reduced to zero to give the farming sector the opportunity to rid farms of quads.

In truth, we are losing the battle.  There is no point in saying otherwise.  I had a meeting earlier this year with the Health and Safety Authority in conjunction with the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Breen, to discuss how we might address this issue.  We have to take an approach whereby nothing can be ruled out in this regard.  I am familiar with the point the Deputy made about quads.  I am also aware of fatal accidents in my constituency involving quads.  I do not wish to give an exact figure in case I am wrong but, if my recollection is right, accidents involving farm machinery constitute a very high proportion of the overall number of accidents.  We might have to contemplate issues that are unpopular.</p> <p>  I visited a rural national school in west Cork recently.  The school has safety ambassadors and one of the points I made to the children was that when they went home they should badger their parents about getting the tractor serviced.  There are simple problems such as faulty brakes.  We would never consider driving a car in those circumstances but we are not as vigilant about the safety of farm machinery.  Twenty years ago tractors on farms were much smaller.  Now they are enormous vehicles, so we must ensure all of them are fit for purpose and serviced regularly.</p></speech>

The Deputy appears to think they should be banned.  However, we must create an awareness of how to use them appropriately.  I sympathise with the Deputy's friend who lost their son.  I read about the accident.  On reducing the VAT rate on alternatives to zero, that is an issue for the Minister for Finance.  My view is that we need a change in attitude in our approach to farm safety, particularly to operating machinery.  Part of that involves education and another part would be the compulsory servicing of machinery to ensure it is fit for purpose.  If my recollection is correct, most fatal accidents on farms are machinery related.</p></speech>

Currently, 24,500 farmers are signed up under the programme.  The Minister indicated that &euro;52 million is available for the programme in 2017.  We have had a debate, and will probably debate it again, on the need for additional supports for the suckler cow herd and, in particular, whether there is capacity to increase payments under the BDGP towards &euro;200.  There was a commitment at the outset to open it to a capacity of 35,000 farmers.  Is &euro;52 million sufficient funding for that to happen this year and to accommodate the additional 10,500 farmers?  Perhaps the Minister will comment on that.</p></speech>

The Deputy labours under an illusion that there is an enormous, unspent pot of gold in the Department, but if there was, we would open it immediately.  I hope there might be some room for manoeuvre but no decision has been made on it yet.</p> <p>  On Deputy Cahill's question, we tendered for the appointment of a consultant to design a scheme on the hen harrier.  I am advised that a preferred consultant has been identified but the contract has not yet been signed.  The principle is that when the contract is signed with the successful tenderer, they will design a scheme in conjunction with the Department and those who hold designated lands.  It is envisaged that applicants will be invited into such a scheme in 2017 with payment in 2018.</p></speech>

Therefore, if the Minister were to reopen significantly the beef data and genomics programme this year, particularly if he were to reopen it for the 10,000 additional farmers, which I am saying was committed to at the start, he would have to find additional funds to do so.

I am quoting back to him his predecessor&rsquo;s commitments in respect of this programme and in respect of GLAS.  They may have become myths at this stage but they certainly were not myths when the commitments were made.</p> <p>  I will move on to the question of expenditure on the GLAS programme.  GLAS III has reopened and 14,000 farmers have applied to it.  This year's budget for GLAS III is &euro;214 million.  If those 14,000 additional farmers under GLAS III are to be paid for the full calendar year of 2017 and if the average payment is the same as what it was until now for GLAS I and GLAS II, that is, approximately &euro;4,500, it would take &euro;236 million in 2017 to pay fully those 14,000 additional farmers who have applied and who have been told they will be accepted.  However, the figure in this year's budget for GLAS is &euro;214 million.  There is therefore approximately a &euro;20 million or &euro;22 million discrepancy in the figures - that is, if the average payment is what it has been until now.  Obviously, those 14,000 farmers who have applied to GLAS III are hoping to be paid for the full year and hoping the budget will be there this year.  I ask the Minister to address this discrepancy in the GLAS budget for this year.  Does it arise from the fact that farmers will not be paid for the full 12 months or the fact that the Minister expects the average payment to be less than what it has been until now?</p></speech>

The Deputy is aware that we are paying out in the calendar year of 2017 what would have been considered 2016 liabilities in some respects.  Therefore, we are paying out some of 2016's liabilities from the envelope of money provided for in 2017 and we will also pay out applications for 2017 from it.  People may not get 100% of their 2017 payment.  We have increased the number of applicants by 13,000 this year, taking the figure to more than 50,000.  It is the most successful environmental scheme.  There is a rolling element to it.  All applicants, it is envisaged, will get an advance payment.  Whether or not they will get 100% of their payments, from Deputy McConalogue&rsquo;s assessment of the figures, it is likely that the balancing payment will slip into 2018, just as the 2016 payment is being paid to some in 2017.  That is the nature of all the schemes the Department runs.</p></speech>

Our experience of GLAS payments for 2016 was that commitments were made that the farmers would be paid in December but this has not happened.  That has rolled into this year.  There are many farmers - up to 5,000 at the moment - in a very difficult position because of this.  Regarding the Department's operation of the scheme and the learning of lessons from it, I would have expected that we could be crystal clear about those 14,000 farmers who have signed up for GLAS III and what percentage of their payments they will get this year.  They would have assumed in fairness that there would be a sufficient budget in place so that when they signed up at the end of last year to start the scheme this January, they could rightfully expect to be paid and not be subject to the kinds of delays we have seen recently because there is not sufficient funding in the budget.</p></speech>

When we opened the scheme, we took in every applicant, some 13,000 extra.  We could have taken in half of them or less and paid everybody the full amount, instead of taking in everybody and managing the payments in order that they would all be paid.  In the calendar year 2017 farmers will receive some of their 2016 payment and some of their 2017 payment.  The numbers in the latest tranche have gone up from 38,000 to over 50,000 and I felt it was better to take in every applicant and pay as many as possible.  I acknowledge that we are having difficulty in getting all of the payments out, but I think we are making the right choice because we are getting as many beneficiaries as possible into the scheme.</p></speech>

If the Minister's choices mean that they will not receive the full payment this year, perhaps he might confirm what his choices were for the 14,000 who signed up in good faith for the GLAS scheme.  It would be better if they were informed in order that they would know in advance what their financial position would be, rather than finding out next December that they will not be paid because of a choice the Minister has already made.  We need to learn from the hardship farmers participating in GLAS have experienced in the past year or two.  The onus is on the Minister to communicate to farmers where they stand on payments due at the end of the year.</p></speech>

It was after the budget and included in the Estimates for 2017.  Given the environmental gain from the schemes and the financial benefit to individual farmers, the best thing to do was to leave in all applicants and manage the payments in order that they would all be paid.  However, not all of them will receive the full payment for 2017 in the calendar year.</p></speech>

The Minister has made apologies and excuses in the past few months for the mess which has resulted in many farmers not being paid and it is clear that preparations were not made to ensure this would not happen.  There is an expectation that if they are committing to a plan that will take up 12 months, they will be paid.  If there is confusion about this, the onus is on the Minister to give them advance warning to avoid what happened last year when farmers were expecting to receive their payment in October or before Christmas but 5,000 of them have still not received it.</p></speech>

We have changed that now and hope that it will facilitate the process.  It will also enable us to manage the Department funding.  We put up a certain amount for 2017 and we cannot be certain that it is going to be drawn down.  Certainly, if the works are done, the money is there to pay it and we will pay it as quickly as we can, once all of the checks are carried out and subject to notification that the works are complete.</p></speech>

I see that &euro;202 million has been allocated in respect of areas of natural constraint, ANC, payments.  That is expected to increase by &euro;25 million for next year.  As it is relevant to the actual scheme, can the Minister provide an update on the mapping?  I know that the structure for payment is going to be changed for 2018.  What is the position regarding mapping?  When publishing the scientific data relating to those maps, will the Minister ensure that there is consultation in advance on proposals for areas of specific constraint?</p></speech>

We are working against the set of criteria that the Commission has laid down.  As the Deputy knows, it was done previously under socioeconomic criteria.  We are now operating on what they call biophysical criteria to do with slope, gradient, drainage, soil composition, elevation, etc.  That work is under way.  We expect to have maps in early summer to midsummer.  That is what I am led to believe.  We are committed, as the Deputy knows, in the programme for Government to increase the payments for 2018 by &euro;25 million.  There will be a consultation and engagement with stakeholders, including farmers, on this matter.  Our ambition, as I have repeated, is that we would hold what we can where possible.  That is certainly something to which I would be personally committed.  I have no doubt that this is something my Department will hopefully be able to work towards as well.  The criteria are laid down for us.  We will be engaging with stakeholders as soon as we have maps to work with on those matters.</p></speech>

The categorisation within the designation is a further matter, but my overwhelming objective is to hold the designation for the country in areas that are currently designated.  We have not considered the sub-categories within that at this stage.  I think the highest payment relates to the islands.  It varies from that to a much lower payment.  At this stage, the overwhelming objective will be to retain the classification.</p></speech>

That will be done in terms of testing, etc.  The part in which there is more flexibility is the 10% specific constraint.  Any proposals the Minister might have for the specific constraint would not have to be published alongside the maps outlining the results of the biophysical criteria outcomes and assessments.  Is that something the Minister will commit to doing later on after consultation or is it something that he is intending to publish all at once alongside the biophysical maps?</p></speech>

However, there are significant areas, particularly on the Border, that would feel very hard done by in the context of previous classifications.  It cannot be <i>carte blanche</i>, namely, that one is in or one is out.  I can quote several examples of areas that would feel very unjustifiably treated.  The criteria the last time kept them out.  It was not based on soil quality last time around.  They were kept out perhaps due to population density or economic reasons, such as a large number of dairy herds in a particular townland.  Those are not the criteria this time around.  Some areas that were excluded the last time will feel that the criteria being used on this occasion will allow their inclusion.</p></speech>

It is particularly dependent on the natural constraint relating to the relevant land.  It is crucial that there is fairness brought to the system as part of this review in order that for those farming poor land, hill land and much poorer land, the categorisation and the bands ensure that there will be payments proportionate to the constraint on the land being farmed.  The biophysical considerations are coming into it, but I think the banding system and payment levels are crucial.  There must be a full reassessment and review of that.  There must be some fairness brought into the system with regard to the final outcome.</p></speech>

The actual document states that it is &euro;2 million.  We are in the territory of a 6% increase, which is not sufficient for Bord Bia's needs.  Without the potential of food tariffs being applied in 2019, a standard increase might be fair enough.  However, with the value of our exports to the UK at almost &euro;5 billion and almost &euro;4 billion in imports, a &euro;2 million increase for Bord Bia is very low.  With a &euro;2 million increase there will not be an aggressive campaign as required to bring our food products to other markets.  That &euro;2 million will not cut much mustard internationally especially when 40% or 50% of our product goes to the UK.  There is a lack of ambition there.  I do not want to waste money but the food sector will be hardest hit by Brexit.  If the Minister had proposed &euro;4 million or &euro;6 million, I do not believe the committee would have told him he was overspending, but &euro;2 million looks very small.  I think he has lowballed it.  Whoever put the figures together does not seem to realise the impact Brexit could have on the food sector.</p></speech>

We were told earlier that Bord Bia is to take on 20 additional staff.  Are they to be paid out of this additional &euro;2 million?  With the challenges the beef and horticultural sectors are facing, this kind of an increase for Bord Bia is inadequate.  I appreciate that some new markets for live exports opened up in the latter part of 2016, but we need to export far more animals than at present if we are to avoid a very serious situation.  That is only dealing with the increase in cattle numbers we have and does not address the consequence of potential reduced access to the British market which would be a very steep hill to climb.  If the &euro;2 million is to pay for the additional 20 staff, it leaves very little money for new initiatives.  Even without Brexit we need to develop new markets.  We have heard a lot about the Egypt market reopening.  We need a significant number of live cattle exports in 2017 if we are to avoid a serious situation at the end of this year.</p> <p>  I cannot understand why organic inspections are not included in the Bord Bia lamb quality-assurance inspections.  Dairy farmers are now incorporated into the beef-inspection scheme.  A dairy farmer with a beef operation will have both inspections on the one day.  I do not understand why organic farmers are not included along with the quality-assurance inspection.  It would make common sense.  Obviously for farmers who are not organic they could just delete the item from the form.  Organic farmers appeared before the committee and there were questions over whom they represented.  Leaving that aside, we have an organic section in farming production.  Bringing it under the auspices of the quality assurance would streamline it.  I do not understand why organic inspections are not included in quality-assurance inspections.</p></speech>

It is not true to say it is &euro;1.6 million as Deputy D'Arcy said.  After 24 June 2016 we put &euro;1.6 million extra into Bord Bia for the remainder of 2016.  On top of that figure we have put an additional &euro;2 million into it for 2017.  When the original 2016 figure is compared with the 2017 figure, there is an increase of &euro;3.6 million.</p> <p>  We must also bear in mind that funding available for Bord Bia for 2017 from the European Union will be &euro;1.9 million, which is double what it was in 2016.  With that &euro;900,000 there is about &euro;4.5 million extra.  I anticipate that includes the additional staff that have been approved.  Feet on the street in new markets is the only way that we will meet the challenges we face.  In the relatively short period of time that I have been in this role, I have come to recognise that Bord Bia does an exceptional job.  I met Bord Bia staff only last week in Germany but previously across north Africa, the Middle East and South East Asia.</p> <p>  We could throw endless resources at this thing.  Through the embassy network now having responsibility for trade, the Bord Bia office now often operates out of the same campus where those offices are located, we get a much more significant punch than we would if they were stand-alone.  Most recently we have opened offices in Singapore and Warsaw.  Bord Bia is putting in considerable effort into its endeavours in the United Kingdom.  We are certainly not walking away from that market.</p> <p>  I have made a public commitment that in respect of the roll-out of the challenge and the scale of it, we can revisit this.  It will be one of the most important things we will be doing in coming years.  When we consider the &euro;1.6 million, &euro;2 million and &euro;900,000 cumulatively, it has significantly increased.  We have an open mind about it.</p></speech>

Prior to the November speech by the British Prime Minister, Mrs. May, nobody expected the UK to leave the customs Union and the Single Market.  That was certainly unexpected.  I have been making the point for some time - it was based on bitter experience following the banking inquiry - that nobody did the analysis for the worst-case scenario.  The beef sector is likely to be the worst-case scenario because of World Trade Organization tariffs on quantities of beef.  I have made the point on numerous occasions - not to the Minister or his officials - but to the IFA at the launch of its Brexit report and to the Secretary General of the Department of Finance.  There has been no analysis of the worst case scenario of a trade war, which now cannot be written out of the conversation.  It was not even in the conversation five or six months ago and no analysis has been done.</p><p>Bord Bia is talking about spending an extra &euro;4 million or &euro;5 million on the beef sector, which is worth &euro;4.5 billion.  The potential exists for a catastrophe in the beef sector in two years time.  I do not think a longitudinal worst-case scenario analysis is being done by anybody.  Nobody wants to go there.  Nobody wants to get into a trade war, but that possibility cannot be discounted.</p></speech>

The Department is putting a great deal of effort into working with Bord Bia to seek new markets, for example in the live export area.  The number of cattle now leaving the country as live exports is greater than ever before.</p></speech>

The UK cannot feed itself.  Ireland is the closest market to the UK.  We have modelled every possible scenario in the context of Brexit.  We send more than 50% of our beef exports, or 253,000 tonnes, to the UK.  The WTO can impose tariffs of 50% on beef.  I suspect that the events of recent days have damaged that possibility.  If the UK decides in a post-Brexit scenario that it wishes to import beef from Mercosur countries, that might significantly displace much of our beef.  If there is a level playing pitch in areas like animal welfare standards, veterinary certification and veterinary standards, we can compete with most countries.  However, we cannot compete with beef from South America if the systems of production and the animal welfare standards are different.</p></speech>

Bord Bia is deeply engaged with purchasers of Irish beef in the UK market.  I have met the chief executives of Tesco and Sainsbury's and I have travelled to the UK to meet the Secretary of State, Andrea Leadsom.  When I expressed to Ms Leadsom our concern about how we would be adversely affected if the UK were to conduct its own trade deals after Brexit, she instinctively made the point that UK farmers and consumers have raised the same issues with her.  In the negotiated outcome, we would like the UK to be somewhat constrained in its capacity to do trade deals with third countries in the agrifood sector.  At the very least, it needs to be ensured in any such deals that producers from third countries are held to the same standards and certification obligations as EU producers.  We believe we could face any competition in such circumstances.  All of these things are the subject of negotiation.  Part of our strategy involves engaging in the UK to cement our relationships with purchasers there and to try to navigate this difficult situation.  For historical, geographical and cultural reasons, it is entirely logical that the UK market is our most important market.  No other market pays a higher premium for beef.  It would be a foolish strategy to walk away from it.  Part of our strategy involves resourcing Bord Bia to look for other markets for live exports and processed beef exports.  It would be critical in the context of a trade war like that alluded to by the Deputy for us to have other export opportunities.</p></speech>

Can he make the worst-case scenario data from the Department, Bord Bia and other relevant parties available?  In the event of a trade war, our products would be prevented from going in at all.  That is the worst-case scenario.  I have not seen any research on that.  To my knowledge, nobody has done such research.  If it has been done, I would like it to be made available because of the potential catastrophe if it is handled badly.  To date, the UK and the EU have handled all aspects of the Brexit issue badly.</p></speech>

Earlier in this meeting, the Minister and I contested a point regarding the targets and the Government commitments for the beef data and genomics programme.  When the Minister, Deputy Coveney, issued a press statement announcing the establishment of the programme in May 2015, he committed to provide &euro;300 million to assist approximately 35,000 beef farmers.  When I mentioned that figure earlier, the Minister said it was "well wide of the mark" and alluded to "myths being perpetuated".</p></speech>

The feedback from industry representatives and Bord Bia officials who attended a meeting of this committee was that additional resources are needed because the current level of resources is insufficient.  I agree with the Minister that the quality people who work in this area carry out their role well within the resources they have.  As the Minister indicated, this is a crucial issue in the context of meeting the challenge of Brexit and trying to maintain existing markets and open new ones.  The feedback suggests there is a widespread feeling that the current allocation of 20 - it was 16 last year, with four more to be hired - is simply insufficient to meet the challenging tasks that exist, particularly the challenge of trying to diversify while opening new markets and reopening markets which would have been available to us in the past.  I accept the Minister's point that we do not have limitless funds and we need to make the most of what we have.  I put it to him that there is a unanimous feeling that additional funding is needed in this area.  Will the Minister give us a breakdown of the operations of the 20 people who have been hired or are being hired to carry out this important role?  What divisions are they going to?  I know Bord Bia is responsible for how it deploys its staff, but it is important to get a handle on where they are going.  When I heard that an additional &euro;2 million was being provided this year, my understanding was that approximately half of that money would be allocated to the beef side of things in Bord Bia.  I suggest that would be a very small figure, particularly in the context of big challenges like trying to develop new beef markets.</p> <p>  I would also like to ask the Minister about the market access personnel in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I know it was previously proposed that a specific market access unit with dedicated staff should be developed in the Department.  I know some staff across a couple of sections of the Department spend a lot of time on market access issues.  Can the Minister comment on the proposal I have mentioned?  Is he open to it?  Does he think it would enhance the current structures in the Department?  I would also like to ask about the Brexit unit that has been established by the Minister.  I understand from the Minister's replies to parliamentary questions that there are three members of staff in the unit at the moment.  I understand the point made by the Minister when we debated this matter in the D&aacute;il last week that this matter is occupying the minds of staff across all sections of the Department.</p><p>On the Brexit unit, which has been established with three people, will the Minister elaborate on the role of the unit and the reason that only three people have been assigned to it?  It seems a very low number, given the enormity of the task of co-ordinating and researching the impact of Brexit on the various components of the agricultural sector.   </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-21a.242" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2017032100002#O00200"><p>In response to the Deputy's question on Bord Bia, if one takes the EU funds of &euro;1.6 million and the &euro;2 million extra, the cumulative figure is &euro;4.5 million above the 2016 provisional figures.  It is significant.  I have no doubt that if we had more money Bord Bia could spend it.  However, in terms of a start on the challenge we face, that is good.  The staff of Bord Bia do a tremendous job.</p> <p>  I engage with the industry in all its manifestations, both inside and outside the farm gate, farm organisations and the representative bodies of the processing sector.  I have not had any single one of them say what the Deputy has said about Bord Bia.  The interesting thing, as I have said to Deputy McConalogue before, I have done sectoral dialogues on Brexit with the dairy, beef, sheep, pork, poultry, grain, forestry, prepared consumer foods, fishery sectors and continue to dialogue with all of them.  I have been on trade missions with them and I have not heard what the Deputy has said.</p> <p>  I have made the point that Brexit is an enormous challenge.  As for hanging one's coat on the issue that the Brexit team comprises three people, I repeat there are 3,000 staff in my Department and every one of them is a critical player in the context of Brexit.  Anybody who goes to an international meeting, anybody who is involved in the agencies such as Bord Bia or BIM is a player in terms of Brexit.  When we go to market - and part of the strategy is to diversify, part is to secure the foothold we have in existing markets - anybody who is involved in quality assurance inspection or in ensuring that the produce we take to market, be they farmers or Department officials, is critical to the Brexit effort.  To make the flippant point that the Brexit unit is just three people is to miss the point about the scale of the challenge and the scale of the Department's response.  The response of the departmental officials at all levels has been phenomenal.  Their commitment has been exemplary.</p> <p>  The high-level Brexit unit is involved strategically in liaising with the Department of the Taoiseach, in engaging with Michel Barnier and his team and is involved in bilateral meetings in which I am involved with various ministerial colleagues across the European Union.  It is a complex response of which they are at the helm in terms of strategising, looking at the implications and scoping out the scale of the problem at a high technical level.  </p> <p>  The market access unit, although technically not the Brexit unit, plays a critical part.  It is headed by an assistant secretary and is an equally important part of our strategy.  The market access unit engages with countries all over the world.  We trade with 180 different countries and are knocking on other doors to get into new markets for various different products.  That unit engages with our ambassadorial diplomatic team, at a technical, veterinarian and peer-to-peer level in respect of ministries in other countries.  A phenomenal amount of work goes on in the market access unit.</p> <p>  These are challenging times and there is a provision in the budget for the Department to take on 200 additional staff across the Department.  They will be deployed into strategic areas that will be identified as needing additional resources.  I have no doubt that the skill set required in those areas to meet these challenges will be looked at.  That is always something that is under review.  It is important to point out that regardless of whether one is a Department inspector in a meat plant or a person involved in on-farm quality assurance inspections or operating in the Brexit unit or in the market access unit or anywhere in between, because the agriculture industry exports 90% of what it produces, everybody in this Department is focused on making sure that we can stand over that product.  Fortunately we can.  We have a great reputation and that is due to all those people, Bord Bia, Origin Green and the phenomenal effort that they put into it.  We are never resting on our laurels.  We are never saying we have it cracked; it is constantly under review.  It is particularly under review in the context of the Brexit challenge.  It has got additional resources but it is the overarching issue that informs every single thing that the Department does at this stage.  I think it is through the collaborative approach, that is, the close collaboration between the agencies I have mentioned, the Department, the farm organisations, the individual farmers and the industry in all its manifestations that we will be able to meet this challenge.  In my view, this challenge is unprecedented.  I have gone on the record of saying there is no upside in this for the agrifood sector.  We may poach a financial or an EU institution but one will not make a broker out of a beef farmer if the industry goes down.  We in the Department are fighting might and main to protect the interests of the industry, to protect the markets we have in the UK, to negotiate the best possible outcome but equally are not anticipating anything in terms of those outcomes and therefore are looking at additional markets as well.  It is a whole-of-Department and a whole-of-Government approach.  It is not three people, it is not 20 additional staff in Bord Bia, it is all of that and a great deal more.</p></speech>

The numbers will be slightly less than that but they are approaching more manageable proportions now.  </p> <p>  The Deputy knows that in 2015 in respect of the national reserve, there was a specific concession made to persons who were applying for these scheme.  Previously one had to have the educational course completed in 2015 but the concession the Department gave, about which the European Commission was not particularly pleased, was that once a person had enrolled and had one module completed in 2015, he or she was eligible - provided he or she followed through and completed the educational qualification - to apply for the young farmer and the national reserve entitlement.</p> <p>  There had not been a scheme like that for several years before that.  We are now having a separate scheme in 2017 but a lot of the heat was taken out by the 2015 process.  The numbers are falling back and are a bit more manageable now.</p></speech>

More than 500 farmers from Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim are waiting to do the part-time green cert course.  There might be some duplication on that waiting list because some of them may have also applied for some of the full-time agricultural colleges.  That is a massive number.  The part-time green cert course takes two and a half years from commencement to completion at one day per week.</p> <p>  I understand that by the autumn there may be five or six new classes across the Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim area for part-time green cert courses.  At an average of 30 per class that could potentially provide places for up to 180 of those.  That is not confirmed yet and it is dependent on a number of staff being allocated to the north-west region from what I think is 20 people that Teagasc is hiring later this year in the training section.  If the north west gets six of those it might be able to run up to six courses.  That might cater for 180 people, but the waiting list is over 500.  That is a massive demand of by and large young farmers awaiting those courses.  Once they get on a course it takes two and a half years to completion.  The Minister should look to provide additional funding to Teagasc for training.  It is particularly important to provide additional staff in the north west this summer and autumn so that it can address the waiting list.</p> <p>  On Brexit, I take the Minister&rsquo;s point on the importance of all staff.  Given the enormity of the issue, I question whether it is sufficient for that unit to have only three people; the Minister believes it is.  However, given what the high-level Brexit unit is being asked to do, having three people sounds like an understaffed unit.  I am not saying that is the be-all and end-all, but I do not believe the numbers in that unit are sufficient to deal with the task being asked of them.</p> <p>  I met some representatives of the processing industry this morning who stated that Bord Bia is understaffed and needs a significant increase on what has already been provided to it.  I will ask them why they do not put these points to you if they put them to me.  That was the feedback as recently as this morning.</p> <p>  Earlier Deputy Martin Kenny touched on opening new markets, including Brazil.  Where does the Minister stand on his engagement with the European Commission?</p></speech>

We are awaiting a response.</p> <p>  I do not have the regional breakdown on Teagasc.  However, I know that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has recently given approval to Teagasc for 15 new temporary posts to deal with the educational backlog.  I do not know how they will be deployed on a regional basis.  In a way it is a reflection that the industry is attracting new blood and young people, which is welcome.  As the Deputy knows, Teagasc is undergoing a review of its green cert and educational offering to farmers, which is appropriate.  We need to keep the matter under review.  The approval of additional 15 temporary posts will enable Teagasc within its budget to deal with how it allocates resources.</p> <p>  In acknowledging the role my Department&rsquo;s Brexit unit plays, I repeat the point that every one of the 3,000 employees in the Department is critical to the Brexit effort because of our export focus.  The Brexit unit, the market-access unit, anybody who is involved in quality assurance and every individual farmer, who is committed to production to the highest standards and meeting the regulatory requirements under which they operate, are all critical to our Brexit effort.  We will keep the resources under review.</p> <p>  Regarding Bord Bia, I believe feet on the street is the most effective response.  It is currently recruiting additional staff.  It has had a significant increase in resources over its 2016 allocation.  We will keep the matter under observation.</p></speech>

Are resources being allocated to help to address that?  I ask the Minister to comment on the Department&rsquo;s preparations for that challenge.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-21a.258" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2017032100002#P01200"><p>The challenge on the fisheries side is particularly acute because we compete for the resource across the European Union.  Much of the competition for the fishing resource is in UK territorial waters.  In the event of a hard Brexit and we are locked out of UK territorial waters, displacement of fishing effort into the remaining EU waters, particularly off our west coast, would be intense and yet quotas would not rise.  So displacement and quota share are critical issues.</p> <p>  We catch about 40% by volume in UK territorial waters and approximately the same in value terms.  In a worst case scenario, it would be a disaster for the Irish fishing industry.  In the negotiations we are attempting strategically to link the fisheries sector into the wider trade negotiations.  If these negotiations are conducted on a silo basis where fisheries are dealt with in a stand-alone basis, the UK would have a very strong hand.  However, it requires market access to the European Union for 70% of its produce.  That is not as strong a card for us to play as one might think.</p><p> In the context of the worst-case scenario to which Deputy D'Arcy alluded previously, WTO tariffs on fisheries are at such a low level that it would not have a material impact if the UK were to have access to the EU market subject to those tariffs.  We are trying to create a common platform on the fisheries issue and I have engaged in numerous bilateral meetings to that end with counterparts from like-minded member states.  At the December Council, we will fight to the nth degree for a single fishery for the Irish fishing industry but, at the same time, there are Brexit-related fisheries issues in respect of which Ireland and the remaining member states have a common interest.  I am trying to forge an alliance of like-minded member states to take a common position with the Barnier negotiating team to protect our interests.  As I said, it is 40% by volume but if one takes some of the most valuable fisheries like scallops and pelagics, we are talking about 45% and almost 60%, respectively, in value terms.  They are the two biggest ones for Ireland so it would be a huge loss in terms of what we catch in UK waters in the worst-case scenario.  We are strategically involved in negotiations at a political and technical level with other member states.</p></speech>

I know that it is not directly related to the figures but I ask the Minister to update us on the status of that review.  I would also make the point, in terms of the concept, that Killybegs vessels in particular have built up a mackerel quota over many years and the review has the potential to take that from them and reallocate it.  Given the fact that the people who own those vessels worked hard to develop that quota and that it is particularly important to the Donegal economy, I do not believe the approach is fair.  I ask the Minister to provide an update on the review.  I urge him to draw a line under the matter and to leave matters as they stand in terms of the quota allocation that is in place.</p></speech>

The EU, until it signs off on the various schemes, retains 5%.  In closing out the 2007 to 2013 scheme, the refund was expected in 2017 but it came during the last days of 2016.  To take the example of a scheme like REPS, we would have paid out the funding under that scheme.  The EU would have withheld 5% and once the EU had gone through its processes, it would have refunded us for funding what we had paid out already to individual applicants.  That is the same across all of the various schemes so the figure is cumulative.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-21a.344" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Moira Leydon" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017032100002#D00200"><p>I am very conscious that it is rather late in the day.  We started late and have a full house.  I will, therefore, use the Obama technique, that is, say three things and try to say them efficiently and effectively.  </p> <p>  My broad opening remark is that the ASTI broadly welcomes the legislation.  We have a preference for one approach, on which I will elaborate.  The measures are reflective of the changes in our society and a timely and judicious response to aspects of the education system that are not perceived to be working as well as they might be.</p> <p>  In the past decade we have introduced what I would describe as a strong accountability framework in education.  Each year the inspectorate conducts over 1,000 visits to schools at both primary and second level.  Eight hundred reports are published on our website every year.  We have the Teaching Council fitness-to-practise guidelines, etc.  This is really just another part of the jigsaw in making sure there is not only equality in the education system but also, more importantly, accountability, transparency and fairness.  That is very much the frame within which the draft legislation has been developed and within which we perceive it.</p> <p>  With regard to the proposals made in the charter legislation, they address what the trade unions have stated explicitly during the years.  We need a national standardised and common complaints procedure across the system.  At present, there are voluntary agreements between the management bodies and the teacher unions that differ from sector to sector.  Certainly, the commitment in the charter to bring forward statutory national guidelines will remove many anomalies and certainly make my life and that of my trade union official colleagues easier because we are dealing with a transparent system.  It is also reflective of what are perceived, unfortunately, to be weaknesses in the system. </p> <p>  Deputy Jim Daly has to be commended for the way in which he kick-started this process.  We do not actually agree that his legislation is possibly the best way to proceed, but I believe he has done us all a very valuable service by kick-starting the debate.  The reason we would prefer the charter legislation is that we believe it is more comprehensive.  On the one hand, it is about dealing with complaints, but, more significantly, from the perspective of legislators, it is trying to change cultures in order that complaints would not emerge in the first place.  It is trying to embed better communication, accountability and transparency cultures in schools.  That is really what legislation should do; it should not micromanage problems; rather, when one is dealing with wide public sector social goods such as education, it should seek to direct cultural change.</p> <p>  The second point we make to Deputy Jim Daly is that the proposal made in his legislation to have a separate ombudsman for children would, in the first instance, not be so practical.  More importantly, it would undermine what this society has struggled to achieve in the past 20 years, but we are getting there pretty well.  I refer to an holistic focus on the child.  The bit of the child that goes to school is the same bit that may need to go to a social worker, the HSE or other body.  The current model of the Ombudsman for Children is the most appropriate, particularly in the light of national strategy in Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, which is a very integrated public policy approach to children.</p> <p>  I have just two more points to make.  To quote an aphorism always attributed to Einstein, it is the essence of lunacy to keep doing the same thing and expecting something different.  I am very much putting on my trade union hat.  This cultural change that the legislation is aimed at achieving cannot and will not succeed unless we seriously consider the way in which schools are run and facilitated to run with resources and middle management.  My trade union colleagues will have strong points to make on that issue.  If the legislation is expected to succeed in spirit, we cannot keep doing the same old thing, namely, bring in another model of change, while not actually supporting the internal processes to deliver that change.</p> <p>  Trade unions are extremely concerned to ensure the legislation will get the balance of fairness right.</p></speech>

The Teaching Council fitness-to-practise arrangement is being bedded in.  Garda vetting is ongoing and not yet fully implemented, yet we are here talking about moving forward with some more legislation in a manner that does not always take into account the perspective of a teacher.  Implementation of section 28 of the Education Act was delayed repeatedly.  Perhaps that is why we have reached this impasse where we believe we have to go down a legislative road.</p> <p>  Teachers are suspicious.  As my colleague said, there is an inspectorate.  There are eight separate modes of inspection, which are a form of oversight.  The Teaching Council is another layer of oversight.  Some might justifiably say it is overkill.  I am concerned about the capacity within the system to implement the legislation correctly and properly and allow schools to get on with developing the very much needed parent and student charter.  It must, however, come about with the requisite resources.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, Deputy Jim Daly's Bill would lead to more confrontation.  The experience of confrontation and the adversarial process in Ireland is that the only people to benefit are those in the legal profession.  That is why we would prefer the parent and student charter.  These are days pon which policymakers have to take into account the practitioners.  Sometimes what leaves Marlborough Street as gold turns to iron pyrite in the hands of others.  We should be careful as we move forward.</p></speech>

The TUI is of the view that the two proposed pieces of legislation are contradictory and mutually exclusive.  We contend that the Education (Amendment) Bill 2015 is mistaken, if well-intentioned, in approach, that the establishment of an ombudsman for education is unnecessary and would duplicate existing offices, and that any legislative change that may be required can be adequately accommodated in the proposed Education (Parent and Student Charter) Bill 2016, suitably revised.</p> <p>  The TUI supports the achievement in practice of the principle of appropriate involvement by students and parents in determining the culture and processes of a school.  Our members - teachers, including principal teachers - have a professional commitment to the creation and maintenance of welcoming, inclusive and democratic school communities that are an integral and dynamic part of the social infrastructure of the broader communities they serve.  In this context, making legislative provision for a charter is worthy of consideration.  Such a charter, however, would have to reflect a balance of the rights and responsibilities of all parties.  Moreover, a charter that imposed additional administrative and/or legalistic responsibilities on schools that lack the capacity to discharge them would be counterproductive.  A number of our specific observations have their origins in this concern about unsustainable demands.</p> <p>  The TUI is at something of a disadvantage as the heads of the Education (Parent and Student Charter) Bill 2016, while proposing an expanded role for the Ombudsman for Children, do not provide the level of detail that would enable us to assess it definitively this stage.  Schools are poorly resourced in the context of administrative and middle management structures.  Boards of management rely on volunteers and there can be no realistic expectation that this will not continue to be the case.  We would advise against additional legislative requirements that would increase the burden on boards.</p> <p>  We ask the committee to note that, under the current section 28 of the Education Act 1998, it is open to the Minister to prescribe procedures to allow grievances of &ldquo;students, or their parents, relating to the students&rsquo; school&rdquo; to be submitted and processed and to allow the &ldquo;parent of a student or, in the case of a student who has reached the age of 18 years, the student, to appeal to the board against a decision of a teacher or other member of staff of a school&rdquo;.  The TUI has for several years urged successive Ministers for Education and Skills to prescribe procedures under this section of the Act, noting that procedures are available for him to prescribe.  Were the Minister to confirm these procedures as the prescribed procedures under section 28, the sensible and logical aspiration of &ldquo;determining appeals and resolving grievances in the school concerned&rdquo; could be realised without imposing further bureaucratic demands on already overburdened schools.  The TUI would again ask the Minister to engage the relevant parties, including representatives of parents and students, in discussions aimed at suitably adjusting the existing sectoral procedures and to approve the procedures that emerge from those discussions.</p> <p>  The Education (Parent and Student Charter) Bill seems to envisage each school developing its own procedures, following the guidelines that the Minister will issue in this regard.  This would be enormously wasteful of very scarce resources.  Some 4,000 separate attempts to reinvent the wheel in 4,000 schools are unnecessary and will lead to inconsistency, contradiction and unfairness.  Litigation will almost certainly follow.  Our message is simple: there is no need to reinvent the wheel.  A further concern is that the general scheme seems strangely oblivious of the existence of robust processes to deal with complaints in regard to the conduct or competence of teachers.  Those procedures have legislative underpinning under section 24 of the Education Act 1998 and Part 5 of the Teaching Council Act 2001.</p> <p>  It is imperative that any legislative change or initiative must not create further administrative workload, particularly for principal teachers.  The effective functioning of schools as communities of learning is already being suffocated by burgeoning administrative demands.  The proposed legislation has the potential to add new and unnecessary layers of complexity and to give rise to a more legalistic culture that will inevitably lead to increased cost for schools and the Exchequer.</p> <p>  A recurrent feature of legislation in the education sphere is the emergence of unintended consequences when it comes to implementation.  Legislation that seeks equity is often frustrated in its implementation by rooted societal inequalities and by the exclusionary practices of some schools.  Hence, schools that are selective regarding enrolment are least affected by equity-based legislation and those that are most inclusive are most affected.  The greatest onus is placed on schools that are open, democratic, inclusive and most responsive to national policy.  The TUI has a real concern that, once again, the greatest challenge will be faced by the schools that embrace the full, rich diversity in the student cohort and that they will have to face the challenge without the necessary resources.  Furthermore, the introduction of a new and expanded governance requirement under the charter means that significant additional funding will be required to provide training to school staff and boards of management.</p> <p>  The proposed legislation seems, on the face of it, to propose a culture of culpability, predicated on the misconception that schools are responsible for all of society&rsquo;s failings and that schools can somehow remediate family dysfunctionality where it occurs.  This is unfair to schools that are struggling to manage after a decade of cutbacks which have left the system threadbare.  There is a fine balance that must be struck between, on one hand, the appropriate remit of a school in terms of supporting and empowering an individual student or parent and, on the other, the overarching requirement that a school provide a safe environment for the greater student body.  It is regrettable but undeniable, for example, that some schools have to manage and deal with unacceptable and occasionally violent behaviour.  This must be taken into account in a charter, which must balance the rights of students and parents with concomitant responsibilities.</p> <p>  The proposed legislation also seems to assume that a large volume of complaints and grievances are not being adequately addressed at present.  The TUI disputes this assumption.  The Ombudsman for Children reports that there have been 4,000 complaints about schools to his office in the past 14 years.  That constitutes fewer than 300 complaints per year in the context of 4,000 schools, serving 917,000 students, and, viewed objectively, constitutes a very low rate of complaint.</p> <p>  That is our initial opening statement.  We will obviously have further views when we see the terms of the legislation.</p></speech>

I am president of the Irish Second-Level Students Union.  We are the umbrella body for second-level student councils in Ireland and we aim to represent and connect second-level students, ensuring that the voice of the Irish student is heard and striving for equality and democracy within the education system.  As a national student representative, I am delighted to present to the committee and to discuss and consider an item of legislation which serves, as the name implies, to define the rights and privileges of students as well as parents.</p> <p>  The principles of the legislation for the parent and student charter bring to the forefront the principles and priorities that the organisation for which I work and the students I represent have always exemplified.  We were delighted, therefore, to watch the progress and advancement being made to further the involvement of and respect for two essential stakeholder groups in the school community.  It is true, though, that students are affected more than any other cohort by the management of a school.  Students are the main beneficiaries of the second-level education system and it is paramount that their voice is heard in order to ensure that any decisions made are in the best interests of the student.  The only way to ensure that the decisions made are of benefit to students is to ensure that students maintain meaningful participation and consultation in any development or evaluation of such decisions.  The only way you will know what it is like to be a second-level student in Ireland is if you are a second-level student in Ireland.  Things change so quickly and the experiences of young people in terms of their education are vastly different with every couple of years.  It is important to stay cognisant of this fact as we move forward to create a better education system in Ireland.</p> <p>  I believe in the ability of this Bill to change the way schools serve their students.  The end product of the Bill will help to establish a structure where students are recognised and, most importantly, supported as equal partners in education.  However, we have massive reservations and concerns regarding the proposed plans to develop guidelines for this Bill.  As it stands, the Minister will invite the partners - the national parent councils, school management bodies, teacher unions and the school principals networks or associations - to participate in a working party.  To quote the</p> <p>explanatory documents, &ldquo;Part of the preparatory work will involve capturing the voice of the child particularly through engagement with student councils and national associations representative of students.&rdquo;  This effectively excludes students, even though the aim is to recognise them as equal partners in education, by letting us only be part of the preparations but not an equal stakeholder on the working party.  We would like to be recognised as equal partners and have the opportunity to work with other partners in education in order to examine and influence how the details of this charter will look when finished.</p> <p>  Applying this integral principle to the entirety of the process of this legislation, it makes sense that, under head 3, the associations representing second-level students should be included in the group of educational stakeholders, rather being consulted on the sidelines.  We welcome the amendment to section 27 of the Education Act 1998 to change the requirement on a student council from one of promoting the interests of the school to the promoting of the interests of the students of the school.  The interests of the students will be better served if the student council is supported to promote the interests of students as we believe the student council is best placed to do so.</p><p>There are often conversations regarding representation of student councils.  We are fully aware that the most vulnerable, the student most in need, will not often put themselves forward for election to a student council but a student council is still the most important element in ensuring that the voice of those students are heard.  <br/><br/>Last week we were in Cork to consult with second-level students as we plan to create our own mental health strategy.  Students at this event, my peers, stated they are more likely to turn to a friend or a fellow student for help than they are to a teacher or parent.  These were young boys from all-boys schools in the surrounding area and while they would be hesitant to talk to anybody in regard to mental health, they said it would be peers to whom they would turn.  <br/><br/>Having a structure of peer support, where students can support one another in ensuring their voices are heard and issues that are affecting them are raised, is absolutely integral to ensuring the needs of our most vulnerable students are brought forward.  This is even more crucial in schools in disadvantaged areas where it may be more difficult to involve parents.<br/><br/>The training offered by the Irish Second-Level Students Union, ISSU, aims to improve student councils in their ability to carry out their functions.  We aim to train as many students as possible to engage but we are also bound by our limited funding.<br/><br/>As we review the amendment to section 27 of the Act, we are faced with another basic operational change, which would transform student voice.  Unfortunately, in too many Irish second-level schools, student councils are subject to the approval of the board of management, which are currently given the liberty of dissolving the student council in the Education Act.  A few days ago I received the e-mail below from a student describing his experience with student voice:</p><blockquote><font color="#2F2F2F">I am in transition year and I am writing on the behalf of the </font>students at my school as we do not have a student council.  <br /><br /><font color="#2F2F2F"> </font>Early last year our student council was disbanded quite suddenly.  As you can imagine this shocked and annoyed a lot of students as we felt we were not represented fairly.  This year our transition year co-ordinator put the challenge to us to restart the student council, so we wrote a letter to our principal.  Myself and several other transition year students then met with our principal to talk about the issue.  She told us that the student council, as well as the green school committee and other committees, had been disbanded because of the current teachers&rsquo; union conflict.  I am, however, not satisfied with this answer as I have spoken with students and teachers from other schools and they all have student councils.  She did however suggest that we could have an unofficial &quot;student's voice&quot;, but this has not really worked out.  I was wondering if we have any rights as students to be represented by a student council and if there is anything the ISSU can do to help us.</blockquote><p>If students really do have the right to be included in decisions which affect them, as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child declares, then students should be fully entitled to have a student council, regardless of any issues with other stakeholders in education.  If student councils are an option which are at the discretion of the people who happen to sit on a board of management, this right cannot be fully realised.<br/><br/>To further this important aspect of school management, we very much welcome the ability of the Minister to issue directives to boards of management as part of head 4.  However we believe, as was mentioned the last time this committee sat, that there are fundamental difficulties with regards to the composition of the board of management.  The management of a school should be a process where students, teachers, parents and patrons work together to continually examine and solve the issues and problems facing any one school.  Students should be aware of the issues being discussed and have an equal vote to the rest of the stakeholders.  Currently, there are a bare few second-level schools where a platform for this kind of partnership is encouraged or supported.  From a democratic perspective, this badly needs to be addressed.  We support the principle of participation of children in decision making but to fully implement this principle, students need to, first, be included in a real and tangible way, by sitting at the table where the decisions are made.  It has always been one of our core beliefs that a student representative should sit on the board of management and we will continue to advocate for this opportunity until it is practice within every second level school in Ireland.</p></speech>

We also have reservations regarding the costs.</p> <p>  This charter allows for a real opportunity but our message today is very clear.

Our Constitution enshrines the rights of parents as the primary educators.  We are happy to see this move.<br/><br/>The National Parents Council, post-primary is grateful to the joint committee for the opportunity to contribute to the pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of an education (parent and student charter) Bill 2016.The Constitution enshrines a parent&rsquo;s right to educate his or her child.  It states that parents are the primary educators of their children.  Research shows that parental involvement in schools leads to better educational outcomes for children.  We believe the proposed Bill will create a more inclusive, open and transparent educational system.  Parents want the best educational system that enriches each student's life and produces an individual confident that he or she has been well served and prepared for life as a young adult in his or her community.  Thus every student attains an education that realises his or her full potential and can contribute positively to society in his or her adult life.<br/><br/>We appreciate and support the positivity of the proposals in the parent and student charter, as it places students in the centre of school life and respects and values the role of parents in education.  Under the parent and student charter, schools will develop a listening culture and will actively seek input from parents on school policies and plans.  Hopefully this will include areas like subject choice, communications, feedback etc.  Schools should be open about their performance and transparent around school costs.  School costs cannot be a barrier to participation in the free education system.  Consultation with parents on the cost of delivering academic and extra-curricular activities and other services, as well as the cost of books, school uniforms and so on is very important and is required.  <br/><br/>Many parents feel excluded from having input into the educational system at secondary level.  The number of complaints was referred to earlier.  We want to be consulted on all aspects of our children&rsquo;s education and development and wish to work jointly with schools management, staff and students on improving communication.  The majority of queries we receive from parents relate to guidelines around grievance procedures in post-primary schools.  Parents are unsure about how to address problems and issues and are unaware of their right to appeal decisions.  A great number of parents who have engaged with us on this matter have described themselves as feeling alone and intimidated by the process.  Parents are often afraid to raise an issue with their school fearing possible reprisal.  We hope that more parental consultation and involvement will ameliorate such problems.  However, if problems do arise, there needs to be a clear process to enable parents and schools to resolve issues locally together rather than having to resort to official procedures.  Should a complaint escalate however, and be brought to the attention of the ombudsman, the ombudsman&rsquo;s office must be properly resourced in order to deal with the issue.  <br/><br/>The ability for us to communicate effectively with all parents at a school is also a matter of serious concern and we feel strongly that every school must facilitate an independent communication conduit between the parents association and the parent body at that school.<br/><br/>The National Parents Council, post-primary, welcomes the opportunity to be involved in the consultation along with students, school management bodies and staff and other representatives in order that we can facilitate proper conversation and detailed consultation.  Since the announcement of the Bill in December 2016, we have commenced a consultation process with parents through our constituent bodies.  This Thursday we will publish a national survey for parents of post-primary students on our website .  On 8 April we will host a free information event in St. Tiernan&rsquo;s community school in Dublin, which again will provide parents with an opportunity to have their voices heard. <br/><br/>We look forward to sharing the results of the feedback with the Department of Education and Skills and with the joint committee.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-21a.356" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Boyle" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017032100002#G00100"><p>As vice president of the INTO and on behalf of our members and our union I thank the Joint Committee on Education and Skills for the invitation to express our views on the two proposed Bills.<br/><br/>At the outset, we note that the two Bills are somewhat contradictory.  The Education (Amendment) Bill 2015 is providing for an ombudsman for education and an appeal mechanism against decisions of boards of management in respect of grievances against schools, while the proposed parent and student charter is proposing various amendments to the legislation governing the Ombudsman for Children to enhance the role of that office in dealing with school matters.  The INTO is not in favour of two offices of ombudsmen having responsibility for similar functions with regard to the operation of schools.  This is unnecessary and would prove cumbersome, costly and confusing.  The focus should be on supporting and resourcing schools in the carrying out of their functions as opposed to requiring accountability for the very same matters in a range of fora.<br/><br/>Systems of accountability should be clear, effective, streamlined and not duplicated across different fora.  Accountability requirements must also have particular regard to the statutory role of boards of management and the provisions of the Education Act 1998.  That Act prescribes that it is the statutory duty of boards of management to manage their schools.  In respect of that statutory responsibility, boards are already accountable to their patrons and the Minister.  These provisions are re-affirmed in the governance manual for primary schools and in Department Circular 52/2015.  Accordingly, the INTO would have significant reservations about section 66 of the Education (Amendment) Bill which is proposing a right of appeal to an ombudsman for education &quot;against a decision of the board in respect of an appeal or grievance made to the board&quot;.  The INTO notes that the Bill is silent on the detail of how such appeals would be conducted.  In terms of fair procedures, any <i>de novo</i>appeal would inevitably require a full re-run of the hearing.  That would be a just and fair process.  The INTO reiterates that it has serious reservations about any such approach which could unnecessarily prolong matters for the parties involved and run counter to the principle of finality in decision-making and the statutory functions of boards of management.  However, the INTO draws a distinction between a full <i>de novo</i>appeal and a review on procedural grounds.  Similar clarification is required in relation to the proposed expansion of the role of the Ombudsman for Children.<br/><br/>In regard to the proposed general scheme of the Education (Parent and Student Charter) Bill 2016, there does not appear to be any so-called ground up demand for this, and many schools will see the proposals as seeking to address no known problem.  Nevertheless, the INTO is not opposed to formalising the terms of relations as currently exist at school level.  In this regard, we strongly urge the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, and the committee to note the evidence of the high levels of trust which are placed in Irish schools and educators, as evidenced<i>inter alia</i>in the chief inspector&rsquo;s reports, the OECD&rsquo;s Education at a Glance report and surveys commissioned by the Teaching Council.  The INTO submits that the culture and tradition of trust must not be damaged by over-formalising and specification of rights, processes or both.<br/><br/>The culture of the Irish primary school system is one of open engagement with parents or guardians and the school community.  In this context, it has always been the case that schools operate an open door policy, fostering positive dealings with parents and guardians.  Parents and guardians are encouraged to come to schools before or after the school day.  Teachers meet parents informally and formally every day.  There are regular parent-teacher meetings once or twice a year.  This is the culture in which primary schools operate.  The INTO submits that this positive engagement culture should be fully acknowledged and supported in any new proposed parent and student charter.<br/><br/>In 1993, a huge amount of work was done between management bodies, the Catholic Primary School Managers Association, the Church of Ireland Board of Education, Educate Together and An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta to agree a formal parental complaints procedure.  That procedure is in place and has worked very well in schools.  The first paragraph of the existing complaints procedure puts it in a nutshell.  It states: &ldquo;The purpose of this procedure is to facilitate the resolution of difficulties where they may arise in an agreed and fair manner.&rdquo;  The emphasis is on the word &ldquo;resolve&rdquo;.  Parents or guardians are encouraged to raise their concerns informally with the relevant teacher in the first instance, as is right and proper.  If the complaint is not resolved, it goes to the board of management following a few short steps.  The existing complaints procedure fully complies with fair procedures and due process.  It is incremental in approach and it balances opportunities for repeated informal attempts at resolution.<br/><br/>Parents or guardians were not party to the discussion on the complaints procedure in 1993.  Several years ago the INTO participated in round-table discussions convened by the Department on this issue.  Unfortunately, the results of that engagement have not been published.  While attempts were made by the education partners, particularly at primary level, to develop procedures under section 28, it is timely and fitting that this now be progressed.  Existing local complaints procedures have been developed and agreed between school management bodies and the teacher unions.<br/><br/>The big issue for the INTO is that if there are to be new procedures, there would be a general agreement reached between the education partners on a one size fits all procedure for our 3,250 schools.  There are huge issues in schools-----</p></speech>

As a teacher for 12 years, I could identify with many of their observations, especially in terms of the workload and paperwork.  It is pragmatic that we look at the implications such a Bill may have in terms of legal costs for the Exchequer at a time when things are very frail and when our schools badly need resources that have been withdrawn from them.  I agree with all of those points and I thank the witnesses again.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-21a.361" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017032100002#G00600"><p>I thank the contributors for making their time available and bringing their expertise and experience to help guide us in our deliberations.</p> <p>  I always quote Ruair&iacute; Quinn: "Our job is to legislate."  We have to take advice from the various interests, vested and otherwise, and then we have to do the right thing.</p> <p>  There are a couple of issues I would like to address with regard to the Education (Amendment) Bill, which I sponsored.  The Teachers Union of Ireland states that 75% of the complaints received by the Ombudsman for Children were deemed outside of his remit.  That has always been the issue.  If the Ombudsman for Children is to be accepted as an advocate for education, somebody who is going to enhance and protect all partners, I can appreciate how it appears that an ombudsman for education would add another layer of bureaucracy and another layer of openness and transparency.  If it did add another layer of openness and transparency, it should be very welcome.  We are all aware of the horrific events in Tuam back in the day.  Everybody wondered why nobody said anything.  What I am trying to do here is bring accountability.  No one should be afraid of accountability.</p> <p> As a former principal, I am from a teaching background.  I do not think that 95 % or 98 % of teachers have anything to fear from an ombudsman for education.  It is not about making life difficult for them, it is about enhancing and recognising their role.  It is about vindicating their rights in a lot of cases.  Even when they are accused of things that they are not guilty of, it is important that there is somebody there to hear them.</p><p>I do not accept the claim somebody made today that the boards of management are accountable to patrons and the Minister.  It is well known that if a parent writes to the Minister to make a complaint about the board of management, the first thing the Minister will say is that he has no role or function relating to a board of management.  I therefore reject that claim.</p><p> To return to the advocacy role of an ombudsman for education, my issue with the Ombudsman for Children is that his remit is too narrow, as is evident from 75% of the complaints.  Somebody said - it might have been the TUI representative but I apologise if I am wrong - it is only 300 complaints per year in the context of 4,000 schools and 917,000 students.  However, the vast majority of parents would not dream of contacting the Ombudsman for Children with a complaint about their school or the board of management.  They would not be aware of it as an avenue.  Certainly in my role as a public representative I have advised several people but otherwise it would never dawn on them.  They just get frustrated and go home.  Some are very capable and use it but many are not aware of it.</p><p> An ombudsman for education would be somebody who is specifically qualified in the area of education and who would understand education and be devoted to it.  The person would understand the Education Acts to the letter, the constitution of boards of management and the rights of teachers.  Teachers are victims in our schools as well, in a minority of cases.  I absolutely accept that trust in schools and in the school system is hugely intact.  This is not a statement that people do not have trust in our school system.  I am referring to the minority of cases, the few occurrences not of bad apples but just where things go wrong when somebody does not do their job and the accountability to the parent in that situation, as opposed to the board of management where the principal tells the board, "There is nothing here, so move on".  The vast majority of principals are superb, overworked and overloaded.  This is not an attack on them but a recognition of them.</p><p> However, there are teachers in our system who require the assistance and guidance of an ombudsman.  Such an ombudsman could advocate for the rights of the teacher.  A teacher cannot go to the Ombudsman for Children.  They are over the age of 18 years and are not children.  We have the Pensions Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces.  Why can we not have a dedicated ombudsman for the largest sector with the largest organisation and largest cohort of people to vindicate the rights of all the partners?  The principals can be victims of their boards of management.  This is about somebody who is exclusively committed and dedicated to education and knows it inside out.  That is not the remit of the Ombudsman for Children.  That is what I am trying to achieve for this huge sector.  The ombudsman could be an advocate against the Government.  For example, the ombudsman could lobby the Government on why the Education for Persons with Special Education Needs, EPSEN, Act has been in place for so many years and is not yet implemented.  The role of an ombudsman for education would be to bang the drum, day in and day out, to ask the Government to do what it should be doing to vindicate the rights of children with special educational needs.</p><p> That is what I envisage with an ombudsman for education.  I believe the witnesses have not looked at this from the right angle when they express a fear that this is something that would be unwelcome, cause more bureaucracy and accountability, require more answering and so forth.  What if one asked the Ombudsman for Children for his view on the current situation with junior certificate reform?  He does not have a view on that.  He is not qualified in that area.  However, an ombudsman for education would roll up his or her sleeves, get involved and make a statement on it.  Such an ombudsman would take on board the views of all the partners and would be qualified to do so.  That is what I am seeking.</p><p> There is a budget of approximately &euro;9 billion for this sector.  We could afford an ombudsman from that &euro;9 billion budget.  To put it in context, the Ombudsman for Children costs approximately &euro;2 million per year.  There are approximately 5,000 children in State care and about one quarter of that number require a voice in court.  We spend &euro;16 million on that, yet we spend only &euro;2 million on giving every other child in the country a voice.  This proposal is not something to be feared.  It is not an attack on the education system or about hanging out to dry teachers or boards of management.  It is about vindicating the rights of all the partners in education and having a suitably qualified professional person who will ensure the Government produces timely legislative responses to current issues.  Those issues could be teachers' rights, teachers' qualification issues or issues where qualifications are not recognised.</p><p> An ombudsman for education is all-encompassing, so it is a narrow focus to suggest subsuming it into the Office of the Ombudsman for Children.  That misses the point completely and does not do the teaching profession, which the organisations represent and for which I have enormous regard as I come from that background, any justice either.  Teachers can be victims of fellow staff members, their principals or the boards of management.  Where do they turn?  I accept they turn to the organisations represented by the witnesses, but that is not their job.  They should not have to be rolling up their sleeves in that regard.  If there was an independent, suitably qualified, professional ombudsman for education to deal with these issues, it would be a win-win for everybody.  I ask the witnesses to re-evaluate their approach to this on that basis.</p><p> I thank Ms Jane Hayes-Nally for her questions.  I have addressed the issue of cost.  The cost is minuscule in the greater scheme.  If there is a budget of &euro;9 billion, spending &euro;1 million or &euro;2 million of that sum on ensuring better outcomes for everybody involved is a pittance.  We should not be hanging ourselves on the cost or saying that it will take from delivery of other services.  One of the witnesses made a statement about all the other services that are under pressure.  This would not take from those services in any way, shape or form.  The Office of the Ombudsman for Children does not have the capacity to deal with the education sector.  The health service has the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, and other bodies.  Education deserves this and it is time we all accepted that, as opposed to feeling fear about it and knocking it on the head.</p></speech>

I complimented the Deputy on the last occasion for starting this conversation and I do so again today.  I am heartened by the presentations, both on the last occasion and today, that this is not a serious issue.  Most of the problems that arise are dealt with at local level and the infrastructure is in place to do that.  However, it is clear there is an issue when it is not possible to resolve a matter at local level.  Putting a mechanism in place to deal with such situations is the challenge we face.  Based on the contributions I have heard, I do not underestimate the challenge of trying to get to a point where there is consensus on this.  The witnesses have highlighted many issues.  I am not saying they are unwarranted, as they are, but it puts into sharp focus the challenge the committee faces in trying to get consensus on this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-21a.365" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1404" speakername="Lynn Ruane" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017032100002#H00400"><p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their submissions.  I feel extremely ambivalent as to what is the right thing to do.  I agree with much of what Deputy Jim Daly said but I also understand the issue.  I tend to look at matters through the lens of class, disadvantage and DEIS schools.  My initial reaction is there is a huge need for an ombudsman with regard to those areas, especially when there are parents and families in communities who would struggle to advocate for themselves.  In fact, sometimes as they do not even realise they are being short-changed or mistreated, complaints will never be made.  Sometimes, too, they do not know they have a right to make a complaint about their child's education or how their child is being treated.</p> <p>  I can give an example, and I was quite proud of the students concerned.  In the past few months, four students from a Tallaght school contacted me about a suspension each of them had received which they did not feel was warranted.  They wanted to know what to do so they contacted me on Facebook.  I was delighted they took the initiative to contact me.  When I contacted the school and went through the school's policies it turned out they were right.  They should not have been suspended from school.  Two of them are in leaving certificate year and the policy and procedure of the school had not been followed.  I tried to help their parents to go to the school and appeal that decision for their children.  It was the same teacher who had done this on a single day in the school.  The parents told me what the school had told them.  It was said about one child that as he was a senior student he was suspended because he should be setting an example for the school and that the school did not follow policy and procedure if it was a senior student.  That is a ridiculous thing to say, but this type of thing is happening all the time.  The parents are coming away with this information and not realising that they are not being given a logical argument.  It is just teachers trying to justify the decision they made on that day.  When I tried to support the parents in going to the board of management they were fearful.  They did not want to do it.  They did not feel confident enough.  They did not think they had the ability or the language to go to the board to advocate and fight that.  The issue is dealing with such situations.</p> <p>  There is also the matter of student councils.  If one conducts an audit of schools that claim to have student councils one will find it is not true.  There are no student councils and they are not meeting.  The students do not have a voice.  My daughter, who was a student representative, used to follow her teacher around the school asking when a student council meeting would be held when they were not taking place.</p><p>I feel there is a need for something such as an education ombudsman.</p><p> We also have people continuing in education beyond the age of 18, such as people with intellectual disabilities or those doing further learning.  Where does that fall in terms of complaints procedures with the children's ombudsman?  Is there another avenue for those complaints?  There is a broader realm of education beyond the age of 18 which does not fall into the remit of the children's ombudsman.</p><p> Ms Leydon made a very important point about policy needing to create a culture shift.  While I think that is right, I do not know whether this Bill achieves it.  I do not think we can scare teachers into behaving or teaching differently.</p><p> I would love input as to what type of policies can move us to the point at which teachers change their culture.  Resources and capital are missing from many schools, but that should not change the attitude of the teacher to the children.  The stress that teachers are under is having an effect on the students.  While the financial support must be in place, something has to be done in the meantime in the absence of resources in order that children are not losing out.  I feel some ambivalence on this, although I am taking on what the witnesses are saying.  My instinct is to protect those most marginalised and most disadvantaged.  I might have rung up an ombudsman a few times in the past five years if he had been in place.</p></speech>

Our view would be that there has to be adequate facility, whether that be a new ombudsman's office or somebody in a current role.  We feel very strongly that the rights that this parents' charter should bring would make that available.  We do not have a position as to whether it should be one or the other.  The provision of adequate facility should be in place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-21a.369" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne McElduff" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017032100002#J00400"><p>I hear what Deputy Daly is saying about an education ombudsman being there to advocate for everybody.  However, he is presenting a contradictory view about how an ombudsman for education would work.  There are many advocates and Senator Ruane has articulated some of the reasons we need them.  The arguments are for more resources for special needs, smaller class sizes, more relief for teaching principals in order that they can interact with parents, and more delegated posts in schools.  It is the resources we need, not the advocacy.</p> <p>  As presented, the Bill is solely an appeal mechanism for parents and students for complaints which currently are dealt with at school level.  This is a further appeal on top of that.  We think that is unnecessary.  It will end up in multiple hearings, which will cost a huge amount of time and take the focus away from resources, supports and resolution mechanisms.  We want to hear the concerns and complaints of parents.  We want to be open about that and to address it.  However, we need to do so effectively and not through multiple layers of appeals.  The Education (Amendment) Bill as structured would end up like that, according to my reading of it.  Section 66 in particular, as it is written, raises serious concerns for us in terms of practicalities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-21a.370" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Moira Leydon" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017032100002#J00500"><p>Deputy Daly is obviously very passionate about this but I feel there is a misplaced focus.  Like my colleague, Ms McElduff, I read the Bill and interpreted it as an appeals mechanism dealing with complaints, whereas the other legislation is about culture change plus the changing of section 28 of the Education Act to deal better with complaints.  I am also concerned about the broad remit the Deputy is attributing to a potential ombudsman for education.</p> <p>  As legislators, the members need to be very clear about their role.  Legislators have roles, as do civil servants.  Industrial relations mechanisms have a role in dealing with teachers who are being treated badly and so on.  We have established structures to deal with issues that arise in the course of employment, public management and education.  We believe that the Office of the Ombudsman for Children should have an extended remit and should be better supported to deal with these problems.</p> <p>  I compliment Senator Ruane.  The last time I met her we were at a lecture in the Royal Irish Academy where she spoke very passionately about the invisibility of disadvantage and the way the disadvantaged are not listened to.  I would make the point that children are people.  Their needs should not be dealt with on a segregated basis.  They should not be told, "This is your education bit but the fact that the HSE has not delivered on your special needs supports is dealt with by another office."  The nature of the office that is proposed in the Bill, which is all we have to go on, would end up being very short-sighted because its remit would not cover the entire needs of the child as he or she grows and progresses.  For those reasons, we would be concerned about whether the Deputy's Bill will achieve what he would like it to achieve, and whether there are other mechanisms in place which would do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-21a.371" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John MacGabhann" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017032100002#J00600"><p>I hope I will not repeat too much of what my colleagues have said.  We want schools to work and to work more effectively.  That means we want them to work for the students.  The purpose is to serve the interests of the students.</p> <p>  The fact is schools are struggling at the moment.  Resources have been pared back; nobody denies that.  In particular, schools are struggling to maintain pastoral structures that were just about at the point of being embedded when economic disaster struck.  In respect of what Senator Ruane said, I was a teacher for 24 years in a Tallaght school and I saw things improve because resources improved.  Precisely the point the Senator made about confidence began to become evident in the community.  People - parents and students - began to become empowered.  They also had local structures that they understood and local access that they could use.  My problem with Deputy Daly's Bill is that it will create another remote, statutory satellite.  If there is one thing we have plenty of in the sky above education, it is satellites.  We have any number of them.</p> <p>  Deputy Daly has described a remit that is very broad.  Among the things included in it is, essentially, the remit of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  The Deputy included what is already very explicitly within the remit of other statutory bodies.  In that context, something as broad and vast as the junior cycle would absorb resources in a manner that would not allow the sort of access that Senator Ruane has sought.  What we want to do is make schools work.  That involves, among other things, making student councils work and making them meaningful.  We do not have an objection to student councils or any fear of culture change.  We are attempting day by day to engineer that change but we are fighting against a resource tide that has been ebbing.  That is the fundamental problem we have faced.</p> <p>  We are open to improving the situation.  I very specifically take the point the Senator has made about those in more marginalised communities finding it an awful lot more difficult to access the pretty complex and arcane structures we put in place.  That is precisely why it is in the school context that problems should be addressed.</p> <p>  On the charter Bill, it would be ruinous if each school was required to reinvent the wheel, as my colleague has said, on foot of guidelines issued by the Minister.  There must be some standardisation here.  Only then will we get consistency and fairness and the reassurance for parents that there is consistency and fairness.</p></speech>

This part of the meeting involves a discussion on the possible impact of Brexit on the Irish educational system.  We will have the opportunity to listen to the views of stakeholders in this very important area.  I took the opportunity over the weekend to look at statistics regarding Irish students abroad.  In 2016, 12,000 Irish students studied in the UK while 2,000 studied in Northern Ireland.  They are studying different subjects in the UK and Northern Ireland for different reasons but if 14,000 students suddenly decided that they were going to study in the Republic of Ireland, it would have significant implications for capacity here.  We are all very familiar with the various arguments relating to the Cassells report and the need for further funding in the third-level sector.  If the 1,500 Irish students abroad who receive SUSI grants could not receive these grants because of the UK being outside the EU, this issue, combined with that of the other 12,500 students involved, could have huge implications.  Aside from the impact on our institutions and students, the area of research and collaboration between us, the UK and Northern Ireland is another issue.</p><p>We are delighted to have a number of witnesses here, all of whom are welcome.  I thank them for their patience in waiting outside.  I welcome Dr. Graham Love, chief executive of the Higher Education Authority, HEA.  I understand that he has been in this position for a week so I wish him the very best of luck.  I also welcome Dr. Gemma Irvine, head of policy and strategic planning at the HEA; Professor Jane Ohlmeyer, chairperson of the Irish Research Council; Professor Brian MacCraith, president of Dublin City University, DCU - who was with us previously; and Mr. John McGrane, director general, and Mr. Paul Lynam, head of sectoral policy, from the British Irish Chamber of Commerce.  It is important to look at other sectors outside education.  Finally, I welcome Mr. Ned Costello, CEO of the Irish Universities Association; Mr. Jeremy Godfrey, board chairman, and Mr. Vincent McCarthy, chair and board member, from the International School of Dublin - an institution on which there could be a significant impact; and Ms Triona McCormack, director of research at UCD Research and Innovation.  I thank the witnesses for their submissions and opening statements.  I advise witnesses that these will be published on our website following the meeting.  While we are very happy to receive the submissions, all of which the members have had an opportunity to read, I suggest that witnesses do not have to stick to the submissions but can instead give shortened versions.  Members will then have the opportunity to ask questions.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite Professor MacCraith to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

We think there are four main areas of relevance and one key challenge.  In terms of student flows, which would be the first area, and picking up on the point made by the Chairman about the 12,000 Irish students in the UK, we believe there are three reasons why Irish students are in the UK.  One is that distinctive programmes are offered there that are not available here.  The second reason is excellent students who would probably be getting into universities like Oxford and Cambridge.  The third reason is an inability to get into equivalent degree programmes in Ireland.  The key point we would make is that if there is no increase in capacity here, this will increase competition for places in Ireland with two potential consequences.  One is a potential increase in CAO points in specific programmes that are competitive and the second is the displacement of students who would otherwise have obtained places.<br/><br/>In the broader context and looking at international students, I would distinguish two cohorts.  One consists of EU students, who will now be international students in a post-Brexit UK.  They may well see Ireland as a very attractive proposition, although, as we know, many continental European universities are offering programmes through English so there will be a competitive space there.  We must also include broader geopolitical developments.  There is very clear evidence that looking at Brexit on its own is not really sufficient.  One must look at Brexit in terms of what is happening in the US and elsewhere - anywhere with immigration issues.  For example, a report in yesterday's edition of <i>The Financial Times</i>stated that Indian students, who might have traditionally looked at the US in terms of MBAs and finance degrees, are now thinking about other English-speaking countries.  We would argue that there is a huge potential international student opportunity - both EU and non-EU - from the combination of Brexit and other factors.<br/><br/>The second point relates to staff mobility.  DCU is already seeing evidence of significant increases in numbers of EU academics currently based in UK universities looking to move elsewhere.  Again, the combination of cultural instability, immigration policies and a general feeling of not being welcome is causing those academics to consider moving.  If we couple that with a potential inability to avail of the huge Horizon 2020 funding for research and innovation, it is causing those academics to think of Ireland as a more attractive proposition.<br/><br/>I wish to address North-South engagement.  As the university nearest the Border, DCU has put huge emphasis on the cross-Border mobility of staff and students and recognises that it can play a significant role in the stabilisation of peace on the island.  We highlighted the issue of the inequity in the points system that was preventing large numbers of Northern Ireland students from coming South.  This has now been fixed following the highlighting of the issue.  We have put various scholarships in place.  It would be a source of grave concern to us if, as a consequence of a hard Brexit, all the effort to attract these students from Northern Ireland, which is only an hour away, was nullified.  In respect of academic staff, one of the great deficiencies is the fact that there is no mechanism for establishing North-South research centres.  Again, this could create significant contributions to an all-island economy, as well as the mobility of staff back and forth.<br/><br/>I could keep elaborating on the potential opportunities, and there are many, but the single biggest challenge we must highlight is the constraint afforded by the absorbative capacity of the system here in many different ways.  The committee has heard one of them discussed previously.  It is the unsustainable funding model, as highlighted by the Cassells report.  If this is not addressed, it will ultimately result in a significant drop in quality with consequent reputational damage.  International students and international staff will not want to come here in such a situation.  Insufficient capital funding to provide the necessary expansion and upgrade of teaching, learning and research infrastructure will have the same consequence.  A very important issue, particularly for international students, is the inadequate supply of suitable and affordable accommodation for students.  International students look for high-quality accommodation and often their decisions are made on the basis of that.  As members are aware, we are already dealing with a significant challenge for our own students in Ireland.</p><p>We are trying to take advantage of the huge potential to attract international students by making Ireland what the HEA has called a "student talent magnet" but we do so in the face of an infrastructural deficit.</p><p> We are delighted that this committee is addressing and highlighting the issues and hopefully they will be incorporated into the Brexit negotiations.  There are massive opportunities for the sector in terms of staff quality, research, the quality of students and the general benefits of internationalisation but there are huge challenges as regards absorptive capacity.</p></speech>

International networks are incredibly important and UCD is no different from other Irish institutions in that the UK is our most significant and primary partner.  Knowledge networks provide a shared resource base to create new insights, new products and the things that drive our economies and societies forward.  It is important that we can manage and maintain those knowledge networks as we move into the future and, as a key partner, the UK is a significant part of that so we will have to look at bilateral arrangements if it is no longer part of the Horizon 2020 EU funding system, which has been the backbone of knowledge networks for the past number of years.  In 2014-2015 the UK received over &euro;1 billion in funding from that source, allowing it to employ 9,000 researchers.  It is a really significant resource base that has allowed its economy to advance.</p> <p>  It is important to maintain our partnerships but Brexit also allows Irish universities an opportunity to access some of that funding.  It is not inevitable, however, as there are competing member states and Germany, for example, is a high attractor of research funding, as are Italy, France and the Netherlands.  It is critical to look at constraints within our own system, such as infrastructure and basic funding and, as Professor MacCraith said, absorptive capacity from the point of view of staffing, to enable us to capitalise on the opportunity.  The priority given to research and innovation in Theresa May's statement on 17 January was very clear and the UK is steadfast in its belief in the value of funding for research and innovation.  It has committed some of its own resources to make up for the gap.  We need to be as steadfast in our belief in the importance of that funding and we need to make the necessary investments because they have real impacts.</p> <p>  Research funding can be seen in the context of the overall health of the economy and industry needs to maintain its export profile in the face of a very challenging Brexit environment.  We have been looking at how we, as a public sector organisation, assist our industries to be more competitive in this space and move beyond commodity products, which are very important to some sectors such as the agrisector, which have been impacted by the weakness in sterling.  The mushroom industry is a good example because 80% of sales are in the UK and it was called the earliest casualty of Brexit when a number of mushroom facilities shut down in October and November.  One company, Monaghan Mushrooms, is surviving and, indeed, thriving and we have worked with the company to assess the impact of vitamin D in its mushrooms, which has given it a growth opportunity.  We need to do such things with more of our industries to help Brexit-proof them and research and innovation is a means of doing that.</p> <p>  UCD has a significant international student base and 25%, or more than 7,000, of our students are from abroad but I echo the challenges mentioned by Professor MacCraith in infrastructure, the cost of living and the cost of housing.  We have put an additional 350 units on our campus this year but it is a continuous challenge to meet the demands of new incoming students and that will continue to put pressure on the system.  UCD is a research-intensive university with a highly international profile of both staff and students and we want to be part of capitalising on the opportunity that Brexit presents.  We see ourselves as part of the Irish solution, North and South.</p></speech>

We still do not know how this will turn out.  The free movement of people is the one I would highlight because of its relevance to research and it will be critical to see how the UK engages with EU research programmes.  Switzerland made proposals to change its immigration system and that had an immediate effect on its relationship with the EU in terms of its participation in the framework.<br/><br/>The Chairman mentioned the 11,000 students from Ireland studying in the UK, which represents over 6% of our own domestic student population.  It amounts to a small university or a couple of medium-sized ITs.  As Professor MacCraith said, if there is a significant perturbation of those numbers there will be major implications for the plans arising from the Cassells report.  The number of UK students coming to Ireland increased by 38% between 2012 and 2015, possibly because of the &pound;9,000 fee in the UK.  However, the most up-to-date data from UCAS in the UK show that in academic year 2017-2018 there was a 10% decrease in applications to Ireland from England, Scotland and Wales and a further 18% reduction in the number of Irish students applying to UK universities.  There are tangible impacts already.<br/><br/>We do not have data for the number of UK staff in Irish universities but there is a common labour market between Ireland and the UK for academic staff so this is a concern.  We have a portal, <i>universityvacancies.com</i>, for jobs in academia.</p><p>What we have seen from that is that there was a significant increase month on month last year relative to the year before in the number of people hitting that portal from the UK.  People are definitely looking to Ireland.  We know that there are 2,300 Irish staff working in the UK.  The position of these staff is obviously a concern.</p><p> Those are some of the downsides.  As for the upsides, I will echo the comments that people have made.  With regard to international students, international education is a big focus of Ireland's education strategy.  We are definitely seeing numbers, which are in my opening statement, reflecting a lessening of interest from international non-EU students in the UK.  That is absolutely a potential opportunity for Ireland.  Again, I echo what has been said by other colleagues here in that the capacity of the system is an issue.</p><p> We need to see this in the overall context and in a supportive environment for higher education.  We need a system in which we address the systemic funding issues and in which we need more flexibility on the staffing and regulation side.  I should mention that because the UK system is much less regulated than our system, particularly when it comes to the autonomy of institutions in how they manage staffing contracts, remuneration architecture and all of that.  We need that as well.  We need some improvement on the sort of nexus between the Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB, and the justice side of things in terms of stay-on opportunities for international students to capitalise on those students as well.  We believe that a holistic package needs to be put together to capitalise fully on the opportunities and to counteract some of the very definite downsides that we can see emerging.</p></speech>

I feel like the man who, if he had more time, would have written a shorter letter in terms of the challenges of summarising.  Understanding that all of the contributors here today share many points in common and that the data are also well understood, I will come at this from the point of view of the organisation that I have the privilege of leading.</p> <p>  The British Irish Chamber of Commerce is a trade body.  We are for the championing of trade between the two islands, Britain and Ireland, and for the more than 400,000 jobs that are sustained by the trade corridor between the islands today.  It is not just about employers and the employment creation, it is about what that does in civic society.  It is those jobs and those investments by employers that create well-being throughout the two islands.  It is about the security that it gives to all.  I might extract one or two passages of relevance to that theme and then draw out a couple of observations.</p> <p>  In our submission, we noted from our perspective the huge powerhouse for research that is the UK.  That is what is in play here alongside Ireland's response to it, which has been commented upon by the practitioners in the sector.  I will insert one or two points.  The UK is currently involved in more Horizon 2020 projects than any other country in Europe.  Last year, UK universities received about &pound;1 billion in research grants and contracts from EU sources.  The most immediate impact of Brexit for the sector, as has been referenced, has been the anecdotal evidence that UK researchers have been dropped as partners from collaborative projects.</p> <p>  There are also collaborations between the UK and Ireland in this space.  Collaborations between academics from different countries are immensely important as they tend to lead to research with greater impact.  The Royal Society in the UK notes that between 2005 and 2014, there were 16,655 co-authored papers between academics in the UK and Ireland.  As previously outlined, the biggest concern for the UK academic community is whether British academics will still be able to collaborate across EU borders with their European peers, including those in Ireland.  UK and Irish research institutions also collaborate extensively under such programmes.  There are currently in excess of 900 collaborative links under Horizon 2020.  Since the commencement of Horizon 2020, 13% of all successfully funded Irish research projects have included at least one UK-based partner.  In the past 12 months, that number has risen to about 40%.  We are massively intertwined in these matters.</p> <p>  What would we say about all of that backdrop and the other things that have been submitted?  The first thing we would say is that we should never waste a good crisis.  We have a crisis.  Our neighbour has a crisis of democratic making which now sees a trapping inside a walled UK economy and community of massive research power, intellectual property, operational knowledge and capability to collaborate.  That is now trapped.  It is not a long-term thing.  It is not two years or ten years away.  It is second only to foreign currency collapse and the effect on mushroom farmers on Ireland.  This is one of the most immediate manifestations of the downside of Brexit for everybody involved, not just for the UK.  It is not just anecdotal.</p> <p>  The patron of the British Irish Chamber of Commerce is Mr. Niall FitzGerald, one of Ireland's greatest living industrialists and employment creators, who careered in Unilever and chaired Reuters.  What is little known, apart from his chairing of Munster Rugby, God bless him, is the fact that he is the president of the Leverhulme Trust, which curates a &euro;4 billion legacy of Lord Lever, the soapmaker, to foster education and research in Britain.  Parts of that &euro;4 billion are dispensed every year to wonderful research projects, many of which collaborate with Irish researchers, Irish third level institutes and European institutes.  In that capacity, Mr. FitzGerald would tell the committee that there is not a week that goes by in which he does not get a call from a vice chancellor in a UK university saying that they are in crisis, not two or ten years away but now, because researchers are feeling a very cold wind of change and feeling very unwelcome inside the UK today.</p> <p>  They are unwelcome.  The question is: are we ready?  As has been referenced by Mr. Brian MacCraith and others, there is a legitimate capacity question and a digestibility question here.  We would go further.  We were recently proud to take a request from the Lord Mayor of Dublin, Brendan Carr, to produce a small piece of work, both in literature form and in video form, called "Greater Dublin is Greater Than Ever", to counter a spinning campaign in the UK and beyond that says that Dublin and Ireland would not be ready to take investment by banks, educational establishments, other employment creators and other value creators and that we do not have enough offices, homes, a regulator with the right amount of will and capacity, and international baccalaureate schools.</p> <p>  These concerns have all been relayed to me personally inside meeting rooms in London and the rest of Britain.  Most of it has some traceability to some anecdotal truth, but most of it is wrong in quantum, data and currency, as in, how current is the information.  Most of it is outdated.  Therefore, we have been telling people that Dublin does have offices and will have by the time they get here.  We have been telling them that Dublin has educational capacity and it will have it by the time they get here.  We have been telling them that it has international baccalaureate capacity coming on stream beyond the very good if small number of capacity institutions that are working here today.  We are delighted to see that one particular promoting group is bringing on stream an 800-seat international baccalaureate school in Dublin in just over a year's time to commence in autumn 2018.</p> <p>  We feel the need not just to know that this is coming but to tell people that this is coming.  The first thing is perception.  Perception is creating its own reality.  This is an immediate burning platform right now.  Educators, researchers and funders will not wait around to know what happens to Ms Theresa May's two-year negotiation space, which is likely to be several years longer than that.  We are in the business of dealing with the issues but being realistic about what is possible.  We must allow ourselves to think inventively. There are many other people who do not have a solution in full right now.  We should gather up our portfolio of reasons Ireland can be a solution to our neighbour's legitimate problem and create, as we have announced last week through a speech given by Mr. Niall FitzGerald as patron of the chamber, the concept of an Ireland and UK powerhouse.  There is nothing against our European allegiance and credentials whatsoever in this.</p><p>It recognises that Ireland is a peripheral and geographically remote piece of the European Union; a small island behind a slightly larger island with which we always have shared geography and many other shared cultural and community links.  We are not forgetting these factors and for the building on these in order see what the opportunities are.  I will round out by saying that on this island 50 years ago a great man, Dr. T. K. Whitaker, stepped forward into the political and public service space at a time when as an island, a country and a people Ireland had far less resources and far more uncertainty than we have today, which is considerable.  He refused to dream small; he thought big and delivered big with the Se&aacute;n Lemass Administration and other good politicians around the whole of the public service at that time.  He said that if Ireland did not think big it would lose big.  At that stage Ireland had its young people leaving on the hoof alongside our cattle.  One of the primary things championed by Dr. Whitaker was the investment in our education sector.  As a result Ireland has now become one of the best performing economies in the world with a tremendous foreign direct investment strategy and the clustering of smaller business development around that.  All of this is underpinned by a wonderful education system, which is challenged.  We now need to think what is the opportunity and what would we do if we were told that we had six months in which to win the case to be the solution - or a significant part of the solution for our neighbour's problem.  What would we do in six months, not six years or 16 years?  Some things will take longer, and that is appropriate, but to take a national emergency and opportunity plan view from this situation we must ask what needs to be done and to go across the water with our friends and ask what will it take for Ireland to be the next best solution for a partner island that has a problem on its hands.  Education, research and third level structuring is core to what lies next.  As a trade body we are proud to be associated with the great education establishments of the State and we commit to working closely with them towards that end over the coming weeks and months. </p></speech>

The International School of Dublin is the only school in Ireland that offers the international baccalaureate curriculum at primary level.  The International Baccalaureate's mission is to develop inquiring, knowledgeable and caring young people who help to create a better and more peaceful world through intercultural understanding and respect, as Professor MacCraith said when he spoke of the importance of international education.</p> <p>  I will now introduce myself.  I relocated to Dublin three and a half years ago, after 20 years in Hong Kong, to take up a position in the public service in Ireland.  In Hong Kong I was the chairman of two international schools in an environment where the international education sector was much more mature and developed than it is here.  I am joined by my colleague Mr. Vincent Mc Carthy who is a member of the board of the International School of Dublin.  In his day job Mr. Mc Carthy is the chief executive of the Festival of Curiosity.</p> <p>  I wish to speak on four points - why Brexit could increase demand for international school provision in Ireland; the current state of international school provision; how international education provision might evolve; and policy recommendations.  We have some insights into the demand for international schooling from contacts with our parent body, contacts with multinational companies, chambers of commerce, embassies, IDA Ireland and through a research project we commissioned from Grant Thornton in 2016.  A consistent message from all these sources is that when executives are offered the chance to relocate, apart from work considerations, housing and education for their children are the two most important considerations when deciding whether to take up a position.  In our research we have heard anecdotal evidence of people who had turned down posts in Ireland because of the lack of what they considered to be suitable education for their children.</p> <p>  As a result of Brexit, Ireland will be competing with other EU economies for multinational operations relocating from the UK.  Ireland's success in attracting this investment will partly depend on the ability to offer suitable educational options for the children of the executives who would come here.  Our research suggests several characteristics of the ideal type of international school.  One factor is that it would provide education from pre-kindergarten all the way through to sixth form because people come with children of different ages and they like to know that their children will be able to go to the same school, and that the schooling would be available as the children grow older.  Another feature would be that the international baccalaureate is provided.  As the gold standard programme offered around the world, people could be sure that if they come to Ireland and their children do the international baccalaureate here they could be prepared if their parents take another overseas posting, and they could take up the international baccalaureate again.  The programme also has a very good record of preparing people to go back into national systems of education.  Fees are another characteristic to be considered.  People would like the fees for an international education to be comparable to those of other fee-paying schools in the Dublin area.  They would like the school to be a not-for-profit school with a strong community spirit.  They would also like an international school to be not just for international students with a leavening of about 25% to 35% of the school body to consist of local students, maybe returnees from the Irish diaspora or local families whose children might like to study overseas in the future and would like the international baccalaureate curriculum.  This is an extremely important implication of Brexit for Ireland and being able to provide education for the children of relocating executives may be more an economic question than an educational one.</p> <p>  People may say that Ireland is not ready for this - as Mr. McGrane has said - and the current state of play is that Ireland is probably not ready.  There is very limited provision of international baccalaureate education.  We are the only primary school offering the programme and there is one secondary school offering the leaving certificate equivalent programme.  There is a school in Greystones offering the middle-years programme but it is mostly targeted at Spanish students who come to Ireland for one year.  Mr. McGrane made reference to a proposal for a through train international baccalaureate school in Leopardstown in the next year.  In our view this is a very useful contribution to what Ireland needs but it will not, on its own, be sufficient because there is actually more demand for international school places.  That school could be entirely filled by ex-patriot families who are currently in the State's education system and who might prefer to be at a school offering the international baccalaureate.  There is a need for even more capacity than just one school.</p> <p>  We also believe that it is desirable that there should be a complementary role in international education for the not-for-profit sector.  The not-for-profit sector has the mission of supporting all the educational needs of the foreign direct investment families, irrespective of whether it is particularly profitable.  It would tend to keep fees a bit lower and it would be easier to generate the community spirit.</p> <p>  Having spoken with IDA Ireland we are also very conscious that it is not all about Dublin.  There is a need to get foreign investment to come to other regions.  While we believe that Dublin is the first priority it is not the only priority and it would be very desirable to expand international education to the regions.  Our vision is for a number of international baccalaureate schools in Dublin and elsewhere.  Some of these might be stand-alone schools and some might share facilities with local schools or with schools offering the national curriculum of France or Germany.  There are a number of different possibilities.  As the charity that runs the International School of Dublin we are looking at expanding our mission to have a wider promotion of the international baccalaureate in Ireland and to change our name to reflect that.</p> <p>  I shall conclude with some policy recommendations.  Reference was made to what I might like to see happening in the next two months.  To help the not-for-profit sector in expanding schools it would be very desirable if the Government could identify a site in Dublin for a second international baccalaureate school and to invite proposals from the not-for-profit sector to operate a school on that site.  There would also be a need for a little bit of money to help fund the start-up costs or expansion costs to cover the other curriculums.</p><p>That could be by way of a loan.  International schools, even in the not-for-profit sector, can be self sustaining over time, and a loan could begin to be repaid after four or five years.  </p><p> It would be useful to have a study on the demand for international education outside Dublin.  The Grant Thornton report carried out really focused on Dublin, but I think if we want to promote the international baccalaureate outside Dublin some information on the demands would be useful.  </p><p> I would also say that attracting local students into these schools is very desirable from a social point of view.  However, there is a problem with the way the the international baccalaureate is valued as an entrance qualification for Irish universities.  Professor MacCraith spoke about Northern Irish qualifications.  We have exactly the same problem with the international baccalaureate.  The perception is that Irish parents would be mad to send their children to an international baccalaureate school if the eventual aim was to get entrance to an Irish university via the CAO system.  </p><p> Brexit does present some challenges, but the foundations are in place to meet the challenges.  With leadership and collaboration we can create an environment for international education that is attractive for new investment and invigorating for society.  We have supplied a more detailed briefing paper, and we are happy to answer questions.  </p></speech>

Mindful that I am the last speaker and that there are some points very strongly in common with the previous speakers my opening statement will be further cut down.  We have provided our paper from last October which talks about the pros and cons and opportunities.  I would like to highlight a few things.  The key concerns around Brexit for higher education and research, as were outlined in that paper, are student mobility and residency rules, international education programmes, academic professional mobility and recruitment, and research collaboration and funding.  Challenges identified include that we will not have exclusive opportunities as others are looking at this; the fact that many European countries are building up English language provision; the visibility of Ireland - I sometimes think that we kid ourselves on this because yes, some of our nearer neighbours are very aware, but for others we are not necessarily seen in as a single independent entity; the points made around absorptive capacity limitations that several of my colleagues have made; and the historic lack of investment in the Irish higher education and research system.</p> <p>  Fundamentally we believe that higher education and research should feature as a central component of Ireland's Brexit strategy.  I want to be very clear on that.  A high quality higher education and research sector can make a significant contribution to boosting the international standing of Ireland for the benefit of Irish society and economy.  Stronger links between higher education research and Irish small and medium enterprise, particularly in regions outside Dublin, can help to cushion the impact of Brexit in the short term and boost competitiveness in the long term.  There is evidence that suggests that international students bring a significant multiplier effect, with some estimates suggesting it is in the region of &euro;1.4 billion to &euro;1.5 billion per annum.  </p> <p> We have an opportunity to globally position Ireland as a distinctive high-quality, international hub for higher education and research by boosting investment in higher education and research to send a strong message that Ireland is back in business after a decade of austerity, identifying and developing new partnerships with other EU higher education institutions, and attracting large EU flagship projects or centres to Ireland. </p> <p>  Irish higher education and research can be a talent magnet, attracting the best students, academics and researchers for the benefit of Irish society and economy through targeted initiatives to provide opportunities for the recruitment of international students, academic staff and researchers and professionals seeking to relocate here, and potentially exploring new contractual arrangements to encourage and facilitate Irish and international researchers across all disciplines.  Particularly important will be the launch of the International Education Mark as part of a concerted effort to promote the quality of the Irish higher education and research system internationally. </p> <p>  In closing I would like to leave the committee with one unambiguous message.  Higher education and research, with the right inputs - and I emphasise that - represents a major opportunity for Ireland in facing Brexit. </p> <p>  I am relatively new here but my colleague, Gemma Irvine, from the HEA, and the chair of the Irish Research Council, Jane Ohlmeyer, are also present.</p></speech>

I would like to make a point around the formulation of research policy, because with Brexit Ireland loses a very important ally in Brussels, and this could shape the future development of the research and education agenda.  That is something that we need to be extremely mindful of as we are having these conversations.</p> <p>  I would like to focus for a moment on shaping Ireland as the country of choice for the best researchers, because it would be useful to remind ourselves that we have a tremendous opportunity here.  To echo what Dr. Love has just said, we may not be ready now, but with relatively modest investment we could well be ready within the next 18 months.  We need to focus on investment in the window that we have.  The truth is that our research ecosystem is currently very unbalanced as a result of austerity, and that our higher education institutions are chronically under-funded.  If we are willing to accept that and actually invest we can create an environment that is extremely attractive to researchers who are refugees from Brexit, and also refugees from Trump's America.  I realise that that is not the focus of our discussions today.  It is about being a magnet for global talent not just talent displaced by Brexit.  However, that means investment in the research ecosystem, encompassing applied research and, importantly, basic frontier research.  I draw attention to the fact that the Minister for Education, Deputy Bruton, has earmarked money to allow the Irish Research Council to develop a frontiers programme, which we very much hope will attract global talent, including talent from the UK, as well as support our own researchers to be better placed to compete, especially in drawing down Horizon 2020 funding.  </p> <p>  What would success look like?  How do we know that we have actually done something significant here?  What that means for me is increased draw-down of European funding, through Horizon 2020 and the European Research Council.  That will be one big indicator.  If we invest now our draw-down will increase.  The global rankings of Irish universities will be improved.  Nobody has mentioned that, but as much as we all hate them they are a reality we are stuck with.  They are extremely influential in terms of people deciding to come to Ireland and invest in Ireland.  If we can attract the best researchers we will without a doubt improve the rankings of our institutions, which then increases our global profile.  </p> <p>  I would like to echo the point that Dr. Love made that Ireland has poor visibility globally.  However, if we attract the best researchers, educators and students internationally, that really helps to mark us out as an educational and research hub of global significance.  For me, that is the prize.  With focused investment over the next 18 months all of this is achievable.  I am coming at this from a research perspective, but the whole thing is an integrated ecosystem.  We cannot just invest in one bit - we have to start at the bottom.</p></speech>

On procurement, is there anything to be said about Irish universities buying lab equipment or items like that from abroad?  Has that been costed, and will it be affected by procurement?</p><p>Do the witnesses expect that the number of English students coming to Ireland to study will be reduced because they will no longer be able to avail of free EU fees?  Will this have an impact on the relationship between England and Ireland?</p><p> In the next few weeks, do the witnesses intend to recommend where the money provided by the Exchequer-employer investment mechanism should be allocated?  It seems that we need capital and space if we want to accommodate researchers, their staff and an influx of students.  Let us assume that the Exchequer-employer investment funding will be increased.  It is does not make sense to allocate it in respect of capital projects if we want to prepare for Brexit over the next six months.</p></speech>

I apologise for my brief absence at the start of the meeting.  The committee will probably debate this matter over the next two years.  We will not know what is going to happen in terms of all of the individual issues until negotiations start.</p> <p>  Brexit poses opportunities and challenges and there will be wins and losses.  More money is needed to fund the third-level sector, the education system in general and the international school that was mentioned.  I will monitor Brexit very closely and carefully.  I hope that enough opportunities will arise to counteract the challenges.  My biggest priority, as a member of the D&aacute;il and this committee, will be funding because, as has been said, we will not be able to attract high-calibre people to this country unless our system is up to scratch.  Everyone will agree that the education system is not up to scratch.  I have no doubt that the committee will engage with the witnesses again on Brexit and on many other issues.</p></speech>

I shall follow on from the point that Senator Ruane made about fees.  When English students come here to study and when Irish students go to England, they pay the same fees as their counterparts in both jurisdictions.  Following Brexit, will English students be considered international students and be obliged to pay higher fees?</p> <p>  I want to ask about the recognition of qualifications.  Students who study pharmacy in the UK or wherever must undertake a course in UCC which, on graduation, will lead to their qualifications being recognised.  Will Brexit prevent a number of qualifications from being recognised?  A number of nurses have been sent to the Great Ormond Street Hospital in London to receive specific training to work in the national children's hospital.  Will their UK qualifications be recognised here?  Brexit will have an impact on fees for education and on the recognition of qualifications.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-21a.396" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1396" speakername="Robbie Gallagher" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017032100002#R00400"><p>I, too, welcome all of the witnesses.  Their contributions have been uplifting.  When Brexit is discussed, usually all one hears about are people's concerns and the negative impact it will have on the economy.  It is great to hear that Brexit will provide opportunities for the education sector.  The challenge is how best to package such opportunities and make them a positive reality for this country.  The old adage that one must speculate to accumulate springs to mind.  The contributions made here today are especially important and many good points have been put forward.  Is there a mechanism whereby all of the delegations present can feed into a central point to harness and package their positive ideas and suggestions together?  Does such a mechanism exist?</p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned that funding is needed immediately in order for us to benefit.  Is there a figure for same?  Have the witnesses heard positive sounds from the Department that the amount they suggested will be provided?  I am not being political when I say that we are only fooling ourselves if we do not get the funding.  We must grasp the opportunities presented by Brexit or they will pass us by.  It is vitally important that the delegations have a platform and that their message is listened to and acted upon.  If, as Deputy Thomas Byrne said, over the next year to 18 months they find that this is not the case, then we need to hear about it because we need to ensure that all opportunities are grasped.</p></speech>

Professor MacCraith mentioned all of the advances that have been made in terms of the McAleese scholarships, ERASMUS funding and the position relating to CAO points being rectified in order to be fair to students from the Six Counties.  We need to protect the many advances that have been made in these areas.  My party and I feel that a designated special status for the Six Counties is the way forward because it would protect all of the gains that have been made in the sector.  Brexit may jeopardise funding for students with disabilities from the Twenty-six Counties who have chosen to study in the Six Counties or the UK.  We must examine these issues and reach a conclusion in respect of them.  I would like to hear the views of the representatives about a designated special status.</p></speech>

It is clear that maintaining the common travel area is a priority on every level.  The common travel area is equally important for the education sector as it is for trade and business.</p> <p>  I agree with Senator Maria Byrne that it is essential that the European qualifications framework continues to be recognised, particularly as it affects students here and abroad.  A hard Brexit would have massive implications for the ERASMUS programme.  We cannot forget the ongoing collaboration regarding INTERREG funding.  It is quite significant and we do not want to lose same.</p></speech>

For brevity, not everybody needs to speak on all of the issues raised.  Comments are welcome if witnesses feel they can make a further contribution.  We could literally debate this matter for another five hours, which would be interesting and exciting because we have had a hugely enthusiastic and positive session so far.  I call on Professor MacCraith to commence.</p></speech>

A number of the questions share a common theme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-21a.402" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1257" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017032100002#R01000"><p>Yes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-21a.403" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Brian MacCraith" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017032100002#R01100"><p>We support the call for a designated special status from the North-South and east-west or UK perspectives because, as Senator Ruane and others mentioned, people move in both directions.  It is difficult to predict how Brexit will pan out.  We would support having minimum perturbation about the situation.</p> <p>  I shall make a final point on the notion of providing a large financial injection in order to grasp opportunities generated by Brexit.  The last time this happened in Ireland was during the 1999-2000 period.  A research programme was introduced in third level institutions that was funded by a combination of money provided by Chuck Feeney's Atlantic Philanthropies and a matching amount from the State.  Before the programme started, Ireland was ranked below Bangladesh in global ratings for science research.  Ireland is now consistently ranked in the top 12 in the world and we are in the top five in a number of key areas.  This success was generated by a recognition that we had a massive infrastructural deficit.  There was a competitive process and Irish universities were encouraged to work together to put a programme in place.  The research programme is an example of the impact an injection of funding can have on a system.  The establishment of a research programme propelled Ireland from nowhere - from league division three to the premier league.  The combination of that with what Science Foundation Ireland has done with human capital is what turned the country around.  All of that to which I refer is ageing and further investment in it has not been forthcoming.  Brexit will provide us with a massive second opportunity and a similar scale of investment will again be required.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-21a.404" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ned Costello" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017032100002#R01200"><p>I shall respond briefly to the good point made about procurement.  For the information of the committee, as part of the Office of Government Procurement, we have responsibility for the procurement of all lab and diagnostic equipment for the education sector overall.  We do this through the Education Procurement Service, which is located at the University of Limerick.</p><p>I do not have the data to hand but I can certainly supply a note to the committee on how exposed we are to the UK.  It is certainly true to say that research and laboratory equipment is so specialised that the vast majority of it would be imported.  That speaks to the point that if we end up in a situation involving tariffs, that will push costs up.  We have a very good global procurement system but if we are buying specialised items from the UK which cannot be obtained anywhere else, there will be cost implications.</p><p> In response to the question on submissions to the Department on the employer funding mechanism, we will be making a submission on that.  The capital issue is an interesting one.  The national training fund is a recurrent fund.  As far as the physical infrastructure element of capital is concerned, higher education was incredibly badly treated in the last round of capital disbursement.  In that context, the current capital review will be very important both for the physical capital element but also for research.  We have a very fine strategy in Innovation 2020 but there is no money in it.  Research funding is denominated as capital and it has to feature strongly in the capital review.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-21a.406" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McGrane" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017032100002#S00200"><p>I strongly support all of the points made today and have a number of brief observations to make.  On funding, all of the work has been done on funding previously.  We have the Cassells report on the matter.  To be fair to Members of the Oireachtas, it is really important that we take that report and do something with it.  There is no other report to be had.  We cannot continue with deferral but must work together and make some tough decisions.  What better time to make them than when we have a crisis-opportunity on our hands?</p> <p>  INTERREG funding was mentioned.  I had the privilege of visiting Swansea University two weeks ago, which is one of the six universities - three Irish and three British - taking part in the CALIN programme.  That programme is supported by &euro;12 million of INTERREG funds for small, emergent life-science firms, of which we have many because of our strong and embedded life sciences sector, born of education and FDI.  The programme will enable the next generation of employment and well being creators to come through, using research in Irish and UK universities.  Part of the issue is that not many people are aware that we are doing such things to champion the sustaining of them.  </p> <p>  Lastly, on a generic issue around Brexit, the process is set down.  It is tedious, politically divisive and so forth but it is very important that Ireland, as one of the EU 27, negotiating through the Council with the UK, has its distinct voice on what is important.  We understand that Ireland cannot have a side deal but Ireland is a fully paid up member of the EU.  In terms of education, research and all other sectors of our society, Ireland needs to have its point of view laid out very clearly.  There are two immediate issues that must be put on the table.  One is the transition regime.  We argued earlier about the extraordinary urgency in this particular sector but there are other matters and other influences that bear on people who say that in two year's time, as per the process, if there is no deal then the UK is gone.  That just raises the fear factor for researchers, educational establishments, funders and so forth.  The very first issue that must be dealt with across all interests is to voice the absolute importance of extending a transition regime and not playing the game that says, "If you don't agree within two years, you're out."  That achieves nothing.  Everybody will lose in those circumstances.</p> <p>  The other factor, which is particularly pertinent to education and research, is immigration.  The referendum was fundamentally about immigration in the UK and the European Union's view on free movement.  Europeans do not call it immigration, they call it free movement.  Educators also call it free movement - of talent, capability and joint intelligence.  We need, as a country, to take the initiative and to champion the importance of the issue of free movement and immigration being on the table early rather than late.  This is the factor that is chilling the environment inside the UK and risking the loss of significant talent, not just for the UK but for Ireland as well.  We need to talk about a transition regime and immigration and free movement early in the process, not later on.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-21a.407" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Jane Ohlmeyer" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017032100002#S00300"><p>I wish to respond to the fees issue as raised by Deputy Thomas Byrne and Senator Lynn Ruane.  The reality we are facing is that a student from the South who is studying in the North will be treated as non-EU and <i>vice versa</i>.  That prospect fills me with horror because the non-EU fee is between three to five times greater than the EU fee.  This is where the Government could be helpful in really trying to ensure that at least on the island of Ireland there is a single fee for students studying in Belfast or Dublin.  That would be a really helpful thing to do.  Ideally, we would want it to be east, west as well as North, South but we will have to work very hard to achieve that.<br/><br/>On the point made by Deputy Carol Nolan about the possibility of a special provision for researchers in the North, it should be noted that the Irish Research Council currently funds students on a pan-island basis.  We would intend to continue that, come what may.  Ideally, we would want to continue to fund students coming from the UK as well.  A lot of our money goes into early career researchers, that is, PhD students and post-doctoral students.  We feed the talent pipeline and would like that to continue, subject to an adequate budget being in place and certainly North-South, that has to be a priority for us.  <br/><br/>On Senator Gallagher's question of whether we speak with one voice, sadly the answer is &quot;No&quot;.  The Senator also asked whether there is a mechanism allowing the sector to speak with one voice but I am not aware of one.  What I am aware of is the fact that there are conversations going on in the Department of Education and Skills, the Higher Education Authority, the Irish Universities Association and elsewhere.  The Royal Irish Academy has just established two Brexit committees.  I am chairing the one for the South and there is another one in the North.  We have a proliferation of people thinking about this and we are all coming to the same conclusion.  Having a mechanism to bring all of these voices together would be extremely helpful because on this occasion, everyone wants the same thing.  In that way, we could influence policy makers here and in Brussels.  We must be very cognisant of the importance of making our case to our European colleagues.  Anything that allows us to speak with one voice at a policy level would be extremely valuable.</p></speech>

We did try to get someone from the EU to take part in this process.  That said, this is only the start of the engagement that the witnesses will have with this committee and I would hope that they will see this committee as a way of facilitating the discussion.  As Deputy Thomas Byrne has said, we will have to convene again, perhaps six months from now, to see where things stand at that point.  We might listen to some other voices at that point too.</p> <p>  On the North-South question, we must identify potential areas for all-island research collaboration.  Areas like the agrifood sector, for example, are vitally important.  If we do that collectively and start the work on that, other areas could come in behind that.</p></speech>

The paper presented to the committee today is the product of a round table meeting of key stakeholders which took place last November.  We will commit to running that again in the near term and I would suggest that this committee invites us back to relay the outcome of that round table.  We are getting more clarity here.  While it is still not absolutely clear, we are gaining clarity on the Brexit situation.</p><p> To pick up on the capital versus recurrent issue, it is difficult not to say "both".  Capacity issues were a key theme here today.  There is certainly a need for some basic level of capital investment to allow the human capital that we need flow through the system.</p><p> Third, several people mentioned INTERREG.  A week and a half ago, while I was still in my previous job as head of the Health Research Board, I signed off on a &euro;9 million deal for clinical trials in the community in the Border counties, which will give access to people in the community to medicines and medical devices and put Ireland further onto that innovation map that is the product of the INTERREG programme.  It will be &euro;5 million to the North and &euro;3.5 million to the South.  I reiterate the key need to keep access to that type of funding.</p></speech>

I am the chief executive of a not-for-profit charity, The Festival of Curiosity.  It is easy for me, as the chief executive of a charity, to approach the system and get funding through Science Foundation Ireland.  It is much more difficult for the International School Dublin.  It is sometimes seen as a foreign direct investment, FDI, challenge or an educational challenge and where the school approaches, one ends up going around the houses to all these different people and sometimes by the time one gets back to them they have changed.  The system does not necessarily have the capacity to understand the strategic challenge of international education at the primary and secondary level through the international baccalaureate.</p> <p>  Brexit give us a chance to look at this challenge through a strategic lens for the first time and we in the International School Dublin can provide the challenges and the opportunity.  We can do costings but a shift in our language is very important.  We are talking about investment in third level, which is blue-skies research but does give social and economic benefit down the line.  With the International School Dublin and the International Education Foundation of Ireland, which it will become, we are talking about an investment in a property but also in the children who attend it, the families who come to Ireland and the communities we will create across the country.  Once we get into that language and set up those mechanisms that we would love to contribute to, we can start reframing Brexit in terms of how we can tackle these challenges in a way that sets us up for the future beyond Brexit, not just for the next two years.</p></speech>

Going through the issues, and education being one of them, I have family members who live abroad and I see how they make their choices in terms of their children.  Having seen the Sundai school experience just outside Newbridge, which worked incredibly well for a number of years for the children of Japanese businesspeople who were based not just in Ireland but throughout Europe, it is a valid argument in terms of everything we are discussing with regard to Brexit, jobs etc.</p></speech>

The same process the universities used to change the points equivalents for A-levels for Northern Ireland students is in the pipeline to address that inequity in the IB schools so that parents can look forward to a fairer system in terms of points.</p></speech>

We talked earlier about the fact that there are openings now at the Commission's negotiating table.  We had always looked to the United Kingdom as a friendly face at the negotiating table.  A gap is opening up.  Others will fill the gap.  The UK were heavily positioning themselves around the digital and cloud strategy in the European Union.  That plays to Ireland's strengths.  We can kill two birds with one stone, so to speak, and try to attract infrastructure investment, as well as research funding while developing a very strong skill base for our future ICT sector.  The questions might be about the opportunity and the cost, but we need to look at this is in terms of the return.</p></speech>

We all recognise the challenges we face but also the opportunities.  The message is that Ireland, and our education system, is open for business but we need huge investment in it.</p> <p>  To address the point Mr. McGrane made about the Cassells report, we are not dragging our heels on it.  We are awaiting two pieces of research, one of which is on the technical impact, particularly regarding the income contingent loan.  That is not to suggest we are going down that road but as a committee we felt we needed some technical report on that, so two different reports have been commissioned.  We have looked for video conferencing with a number of other countries that have brought in that system.  We await that.  This is such an important decision we need to have as much information as possible but at the same time we are urging the Government to make as much investment as possible at this time while it awaits our recommendations on it.</p> <p>  I thank all the witnesses for coming in today.  It was a very interesting discussion.  I appreciate their insights, observations and recommendations.  It was interesting to hear what they are doing within their own organisations in terms of dealing with what is ahead of all of us.  I look forward to an engagement at another level and if they want to make any written submissions at a later stage we would welcome that.  I also appreciate what Dr. Love said that there will be another round-table discussion because as this process is evolving, more clarity will emerge so it is important that every six months there is an opportunity to do that, to learn from one another and explore what we can say as one voice.  Obviously, there will be some differences.  The witnesses represent unique organisations that sometimes compete within the same sphere.  That is the case with me and my political colleagues also.</p></speech>

Today we are dealing with an overview of the credit union sector, that is, the report by the credit union advisory committee, CUAC, of June 2016 entitled, Review of the Implementation of the Recommendations of the Commission on Credit Unions Report.  We are joined by a number of witnesses, all of whom are very welcome.  The committee has previously met representatives of each of the pillar banks.  This week, the committee will engage with the key players in the credit union sector, which again is hugely important.  We will begin our meeting with statements, but before that I want to bring attention to the fact that witnesses are advised that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I invite the witnesses to make their opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-21a.422" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Annmarie O'Connor" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017032100002#B00200"><p>The Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, welcomes this opportunity to appear before the committee.  First, I wish to note that huge work has been done inside the credit union movement over the last number of years and that is evidenced in the CUAC report.  In our view that must now pay a social dividend for members and their communities.  MABS works very closely with the credit union movement and has done since its foundation and that work remains very important to MABS and its clients.  We have made a detailed submission and I will summarise some of the points now.<br/><br/>Credit unions are a route to social and economic progression for individuals, households and communities.  They enable progression between significant stages of life.  Short-term lending does not always support that key objective.  We concur with the view expressed in the CUAC report that section 35 needs to be reviewed.  We also believe that mutuality, combined with appropriate regulation and strong corporate governance, offers a potential solution to some of the difficulties in the mortgage market and is worthy of further consideration. <br/><br/>When we last appeared before the committee in 2012, our main concerns related to financial and social inclusion.  We note that there is very little reference in the CUAC report to the issue of financial inclusion and wonder therefore what progress has been made since the commission reported.  I will talk about the personal microcredit pilot scheme later. <br/><br/>A credit union exists only to serve its members and not to profit from their needs.  In MABS we are seeing more broadly in the credit market a movement of decision making about credit moving further and further away from the people and the communities concerned.  We also have a concern that big data and data analytics will come to replace rather than reinforce the relationships of measured mutual trust that are a cornerstone of good lending. <br/><br/>We previously highlighted the need for a robust assessment to underpin lending decisions and in that regard we welcome the new credit register, which will come on stream later this year. <br/><br/>In our experience it is borrowers in their mid-years who most often find themselves in financial difficulty and we believe that if a member and their credit union can re-engage on a pragmatic basis during an arrears difficulty, there is scope for long years of highly productive engagement for the future.  More broadly we have a concern about the credit market to the effect that the outsourcing of loan books and of collections to third parties could cause a permanent severing of those important relationships between members and credit unions and could have an adverse impact on credit unions.<br/><br/>We note from the CUAC report that the potential for remuneration of voluntary board members has been mooted by some respondents.  We would be concerned if this added to transaction costs within the movement or indeed displaced the contribution that is currently made by volunteers free of charge. <br/><br/>As regards lending, there is a need for balance in making good lending decisions yet not being so risk-averse that regulatory systems and processes serve to prevent credit unions from granting loans to people who need credit. <br/><br/>The continued prevalence of licensed moneylending in Ireland is symptomatic of a failure to provide attractive, affordable and life-enhancing products and services to low income borrowers.  We would like to highlight the early success of the &quot;It Makes Sense&quot; loan, which is currently being rolled out by more than 100 credit unions.  It is an excellent first step and we are getting lots of positive feedback but it needs to make a much larger and deeper imprint on Irish society to become a competitor product to the doorstep lender.  An important feature of its success is that it is a highly branded loan and such brand recognition is very important.  There is scope within the credit union movement to roll out a core suite of easily recognisable and strongly branded products such as the &quot;It Makes Sense&quot; loan and that would enable it to attract greater market share.The use of the doorstep lender and moneylender is a type of high-cost overdraft which is relied on by low-income borrowers on an ongoing basis.  The view of MABS is that a similar low-cost alternative should be available via the credit union, with borrowers having access to revolving pre-approved credit to a certain limit at an affordable cost.  Obviously regulatory issues would have to be explored.  On a related point, if we are serious about financial inclusion, loans that are successfully repaid to a licensed moneylender should be recorded in the new credit register and thereby enable those clients to have a stepping stone back into mainstream credit provision<br/><br/>I would like to mention our new service, the dedicated mortgage arrears advice service within MABS.  We have already helped 3,000 borrowers who are in late-stage mortgage arrears and 20%<i></i>of these borrowers also owe debts to credit unions.  The casework is often characterised by family tragedy, relationship breakdown, illness and mental health difficulties.  These clients absolutely must prioritise the payment of their home mortgage.  We also recognise that an appropriate balance must be achieved between the legitimate interests of all creditors but that this should be happening at a far earlier stage, well before the point at which the borrower or member is at risk of losing his or her home. <br/><br/><b></b>On insolvency, we believe it is a fact that some loans will never be repaid in full and insolvency is a tool which enables everyone to move on.  MABS has a particular interest in debt relief notices.  The throughput to this solution has been far lower than anybody had anticipated.  Many eligible clients do not proceed because of their allegiance to their credit union and its members.  Others are discouraged because they do not wish to damage their future prospects of borrowing from a credit union as they know what the alternative may be.  That process needs to work much better.<br/><br/>We have a concern also about younger members and the tailoring of credit union products to suit the income patterns of young people.  Their employment can often be fragile and their income unpredictable.  We need a suite of products that suits their needs. <br/><br/><b></b>In terms of<b></b>financial capability, credit unions have a very important role in increasing members&rsquo; understanding of credit union products.  However, information is not enough.  We need to have a capable and financially literate consumer population.<br/><br/>There is a problem with complexity, in MABS's view, which is emerging across a whole range of markets, including utilities, insurance, savings and mortgage markets as competition increases.  This is a wider socio-economic development but it underscores the important role of the credit unions and the lasting relationships it forges with individual members and within their communities. <br/><br/>I would like to raise a concern that is reflected on page 59 of the CUAC report around the future business model for the sector and that there remains considerable ambiguity about business model development within the sector.An element of stasis seems to have set in with regard to the vision for the credit union movement, yet at the same time we are witnessing a proliferation of new entrants to the Irish credit market.<br/><br/>We need a strong, capable credit union sector with a recognisable and accessible service offering that is designed around the needs of its membership, including in particular those on low incomes. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-21a.423" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian McCrory" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017032100002#B00300"><p>I thank members for inviting us here today and for putting credit unions on the agenda of the committee.  We in the Irish League of Credit Unions comprise 390 credit unions from across the entire island of Ireland.  There are 297 credit unions in the Republic of Ireland affiliated to the league and 93 in Northern Ireland.  My background of over 35 years involvement in the credit union movement is in Belfast, with the Belfast Teachers Credit Union, which operates across all of Northern Ireland, and with the SAG Credit Union, which is anchored in the heart of West Belfast.  I am also vice president of the World Council of Credit Unions.  I am accompanied here today by Mr. Ed Farrell, the CEO of the Irish League of Credit Unions.</p> <p>  Before the last general election the league set out a succinct policy programme entitled Six Strategic Steps.  One of those six steps is for credit unions to feature on a recurring basis on the agenda of this committee.</p><p>Credit unions are a vibrant, innovative movement that do a lot now, but critically are positioned to do a lot more for communities and our country.  There is a mismatch between our capacity and willingness on one hand, and the willingness and capacity of those with policy and regulatory responsibility to partner with us.  In seeking to put our business on the committee's agenda, we are looking for champions who will deliver change that will enable credit unions become a much more dynamic force.</p><p> Where credit unions have found partners, we have made progress.  In this regard I positively single out the Department of Social Protection.  Moneylending is a social scourge.  It blights communities and doubles down on the financial exclusion of the poorest.  In partnership with the Department and with MABS, the "It Makes Sense" loan scheme is now being rolled out nationally.  It is making a difference to communities.  It is very much part of our social ethos and we are very proud to be part of that.  Where we can find partners to work with, we have a track record of delivering.</p><p> On the critical issue of funding for social housing, the then Government in its 2014 policy document, Social Housing Strategy 2020, looked to credit unions for funds.  We responded with a very detailed policy paper setting out how that could be delivered in ways that would allow all credit unions to contribute via a centralised vehicle that underpins the credit union ethos and ensures effective regulatory oversight.  The response has been very positive.  Regrettably, several years later the delivery to date has been nil.</p><p> Today's agenda specifically deals with the CUAC report.  This review was set up in response to the league's campaign and the implementation group has been established on foot of the review.  The implementation group has met once.  Effectively its first substantive meeting will be tomorrow.  Its programme of work stretches over months.  We hope this process will deliver substantive policy change that will be mirrored by appropriate regulatory change.  We will be involved in it and we will work hard.  However, we are concerned that this process is as much about time management as change management.  Volunteers in credit unions ask me if this is just another hop on the merry-go-round.</p><p> Credit unions need sustained political support.  We need this committee to pursue credit union issues forensically and continually.  In 2015 we campaigned hard to persuade the Minister for Finance to pause and review before bringing into force the remaining sections of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012, prior to implementation of CP88, the Central Bank's latest regulations.  The Minister, however, would not pause.  The last effective control of the Oireachtas over credit unions was handed over at midnight on New Year's Eve 2015.  Now, we have had a review, followed by an implementation process in circumstances where the capacity of the Department of Finance, via the Central Bank, regarding credit unions is unclear.</p><p> The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government has advised that it is very interested in our proposal on social housing.  Given that the Department elicited it in the first place, it should be.  That Department is in turn in discussion with the Department of Finance, which we are led to believe is in discussion with the Central Bank.  While I have no doubt such conversations are taking place, I doubt whether any action will ever arise as a consequence.</p><p> We have much more to give to communities.  We have resources and have a national network, but we are also challenged.  On the one hand we must develop our business model, and we are rightly reminded of this by the regulatory authority.  However, we are caught in a Bermuda Triangle where we must develop but regulatory approval has not been forthcoming for the changes we wish to adopt.  We receive political encouragement from the Oireachtas that ironically handed over nearly all effective responsibility to the Central Bank.</p><p> There are crying needs in our communities.  The Irish League of Credit Unions has developed a number of policies on how change can come, many of which the committee members will have seen prior to today.  However, change will not happen and credit unions will not realise their potential unless there is sustained political involvement that effectively connects better policy with more appropriate regulation.  Our hope is that today is the beginning of that process, which unlike others, will be short and purposeful.</p></speech>

CUMA is the organisation for senior credit union managers, CEOs, chief financial officers, risk managers, compliance managers etc.  CUMA has been a proactive participant on the commission and the credit union restructuring board.  Our managers have carried much of the burden of change arising from the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 and other legislative requirements.  This transition has come at a time of great upheaval in the economy.  At the same time, credit unions have remained by far the most popular deliverers of service in Ireland.</p> <p>  The most recent statistics in the report, Financial Condition of Credit Unions 2011-2016, show that credit unions have come through that period very well.  In that period average surplus grew from &euro;320,000 to &euro;730,000, average return on assets grew from 0.87% to 1.22%, average arrears fell from 18.15% to 9.69%, and reserves grew from 13.35% to 16.48%.</p> <p>  The credit union sector in future will be a mixture of large credit unions, many with their origins in mergers, and smaller credit unions.  Credit unions will continue to have a vital role in the communities they serve, particularly in light of recent and future bank branch and post office closures.</p> <p>  The CUAC report is timely and accurate.  Attention is drawn to areas that have been ignored to the significant disadvantage of credit unions and of their members.  Tiered regulation, proportionate to the scale and risk in each credit union, has not been delivered.  This was a key deliverable of the commission report.  Consultation and engagement have been less consistent and transparent than was originally envisaged by the commission.  Consultation was expected to be meaningful, with clear impact analysis forming the basis for significant changes.  Where consultation has been triggered, sector views have often been ignored, as was the case with CP88.</p><p> When it comes to engagements between individual credit unions and the Central Bank, service level agreements do not currently exist.  Response times from the Central Bank can be overlong, resulting in indefinite delays around the holding of credit union AGMs and other processes.  Where significant issues arise, the American model of &ldquo;prompt corrective action&rdquo; is preferable to repetitive and expensive studies by various consultancy firms.</p><p> A one-size-fits-all approach to regulatory directives can have very significant adverse impacts on a credit union, both short-term and long-term.  Blanket lending restrictions on credit unions caused a loss of lending relationships for many years, from which we are still suffering.  Restructuring has gone some way to delivering changes necessary to deliver better services.  We acknowledge the work of ReBo, the restructuring board.  However, we now fear that restructuring will stall and we believe the legislative framework for restructuring needs to be revisited.</p><p> Business model development is the responsibility of credit unions.  No other sector is as constrained from innovation as credit unions are under sections 48 to 52 of the Act.  The Central Bank&rsquo;s role should be to have clear frameworks available so development proposals are dealt with in a more structured, timely and appropriate manner.  Statutory Instrument No. 1 of 2016 limits our capacity to develop.  For instance, the hard-coding of a 10% minimum regulatory reserve requirement puts us at a significant disadvantage in regard to banks.  There are significant prescriptions on lending in the instrument, including limits on community lending, commercial lending and mortgage lending.  Meaningful consultation and a regulatory impact analysis in all cases would have made for better regulation and allowed a more varied approach to business model development to take place.</p><p> It is time these many areas and others are addressed.  We look forward to engagement with CUAC and the implementation committee on the issues outlined.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-21a.427" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Johnson" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017032100002#D00200"><p>CUDA is grateful to the committee for inviting us to this meeting.  CUDA was formed in 2003.  It is owned by 12 credit unions and currently has 43 of the most professional and progressive credit unions among its members, which in turn mange one third of the total credit union assets of &euro;16 billion.  Over the past ten years the financial landscape of Ireland has changed dramatically with the collapse, bailout or closure of every single banking institution in Ireland.  It is important to note that of the 420 credit unions that existed in 2007, only two were liquidated and three were subject to directed transfers.  Although any one credit union closed is one too many, the committee will take comfort in the fact this represents some 1% of those which were in operation, with 99% coming through the crisis intact.</p> <p>  In recent years we have become more consolidated, stronger and smarter credit unions.  However, without Oireachtas support to get rules changed to allow credit unions broaden their business, they will not survive.  It will surprise committee members to learn that although this is a success story, the regulation that has come into force over the last decade on savings, loans and payments systems has resulted in credit unions being permitted to do less business now than they could ten years ago.  This is neither proportionate nor fair, and it can only lead to marginalisation of credit unions as an effective force in lending if this is allowed to continue.  We need the help of the Oireachtas to put this right.</p> <p>  The first slide outlines a clear vision that shows credit unions as capable of being the financial hub of their community, offering real choice to people and being a meaningful alternative to banks.  We are doing this by building on the qualities that have made credit unions so successful and earned members' trust and loyalty by being there for them and consistently being on their side, whether they are simply trying to cope with the financial challenges of life or trying to achieve their ambitions for home ownership or financial security.  Unless we are allowed to compete, however, members will continue to be deprived of best value.</p> <p>  The next slide sets out the legal objects of a credit union.  I draw attention to object (b), which refers to the creation of sources of credit, not just personal unsecured loans, for the mutual benefit of its members.  This means that where a credit union can prudently and compliantly provide loans, it will also be able to reward its savers, who are in danger of having their needs overlooked.  It is clear credit unions are about the optimisation of surplus to improve the well-being and spirit of the members and their community, rather than maximisation of profit for a small number of privileged people, as we see in other institutions.</p> <p>  The fourth slide sets out some key figures that demonstrate the success, the financial strength and the popularity of credit unions.  The growth in savings has driven a significant increase in the level of investments, and with credit unions being forced into bank deposits to meet regulatory liquidity requirements, banks now appear to be taking advantage of that situation and charging for such deposits.  This is a very serious threat that needs to be addressed by allowing more lending and wider investment classes for credit unions.</p> <p>  The following slide shows that consumer preference was again evidenced last year, as it was in 2015, through an independent survey of 37,000 customer experiences where people recognised that credit unions provide the best customer experience across all industries in Ireland.  Other research has also demonstrated that people would like to see credit unions provide more services.  We want to do this to ensure people get what they need when they need it and how they need it, and in a fair and equitable way.</p> <p>  At CUDA we have made real progress in helping credit unions strengthen their governance by complying with the absolute barrage of new legislation and regulation while they also continue to provide services, albeit within the 2016 regulations that impose severe caps on the levels of business that can be done.  Our work through the solutions centre includes supporting credit unions to provide home loans to their members in a fully compliant and prudent manner, something that those who are building such capabilities should be allowed to do more of.  However, credit unions need the help of the Oireachtas Members.  There is a wonderful opportunity for Oireachtas Members to enable credit unions to contribute to solving the housing crisis.  They collectively have the power to make a simple amendment to the Credit Union Act 1997 that will enable credit unions to collectively lend to approved housing bodies and local authorities for social and affordable housing projects, as set out in slide No. 7.  They can urge the Central Bank authorities to substantially extend lending limits where capabilities and financial strength exist, given short-term lending alone is inadequate for their survival.  They can also urge them to enhance the classes of investments; for example, we submitted draft regulations, as set out in slides Nos. 8 and 9, to allow credit unions to invest in funds for housing-related purposes.  The third way Members can help us is by keeping credit unions on their agenda.  The CUAC review and the findings in its report, as set out in slide No. 10, are simply a reflection of the regulatory failure to implement these issues as recommended by the Commission of Credit Unions in the first place.  Members should remember that their involvement clearly drives action.</p> <p>  In conclusion, the effect of the new regulatory rules without proportionality relegates credit unions to compete in less than 10% of the Irish credit market.  Yet, we have the capital, competency and community from which we can compete on a fair playing pitch with other lenders.  The effect of existing rules is like asking us to win an all-Ireland while marginalising our team to staying inside its square, and at the same time allowing competitors free rein over the remaining 90% of the pitch.  The outcome of such actions will be plain for all to see.  As we meet these needs, we need to broaden our range of lending options by way of loan periods and rates.  To do this we seek to work co-operatively with the Oireachtas and with regulators on behalf of all in this State.  This is community building, state building and fairness in action, nothing more.  We need the assistance of the Oireachtas to mobilise efforts to do this work immediately and, in doing so, this will allow credit unions to help families finance their homes, improve their lives and breathe life back into their communities.</p></speech>

As funds come into the credit union, it can lend them out or invest them.  Due to the very strict liquidity requirements and the very restrictive classes of investments, it effectively means putting it on deposit.  One bank announced in early January that it was going to apply a negative rate, in other words, it was going to charge credit unions 0.25% for the privilege of keeping their funds there.  That was rapidly followed by another large bank, a State-owned one, that increased that to a negative 40 basis points.  Between that and the withdrawal of some of the banks from the market, it is a serious compression on the counter parties available to credit unions.  Unless we get the rules changed and allow credit unions to compete and offer more services, their options about what to do with that money are seriously compressed.</p></speech>

Typically, the money would have been on deposit with the local bank.  That was the traditional model as I understood it and I have been a member of a credit union for virtually my entire adult life.  I want to tease out the practicalities.  Could Mr. Molan tease out what happens if someone comes into a credit union with &euro;10,000 they inherited or in savings?  I want to understand the implications of that for the capacity of the credit union to function and lend money.  Could Mr. Molan distill it down because it may be a bit abstract for some people?</p></speech>

A 10% reserve requirement is imposed on credit unions.  This has a significant cost at this stage.  That reserve requirement has been hard coded under SI No. 1 of 2016.  We have no option but to meet those reserve requirements and if a credit union falls below them, it is in trouble with the regulator.  If it falls sufficiently low, it is in severe difficulty.  This is an actual cost that is visited upon a credit union.  Many members have a preference and such is the popularity of credit unions that many members see it as their primary savings institution.  Again, because of the local nature of credit unions, it is a significant factor for them.  My colleague from MABS spoke about social inclusion.  At present, a significant number of people in this country are unbanked and a significant number of people in this country have a preference-----</p></speech>

The bottom line is that a number of credit unions have taken a decision to put a cap on savings inflow for prudential reasons.

It is not a case of refusing savings from any individual member.  The sad part of it is that it is reflective of the restrictive nature of the credit union that it cannot utilise those funds in a prudent and provident manner.  We mentioned the ability to lend for housing projects earlier.  If we had that simple amendment either to the class of investment or indeed to the Credit Union Act, the funds would be welcomed and members of credit unions would be delighted to see their savings put to very prudent and provident use.</p></speech>

If it is taking in money, it is taking in stock.  Unless that stock is going out the front door in some shape or form, there is no point in continuing to stock the shop.  It then takes the prudential decision to stop buying the stock until it can deal effectively with what it already has.  Through restrictions on who they can lend money to, the amount, the nature of the person, etc., credit union lending has deteriorated over a number of years since 2015 because of an edict from the Central Bank as to the circumstances in which a credit union can lend money to an individual.  There is a direct correlation between the decline in lending and that.</p> <p>  As Mr. Johnson also said, it is about the opportunity to be able to invest funds in other programmes that can earn a social dividend and a capital dividend for the credit union and the community at large.  Those opportunities are denied to us.  We are forced to become wholesale collection agencies for banks to have our moneys on deposit.  The people who benefit from that are the banks, not the community and not the citizens of this country who have amassed billions that are sitting on deposit.  </p></speech>

If they take in an extra &euro;10,000, an extra &euro;1,000 has to be reserve capitalised by the credit union.  Their own earnings are their only form of capital.  They are not allowed to inter-bank borrow, borrow on markets or issue bonds.  It is a full asset.  There is no risk rating.  Our capital regime is much higher of a requirement than the banking one would be so we have to have a 10% reserve on our total assets.  The banks have to have a 10% reserve on a risk weighting of their assets, which in effect would probably be about half our capital requirement.  In terms of the extra moneys, which we are only going to take in from the people as the bank branches close in the towns, if we are going to put it on deposit with a pillar bank or into a Government bond, why make us have a 10% capital reserve requirement on it?  The money is going into a risk free environment so we could mind the money for the people at a very small or zero interest rate, and they understand the interest rates as well - if that much greater capital requirement was not on us and the money it is going into is risk free.  We could mind the money.  We would not make money on it but at least it would stop the people having to go elsewhere, which goes against our grain, and theirs.</p></speech>

The Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU, summed it up as being a mismatch between what they are willing and able to do and the capacity of the policy makers and the regulators to match that willingness.  The committee will hear from the Department and the regulator on Thursday and we know they will speak about their responsibility to ensure the prudent management of the sector to protect members.  Do the witnesses believe this is what they are really concerned about or do they believe they are pursuing a wider policy goal?  Are the actions of the Department and the Central Bank compatible with their members' vision of a modern credit union sector?  What needs to be changed on their side?  Do they believe their side has made the changes necessary to adapt to the demands of the credit union sector in 2017?  Do they have confidence in the Central Bank and the Department as partners going forward or do they believe we need to examine the entire regulatory structure?  There is a lot being sought in those questions but I ask the witnesses to comment on them.</p></speech>

On social housing, we gave an example, albeit it was Government policy, of an ask from Government for credit union funding to be made available for social housing and a willingness on our behalf to engage with that.  It was the 2014 report to which the president referred.  Almost three years later, we are frustrated at the lack of a way of getting that done.  We need the Departments of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and Finance, the Central Bank and the various arms of the State to figure out a way to get this social housing proposal done, which is Government policy.  The credit unions have stepped up to the plate, as it were.  Many regulatory requirements were placed on credit unions in the 2012 legislation following the commission report and everyone acknowledges, including the CUAC report from last July, that the governance regime in credit unions in Ireland now is as good as it is in any credit union movement anywhere in the world.  Credit unions have stood up but to go back to Mr. Johnson's point on the investments and the lending side of the equation, the rules behind the business side of the house and the balance sheets have not been moved in the expected manner.  There is a huge degree of frustration among credit union people about that.  They have done the hard work.  At all times we encouraged the arms of the State to get together to find the channels and unlock any blockages to get these very important projects for the people of Ireland moving across the line.</p></speech>

That is why we had the review published last June.  Do the witnesses believe the review's recommendations to set up the implementation body might have been an error as they allowed the Government and the Central Bank to stall on any other recommendations until it was set up, which as we know is happening now, nine months after it was published?

When the Senator says that the report of 2012 is largely unimplemented, that is not necessarily accurate.  Our concern and frustration is that all the parts of it that related to the governance and prudential rules were implemented.  What heightens our frustration is that prior to the commission report credit unions could do more for their members in their community than they can today.</p><p>What we are looking for is that <i>quid pro quo</i>.  The strength and governance is all in place and credit unions have embraced that.  It has not been easy because implementation continues to be challenging and expensive.  It heightens the cost of delivering a service to members.<br/><br/>On the other side of it are items such as the full review of lending limits.  Instead of that taking place, we got another layer of limits, by category, imposed on us and fewer options on investments.  I commend the credit union advisory committee, CUAC, for its honest report and for highlighting the seven areas which were not implemented.  It is not a matter of cherry-picking one or two of them.  There are a suite of changes that need to take place.<br/><br/>We are all conscious, not just the Central Bank, of protecting members&rsquo; savings.  It is constantly put to us as if the credit unions were not aware of that.  Of course we are aware of it.  That is our primary objective.  It is all about the prudent and provident use of those savings for the betterment of the whole community.  I would not pick one particular recommendation.  The CUAC and the implementation group have to get on with dealing with those outstanding issues and ensuring that they are all implemented this time.  As I said in the opening statement, it only exists because they were not implemented the first time.  That is why we ask the committee to keep credit unions firmly on its agenda.  We would love the committee to play a monitoring role to ensure these things happen properly.</p></speech>

Coming from a rural community, I know the role they play in tackling social inclusion, addressing poverty and many other issues that affect communities.

If credit unions are allowed to fulfil their true potential in rural, as well as urban, communities, we all will have a lot to gain.</p></speech>

I am trying to reconcile the gap between the Central Bank, the Department of Finance and the individual member of a credit union, as represented by these groups today.  If I start with Consultation Paper 76 - or CP76 - my understanding was that the representative organisations made specific proposals on tiered regulation.  I note the point made by Mr. Tim Molan of CUMA earlier:</p><blockquote>Tiered regulation, proportionate to the scale and risk in each credit union, has not been delivered.  This was a key deliverable of the commission report.  Consultation and engagement have been less consistent and transparent than was originally envisaged &hellip;  Where consultation has been triggered, sector views have often been ignored, as was the case with CP88.</blockquote> <p>I want to drill further into that dynamic.  I read the speech by the Registrar of Credit Unions to the CUMA spring conference.  Objectively, one would think that, from a regulatory point of view, the issues raised by her in that speech seem to apply to many credit unions.  If there are still outliers in the system that are not ticking all the regulatory boxes from a legislative point of view, should they be dealt in one parcel, while those credit unions, whether they are large or involved in the hub-and-spoke model, are allowed to progress into areas such as payment accounts, debit cards, longer term lending and investment in social housing?  Is it the case that the Central Bank is trying to apply a one-size-fits-all approach?  If that is the case, will that hamper the ability of the credit union movement to progress in lending for productive, social and other purposes?</p></speech>

At the time, the commission envisaged a three-tier regulatory approach.  In CP76, issued by the Central Bank in late 2013, a two-tiered regulatory approach was proposed.  The tiers were supposed to be around the level of risk and complexity that would be involved.  All three representative associations were in favour of a tiered approach to regulation.  It never happened, however.  That is part and parcel of why, for instance, this CUAC report is being debated.  Generally, there are several downsides to the one-size-fits-all approach.  First, it overburdens the small credit unions, and, second, it restricts the ability of the larger credit unions to innovate.  Innovation is absolutely key to the future for us.  The whole area of tiered regulation has to be addressed by this committee.  Other than that, we are just going to stagnate.</p></speech>

I read her speech to the CUMA conference in which she addressed issues such as everyday payment accounts.  She stated:</p><blockquote>[T]he market is not large enough to support multiple offerings of the same products and services, but that limit is not one confined to one service model.  So far, we have not received any formal applications beyond MPCAS, although our sectoral engagement suggests that this is an area of active interest.</blockquote> <p>If the credit union movement is talking about innovating and the potential for payment accounts, how does that work its way through the system?  What does that mean from the credit union movement's perspective?</p></speech>

The regulator should be there to regulate - full stop.  If one considers how the system is currently constituted, the regulator essentially dictates who is in the chair, who will manage, who might be on the board, to whom one can lend, the amount one can lend, the reasons for which one can lend, the duration of one's investment, the nature of one's investment and the amount one has on call by way of cash.  We proudly espouse our status as a democratic movement.  This has essentially been stolen from members because that democracy no longer exists.  We do not even have the wherewithal or the freedom to call an AGM or a meeting of our members because the bank can decide not to allow us to do so.</p></speech>

We are trying to get a better understanding of this.  As I said, it is still about the gaps that exist.  Mr. McCrory has already articulated a gap in respect of CP88 and spoken about the indefinite delays in the holding of AGMs.  What the average member wants to know is why this is the case.  How do we close this gap?  The theme of the registrar's speech was &quot;Mind the Gap&quot;.  She referred to:</p><blockquote>- Your current v. your needed level of regulatory compliance.  Given some of the issues we have found in recent supervisory engagements, I could characterize this as &quot;Mind the basics&quot;, and<br /><br />- the sector's current business model and capability, and the ambitious proposed or evolving business models, which often carry very much different risks and capabilities.</blockquote> <p>There is then still a massive gap between how the registrar perceives the Credit Union Managers Association and how the organisation perceives itself.  Somewhere in between, we are trying to see if we can broker or mediate that gap, and in broad terms there seems to be a long way to go.  On the face of it, the registrar seems, if I am reading the speech correctly, to put a major limit on the issue of the payment accounts and debit cards.  She seems to suggest a major curbing of one's enthusiasm, for want of a better expression, in respect of long-term lending.  She is very reticent, if I interpret her correctly - and she will have a chance to respond to these comments on Thursday - on the investment in social housing.</p><p>In addition, I have a difficulty understanding the issues regarding section 35.  No review has yet been undertaken, even though we are technically out of recession, on the section 35 rescheduling restrictions because individual impacted members - and this is based on anecdotal evidence - are back in work and have continuing borrowing requirements in excess of the emergency amounts allowed under the regulations.  Again, the question on my mind is whether it takes a legislative change to amend this or whether a cultural change is needed within the Central Bank to broker that.  I hope that makes sense.</p></speech>

Moving away from prudential and regulatory matters, the gap, as we perceive it, is between what the members need and what the credit unions can provide.  That is the biggest and most important gap.  As we are aware, nature abhors a vacuum, and when that gap exists, our concern is that others will enter the market, and others have been entering the market.  As we perceive it from the outside, there are fewer constraints on those new entrants to the market than exist on the credit unions.  We have a concern about section 35, which we have mentioned.  We are all living longer and we all work longer.  Long-term lending, therefore, needs to match these requirements.  That is a big issue for us.  We know there have been amalgamations in the credit union sector but the credit unions have long-lived relationships with their communities, and we are concerned that some of the new entrants do not have such long-lived relationships with borrowers.  People are therefore experiencing a real gap day by day in what they need from credit unions.</p></speech>

These matters of proportionality and regulations that match the nature, scale and complexity of the individual credit union are set out in the legislation.

That attitude has deteriorated over the years since the Central Bank took over the regulation of the credit union movement.  There are thousands of volunteers and staff in credit unions working hard every day to keep their 3 million members serviced well.  All these regulatory and governance improvements have been made since the 2012 Act, yet this is the thanks or the praise we get.  Also frustrating is that all during the CP88 campaign, all the representative bodies went to long yards to stress that the Central Bank had said the current business model is broken and not viable.  However, not only do the CP88 rules not allow enhancement to business and services, but they actually reduce and restrict the investments and lending, as we said earlier.  We therefore all agreed we would have to do new things, yet the new rules allowed less than the current rules, and certainly not new things.</p></speech>

The Central Bank is often keen to quote international comparisons.  The reality is that many of the international movements were created on the basis and experience of the Irish movement; the sad reality is that they have been allowed to pass us at speed.</p><p>One third of their book is SME lending, one third of it may well be unsecured personal lending and the other third is either in the form of supporting social housing or other social objectives.  The credit union movement in Ireland has been curtailed from evolving.  It is not that long ago since the Minister for Finance stood up in the House and said that he foresaw a time when the credit union movement would be the third pillar of financial institutions on the island of Ireland, but I have yet to see action that would enable that to happen.</p></speech>

Much of what happened in the North by way of decline has been caused by uncertainty, that is, economic uncertainty, the fragility of the market and at one stage there was the threat of the withdrawal of British Government funding.  Much of the North's employment base is, essentially, Government-funded.  Had that funding gone, peoples' job security and associated securities would have disappeared with it.  There was a reluctance to borrow, and following the financial crisis, there was a tendency for people to consolidate their household moneys and to reduce their outgoings.  Given the current uncertainties over Brexit, that is unlikely to change any time soon.</p></speech>

They would be very modest dividends because the European Central Bank rate is zero, but most credit unions would be paying modest dividends linked to the ECB rate of less than 0.5%.  The imposition of DIRT takes half of that away, so one is talking about half of half of one per cent.</p></speech>

However, one must bear in mind that there are attendant benefits <i>in situ</i>for credit union members that have not been expanded upon.  For example, in the ILCU and some other credit unions, members' debts die with them.  Savings are doubled on death, and in the ILCU, in the event of accidental death, savings are trebled.  The credit union provides a death benefit grant in many instances.  These are not benefits that one will find in any other lending institution but they are part of our operating costs.  Those costs are not borne by the members</p></speech>

I do not want this to be seen as only an issue for the Central Bank.  Legislative change can be made to allow credit unions collectively to lend for housing projects and that is completely within the remit of the Houses of the Oireachtas.

When others appear, the rhetoric is that they are simply trying to protect members' savings and that we are not trying to do that.  On the contrary, we are there, first and foremost, to protect members' savings.  We try to afford members the opportunity to reinvest their money in their local communities, whether through social housing, SME lending or some other way to empower the community, such as unsecured personal landing.  Such people are not being afforded that opportunity and there needs to be radical change in the mindsets of the people who regulate and govern.</p></speech>

Lending limits were embedded in section 35 of the 1997 Act but this was replaced by a provision giving the regulator the authority to set the limits.  In the commission report, the expectation was that in transferring that authority from legislation into regulation there would be a thorough review and that under the tiered regime some credit unions would be allowed to do more.  In fact, the existing term rules found their way into the regulations and concentration limits, based on different categories of loans, were placed on top of them.  A lot of these rules resided in the legislation but are now the remit of the regulator.</p></speech>

A lot of action and work were promised and the Department of Finance, the Department of the Environment and the Central Bank were engaged to push on with social housing following requests by Independent Deputies who were in talks about the formation of a Government at the time.  Despite the urgency of that time and meetings of those three bodies with the credit union movement, almost a year later no credit union money is being put to use for social housing.  Since then the Central Bank has said that consultation would have to be done in any event and that, even if it wanted to, it could take between six and 21 months to change the rules.</p> <p>  Each of the representative bodies meet the Central Bank on a regular basis, though we do not meet the Department of Finance as regularly as we should or would like to.  We pushed very hard for the Minister and the Government not to take the rules out of the legislation because we feared the Central Bank would be more rigid once the rules were taken away from the control of the Oireachtas.  During the work of the commission in 2011 and 2012, the thinking was that the rules would be less rigid because they would not require Acts of the Oireachtas to change small operational details relating to credit unions.  However, it is actually more straitjacketed now. </p></speech>

I am sorry but Mr. McCrory should tarnish someone with the brush because we are here and listening to the submission he is making.  Mr. McCrory said in his opening statement that he is searching for champions.  I do not believe there is anyone in the Houses who would speak against a credit union.  I am a member of a credit union and many Members right across the political divides are members of credit unions.  We support the credit unions.  I want to see the credit unions allowed to be developed but when we meet with the other side of this argument on Thursday, we want to have all the specifics on this subject.  It is either a case that regulation within the Central Bank and its response to the Irish League of Credit Unions is just not up to it or it is the case that the legislation in its entirety needs to be re-examined and amended.  One cannot help but note from Mr. McCrory's contribution the frustration and, at times, anger over the fact that credit unions do not have somebody to champion their cause and we note his reference to the poor response from the Government, particularly, in the example given by Mr. McCrory, with regard to the housing strategy.  My answer is that within the House and among its Members, the credit unions would have the greatest of respect.  I can point to my own constituency and county and say that St. Canice's Credit Union is a magnificent example for anyone to follow.  It has helped those who were in debt to moneylenders. It has helped with the local enterprise board in supporting business and helped some of us with regard to election campaigns.  A credit union is an essential element in the make-up of any community.  I know from listening to the committee members' questions that they want to support what the Irish League of Credit Unions is doing.  The fact is that credit unions have champions.  Within this committee there would be an agreement to continue to champion and highlight the issues that concern credit union representatives to drive on the change and reform the Irish League of Credit Unions believes is necessary.  I am taken aback at the lack of exchange by those who hold the reins, be it on the Department's side or the regulatory side, and that they do not see the value and do not engage sufficiently well to allow credit unions to perform to the full extent in the marketplace.  If that is the case then we must go back to identify where the problem lies.  We must first identify it and address, as parliamentarians, what appears to me to be a highly disrespectful approach by the regulator to the credit unions.  This is how it appears to me.  There is also a misunderstanding or lack of understanding about the role credit unions play - and are trying to play in an extended role - in the community, which is a positive for community development.  That must be addressed.  Mr. McCrory spoke of the housing investment.  What kind of money are we talking about?  If he was asked to invest in the morning what money would credit unions make available?</p></speech>

That figure would have increased substantially.  Credit unions want to play a part in developing, supporting and contributing to their communities.  Part of that will be social housing.  We are not talking about putting all the eggs in one basket.  It will be part of a range of activities in which they want to be involved.  To preclude credit unions from that-----</p></speech>

The Credit Union Development Association has a lot of engagement with the registrar, as do the Irish League of Credit Unions and the Credit Union Managers Association, and it is quite a professional relationship.  There are a lot of good people trying to do their best.  This is why it really makes one challenge and question where is the logjam.  The Central Bank published information in the last few weeks which highlighted its own concerns around the future viability of credit unions.  The Central Bank is very conscious of the financial strains coming down the tracks but at the same time, we do not seem to be able to figure out how to relax these rules to allow credit unions to prudently use the funds and the strength they currently have.  The time to act in this regard is now, while we have the strength.  We need to look at the structure within the Central Bank and we need to look at how the registrar is positioned within the Central Bank.  Increasingly, we are finding that regulations that are appropriate for other types of institutions are coming our way.  We have to be conscious of the uniqueness of the credit union sector and it is something that must be preserved in all of this.  All we have sought in recent engagements, including in engagements with the deputy governor, is greater transparency around the Central Bank's expectations of what it wants us to deliver.  In public speeches we constantly hear about the poor quality of proposals or the lack of proposals, but as Mr. McCrory has said, it would certainly help us if we could have greater transparency around the expectation of what those proposals should be like.  If the proposals do fall short of expectation then what is required of us to bring it up and turn a "No" into a "Yes"?</p></speech>

I got to hear most of the their contributions and to study them in advance of their attending.  The league is focusing mainly on the Republic aspect.  There are 297 credit unions within the Republic.  We were saying one size does not fit all.  Are there bands of credit unions?  Are there ten or 20 that are huge and 80 that are minute?

There have been approximately 100 mergers or transfers of engagements.  There were approximately 400 credit unions but there are now 300 approximately.  As I stated, that has resulted in a smaller number of much bigger credit unions in addition to a number of smaller credit unions.  There are approximately 50 credit unions with a balance sheet of more than &euro;100 million.  They comprise roughly 50% of the total number in euro and assets.  The Central Bank of Ireland has three asset bands, namely, under &euro;25 million, between &euro;25 million and &euro;100 million, and more than &euro;100 million.  By and large, those in the latter category have taken over credit unions in the past three years under the restructuring project.</p></speech>

During the restructuring in the past couple of years, credit unions in that band felt a lot of pressure to merge with a bigger neighbour.  Now that band is for assets worth under &euro;25 million.  Those in it fear there will be pressure put on them to continue.  We are all in favour of full voluntary transfers of engagements, whereby the board of the smaller credit union, perhaps in the village or smaller town, voluntarily engages with the county town credit union or a bigger credit union that is reasonably close geographically.  If it is a matter of two voluntary boards of directors coming to a good conclusion to the joint benefit of all their members, we are all in favour of it.  We do not like to see undue pressure being exerted just because of the size of the balance sheet.</p></speech>

One might cynically ask whether one should create a bigger entity simply to sustain the burden of the regulatory cost that has emerged in recent years.  The regulatory cost is a considerable burden for many credit unions.  It effectively takes money from members' pockets.  Credit unions are not against proportionate and relevant regulation but what they are challenged with is a costly exercise.  I refer to the creation of the number of statutory instruments that require credit unions to contribute to funds that require efficiencies of scale.  This has made some credit unions feel compelled to jump.  There may not necessarily have been a very sound underpinning business reason in some mergers.  In other cases, there might have been compelling reasons.  That is fine but the idea that the creation of economies of scale somehow achieves a better outcome is questionable.</p></speech>

The rules state every credit union must have a risk officer, risk committee, compliance officer, compliance committee and an internal audit function.  The external audit function was always in place.  A credit union must have a board of directors and board oversight committee.  There are six or seven layers of checks and balances.  With the absence of tiering, the smallest or simplest credit unions are subject to the same requirements as the largest.  Some of the bigger credit unions might have a simple business model.  We are not necessarily saying it a case of the smaller versus the bigger.  The one-size-fits-all-regulatory burden has been imposed and there is a cost to implementing those systems.  As Mr. McCrory stated, when the Government talked about the big hole in the credit unions, it created funds, and the credit unions are levied every year to put money into them although the money was already in the movement.  Some &euro;20 million or &euro;25 million per year is going into three or four of these key funds.  It represents approximately 20% of credit unions' income.  The funds are not needed.  The rainy day has passed, as it were.</p> <p>  Without giving too much detail, one of those funds was the credit institutions resolution fund.  It was set up for four years and it was to have &euro;100 million after that period.  The banks were to pay in &euro;17 million, the credit unions were to pay in &euro;7 million and what I call the IFSC companies were to pay in &euro;1 million.  Therefore, &euro;25 million per year was to go in for four years.</p><p>The four years have passed.  We have been asking the Central Bank and the Department of Finance if that is the end of it.  It was a four-year fund.  Is that the end of our levy going into that fund?  Before they answered us, they took a fifth year&rsquo;s levy into a four-year fund and we still cannot get an answer.  One is pushing it to the other and we are not able to tell our credit unions if the fifth of four is the last one or if there will be six or seven or four.</p><p> At the same time, they commenced another fund, the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Fund.  We got reassurances in November.  Last May we had been expecting it by year-end.  We got reassurances in November it was not current, but in less than a month invoices for &euro;12 million went out to credit unions after we had been reassured a month earlier it was not current.  That &euro;12 million and &euro;7 million gives a total of &euro;19 million in levies that went out in December.  The &euro;7 million is the fifth year of four and the &euro;12 million we were told was not imminent.  It is 20% of the credit unions' income and the income is under pressure because of the interest-rate cycle we have been talking about.</p></speech>

The deposit guarantee scheme exists throughout Europe and Ireland for every bank, building society and credit union.  If one of them fails, the money comes from that scheme.  This resolution fund was set up and has not really been used.  A stabilisation one has been set up and it is only for credit unions within a very small bracket.  It has not been used yet and I do not think there is any real expectation that it will be used.  It was a sledgehammer to crack a nut to set up these multi-million funds.  Despite the movement maintaining there would be no contagion and that the credit unions would be able to handle it themselves, the money is being taken out of the credit union movement.  We cannot even plan ahead; the individual credit unions cannot even plan in their cashflows because we cannot even get answers as to when some of these are ending or being reviewed.</p></speech>

The discussion on what is going on in the credit unions has gone on for some time.  The CUAC report sets out clearly what has been achieved in terms of the commission's recommendations.  What has been achieved is hugely significant.  The financial inclusion side seems to be lacking.  Listening to some of the dialogue there is frustration over a credit union movement that in part cannot borrow and also people cannot save in it.  Where will that end up particularly for people who want to have that service available in their local community?  I am concerned at the potential for people to drift out of this model now.  The old supports that were once there for many people are not facilitated by the regulatory model.  We have an opportunity now; we have a very well structured movement.  It is time to put some of those arguments to bed and for the credit union movement to have a vision that supports its membership and indeed new members.</p></speech>

The Chairman alluded to the idea of champions and so on.  Most members, not just in this committee but Members of the Houses, have been supportive of the credit union movement over the years.  One of the positive points about financial inclusion is the aspect of the "It Makes Sense" loan scheme in co-operation with the Department of Social Protection and MABS.  I ask Ms O'Connor to elaborate on that and how it takes over from some of the licensed moneylenders and so on.</p></speech>

It is currently available through 100 credit unions.  It came from a pilot project and is now almost a mainstream product across the movement.  It targets low-income borrowers.  There is a link through the household budget scheme.  Borrowers can repay from their social welfare payments where it is linked through the household budget scheme.  That provides a degree of reassurance over the repayment of the loan.  In our experience of our clients who have accessed it, it is very effective for those clients who were thinking about taking a loan from the doorstep lender or the licensed moneylender.  This is a viable alternative for them; there are thresholds on the loan value and so on.  We believe it is a product that offers an alternative to that.  Given the amount of money credit unions have and given that moneylenders have a client base of I believe 300,000 clients, we wonder what more we can we do now.  We have to make this loan and products like it much more widely available to low-income borrowers because those borrowers are simply not attractive to the high street, mainstream-----</p></speech>

As Ms O'Connor said, it was a multi-stakeholder group so the representative bodies of the credit unions, Citizens Information Board and the Department of Social Protection were involved.  In his opening address, Mr. McCrory gave it as an example of how we can make a great success of something where we find willing partners.  It was done with the Department of Social Protection and the Citizens Information Board under the former Minister of State, Senator Humphreys, and the then senior Minister, Deputy Burton.  Even more recently we had a very positive meeting with the current Minister, Deputy Varadkar, as we were moving from a pilot to the nationwide roll-out.</p> <p>  We have 100 credit unions covering more or less every county.  The geographical base would be large because the larger towns' credit unions would cover a lot of a county and the people working or living in that hinterland can be a member of the credit union.</p><p>A larger than normal provisioning requirement for the pilot was agreed to by the multi-stakeholder group.  The good news was that when the pilot was finished it was agreed by all, and the Central Bank is on that stakeholder group, that the arrears were not at a level that required it.  I believe it is running at only approximately 2% arrears.  The people who have been dogged by the moneylenders are very happy to be able to get back in.  The credit unions had almost been afraid to lend to them due to the restrictions and whatnot that had been on them.  Everybody is happy to get back in.</p><p> The credit unions are not making any money out of it.  By law, credit unions cannot charge more than 12% interest, whereas moneylenders are allowed to charge percentage rates in the hundreds.  There are numerous reports on the unfairness of that.  We have a close relationship with English credit unions and they are allowed to charge 3% per month, which is 36% to 40% APR for that type of payday, as they call it in England, or small lending in that moneylending space.  They can charge far more.  That is mentioned in the CUAC report.  The maximum interest rate of 12% was probably okay 20 or 30 years ago but there is a need to look at that again.  We could do a very good social job by helping these people move away from the moneylenders, but at more than 12% we could make a few bob on it as well so it would be a win-win situation for everybody.</p></speech>

The average loan has been approximately &euro;500 so the loan for the year will generate less than &euro;50 in interest, whereas for the moneylender it is &euro;150 in interest.  There is a burden in collecting any loan.  Certainly, credit unions stood up to the plate.

If the credit union is to do more to deliver this social benefit this is where the balance is critical, to get the economic return to be able to do more and deliver more of the social benefits.  One can see why the business model must evolve so that the less fortunate can benefit more from the credit union, as well as those who are fortunate.  The credit union is there for all.  The more we can do, the more good work we can do.</p></speech>

I will ask my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, to speak shortly, but there is a fairly united message from all of our guests to the effect that they are frustrated with the system as it is.  They are being encouraged to contemplate doing certain things but when they try to do them, there appears to be a barrier or a wall of silence.  I am not sure what it is, so perhaps on Thursday we will ask those questions, on their and our behalf, as to why some of the progress has not been made.  It is almost frightening to think that the implementation group of the CUAC has met only once since that report emerged.</p></speech>

I had to cover for the party leader in the Chamber this afternoon.  There is nothing worse than somebody arriving late, repeating many of the points that have been made and asking the same questions, so I will make a couple of observations and put one question.  The question will be on the recommendations the witnesses would like the committee to make.  When I suggested to the Chairman that we hold these hearings, it was with a view to the committee, on an all-party basis and including members of no party, collectively making recommendations to the Oireachtas and the Government that might make a difference.  It is not about a long wish list but about the priority areas where we could make meaningful changes.  That will be my question presently for each of the witnesses.</p><p>The frustration coming across is palpable, but there is also an honesty that is welcome.  When we consider what has happened over the last number of years in the approach to regulation and so forth we should also recall the context.  In October 2011, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, was obviously advised by somebody to tell the Seanad that the cost of rescuing credit unions would probably be over &euro;500 million and might be up to &euro;1 billion.  That was the thinking and the context.  Somebody advised him that this was the likely scenario for credit unions.  It was very wide of the mark.  A small number of individual credit unions got into difficulty and did not have good practices.  Everybody must acknowledge that.  However, I have gone through the numbers and when one takes into account the various levies that have been paid into the different funds, the net cost is negligible.  It is a net cost to the State of a few million euro to support the movement.  There was a real suspicion within the system as to what credit unions were doing and how healthy or unhealthy they were and that informed the approach of the Central Bank in particular to the credit union movement.  That is my understanding of it, and I could be wrong.  However, I believe there was a feeling that the movement was in far worse shape than it transpired was the case when the deep-dive assessment was carried out.</p><p>The failure to implement the tiered approach to regulation was a travesty and a betrayal.  All of the changes that were introduced were supposed to be in the context of the tiered approach.  If that approach had been the overarching strategy within which all the other changes to regulation occurred, it would not have been anywhere near as bad as it has turned out to be for credit unions.  The CUAC report of last June was refreshing and straightforward.  It contained many interesting items.  One that struck me was the following statement:</p><blockquote>The loan to asset ratio has fallen steadily in recent years to a present level of 26% which is a cause of deep concern.  There are only 5 countries out of 105 with credit union movements, which have a loan to asset ratio inferior to that in Ireland.  A further major issue for the credit union loan books is that over the period there has been a significant shift away from larger value, longer duration loans to smaller value, shorter duration loans.  Both trends raise fundamental questions around the credit union business model(s).</blockquote> <p>The main recommendation of the report was that there should be an implementation group to oversee the implementation of its recommendations.  However, it took eight months for that group to meet.  That says it all about the lack of priority afforded to the movement.</p><p>We are here to try to make a difference.  We will be meeting with the Department and the registrar.  What would each of the witnesses like us to recommend?  There are many issues involved, including the restrictions on where credit unions can place their investments, the different types of lending restrictions, the longer term restrictions, the issue of the reserves, the difficulty in getting sanction for new services and the issue of lending to approved housing bodies and local authorities and legislation to address that.  What can we usefully do?  At the end of this process, I hope the committee will agree unanimously on a report, which will go to the Oireachtas for debate and to the Minister for Finance for implementation.  If it requires legislation, which I expect it will, so be it.  We can do that.  If the witnesses would state the key items they would like the committee to recommend after we have had our engagement on Thursday, that would be very helpful.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-21a.637" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Annmarie O'Connor" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017032100002#P00100"><p>Our emphasis is on financial inclusion.  In terms of the regulatory issues, the review of section 35 and the capacity for long-term lending is important.  I also want to reiterate the importance of the personal micro finance loan, the "It Makes Sense" loan.  When I look across at the UK, much research has gone into this area and many actual bodies have been set up by industry to examine responsible credit.  There is no such analogous organisation here independent of the credit union movement.  We have no real think tank on credit.  Organisations such as ourselves can make inputs.  Organisations such as the Social Finance Foundation have provided research for the credit unions on the "It Makes Sense" loans.  There is no independent think tank, however, looking at building financially healthy communities in Ireland which is happening in the UK as part of the recovery.  There is this gap and there is in-thinking.  We need new thinking if we need to get innovation in the sector.  We need to ask those most in need of the support the credit unions can provide about they want for the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-21a.638" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian McCrory" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017032100002#P00200"><p>Part of what needs to be changed does not require legislative change but a change in mindset.  They very same people advising the Minister in 2011 are the same advising him now and those attitudes still prevail.  There is still an undercurrent of suspicion that there is something radically wrong with credit unions.  I am not saying there are no flaws or issues which need to be addressed or that there have not been problems.  In every instance, despite a suggestion by the regulatory authority at one time, credit unions which found themselves temporarily in difficulty have traded their way out of it.  At one point the advice to the Minister was that they should be shut.  The consequences for society of such an action would have been dire.  There must be a change, whether it be legislative or regulatory, that will allow credit unions to invest their collective moneys in the citizens of this State, whether it be for social housing, SMEs or other purposes.  There needs to be liberation from the &ldquo;computer says no&rdquo; mindset at every turn.  There needs to be a relaxation of the lending limits and a reconsideration of the directives issued to credit unions that precludes them from lending to many of their members.<br/><br/>The decline in lending can be precisely traced to a communication from the Central Bank to credit unions which grossly impacted on their ability to lend to a significant number of people.  Over time, one can track the pronouncements from the Central Bank and the regulatory authorities and the reduction in lending.  A couple of years later, credit unions are heading for difficult times.  It is a virtuous circle.  What is it that the credit unions are supposed to do to break that virtuous circle because those gifts are not within our control?  There needs to be a review of the rules taken from legislation and put into regulation.  The rules need to be legislated for, specifically defined and not to be arbitrary.  There needs to be a willingness to allow what was at one point a democratically controlled movement to be in control of its own destiny.  Whenever people make the statement that we are here to protect members&rsquo; savings, the direct inference is that we are not.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I find that irksome when it is repeated <i>ad infinitum</i>.  It is as if there is one particular party to this with the fitness and probity who can protect members&rsquo; money.  That requires a mindset change, not a legislative change.</p></speech>

That would be a definite win all round.</p> <p>  The classes of investments and the long-term lending limits are two urgent areas which need to be addressed.  We are entering into the discussion with the CUAC implementation group in good faith.  There were seven areas highlighted which were not delivered the first time.  We would urge the committee to play a monitoring role to ensure it does happen this time.  The tiered regulation is like an umbrella which sits over many of the other parts of the movement.  It is there for the benefit of the small, medium and large credit unions and we get that proportionality with the nature, scale and complexity factored in properly.</p> <p>  We have no idea how the &euro;1 billion figure was arrived at.  At other committee meetings in the past, concerns were raised that there were more than 100 credit unions on solvency watch lists.  The one learning we have taken out of all this is the Judge Judy rule.  Things were not written down, so it was assumed they did not happen.  We have taken on all the burdens of the 2012 Act and have strategies, policies and procedures coming out of various orifices.  What we need now is to use all that newfound capability in a constructive way to deliver more services to more members.</p></speech>

They, more than us, need a champion.  That champion is this committee.  Its oversight and scrutiny over the next several months is critical for going forward.  CUAC has isolated several specific areas.  There is the spirit and the intention of the commission&rsquo;s report which was agreed by all stakeholders, the Central Bank and the Department.  That has to be followed through.  All the questions on the outstanding issues have to be answered to our satisfaction.  As bodies, we are up for engagement.</p> <p>  Our job is to manage prudentially the funds of our members and to lend to them.  Those are the goals on which we need to pursue and deliver upon.</p></speech>

Also, we have not received any specific proposal on changing long term lending limits at the sectorial level, or any proposed risk management framework to accompany greater long-term lending.</blockquote> <p>One can argue there is a lot in that and maybe there is not a lot in that.</p><p>What is Mr. Johnson's response to the comment that there is no specific proposal on changing long-term lending or that there has not been that much exploration as to how credit unions intend to use that long-term lending to boost profitability?  </p></speech>

When we spoke about this previously, what was quoted was the very low percentage of lending in that particular category.  It was stated that little over 2% of the total loans were in the long-term lending bracket.  We then set about trying to bring in the capability and expertise.  It comes back to the earlier point about what actually constitutes a proposal.  We discuss these things and have very good engagement at times.  There is a good professional relationship there.  At deputy governor level, we have asked for greater transparency around that expectation.  We will then set it out and deliver it.  We can argue about fairness or otherwise after that but at least if we understood what is expected from a proposal, we can do that.  To say there is none is probably unfair.</p></speech>

Credit unions, CUDA, the ICLU and individual groups have been seeking to introduce debit cards.  This technology is almost 60 years old.  That process has been in train for over two years.  I have lost count.  We are no further down the track than we were at the start.  It would be mildly disingenuous to say that no propositions have been offered.  As Mr. Johnson alluded to, it is semantics.</p></speech>

It is part of what we are trying to consider.  By and large, Mr. McCrory knows this industry better than we do.  We just want to hear everybody's perspective on it and try to see where the logjams are.</p> <p>  The final point, which I raised at a committee meeting with some people from the Central Bank, is that some credit unions have been fined for non-compliance.  One was in Wicklow while another received a fairly substantial fine relatively recently.  What are the witnesses' thoughts on or reactions to that level of fine?  Were they valid?  </p></speech>

All I would say is that when there is a movement with 9,200 volunteers and 3,500 professional staff, there will be occasions when something goes wrong.  As we said in our opening comments, while 1% of the system fails through the greatest crisis we have experienced, overall, we have seen an excellent performance.  We certainly would not condone any breach of requirements.</p></speech>

There is technical training in money laundering and finance as well as soft skills training so all those volunteers and paid staff do ten, 12 or 15 hours training.  It can be online courses, days in classrooms or accredited courses where they are studying for certificates or diplomas.  The movement takes training and learning very seriously.  The credit unions are as disappointed as we are if any of them falls into a fine category but it seems to be an area where the Central Bank is eager to name and shame.  None of us condones that.</p></speech>

However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>Before I invite our guests to address the committee I must highlight the following.  Members have been advised that the witnesses are attending for the purpose of establishing facts and giving the committee a factual account of the matter, and that they cannot be required to offer an opinion on a matter of Government or ministerial policy.  As Chair, it is my role to ensure that questions directed at the witnesses do not breach this principle.  Members have also been advised that, if necessary, the witnesses will also be available when the delegation from ConnectIreland has finished making their contribution to provide any necessary clarification in so far as they are in a position to do so in terms of matters that are the responsibility of the Department.</p><p>I remind our guests that their presentations should be of no more than five minutes in duration.

Before setting out some information and details regarding the initiative, I will briefly introduce myself and my colleague, Ms &Aacute;ine Maher.  We are part of the inward investment team in the innovation and investment division of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  We work closely with IDA Ireland on issues, be they budgetary, administrative or financial, concerning the agency and more broadly on the implementation of effective foreign direct investment policy in Ireland.  This includes the Succeed in Ireland initiative, which is the subject of the committee's deliberations today.</p> <p>  The Succeed in Ireland programme was borne out of the 2011 Global Irish Economic Forum.  The concept behind the initiative was, in essence, to engage individual members of the Irish diaspora in helping to attract new foreign direct investment to Ireland in return for a financial award.  The Government asked the IDA to oversee Succeed in Ireland, and following a tender in August 2011, ConnectIreland, a subsidiary of the Taxback Group, was appointed to implement the initiative.  The programme was subsequently launched as part of the 2012 Action Plan for Jobs, with a target of creating 5,000 new employment positions in Ireland.  It has been in operation since then and has contributed to the Government's efforts to win more foreign direct investment and jobs for the people of Ireland.  According to the IDA, which is responsible for its oversight, 535 positions have been created through the initiative.  As a financial reward is due in respect of each job that has been verified as having been created on the ground, ConnectIreland has received payments to date totalling &euro;2.11 million from IDA Ireland.  This figure does not include an additional &euro;150,000 which ConnectIreland received from the IDA for marketing support.  I should point out that the figure of 535, representing the total number of jobs created to date by the initiative, may yet increase.  This is because jobs generated by approved projects under the programme will continue to be counted up until March 2020.  Moreover, the verification process for any such jobs will continue to operate until March 2022.</p> <p>  As regards the conclusion of the contract underpinning the programme, it was originally due to end in March 2016.  However, in advance of that date, ConnectIreland and the IDA agreed to extend it for a further 12-month period.  The express purpose of that extension, which was mutually agreed by both parties, was to effect an orderly wind-down of the original agreement signed in 2012.  The original agreement is now set to conclude on 26 March, this coming Sunday.  The IDA has advised the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation that granting a further extension to the agreement, which would allow the programme to continue beyond 26 March, would legally not be permissible.  This is because of public procurement law which provides that in this instance a new tender would be necessary before a further contract could be entered into.</p> <p>  At its meeting in November 2016, the board of IDA considered the future of Succeed in Ireland and whether a new tender should be issued in 2017 for its continuation.  The board made the decision not to re-tender and the agency informed the Department of this immediately thereafter.  The fact the IDA board opted against retendering in November 2016 does not necessarily mean - this is an important point to make - that a definitive decision has been taken in respect of the long-term future of the initiative.  There is nothing to prevent, for example, the IDA from deciding to proceed with a tender for a further Succeed in Ireland programme at a later stage.  The IDA has decided instead not to pursue that route at this point.  The conclusion of the contract will also allow us to take stock of the programme and the contribution it has made to employment generation in the State.</p> <p>  We will be aided in this process by a review which, on the instructions of the Minister, will shortly be commissioned by the Department.  In short, this review will allow for a full and comprehensive assessment of the costs and impact of Succeed in Ireland.  Once completed, it will improve our understanding of how the initiative has functioned, its strengths and weaknesses and, crucially, how we could improve it for the future.  As made clear by the Minister it is important that this review be undertaken before a determination is made on the ultimate future of the programme.  The committee should be aware that the terms of reference for this review have not yet been finalised.  A decision on the start date and authorship will be taken in due course following the conclusion of the current Succeed in Ireland contract.  Confirmation of details concerning the review, once finalised, can be supplied to the committee in due course.</p> <p>  I want now to turn briefly to the well-publicised differences that have arisen between ConnectIreland and the IDA regarding the operation of the initiative.  While this is unfortunate, it is the case that the contract between the parties provides for a procedure to resolve any such differences.  This dispute resolution mechanism has been triggered and I understand the two sides have been engaged in efforts, pursuant to that contractual provision, to find a solution.</p><p>That process remains ongoing, and the Minister is hopeful that a mutually acceptable outcome can be reached for both parties.  As the committee will appreciate, I am unfortunately precluded from commenting any further on the substance of this dispute or anything in connection with it in the event that I inadvertently prejudice the position of either of the parties in any future proceedings.</p><p> The Minister has asked me to emphasise that the attraction of further foreign direct investment to Ireland will remain an absolute priority of hers in the time ahead.  The Government, together with the IDA, is continuing to do its utmost to attract more overseas companies to expand or locate here and to create new employment opportunities.  ConnectIreland, through its operation of the Succeed in Ireland programme, has made a useful contribution to the collective efforts made in recent years to win more FDI for Ireland.  The Minister is grateful for this contribution.  We look forward to undertaking a review of the programme to be in a better position to make a determination as to how to proceed with Succeed in Ireland.</p><p> I am now happy to answer any questions the committee may have.  I may not, however, be able to address certain operational or legal queries in connection with the programme for reasons I have just described.  I trust the committee understands why that is the case.</p></speech>

I have a number of questions about the review.  Why have the terms of reference for the review not been finalised yet?  What is the reason for this delay?  When will the terms of reference be finalised?  How long is the review scheduled to take?  Will it be made public?  Why close the initiative when the review is ongoing?  Why not operate at least until the review is complete?  Would it not be more efficient to review the initiative before the contract ends, or has the Department already decided to end the Succeed in Ireland initiative and is the review just a cover-up?</p></speech>

I am not in a position, unfortunately, to provide any more details on that.  As I said, the idea is to wait until the contract concludes, after which a decision will be taken on the review and how it will be conducted.  Why is the review not being undertaken while the contract is ongoing?  I think the decision was that it would be better to wait until the conclusion of the contract to be better able to assess and get a better understanding of the results of the programme.  Generally, it is more difficult to undertake a review of something that is ongoing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-21a.670" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1327" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017032100002#J00600"><p>I am disappointed by Mr. Scannell's response.  I do not accept that the Department cannot do a review while the matter is ongoing.  That has been done in the case of every project I have ever been involved in or worked with.  Companies do reviews all the time.  It is unacceptable that Mr. Scannell cannot tell us when the review will take place.  Why have the terms of reference not been finalised already?  It is just unacceptable.</p> <p>  I wish to raise my disappointment with the IDA for not turning up before the committee.  I know the IDA sent us a letter but I do not accept what is in the letter.  We could have asked representatives of the IDA questions without breaching what they were worried about, so I am disappointed.</p> <p>  Mr. Scannell did not answer any of my questions properly.  There is concern that this project will finish on Sunday, which is five or six days away.</p></speech>

They are State-funded organisations, they are funded by the Exchequer, and Enterprise Ireland sending us a one-liner that it has no one available absolutely beggars belief.  It is a large organisation and was invited here on a number of occasions, such as during the Brexit exercise we undertook.  It came before the committee on that occasion, as did the IDA, and I wish to put that on the record.  It is simply not good enough.  This is coming off the back of St. Patrick's Day and the diplomatic offensive in which this country has traditionally engaged over the years in reaching out to the diaspora.  The core business of ConnectIreland is exactly that: connecting with our diaspora to try to promote economic activity in the country.  I ask that we write to these two organisations again.</p><p>We should demand that they come before us so we can register with them our disapproval and the fact that it is disrespectful to the Houses of the Oireachtas and, by extension, to the people of Ireland.  We are here to represent the people.  We should set a date for them to come back in.  Failing that, and given I am not sure we have powers of compellability, we should ask the Committee of Public Accounts, which would obviously have an overlapping role in this regard because the organisations are funded by the Exchequer, to examine the situation.  The Committee of Public Accounts might be able to exercise its powers of compellability.  This is simply not good enough.</p></speech>

I expect that would be unanimous from us all and there is no issue in doing that.  However, we cannot compel them to attend.</p></speech>

However, if they become a no-show again, perhaps we might consult the Committee of Public Accounts in respect of the matter.  I am just saying that.</p></speech>

I find it incredible that the Department is still drafting the terms of the review.  Deputy Quinlivan was right in how he reacted to the answer.  I raised this matter in a priority parliamentary question a number of weeks ago, as Mr. Scannell will be aware, and the answer I got from the Minister was wholly unsatisfactory.  A number of weeks have now elapsed yet the Department is coming in here and saying that the review is still being drafted, that we will have it in due course and that a decision will ultimately be taken, but we do not know who is taking the decision.  It appears that IDA Ireland is happy to let the clock run out on this.  I am at a loss to know who exactly has the responsibility for driving this review.  Is anybody within the Department, from the Minister down, concerned that the current initiative will cease on 26 March, that we will then go into a period of drift and that the momentum that has been built and the connections that have been made could potentially come to naught?  This is despite all the work that has been done and the money spent.  Mr. Scannell outlined the amount of money that has been paid to ConnectIreland to date.</p> <p>  I find what is happening incredible.  Is this is what the Department is serving up to us at this point, namely, that the review is being drafted?  As Mr. Scannell indicated, the initial contract ran out last year and an extension was agreed for a further year.  I find this wholly incredible.  Can Mr. Scannell tell us what the term "due course" means and who will actually make the decision on the review?  As we know, there is a dispute between the two organisations.  If we are to wait for IDA Ireland to make a decision, I think we will be left waiting.  Will the Minister or the Government make a decision on the matter?  Is that the nature of the decision-making process?</p></speech>

That is all I am in a position to inform the committee of at the moment.  The review will be undertaken after the contract concludes.</p> <p>  Generally, on the question of what happens to the programme after its conclusion, when the contracts were originally agreed, it was never envisaged that the contract would run in perpetuity.  The contract was for a set period.  It was extended for the maximum amount of time and a further extension was granted to effect an orderly wind-down of the contract.  That is now coming to an end.  It was not envisaged, unfortunately, that this would run for ever.  It was to run for a set period and the decision has now been made to undertake a review so that we know where we stand, exactly what the programme has contributed and what are the results.  A longer-term decision will then be made as to its future.</p></speech>

I understand that was a factor.  Other than that I am also aware that the board and IDA Ireland more generally would have looked at the results that have been achieved to date in terms of the job numbers achieved by Succeed in Ireland against its targets.  Those are factors that would come into consideration.</p></speech>

I know there is a dispute about the number of jobs to be verified versus the number of jobs that ConnectIreland would claim are actually on the ground at the moment and they are evolving over the next period of time.  That is very much at the heart of what we are discussing here today.</p> <p>  I place on record my appreciation of the work of ConnectIreland particularly in rural areas.  I was instrumental in developing, with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the agencies, the regional Action Plan for Jobs approach.  Based on the results ConnectIreland has delivered, the jobs on the ground are mainly outside the main cities and urban centres, areas that on the basis of current IDA Ireland policy will never attract an enormous number of foreign direct investment jobs in particular sectors.</p> <p>  It is bizarre and reckless to engage in a review at this point.  I agree with colleagues that if we were to have a review, that review should have taken place much earlier than now and the evidence from that review could then have informed Government policy as to the approach to ConnectIreland and the Succeed in Ireland initiative generally.</p> <p>  Clearly the protagonists, if I can use that description, are in a process at the moment.  ConnectIreland, for obvious reasons, would favour a bridging contract arrangement being provided.  I will not ask Mr. Scannell to comment specifically on whether he thinks a bridging contract should be awarded to ConnectIreland to allow the initiative to proceed in the context of the review that is now being undertaken.  Does Mr. Scannell believe from a policy perspective that it is feasible for a bridging arrangement to be agreed in a short period of time because, obviously ConnectIreland is staring down the barrel of a gun with the conclusion of its contract and all that flows from that?  From a policy perspective and in the context of public procurement and tendering guidelines, is it feasible for the Minister to award a bridging contract to the organisation, staying within the confines of legal parameters?</p></speech>

As we understand it, the legal advice that has been received provides that because of public procurement law, unfortunately no further extension can be granted.  That basically precludes any bridging contract or any such device to allow prolongation of the initiative.  An extension is effectively off the table; there would have to be a new tender before the programme could continue on the basis of a renewed contract.</p></speech>

As I explained, in November 2016 the board of IDA Ireland decided not to retender.  The Department accepted IDA Ireland's decision.

Mr. Scannell says that this plan was extended on numerous occasions.  I am an ex-emigrant - I was out of the country from 2010 to 2013 - and I was well aware of this when I was in Australia, when there would have been much talk about it among the diaspora to kick-start the economy and get investment in.  There was a mechanism in place if there was a dispute or conflict and there was an extension given.  Am I correct in assuming that there was a process written in for how an extension would be granted or was there a review at the time which resulted in that extension?  If so, was there a review mechanism with a timeline written into it, rather than what is being highlighted here, namely, carrying out a review at the last minute?</p></speech>

I do not mean that disrespectfully but he has told us absolutely nothing in relation to the key issues here.  Like my colleague, Deputy Niall Collins, I have to express my huge disappointment at IDA Ireland's decision not to attend, Enterprise Ireland's decision not to attend and the Minister's decision not to attend. To be frank, something very strange is going on here when no one wants to turn up and when the people who do are extremely restricted in what they can say.  I find it odd.</p> <p>  I do not mean to be flippant but my first question is do the people here now report to IDA Ireland?  If they do not - and I take it that they do not - then perhaps they could tell us why the Department accepted IDA Ireland's decision not to retender.</p> <p>  One thing in particular puzzles me.  My understanding was that the wind-down period - that last 12 months - was to allow for a retender to take place.  We have not been given any credible reason why that retendering did not take place.  This seems to be a very cynical exercise designed to wind down time and then say that there was nothing that could be done.  We are up against it now in terms of next Sunday.</p> <p>  I live in rural Ireland.  I think ConnectIreland has done a huge service to the country.  The Department's statement refers to the absolute priority to attract further foreign direct investment to Ireland.  How does the Department reconcile that with the fact that it is going to close ConnectIreland on Sunday?  I am absolutely stunned.  There is something really odd about this.</p><p>It is completely unacceptable that IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland decided to duck the issue today in the hope that time would run out.  I hope I speak for every committee member when I say that we are not going to allow this to happen.  It is beyond reasonable and beyond what the taxpayer should tolerate.  ConnectIreland delivered jobs to rural Ireland which the IDA will not because it only works with projects of 30 employees and upwards.  Many of the ConnectIreland projects involve smaller job numbers.  There is a gap there.  We are facing into Brexit and this committee has spent much time dealing with the challenges of Brexit.  At the very time it is about to hit us, the Department is shutting down one of the key elements in our army to fight back for jobs.  Will the Department please tell us it has something more to say?</p></speech>

I agree wholeheartedly with the Senator that it is regrettable that IDA Ireland is not here.  We saw the letter issued from IDA Ireland which said it would consider it regrettable if the committee proceeded with a hearing on Succeed in Ireland.  It is regrettable the IDA is not here.  In fairness to Mr. Richard Scannell and Ms &Aacute;ine Maher, they are left trying to pick up the pieces.</p></speech>

That is not what is happening here.  The two parties, to be fair, entered into a contract which had a conclusion date.  The contract was not intended to run forever and it is ending.  That is effectively what has happened.  No decision has been made in that respect.</p> <p>  In terms of accepting the decision of the IDA, the Minister and the Department have great respect for the work IDA Ireland has done.  It has a stellar track record in attracting foreign direct investment to Ireland, creating jobs and investment across the country.  There is no reason in this instance to second-guess the judgment of the IDA.  The purpose of the 12-month extension, as I understand it, which was agreed in March 2016, was not to allow for a further tendering.  In fact, the express terms of that extension, if I recall correctly, were to effect an orderly wind down of the agreement, to effectively bring the original contract to a conclusion and not to allow for the re-tender.</p></speech>

Taxback has been extremely successful in the work it does and, likewise, with ConnectIreland.</p> <p>  I want to put on record that the level of arrogance shown by the IDA by not turning up is something I have not seen in this House for quite some time.  The manner in which the opening statement was given and the lack of content in addressing the issue is further shocking from the Department.</p> <p>  How much does it cost IDA Ireland to create a job?</p></speech>

The Department is the body setting out the strategy and policy in regard to this.  I simply want to find out how many people are going to be unemployed after the decision is made and whether it is the Department's intention to save the jobs, pay ConnectIreland for the intellectual property rights and deal with the outstanding issues because this affects the profile of Ireland abroad.  It will have a major negative impact at a time when we are attempting to build up our response to Brexit.  It is a fair question.</p></speech>

I have a final question.  IDA Ireland has paid over &euro;2 million to this company for the magnificent work it has undertaken abroad and in respect of the creation of jobs at home.  Presumably, that comes through Mr. Scannell's Department.  That is a type of investment because it is constantly working with ConnectIreland.  Would the Department consider that to be value in terms of what this company did?  Mr. Scannell said it contributed to the Government's efforts and that it made a valuable contribution.</p></speech>

I apologise for being obliged to leave but I have other business.  I agree with other speakers that there is an extraordinary atmosphere and a chill factor in respect of this issue.  There is a legal process going on but representatives of IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the Minister are not here and two civil servants have been left to take the rap for everything that has been thrown at them.  That is what they are paid for and what they are employed to do but it is clear that other key people are missing from the room-----</p></speech>

That contrasts starkly with the kerfuffle and glamour around the formation of this project - involving the Taoiseach, the Minister at the time, Deputy Richard Bruton, Michael Flatley dancing around the place, the talk of foreign direct investment coming into the country, etc. - and the fact that this organisation will be shut down next Sunday.  What position does the Government see the 78,000 connectors around the globe being left in?  I will pre-empt the answer to my question by saying that I am a member of this committee because I am interested in the creation of real jobs.  However, I have no way of knowing that the jobs that ConnectIreland or IDA Ireland bring to this country are well paid and that the workers who take them up are looked after.  From time to time, companies attracted here by way of foreign direct investment are brought to my attention by those who work for them.  I am interested in this committee discussing ways to save jobs at Bus &Eacute;ireann and An Post and how we can attract nurses back to the country.  We never seem to discuss those issues, however.  We are always discussing foreign direct investment and where it is leading us.  I regret that very much but nevertheless it is important that I ask what the Department believes will happen with the 78,000 global connectors affected by this contract being brought to an end.  I will watch the proceedings later.</p></speech>

First, in his opening statement Mr. Scannell said the Government asked IDA Ireland to oversee the programme.  I presume that, by extension, it was the Department which  asked IDA Ireland to oversee it.  Mr. Scannell said the contract was extended for a year to facilitate an orderly wind-down.  Can he explain the reason he allowed the extension of one year and why we have had drift and no succession planning?</p><p>Second, Senator Gerald Nash mentioned a bridging arrangement and said IDA Ireland had presented legal advice to the effect that the contract could not be extended and would have to be retendered for.  How long does it take to retender?  IDA Ireland does not want this initiative to continue, but, given its record on job creation and in addressing the urban-rural gap, not to mention the difference in cost between the jobs created by ConnectIreland, at &euro;4,000 each, and those created by IDA Ireland which cost &euro;10,000, why does the Department not step in and have an arrangement with ConnectIreland?  That would keep it going and ensure there was no interregnum.</p><p> What is the Department's view on the operation of the system whereby connectors are red flagged, which is crucial to the operation of the programme?  IDA Ireland states the initiative has not been a success, but it has been.  IDA Ireland has given the operation of the red flagging system as one reason the initiative has not been a success.</p></speech>

It has to clear the contact with IDA Ireland to ensure the latter is not already in consultation with the company.  It has been reported that the system has experienced difficulties.  In some cases, ConnectIreland received feedback that IDA Ireland was talking to target clients, but these clients stated they had had no communication whatsoever from IDA Ireland.</p></speech>

The intention was not for the contract to run continually but for a set period.  When the board of IDA Ireland decided not to retender, it was natural for it to come to a conclusion.  That is why there was no succession planning.  I do not know how long it takes to retender as I am not well versed in procurement procedures, but I think it takes some four or five months.  I can come back to the Deputy with a more authoritative answer.</p></speech>

It would have been very useful and helpful today if we had been informed of what was written into the original process when it came to the review.  I assume there is factual information.  I cannot understand why that could not have been presented to the committee today as part of an appendix or whatever.  To me, it lays down the precedence of what reviews took place before and what the rationale was for the roll-over.  From that, we could draw our own conclusions on the lack of interaction we had today and maybe highlight some of the conclusions that could be arrived at or rebutted.  We are operating in a complete vacuum.  That factual information should have been presented today.</p></speech>

As to why there is no re-tender, it is because the IDA decided not to re-tender.  As to whether someone else would re-tender, we are going to await the outcome of the review before any future decision is taken.</p></speech>

By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>Before I invite the witnesses to address the committee, I must highlight that the committee has already been advised that the contractual dispute between IDA Ireland and ConnectIreland is a matter between those two parties and the committee cannot, therefore, inquire into the matter in dispute.  I understand ConnectIreland has already indicated orally that it will not raise the matters in dispute in the course of its meeting with the committee.  Although we have not had sight of the contract, our understanding is that it also contains provisions relating to confidentiality.  Can I assume that ConnectIreland will not volunteer information to the committee that pertains to specific matters in dispute between it and IDA Ireland or that breaches any confidentiality requirement, contractual or otherwise?  Can I ask for an assurance from ConnectIreland that if members ask questions of it that present a difficulty in this regard that will be clearly signalled by it?</p><p> I remind our guests that the presentation should be of no more than five minutes' duration.  The presentation has been circulated to committee members.  I invite Ms Joanna Murphy to make her presentation.</p></speech>

It is a tremendous privilege for ConnectIreland to come to the Houses of the Oireachtas to present a successful job creation initiative, primarily for rural Ireland, of which we are very proud.  Before reading my presentation, I wish to offer our sincere condolences to those in Sinn F&eacute;in on the loss of their colleague last night.</p> <p>  The purpose of ConnectIreland's appearance before the committee is to appeal for a bridging contract to allow us to continue to operate the Succeed in Ireland initiative, preferably with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The contract for Succeed in Ireland is due to expire on Sunday next.  Recently, the Minister for Jobs Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, confirmed in the D&aacute;il that she has asked her Department for a review to be conducted on the initiative after it has been terminated.  ConnectIreland welcomes the review but we respectfully request that it be independent, that it be carried out by third party and that it include the experience of ConnectIreland in implementing this programme, overseen by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  We have received tremendous support from tens of thousands of loyal members of the Irish diaspora who continue to introduce valuable leads every day, thereby benefiting rural Ireland.  We wish only to continue the work that we do until that review has been concluded and recommendations arrived at.  We see no advantage in the discontinuation of this vital job creation programme before the review is complete.</p> <p>  ConnectIreland is a not-for-profit patriotic initiative founded by Terry Clune to operate the Succeed in Ireland initiative to bring jobs to Ireland in the wake of the recent financial crisis.  The initiative is an idea which came from the Global Irish Economic Forum in 2011.  It utilises Ireland's relationship with its diaspora and global connections to persuade companies to move to Ireland.  The way it works is simple: people - connectors - who know someone planning to move a company into Europe will get in touch with ConnectIreland which will then provide a wide range of supports to that company to help it decide to choose Ireland.  For passing on the lead, the connector will receive a reward of &euro;1,500 for every job created.  ConnectIreland has operated under the auspices of Industrial Development Agency, IDA, Ireland.</p> <p>  ConnectIreland has proved very successful in bringing small companies to Ireland.  We have also been very successful in bringing jobs to rural Ireland, not just Dublin.  We have brought 82 new-name, greenfield projects to Ireland, with a heavy rural emphasis.  We have had 2,351 jobs approved by IDA Ireland's management investment committee, scaling over three years, with 1,046 jobs already on the ground.  There have been 527 verified by IDA Ireland.  There are almost 80,000 connectors, loyal members of the Irish diaspora who continue to introduce companies to us every day.  They understand the initiative and support its ambitions.  They are an army of volunteers working for Ireland.  I take this opportunity to introduce Mr. James Moran, a connector in the first instance but now also running a company called SLM Connect in Gweedore, Donegal, and his colleague, chief executive of SLM Connect worldwide, Mr. Abdul Salam, who has graciously taken time to travel from Manchester today.  Mr. Moran has travelled from Donegal to tell the committee why they chose Gweedore and why relationships with the Irish diaspora are so important.</p> <p>  Beyond what IDA Ireland has approved, we are working with 957 additional companies.</p><p>I direct Deputies and Senators to the list which shows the companies with which we are currently engaged and the relationships that will be lost on Sunday should we not be able to continue.  We encourage them to relocate to Ireland.  Should the programme be discontinued, the relationship and trust ConnectIreland has built with them will be lost.  There is no cost to the taxpayer unless jobs have been created.  At &euro;4,000 per job created, of which we share &euro;1,500 with our connectors, the initiative is 250% cheaper per job than the cost for IDA Ireland.  We consider this to be something of which we are very proud.  IDA Ireland's track record in attracting foreign direct investment to Ireland is exemplary, but as a new company, we are working with the diaspora to deliver jobs at a much lower cost to the taxpayer, of which we are very proud.  Our connectors are based in 147 countries worldwide.</p><p> IDA Ireland is not renewing the contract which is due to expire on Sunday.  We have had some significant challenges in implementing the programme, none of which was getting a lead from the diaspora in attracting foreign direct investment to Ireland.  We are committed to resolving these issues.  This is more important than structural difficulties.  We are here because we want to continue to create jobs in Ireland which needs as many channels to job creation as possible.  Closing down ConnectIreland is not in Ireland's national interests.  Shutting down the Succeed in Ireland initiative will have an enormously negative impact on job creation in Ireland.  Our global network will be lost and all jof the jobs in the pipeline will be put at risk.  It will be extremely damaging to Ireland's reputation for thousands of investors.  We will be missing huge opportunities for dozens of small towns in Ireland.  In the context of Brexit, does this make sense?  We see the continuing volatility of the jobs market and global uncertainty on the political landscape which confirm the need to have all possible job creation measures.  This will be another killer blow to rural Ireland.  We need the initiative to be extended to facilitate a review, of which we would be part, and until such a time as a path forward can be found for the initiative.  We plead with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to step in to save jobs in rural Ireland and provide cross-departmental support for ConnectIreland.  ConnectIreland has been the recipient of huge support from various Departments which we acknowledge and also from Irish embassies and consuls, as well as from significant Irish organisations such as the GAA.</p><p> I thank the committee for its time.</p></speech>

I am perplexed by the decision of IDA Ireland not to renew the contract.  I cannot get my head around the reasoning for it.  From speaking to ConnectIreland in the past and seeing the jobs it has delivered in areas where IDA Ireland is not going to deliver them, especially in rural Ireland and the more remote parts of the State - IDA Ireland would not even make a site visit, never mind bring jobs there - I cannot understand why IDA Ireland is not renewing the contract.  What are the connectors saying?  They must be absolutely perplexed about what is happening.  Have there been instances where jobs sourced through the Succeed in Ireland programme have been claimed by IDA Ireland?</p></speech>

Our initiative was designed to be collaborative, to bring small companies to Ireland, to complement the work of IDA Ireland and to add value.  The jobs that have come through our initiative are additional and there is no State subvention required.  We are paid on a success-only basis.</p><p>We, like our connectors and this army of companies, are utterly perplexed.  I do not know what we will say to them on Monday if we cannot resolve this today.</p><p> Unfortunately, I will not be able to answer the Deputy's second question, bearing in mind what the Chairman said earlier.</p></speech>

In addition, it is filling the gap, particularly in rural Ireland.  In the past two weeks, a closure in Nenagh was announced.  Brexit was one of the reasons cited.  Brexit was mentioned a number of times in the earlier session and we have done our own exercise in relation to this.</p> <p>  Will the representatives of the Department tell us how the red lighting or the red flagging system works?  What has their experience been of its operation?</p></speech>

As I said earlier, our goal is to add value.  What we do is additional.  We submit the lead to IDA Ireland and it tells us if it has been in dialogue with that company on a specific project within the past six months.  I cannot comment further on that subject other than to say that we were surprised at the volume of companies that were red-lighted to ConnectIreland.</p></speech>

The reason given by the IDA is that it had already been in contact with those people.  However, ConnectIreland subsequently found out from those people that the IDA had not been in contact with them at all.  Is my understanding correct?</p></speech>

His understanding is correct.  We cannot comment on that particular topic.</p> <p>  For ConnectIreland, today is about a continuation.  It is about the positives that have come out of this initiative at a time of deep economic uncertainty in Ireland.  We are now facing into uncertainty once more, which is why we have brought with us an example of the type of relations that Ireland needs to use.  Having come back from a world painted green last weekend, we all know the latent energy and power that is in our Irish diaspora.</p> <p>  With the indulgence of the committee members, I will introduce Mr. James Moran, who has an interesting story to tell of why Gweedore has a special place in his heart.  I will then introduce Mr. Abdul Salam to talk about why he chose Gweedore over Scotland or Wales.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-21a.828" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Moran" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017032100002#W00700"><p>I thank the committee for allowing me to share our story.  I was born in Manchester and raised in Donegal.  After my leaving certificate, I went to university in the UK and stayed there for a number of years.  I subsequently worked in Dublin and, in recent years, in the US.</p> <p>  In 2015, I was working for a US technology company in Manchester.  It shared a building with Mr. Salam's company, SLM Connect, which is a contact centre or call centre organisation.  I got to know Mr. Salam on a personal level.  One day while chatting, he said that he wished to expand his operation outside Manchester, possibly to Wales or Scotland.  I put my green hat on and threw Ireland into the picture.  He was happy to consider that.  I was aware of the ConnectIreland initiative through a friend of mine back home.  I became an approved connector.</p><p>When the management of SLM and ConnectIreland subsequently spoke, that set the seed for encouraging the company to set up in County Donegal.  After a few months, when the project was progressing well, Mr. Salam asked me to consider joining the company to look after its Irish operation.  I jumped at the chance for personal reasons.  My mother has been on her own in County Donegal since my father passed away a few years ago.  Her five children are scattered all over the world, as many Irish families are.  I have a sister in the United States and another in New Zealand.  I jumped at the chance to go back home to look after my mother.  She would probably be adamant that it is still a case of her looking after me and she is probably right.</p><p> Our operation in County Donegal is off the ground.  We employ 36 people and are looking to increase that number to 125.  Our facility can probably hold approximately 150.  We are hoping to have 50 employees by Easter and 125 within two years.  It has been a great experience.  It is good to be back home.  We have been very impressed by the calibre of people we have managed to get.  It is probable that approximately 50% of our staff have third level degrees.  I am sure they did not envisage working in a call centre or a contact centre when they were in college, but to be fair, they appreciate and are grateful for their jobs.  A few Deputies have hammered home the point that rural jobs are much more important.  People in County Donegal really appreciate their jobs and are committed to making this operation a success.  A significant cohort of our staff had been among the long-term unemployed.  Just as I wanted to move back home to be closer to my mother, many people in County Donegal are tied to the area because of family commitments.  They want to stay in the county in order that they can remain part of the fabric of the community.  The great ConnectIreland initiative is helping us to provide 125 jobs in Gaoth Dobhair in the first phase.  Mr. Salam and I are quite keen to increase the number of jobs provided by the company to between 300 and 500 in the second phase, which might be closer to Letterkenny or one of the other bigger towns in County Donegal.  I reiterate that all of this has been made possible by the ConnectIreland initiative which has enabled me to get in touch with officials to take the project onwards and upwards.</p></speech>

I ask him to outline why he has chosen Gaoth Dobhair rather than one of the competing markets.  What was it about this location that appealed to him when he was planning the expansion of his company?</p></speech>

We received huge support from ConnectIreland and Mr. Moran.  The culture and community within Gaoth Dobhair were the deciding factor when we decided to establish an Irish-based footprint.</p></speech>

It was suggested the cost of a ConnectIreland-created job was approximately &euro;4,000, whereas the cost of an IDA Ireland-created job was over &euro;10,000.  According to the Department, ConnectIreland claims to have created over 2,000 jobs, but the official figure from IDA Ireland suggests ConnectIreland has created just 535.  Will the ConnectIreland officials clarify the position?</p></speech>

I understand from IDA Ireland's recent figures that the figure of &euro;10,500 has been well documented.</p><p>The reason we can do that is because of the enormous goodwill that ConnectIreland has received.  I will ask my colleague, Mr. Clune to give examples of what ConnectIreland's goodwill has generated.</p></speech>

Some of the connectors are recent graduates and others are very senior business people.  We have been very lucky that Mr. Michael O'Leary from Ryanair has given ConnectIreland significant coverage across Ryanair's in-flight magazine in the past two years.</p> <p>  People really understand what we are looking for.  It is not a difficult ask.  What we ask people to do is simply to keep their eyes and ears open for Ireland.  During St. Patrick's week the Tricolour was out in force.  There is massive loyalty to Ireland and this initiative gives people something useful they can do, a simple channel through which they can keep their eyes open and if they hear of a company that is expanding to Europe, they should let us know and we in ConnectIreland will take it from there.  This concept has been working very successfully.  </p> <p>  In terms of the numbers, SLM Connect's numbers are not included in the IDA's 527 verified list.  The IDA has not verified them.  We hope that as part of a review, the verification process or how long it takes to verify the jobs would be looked at and reviewed.  Equally, and we cannot discuss it here unfortunately, the red lighting issue would be a key aspect of what we would like to be able to review and ensure that issues and opportunities are not lost for Ireland.  We have a significant number of red lighted companies.  We would hope that in a review of the project with the Department and IDA that we would be able to overcome that issue in the future and that those companies would no longer be blocked to Ireland.</p></speech>

We pressed the previous witnesses quite hard on what I have described as the drift in the past 12 months.  The contract of ConnectIreland was extended for a 12 month period.  Will the witnesses comment on the level of engagement with the IDA and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in terms of ensuring that the programme continues in some shape or form, whether it be by ConnectIreland, which is my first choice or in its absence some other entity that would be equally as competent?</p></speech>

I welcome the comments of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation earlier today.  Unfortunately we cannot agree on one particular item.  The contract extension was set down in order to facilitate a new tender.  What was communicated to ConnectIreland was that within the second six months, which was described as "blue ocean", there would be an opportunity for the tender to be reissued.  We in ConnectIreland would have bid for the contract as part of a competitive call and would hope that our work was sufficient to win such a contract.  A public information notice was issued on 23 September 2015, with a budget earmarked.  To our disappointment that was never progressed and we were left in a state of dismay when we found out the week before Christmas that it was the intention to dismantle all the good work that has been done.  That is the difference we have with the Department.  That was not our understanding of the extension.  The point was quite expressly made to us that there was a need for ConnectIreland to stop promoting to facilitate a new tender.</p></speech>

We waited and we still continued to engage with companies in that six month period.  We have companies contacting us every single day and we have not withdrawn any support from them.  We continue to support those companies and our connectors with them.</p></speech>

We have spoken to the Minister in the past.  We have written to the Minister asking for intervention, for somebody to assist in that regard.</p><p>We have not had any action or output, as yet, on that.  We are here to resolve matters and not to look back.  It is important to put on the record that ConnectIreland of itself is an innovation.  It is a disruptive FDI, if I can use that expression.  It is doing something different.  We have been internationally award-winning and that is not to celebrate ourselves but to celebrate the likes of Mr. James Moran, who has done all of the work.  We would not exist were it not for the great leads that come in.  We accept that there can be gaps and challenges in innovation and all we want to do is resolve.  We just have not had any engagement in that respect, unfortunately.</p></speech>

I first heard of ConnectIreland when I emigrated in February 2010.  In terms of marketability, ConnectIreland appealed to the ordinary emigrant on the ground as opposed to the key decision makers in established industries across the world.  That was the strategy and key focus at the time, in terms of getting companies to set up in Ireland but also to re-establish our reputation.  The organisation was trying to do that from the ground up; it was a bottom-up approach.  When I went to Australia, I was working in recruitment and every Irish emigrant knew about ConnectIreland within 24 to 48 hours of arriving.  It was a way for emigrants to reconnect with Ireland because most of us were forced to leave.  We never thought we would have to go.  Our country educated us to the hilt, we thought we had endless opportunities and then bang, we had to go, like the generations before us.  We were the first emigrants who were highly educated and we were able to speak in business language with key decision makers in order to attract businesses back to Ireland.  We were the ordinary punters on the ground at the time and that was the strategy behind it.  Indeed, that is where ConnectIreland worked.  I know that the company was spoken about by The Ireland Funds Australia and other network groups.  I wanted to put that on record from my experience on the ground, as a modern emigrant.  That is the way we saw it.  There was an incentive there.  The question was always asked, it was spoken about around the tables - can we get companies back?  We wanted to help the country.  We wanted to give something back and to have that connection, unlike previous generations who, through no fault of their own, did not have that opportunity.  Indeed, as a country, we were not as commercially aware back then as we are now.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions for the witnesses.  They mentioned interactions, spoke about prospective clients interacting with either IDA Ireland or ConnectIreland and referred to a six-month timeframe in that context.  I ask them to define what is meant by interaction.  Does it mean a conversation, a phone call or documented interaction?  Second, was ConnectIreland privy to any information regarding the review mechanism or the roll-over mechanism?  Do the witnesses know what criteria were used in the decision to roll over and continue the contract?  I asked the previous speakers the same question but they did not have that information.  In terms of the review, were there key performance indicator targets that ConnectIreland had to achieve and did that have an impact on the roll-over time period?</p></speech>

Every year at the All Ireland Hurling and Football Championship finals, the GAA affords us an opportunity to reach the four corners of the world with a video message about getting involved in ConnectIreland.  The GAA became so heavily involved because it is a community benefactor and ConnectIreland is, ultimately, a community organisation, supported by city and county councils across Ireland.</p><p>It was also because it had difficulty in fielding football teams at that time and it wanted to reach out to young men and women from Ireland across the world to tell them they could do something too.  One of our ambassadors is M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Muircheartaigh, who members will be well aware of as he is almost a president of Ireland.  He is more than 90 years of age now and he never travels outside of the country without a box of ConnectIreland brochures under his arm.  He insists on it because he wants to do something useful.  He wants to talk about job creation and the value of our diaspora.  We receive that type of contact and support from a mind-numbing number of people.  I recognise what the Deputy described as it is what we feel and see every day in ConnectIreland.</p><p> We welcome the review but we were hoping to be part of the review and that perhaps somebody might ask us what we thought was good about the programme after operating it exclusively from when it began to where it is now.  Certainly, we believe there are areas that can be improved but we would also like to celebrate the success of the initiative.</p><p> The Deputy also asked about the roll-over and key performance indicators.  There was no key performance indicator, as such.  We had what we have now, which is monthly operational meetings.  We are delighted and proud that we have another three announcements today.  They involve three companies, two of which are outside of Dublin, and 35 jobs.  They are small, sustainable and valuable jobs for Ireland.  That is, and has been, our success.</p></speech>

How does the witness prove it?  Is it documented?  I was a recruitment consultant and when somebody sent in a curriculum vitae, it was in an e-mail.  That depicted that it was one's candidate or client.  Was there a formal process in place between ConnectIreland and the IDA to depict a client?</p></speech>

There was obviously some type of review, or something happened, and the decision was made to roll over and that ConnectIreland would continue.  Is the witness aware of or can she outline the criteria that were used to make that decision?  I asked the previous witnesses and they were unable to tell me.  We have asked that a letter be written to the Department on that.  If the witness is aware of them and can share them, that is fine.  If she cannot, I understand that.</p></speech>

There was also a review after the first year, and I expect that was to make sure the initiative was working and growing as expected.  After the first year it was automatically renewed.  Then, up to 12 months ago, ourselves and the IDA discussed renewing it for one further year with a view to winding down that agreement, on the basis that in the last six months there would be a further tender issued by the IDA.  The only thing that has not happened is that last piece.  That is what we have been promised all along-----</p></speech>

Again, generally speaking, we would not renew State contracts with a 50% success rate either.</p></speech>

The IDA would also say, if its representatives were here, that it recognises that there are many hundreds more jobs that have not been verified yet.  It is explicitly clear on that point.</p> <p>  In respect of the 527 verified jobs, ConnectIreland knows that this is not the case because we have a relationship with these companies such as our colleagues here from SLM Connect.  Let us imagine it was the case that only 527 jobs had been created, and we say the figure is much larger.  There is still a return to the Exchequer in respect of the 527 jobs generated by an initiative that required no State subvention and which was based only on success.  The figure is enormous.  What is wrong with creating jobs on a success-only basis?  What is wrong with rewarding the Irish diaspora for doing so?  They reach areas of Ireland where, understandably, the IDA is concerned with attracting very big companies.  The organisation does very big business on behalf of Ireland and does it well.  What is wrong with a success-only initiative?  Why would anyone bring the initiative to a halt in the context of a creative Ireland, a looming Brexit and a new US Administration?  Why would anyone stop a channel to job creation that does not cost the taxpayer unless it succeeds?</p></speech>

I know the witnesses are subject to legal process.  If they cannot encroach on any of this matter, then by all means they should say so.

The IDA has not verified the jobs yet.  This process is ongoing and evolving.  For the committee's benefit I have brought along a form.  Obviously when IDA celebrates its jobs number every year, it uses the annual employment survey to do so.  By way of illustration, and I hope nobody minds, there are two boxes on the form on which employers can write the number of their employees.</p><p>If they do not know the exact number, an estimate is sufficient.  As I said, there are two boxes to be completed.  The employer then signs the form and returns it to the IDA.  This is the ConnectIreland verification process, which members will note runs to two pages.  It is a 26 stage process which involves redacted bank statements, contracts of employment and post-six months probation information, which in the digital age involves a physical visit to Gweedore by one man based in Wilton Place in Dublin.  This is an enormously impractical verification process than can be improved.  In regard to the review, we would be suggesting to the people carrying out that review that the verification process be simplified.  We have very good ideas as to how that might be done.  I hope that clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></speech>

I am loth to speak on behalf of anyone other than ConnectIreland but it is fair to say that the Department and IDA also recognise that the verification process is extraordinarily laborious.  In many cases our client companies get no material benefit.  In most cases, they do not get grant aid.  They do not come here for that reason, rather they come here because Kinvara is the centre of the world.  To ask a company to step through a process from which they obtain no material benefit is not right.  With all due respect, these are busy people, scaling companies.  Regardless of how much they like ConnectIreland they have a job to do.  It is too much to expect of them.</p></speech>

Perhaps Ms Murphy would define "lead".  Is a "lead" a person within a company or the company itself?  Am I correct that if ConnectIreland has a lead in a company and the IDA also has a lead in the same company it is then that the red lighting process kicks in or is it that both agencies are chasing the same individual?</p></speech>

ConnectIreland is different in that its ambassadors are connected and they have business networks and relationships with the particular companies, which enable them to tell ConnectIreland whether there has been active dialogue in their experience.  Unfortunately, I cannot take this conversation any further because it is a topic that is currently under dispute.  ConnectIreland never envisaged working on any companies where the IDA already had traction and was making progress.  That is not our intention.  We only ever intended bringing new companies on board, particularly companies that fall outside the target sector.  It is important to point out that in terms of the work that we do, we are an additional and complementary service that assists smaller companies.  There is a gap in this area which we are only too happy to fill.  We are not competing with other agencies for the same companies.  That is not the correct characterisation of ConnectIreland.  We seek only to bring new leads to Ireland, of which our connectors become aware through their own business dealings and spread around the globe.</p></speech>

I was very interested in the information provided regarding the cost per job.  Ms Murphy stated that the cost in this regard via the ConnectIreland process is &euro;4,000 versus &euro;10,000 via the IDA process, which chimes with an article I read in the media some time ago - possibly, the Sunday Business Post  - that ConnectIreland is effectively seeking millions of euro from the IDA.</p></speech>

ConnectIreland is concerned only with ensuring that its connectors are treated fairly and appropriately.  We have run, with great pride and, I hope, with some dignity, this Government-backed programme.  Up to December last, Mr. Moran, through his connection, had brought 125 jobs to Gweedore, which is a beautiful part of the world on the edge of Ireland.  ConnectIreland is focused on ensuring that Mr. Moran, and all other connectors that have done as Ireland has asked them to do, are duly recognised.  I hope I have answered Deputy Rock's question.</p></speech>

The reward that he is entitled to under the Government programme is not forthcoming.</p><p>This is part of the financial element we are seeking on behalf of our connectors, so "yes" is the answer.  If there is a dispute, it is over whether this is a successful initiative.  It is a success-only model.  If we get no jobs in, it costs the State zero.  I do not know of any similar initiative or any contract under which the Government works in such a format, but this is what we proposed at the start, purely as a patriotic initiative, to help attract jobs into the country.  It is as simple as that and it is working.  We have built a network of 78,000 people around the world, and as of Sunday we will ask these people to stop sending us leads.  This does not make sense to me.  Why-----</p></speech>

I just wonder how many villages in rural Ireland will not get their SLMs as a result of the fact that it appears the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is prepared to see ConnectIreland lapse this Sunday.  When we hear the figure of 957 companies in the pipeline, any of us who knows how the IDA works - and I used to work with the IDA regularly in a previous life - knows there is no way in heaven the IDA will be able to take on that pipeline in any way.  Let us be absolutely honest about that.  I find it very disturbing.  We have all worked collegiately on Brexit and produced a report last week.  I must put on the record that I am absolutely bewildered that the Department could consider letting ConnectIreland lapse in the way it proposed to do so.  I hope all of us, despite our ideological differences, can agree that we cannot allow this to happen and I appeal to my colleagues in Fine Gael, in particular, to use their influence to ensure that something happens before Sunday because the real victims will be the people in rural Ireland.</p> <p>  I have two questions.  It is important to get a perspective on this.  Why did Mr. Clune set up this initiative in the first place?  I think he has put up &euro;5 million.  Given what he has experienced, would he do it again?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-21a.905" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Terry Clune" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017032100002#DD00600"><p>As to why it was set up, the Taoiseach in 2011 was seeking ideas as to how we might attract more jobs into the country.  I participated in a business talk in Kilkenny, where I live, and said to those present that we should use our contacts around the world.  A lady stood up to say she was a distant relative, going back 120 years, of the Coca-Cola family, who had left Callan, County Kilkenny, and went on to be one of the founding families of Coke.  She still has a distant connection she has never utilised.  She also said to us that within three of miles of where she lives, in Windgap in rural Kilkenny, lived the man who designed the White House, and within six miles of where he in turn lived, the grandfather of Walt Disney lived.  This elderly lady told us of her connections and the connections of those connections in this tiny region of rural Kilkenny, and it just struck me that we really should utilise these connections.</p> <p>  There has been much talk of the diaspora for several years.  I proposed my idea to the Taoiseach and he really liked the concept.  I also proposed that I would finance it at the start and get it up and running and that we would be paid back over time as we became successful.  I proposed that it would run as a break-even initiative, which is ultimately the way it is materialising now.  We now have a huge network of educated connectors who know about the project, people all around the world who are eyes and ears for the country and are keeping their eyes and ears open.  If they hear about companies that are expanding, they let us know.  We receive huge numbers of leads every day.  Not all of them convert or turn into jobs for Ireland, but the State does not have to pay in that case.  The State simply pays us a small amount, two and a half times less than the cost of the IDA, for each job we get into the country.  It is a success-only model, so I see absolutely no national advantage in shutting it down.  To answer the Senator's question, I set it up as a patriotic initiative and thought I could get it done.  We had not only a fantastic team led by Ms Murphy, but also a massively loyal network of connectors around the world that we have now built who help the country for nothing.  We give them an opportunity to help the country, and it is as simple as that.</p><p>Would I do it again?  Absolutely.  It works.  There are challenges with it so we would like very much to be involved with a review rather than it being this contract whereby we are a direct contractor to IDA Ireland.  It should be a public-private structure whereby one can use the best of the private sector and the innovation of entrepreneurs with the structure and infrastructure of the State organisation to get a job done.  Ultimately, that is what we are doing but there is a lot of opportunity to fix the structure and make it much more successful into the future.</p><p> What we would really like is that, as one of the Deputies suggested earlier, rather than closing it down on Sunday, the Department would take it over as a short-term measure and operate it or oversee it until the review is conducted and completed.  Based on the outcome of the review, either the Department would continue running it, IDA Ireland would run it or Enterprise Ireland would do so.  However, somebody would run it or else the Department would deduce at the end that this does not make sense.  Closing it down and then carrying out a review does not make sense and is not in the national interest.</p></speech>

We have sought exactly that for almost three years, non-stop.  However, it is worth noting our legal advice on this issue is that, because of the unique nature of this programme, it does not require a tender.  We have it from one of the pre-eminent procurement lawyers in the country that in time of national emergency, such as with Brexit and given the fact it is unique, that is not required.  However, ConnectIreland would have been, and still is, very happy to enter into a tender process in order to facilitate that.</p> <p>  ConnectIreland is not a business.  This thing does not make a profit; it is a not-for-profit entity.  However, it is a passionate, wonderfully vibrant community of people who all have one golden thread running through them, namely, an affinity toward Ireland.  It is not a case of them and us.  It is not a case of wanting to put down the State agent partners.  We want to work with them.  We want to unify more and become more collegiate.  We want them to find a way to work with us also, understanding that the number of jobs we bring is smaller than what they are used to and may not be as interesting to them as other announcements may be, but that they are vital for Ireland.  ConnectIreland is open to any single iteration that allows us to continue our good work and to facilitate rural job creation in Ireland.</p></speech>

It is a challenge to be here on a Tuesday morning.  This is a very important issue and I want to put on record that I have met representatives from ConnectIreland.</p> <p>  Although we want to conclude this meeting quickly, I am struck by a host of issues.  There is no doubt one of the great things Ireland has is an extraordinary network of people around the world who feel very passionate and strongly about the country.  What disturbs me most from what the witnesses had to say is an impression I get that we will be saying to the diaspora, to which we put out our hands at a time when the country was in crisis, "We are all right now thanks very much".  That would be very wrong.</p> <p>  I sincerely hope the Department will reconsider this situation and I will certainly be talking to the Minister about it.  I am fully aware of the fact that this is very different to the work ConnectIreland does, and that it is a case of no fee, no foal.  It is about providing better value for money in a different sort of way.  It is going for the smaller scale of one to ten, 20 or 30 jobs as opposed to IDA Ireland, which works in the hundreds and thousands.  We want to support IDA Ireland and that is fantastic.  I fully accept the witnesses' point that it is not a case of either-or but, rather, that it is both working in tandem.</p> <p>  In Swords yesterday, I visited a home-grown company that started off in 2010 with six people, that now employs 120 and that is going to invest &euro;25 million in order to increase its workforce to 400 over the next three years.  The company in question began with a turnover of &euro;40,000 and this has risen to &euro;220 million.  From the little acorn, the great oak doth grow.  There are hundreds of such companies and we want to support them.</p><p>As the Taoiseach once said, if every SME in the country just took on one extra employee we would have 80,000 off the dole immediately.  The small ones also work really well.  I know there are disputes over figures and I accept that it is not the full story, that the verification process is much more difficult from ConnectIreland's point of view and it is not the same verification process used by IDA Ireland in other areas.  We certainly do not want to lose 78,000 connections around the world.  Perhaps rather than having a relationship with IDA Ireland, ConnectIreland might look to having a relationship with Enterprise Ireland.  One way or the other, I would be very strongly in favour of ConnectIreland continuing.  I do not believe one should turn off the light before examining what will replace it or how it was working.  It should be left on.  I hope the Minister will take action.  We will certainly be lobbying her very strenuously to ensure that happens.</p></speech>

We have been enormously proud.  We talked about 82 new-name greenfield investments over the short life of the programme.  It is not quite five years yet.  We are so proud.  IDA Ireland is one of the most successful inward investment agencies in the world.  We are terribly proud to have been able to contribute 22% of its own new-name greenfield projects over the same timeframe.  I hope that in some way answers the question.  It has been very successful.  We would not want to do it if it was not.  It is an evolving thing.  For 14 months consecutively we have had job announcements every single month coming through the initiative, including smaller companies.  It works.</p></speech>

We were talking about the seeking of the money from IDA Ireland.  I am curious about that and I ask the witnesses to deal conclusively with that.  Newspapers reported figures in the millions.  From where is that derived?  What exactly is that?</p></speech>

We have now got 2,351 jobs approved.  As those jobs are created on the ground, it will trigger a payment of &euro;4,000.  I imagine that the figure has come from 2,351 multiplied by &euro;4,000.</p></speech>

However, if we add to that consideration that rather than multiplying it by &euro;4,000, we multiply it by &euro;10,500, we can very easily deduce how much we have actually saved the State.

That would have been the path of least resistance.  We do not wish to do that.  We seek to continue and to grow.  Every day we are blown away by people, such as the two gentlemen on my right hand side, who have chosen this country.  To reiterate, I do not believe that this is a them-and-us situation.  There is little wrong with this initiative that a few people in a room with a constructive frame of mind could not resolve in a number of hours.  Issues such as verification and red lighting can be resolved.  There is not much wrong with it.  It is okay that there are gaps and that these things did not exist.  The programme is new and, if members will excuse the phrase, one does not throw the baby out with the bathwater.  One figures out where the issues are and resolves them.  That is what ConnectIreland seeks to do, and that is why we did not trigger an arbitration.  We did not want to.  We want to continue on behalf of our network across the globe.  We feel enormously pressurised in the context of Monday.  How do we tell those companies?  What do we say to them?  We have not figured that out yet, to be honest.</p></speech>

That is what we will be saying.  We are at various levels of dialogue with 900 companies.  The IDA is a very successful organisation, but we have the ongoing relationships with these companies.  We have built them and we have the dialogue.  The IDA is not structurally able and I assume would not be in a position suddenly to take over 900 other new companies when it is already stretched enough.  Again, the cost of our initiative is pay on success only.  In the interim, we hope the Department will be able to step in for a short period and have an interim or temporary contract with us while the review is done.  It will see the good aspects and we can share the things that could be improved.  That is good for the country.</p></speech>

We need all the connectivity we can muster to remain in place.  I thank the witnesses for the work they have done and for all the jobs and goodwill they have brought as well as for cementing the connectivity with the diaspora.  The last message that should come from this meeting is, "Thanks very much, we are all right now."  The message we should convey is that we appreciate the tremendous patriotism and connectivity of the people who have left this country, we value it above and beyond jobs and that it is something we want to grow and flourish in good times as well as bad.  Although we are in a much better place than we were previously, we still need all that connectivity.  It works both ways.  Much goodwill and many possibilities can flow back to the countries that make the connections here.  I thank the witnesses and assure them we will lobby the Minister very hard on this.  We want the message to go back to the 78,000 connections, and to the many more it is hoped the organisation will make, that we appreciate and value them, regardless of the jobs side of it.</p></speech>

It is a great pity and a great contrast that while ConnectIreland is here and giving us answers, the Minister and the IDA are not present.

Its endeavours have been very worthwhile.  I thank Ms Murphy for her efforts.  She has worked extremely hard for the past few years, especially in the past three months, to ensure that ConnectIreland will still be working for Ireland next Monday.</p> <p>  I thank Mr. Moran and Mr. Salam for connecting with each other and bringing jobs to Gweedore in County Donegal.  We like to hear such news as we all have rural and urban areas in our constituencies.  It is fantastic to see jobs created in a rural part of Gweedore.  Both men are more than welcome to bring jobs to County Waterford.  </p></speech>
