Today we are dealing with an overview of the credit union sector, that is, the report by the credit union advisory committee, CUAC, of June 2016 entitled, Review of the Implementation of the Recommendations of the Commission on Credit Unions Report.  We are joined by a number of witnesses, all of whom are very welcome.  The committee has previously met representatives of each of the pillar banks.  This week, the committee will engage with the key players in the credit union sector, which again is hugely important.  We will begin our meeting with statements, but before that I want to bring attention to the fact that witnesses are advised that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I invite the witnesses to make their opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-21a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Annmarie O'Connor" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017032100002#B00200"><p>The Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, welcomes this opportunity to appear before the committee.  First, I wish to note that huge work has been done inside the credit union movement over the last number of years and that is evidenced in the CUAC report.  In our view that must now pay a social dividend for members and their communities.  MABS works very closely with the credit union movement and has done since its foundation and that work remains very important to MABS and its clients.  We have made a detailed submission and I will summarise some of the points now.<br/><br/>Credit unions are a route to social and economic progression for individuals, households and communities.  They enable progression between significant stages of life.  Short-term lending does not always support that key objective.  We concur with the view expressed in the CUAC report that section 35 needs to be reviewed.  We also believe that mutuality, combined with appropriate regulation and strong corporate governance, offers a potential solution to some of the difficulties in the mortgage market and is worthy of further consideration. <br/><br/>When we last appeared before the committee in 2012, our main concerns related to financial and social inclusion.  We note that there is very little reference in the CUAC report to the issue of financial inclusion and wonder therefore what progress has been made since the commission reported.  I will talk about the personal microcredit pilot scheme later. <br/><br/>A credit union exists only to serve its members and not to profit from their needs.  In MABS we are seeing more broadly in the credit market a movement of decision making about credit moving further and further away from the people and the communities concerned.  We also have a concern that big data and data analytics will come to replace rather than reinforce the relationships of measured mutual trust that are a cornerstone of good lending. <br/><br/>We previously highlighted the need for a robust assessment to underpin lending decisions and in that regard we welcome the new credit register, which will come on stream later this year. <br/><br/>In our experience it is borrowers in their mid-years who most often find themselves in financial difficulty and we believe that if a member and their credit union can re-engage on a pragmatic basis during an arrears difficulty, there is scope for long years of highly productive engagement for the future.  More broadly we have a concern about the credit market to the effect that the outsourcing of loan books and of collections to third parties could cause a permanent severing of those important relationships between members and credit unions and could have an adverse impact on credit unions.<br/><br/>We note from the CUAC report that the potential for remuneration of voluntary board members has been mooted by some respondents.  We would be concerned if this added to transaction costs within the movement or indeed displaced the contribution that is currently made by volunteers free of charge. <br/><br/>As regards lending, there is a need for balance in making good lending decisions yet not being so risk-averse that regulatory systems and processes serve to prevent credit unions from granting loans to people who need credit. <br/><br/>The continued prevalence of licensed moneylending in Ireland is symptomatic of a failure to provide attractive, affordable and life-enhancing products and services to low income borrowers.  We would like to highlight the early success of the &quot;It Makes Sense&quot; loan, which is currently being rolled out by more than 100 credit unions.  It is an excellent first step and we are getting lots of positive feedback but it needs to make a much larger and deeper imprint on Irish society to become a competitor product to the doorstep lender.  An important feature of its success is that it is a highly branded loan and such brand recognition is very important.  There is scope within the credit union movement to roll out a core suite of easily recognisable and strongly branded products such as the &quot;It Makes Sense&quot; loan and that would enable it to attract greater market share.The use of the doorstep lender and moneylender is a type of high-cost overdraft which is relied on by low-income borrowers on an ongoing basis.  The view of MABS is that a similar low-cost alternative should be available via the credit union, with borrowers having access to revolving pre-approved credit to a certain limit at an affordable cost.  Obviously regulatory issues would have to be explored.  On a related point, if we are serious about financial inclusion, loans that are successfully repaid to a licensed moneylender should be recorded in the new credit register and thereby enable those clients to have a stepping stone back into mainstream credit provision<br/><br/>I would like to mention our new service, the dedicated mortgage arrears advice service within MABS.  We have already helped 3,000 borrowers who are in late-stage mortgage arrears and 20%<i></i>of these borrowers also owe debts to credit unions.  The casework is often characterised by family tragedy, relationship breakdown, illness and mental health difficulties.  These clients absolutely must prioritise the payment of their home mortgage.  We also recognise that an appropriate balance must be achieved between the legitimate interests of all creditors but that this should be happening at a far earlier stage, well before the point at which the borrower or member is at risk of losing his or her home. <br/><br/><b></b>On insolvency, we believe it is a fact that some loans will never be repaid in full and insolvency is a tool which enables everyone to move on.  MABS has a particular interest in debt relief notices.  The throughput to this solution has been far lower than anybody had anticipated.  Many eligible clients do not proceed because of their allegiance to their credit union and its members.  Others are discouraged because they do not wish to damage their future prospects of borrowing from a credit union as they know what the alternative may be.  That process needs to work much better.<br/><br/>We have a concern also about younger members and the tailoring of credit union products to suit the income patterns of young people.  Their employment can often be fragile and their income unpredictable.  We need a suite of products that suits their needs. <br/><br/><b></b>In terms of<b></b>financial capability, credit unions have a very important role in increasing members&rsquo; understanding of credit union products.  However, information is not enough.  We need to have a capable and financially literate consumer population.<br/><br/>There is a problem with complexity, in MABS's view, which is emerging across a whole range of markets, including utilities, insurance, savings and mortgage markets as competition increases.  This is a wider socio-economic development but it underscores the important role of the credit unions and the lasting relationships it forges with individual members and within their communities. <br/><br/>I would like to raise a concern that is reflected on page 59 of the CUAC report around the future business model for the sector and that there remains considerable ambiguity about business model development within the sector.An element of stasis seems to have set in with regard to the vision for the credit union movement, yet at the same time we are witnessing a proliferation of new entrants to the Irish credit market.<br/><br/>We need a strong, capable credit union sector with a recognisable and accessible service offering that is designed around the needs of its membership, including in particular those on low incomes. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-21a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian McCrory" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017032100002#B00300"><p>I thank members for inviting us here today and for putting credit unions on the agenda of the committee.  We in the Irish League of Credit Unions comprise 390 credit unions from across the entire island of Ireland.  There are 297 credit unions in the Republic of Ireland affiliated to the league and 93 in Northern Ireland.  My background of over 35 years involvement in the credit union movement is in Belfast, with the Belfast Teachers Credit Union, which operates across all of Northern Ireland, and with the SAG Credit Union, which is anchored in the heart of West Belfast.  I am also vice president of the World Council of Credit Unions.  I am accompanied here today by Mr. Ed Farrell, the CEO of the Irish League of Credit Unions.</p> <p>  Before the last general election the league set out a succinct policy programme entitled Six Strategic Steps.  One of those six steps is for credit unions to feature on a recurring basis on the agenda of this committee.</p><p>Credit unions are a vibrant, innovative movement that do a lot now, but critically are positioned to do a lot more for communities and our country.  There is a mismatch between our capacity and willingness on one hand, and the willingness and capacity of those with policy and regulatory responsibility to partner with us.  In seeking to put our business on the committee's agenda, we are looking for champions who will deliver change that will enable credit unions become a much more dynamic force.</p><p> Where credit unions have found partners, we have made progress.  In this regard I positively single out the Department of Social Protection.  Moneylending is a social scourge.  It blights communities and doubles down on the financial exclusion of the poorest.  In partnership with the Department and with MABS, the "It Makes Sense" loan scheme is now being rolled out nationally.  It is making a difference to communities.  It is very much part of our social ethos and we are very proud to be part of that.  Where we can find partners to work with, we have a track record of delivering.</p><p> On the critical issue of funding for social housing, the then Government in its 2014 policy document, Social Housing Strategy 2020, looked to credit unions for funds.  We responded with a very detailed policy paper setting out how that could be delivered in ways that would allow all credit unions to contribute via a centralised vehicle that underpins the credit union ethos and ensures effective regulatory oversight.  The response has been very positive.  Regrettably, several years later the delivery to date has been nil.</p><p> Today's agenda specifically deals with the CUAC report.  This review was set up in response to the league's campaign and the implementation group has been established on foot of the review.  The implementation group has met once.  Effectively its first substantive meeting will be tomorrow.  Its programme of work stretches over months.  We hope this process will deliver substantive policy change that will be mirrored by appropriate regulatory change.  We will be involved in it and we will work hard.  However, we are concerned that this process is as much about time management as change management.  Volunteers in credit unions ask me if this is just another hop on the merry-go-round.</p><p> Credit unions need sustained political support.  We need this committee to pursue credit union issues forensically and continually.  In 2015 we campaigned hard to persuade the Minister for Finance to pause and review before bringing into force the remaining sections of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012, prior to implementation of CP88, the Central Bank's latest regulations.  The Minister, however, would not pause.  The last effective control of the Oireachtas over credit unions was handed over at midnight on New Year's Eve 2015.  Now, we have had a review, followed by an implementation process in circumstances where the capacity of the Department of Finance, via the Central Bank, regarding credit unions is unclear.</p><p> The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government has advised that it is very interested in our proposal on social housing.  Given that the Department elicited it in the first place, it should be.  That Department is in turn in discussion with the Department of Finance, which we are led to believe is in discussion with the Central Bank.  While I have no doubt such conversations are taking place, I doubt whether any action will ever arise as a consequence.</p><p> We have much more to give to communities.  We have resources and have a national network, but we are also challenged.  On the one hand we must develop our business model, and we are rightly reminded of this by the regulatory authority.  However, we are caught in a Bermuda Triangle where we must develop but regulatory approval has not been forthcoming for the changes we wish to adopt.  We receive political encouragement from the Oireachtas that ironically handed over nearly all effective responsibility to the Central Bank.</p><p> There are crying needs in our communities.  The Irish League of Credit Unions has developed a number of policies on how change can come, many of which the committee members will have seen prior to today.  However, change will not happen and credit unions will not realise their potential unless there is sustained political involvement that effectively connects better policy with more appropriate regulation.  Our hope is that today is the beginning of that process, which unlike others, will be short and purposeful.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-21a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Molan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017032100002#C00200"><p>I thank the members for the opportunity to address the committee on the important issues of credit union sectoral overview and the CUAC report.  CUMA is the organisation for senior credit union managers, CEOs, chief financial officers, risk managers, compliance managers etc.  CUMA has been a proactive participant on the commission and the credit union restructuring board.  Our managers have carried much of the burden of change arising from the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 and other legislative requirements.  This transition has come at a time of great upheaval in the economy.  At the same time, credit unions have remained by far the most popular deliverers of service in Ireland.</p> <p>  The most recent statistics in the report, Financial Condition of Credit Unions 2011-2016, show that credit unions have come through that period very well.  In that period average surplus grew from &euro;320,000 to &euro;730,000, average return on assets grew from 0.87% to 1.22%, average arrears fell from 18.15% to 9.69%, and reserves grew from 13.35% to 16.48%.</p> <p>  The credit union sector in future will be a mixture of large credit unions, many with their origins in mergers, and smaller credit unions.  Credit unions will continue to have a vital role in the communities they serve, particularly in light of recent and future bank branch and post office closures.</p> <p>  The CUAC report is timely and accurate.  Attention is drawn to areas that have been ignored to the significant disadvantage of credit unions and of their members.  Tiered regulation, proportionate to the scale and risk in each credit union, has not been delivered.  This was a key deliverable of the commission report.  Consultation and engagement have been less consistent and transparent than was originally envisaged by the commission.  Consultation was expected to be meaningful, with clear impact analysis forming the basis for significant changes.  Where consultation has been triggered, sector views have often been ignored, as was the case with CP88.</p><p> When it comes to engagements between individual credit unions and the Central Bank, service level agreements do not currently exist.  Response times from the Central Bank can be overlong, resulting in indefinite delays around the holding of credit union AGMs and other processes.  Where significant issues arise, the American model of &ldquo;prompt corrective action&rdquo; is preferable to repetitive and expensive studies by various consultancy firms.</p><p> A one-size-fits-all approach to regulatory directives can have very significant adverse impacts on a credit union, both short-term and long-term.  Blanket lending restrictions on credit unions caused a loss of lending relationships for many years, from which we are still suffering.  Restructuring has gone some way to delivering changes necessary to deliver better services.  We acknowledge the work of ReBo, the restructuring board.  However, we now fear that restructuring will stall and we believe the legislative framework for restructuring needs to be revisited.</p><p> Business model development is the responsibility of credit unions.  No other sector is as constrained from innovation as credit unions are under sections 48 to 52 of the Act.  The Central Bank&rsquo;s role should be to have clear frameworks available so development proposals are dealt with in a more structured, timely and appropriate manner.  Statutory Instrument No. 1 of 2016 limits our capacity to develop.  For instance, the hard-coding of a 10% minimum regulatory reserve requirement puts us at a significant disadvantage in regard to banks.  There are significant prescriptions on lending in the instrument, including limits on community lending, commercial lending and mortgage lending.  Meaningful consultation and a regulatory impact analysis in all cases would have made for better regulation and allowed a more varied approach to business model development to take place.</p><p> It is time these many areas and others are addressed.  We look forward to engagement with CUAC and the implementation committee on the issues outlined.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-21a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Johnson" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017032100002#D00200"><p>CUDA is grateful to the committee for inviting us to this meeting.  CUDA was formed in 2003.  It is owned by 12 credit unions and currently has 43 of the most professional and progressive credit unions among its members, which in turn mange one third of the total credit union assets of &euro;16 billion.  Over the past ten years the financial landscape of Ireland has changed dramatically with the collapse, bailout or closure of every single banking institution in Ireland.  It is important to note that of the 420 credit unions that existed in 2007, only two were liquidated and three were subject to directed transfers.  Although any one credit union closed is one too many, the committee will take comfort in the fact this represents some 1% of those which were in operation, with 99% coming through the crisis intact.</p> <p>  In recent years we have become more consolidated, stronger and smarter credit unions.  However, without Oireachtas support to get rules changed to allow credit unions broaden their business, they will not survive.  It will surprise committee members to learn that although this is a success story, the regulation that has come into force over the last decade on savings, loans and payments systems has resulted in credit unions being permitted to do less business now than they could ten years ago.  This is neither proportionate nor fair, and it can only lead to marginalisation of credit unions as an effective force in lending if this is allowed to continue.  We need the help of the Oireachtas to put this right.</p> <p>  The first slide outlines a clear vision that shows credit unions as capable of being the financial hub of their community, offering real choice to people and being a meaningful alternative to banks.  We are doing this by building on the qualities that have made credit unions so successful and earned members' trust and loyalty by being there for them and consistently being on their side, whether they are simply trying to cope with the financial challenges of life or trying to achieve their ambitions for home ownership or financial security.  Unless we are allowed to compete, however, members will continue to be deprived of best value.</p> <p>  The next slide sets out the legal objects of a credit union.  I draw attention to object (b), which refers to the creation of sources of credit, not just personal unsecured loans, for the mutual benefit of its members.  This means that where a credit union can prudently and compliantly provide loans, it will also be able to reward its savers, who are in danger of having their needs overlooked.  It is clear credit unions are about the optimisation of surplus to improve the well-being and spirit of the members and their community, rather than maximisation of profit for a small number of privileged people, as we see in other institutions.</p> <p>  The fourth slide sets out some key figures that demonstrate the success, the financial strength and the popularity of credit unions.  The growth in savings has driven a significant increase in the level of investments, and with credit unions being forced into bank deposits to meet regulatory liquidity requirements, banks now appear to be taking advantage of that situation and charging for such deposits.  This is a very serious threat that needs to be addressed by allowing more lending and wider investment classes for credit unions.</p> <p>  The following slide shows that consumer preference was again evidenced last year, as it was in 2015, through an independent survey of 37,000 customer experiences where people recognised that credit unions provide the best customer experience across all industries in Ireland.  Other research has also demonstrated that people would like to see credit unions provide more services.  We want to do this to ensure people get what they need when they need it and how they need it, and in a fair and equitable way.</p> <p>  At CUDA we have made real progress in helping credit unions strengthen their governance by complying with the absolute barrage of new legislation and regulation while they also continue to provide services, albeit within the 2016 regulations that impose severe caps on the levels of business that can be done.  Our work through the solutions centre includes supporting credit unions to provide home loans to their members in a fully compliant and prudent manner, something that those who are building such capabilities should be allowed to do more of.  However, credit unions need the help of the Oireachtas Members.  There is a wonderful opportunity for Oireachtas Members to enable credit unions to contribute to solving the housing crisis.  They collectively have the power to make a simple amendment to the Credit Union Act 1997 that will enable credit unions to collectively lend to approved housing bodies and local authorities for social and affordable housing projects, as set out in slide No. 7.  They can urge the Central Bank authorities to substantially extend lending limits where capabilities and financial strength exist, given short-term lending alone is inadequate for their survival.  They can also urge them to enhance the classes of investments; for example, we submitted draft regulations, as set out in slides Nos. 8 and 9, to allow credit unions to invest in funds for housing-related purposes.  The third way Members can help us is by keeping credit unions on their agenda.  The CUAC review and the findings in its report, as set out in slide No. 10, are simply a reflection of the regulatory failure to implement these issues as recommended by the Commission of Credit Unions in the first place.  Members should remember that their involvement clearly drives action.</p> <p>  In conclusion, the effect of the new regulatory rules without proportionality relegates credit unions to compete in less than 10% of the Irish credit market.  Yet, we have the capital, competency and community from which we can compete on a fair playing pitch with other lenders.  The effect of existing rules is like asking us to win an all-Ireland while marginalising our team to staying inside its square, and at the same time allowing competitors free rein over the remaining 90% of the pitch.  The outcome of such actions will be plain for all to see.  As we meet these needs, we need to broaden our range of lending options by way of loan periods and rates.  To do this we seek to work co-operatively with the Oireachtas and with regulators on behalf of all in this State.  This is community building, state building and fairness in action, nothing more.  We need the assistance of the Oireachtas to mobilise efforts to do this work immediately and, in doing so, this will allow credit unions to help families finance their homes, improve their lives and breathe life back into their communities.</p></speech>

At this stage we are old friends and have been dealing with each other over many years.  To cut to the heart of it, there was a report recently in one of the newspapers, perhaps the<i>Irish Examiner</i>, that credit unions were refusing deposits and did not wish to take in deposits.</p><p>Is that reflective of the views of the credit unions on the ground?  </p></speech>

As funds come into the credit union, it can lend them out or invest them.  Due to the very strict liquidity requirements and the very restrictive classes of investments, it effectively means putting it on deposit.  One bank announced in early January that it was going to apply a negative rate, in other words, it was going to charge credit unions 0.25% for the privilege of keeping their funds there.  That was rapidly followed by another large bank, a State-owned one, that increased that to a negative 40 basis points.  Between that and the withdrawal of some of the banks from the market, it is a serious compression on the counter parties available to credit unions.  Unless we get the rules changed and allow credit unions to compete and offer more services, their options about what to do with that money are seriously compressed.</p></speech>

Typically, the money would have been on deposit with the local bank.  That was the traditional model as I understood it and I have been a member of a credit union for virtually my entire adult life.  I want to tease out the practicalities.  Could Mr. Molan tease out what happens if someone comes into a credit union with &euro;10,000 they inherited or in savings?  I want to understand the implications of that for the capacity of the credit union to function and lend money.  Could Mr. Molan distill it down because it may be a bit abstract for some people?</p></speech>

A 10% reserve requirement is imposed on credit unions.  This has a significant cost at this stage.  That reserve requirement has been hard coded under SI No. 1 of 2016.  We have no option but to meet those reserve requirements and if a credit union falls below them, it is in trouble with the regulator.  If it falls sufficiently low, it is in severe difficulty.  This is an actual cost that is visited upon a credit union.  Many members have a preference and such is the popularity of credit unions that many members see it as their primary savings institution.  Again, because of the local nature of credit unions, it is a significant factor for them.  My colleague from MABS spoke about social inclusion.  At present, a significant number of people in this country are unbanked and a significant number of people in this country have a preference-----</p></speech>

The fact that credit unions are refusing to take deposits from the ordinary person goes against all the principles of the credit union movement.

The bottom line is that a number of credit unions have taken a decision to put a cap on savings inflow for prudential reasons.  We should bear in mind that in the same statutory instrument, the Central Bank imposed a blanket cap of &euro;100,000 on all credit unions in the country.</p></speech>

It is not a case of refusing savings from any individual member.  The sad part of it is that it is reflective of the restrictive nature of the credit union that it cannot utilise those funds in a prudent and provident manner.  We mentioned the ability to lend for housing projects earlier.  If we had that simple amendment either to the class of investment or indeed to the Credit Union Act, the funds would be welcomed and members of credit unions would be delighted to see their savings put to very prudent and provident use.</p></speech>

If it is taking in money, it is taking in stock.  Unless that stock is going out the front door in some shape or form, there is no point in continuing to stock the shop.  It then takes the prudential decision to stop buying the stock until it can deal effectively with what it already has.  Through restrictions on who they can lend money to, the amount, the nature of the person, etc., credit union lending has deteriorated over a number of years since 2015 because of an edict from the Central Bank as to the circumstances in which a credit union can lend money to an individual.  There is a direct correlation between the decline in lending and that.</p> <p>  As Mr. Johnson also said, it is about the opportunity to be able to invest funds in other programmes that can earn a social dividend and a capital dividend for the credit union and the community at large.  Those opportunities are denied to us.  We are forced to become wholesale collection agencies for banks to have our moneys on deposit.  The people who benefit from that are the banks, not the community and not the citizens of this country who have amassed billions that are sitting on deposit.  </p></speech>

If they take in an extra &euro;10,000, an extra &euro;1,000 has to be reserve capitalised by the credit union.  Their own earnings are their only form of capital.  They are not allowed to inter-bank borrow, borrow on markets or issue bonds.  It is a full asset.  There is no risk rating.  Our capital regime is much higher of a requirement than the banking one would be so we have to have a 10% reserve on our total assets.  The banks have to have a 10% reserve on a risk weighting of their assets, which in effect would probably be about half our capital requirement.  In terms of the extra moneys, which we are only going to take in from the people as the bank branches close in the towns, if we are going to put it on deposit with a pillar bank or into a Government bond, why make us have a 10% capital reserve requirement on it?  The money is going into a risk free environment so we could mind the money for the people at a very small or zero interest rate, and they understand the interest rates as well - if that much greater capital requirement was not on us and the money it is going into is risk free.  We could mind the money.  We would not make money on it but at least it would stop the people having to go elsewhere, which goes against our grain, and theirs.</p></speech>

The Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU, summed it up as being a mismatch between what they are willing and able to do and the capacity of the policy makers and the regulators to match that willingness.  The committee will hear from the Department and the regulator on Thursday and we know they will speak about their responsibility to ensure the prudent management of the sector to protect members.  Do the witnesses believe this is what they are really concerned about or do they believe they are pursuing a wider policy goal?  Are the actions of the Department and the Central Bank compatible with their members' vision of a modern credit union sector?  What needs to be changed on their side?  Do they believe their side has made the changes necessary to adapt to the demands of the credit union sector in 2017?  Do they have confidence in the Central Bank and the Department as partners going forward or do they believe we need to examine the entire regulatory structure?

On social housing, we gave an example, albeit it was Government policy, of an ask from Government for credit union funding to be made available for social housing and a willingness on our behalf to engage with that.  It was the 2014 report to which the president referred.  Almost three years later, we are frustrated at the lack of a way of getting that done.  We need the Departments of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and Finance, the Central Bank and the various arms of the State to figure out a way to get this social housing proposal done, which is Government policy.  The credit unions have stepped up to the plate, as it were.  Many regulatory requirements were placed on credit unions in the 2012 legislation following the commission report and everyone acknowledges, including the CUAC report from last July, that the governance regime in credit unions in Ireland now is as good as it is in any credit union movement anywhere in the world.  Credit unions have stood up but to go back to Mr. Johnson's point on the investments and the lending side of the equation, the rules behind the business side of the house and the balance sheets have not been moved in the expected manner.  There is a huge degree of frustration among credit union people about that.  They have done the hard work.  At all times we encouraged the arms of the State to get together to find the channels and unlock any blockages to get these very important projects for the people of Ireland moving across the line.</p></speech>

That is why we had the review published last June.  Do the witnesses believe the review's recommendations to set up the implementation body might have been an error as they allowed the Government and the Central Bank to stall on any other recommendations until it was set up, which as we know is happening now, nine months after it was published?  What recommendations do they believe the implementation body needs to prioritise?</p></speech>

When the Senator says that the report of 2012 is largely unimplemented, that is not necessarily accurate.  Our concern and frustration is that all the parts of it that related to the governance and prudential rules were implemented.  What heightens our frustration is that prior to the commission report credit unions could do more for their members in their community than they can today.</p><p>What we are looking for is that <i>quid pro quo</i>.  The strength and governance is all in place and credit unions have embraced that.  It has not been easy because implementation continues to be challenging and expensive.  It heightens the cost of delivering a service to members.<br/><br/>On the other side of it are items such as the full review of lending limits.  Instead of that taking place, we got another layer of limits, by category, imposed on us and fewer options on investments.  I commend the credit union advisory committee, CUAC, for its honest report and for highlighting the seven areas which were not implemented.  It is not a matter of cherry-picking one or two of them.  There are a suite of changes that need to take place.<br/><br/>We are all conscious, not just the Central Bank, of protecting members&rsquo; savings.  It is constantly put to us as if the credit unions were not aware of that.  Of course we are aware of it.  That is our primary objective.  It is all about the prudent and provident use of those savings for the betterment of the whole community.  I would not pick one particular recommendation.  The CUAC and the implementation group have to get on with dealing with those outstanding issues and ensuring that they are all implemented this time.  As I said in the opening statement, it only exists because they were not implemented the first time.  That is why we ask the committee to keep credit unions firmly on its agenda.  We would love the committee to play a monitoring role to ensure these things happen properly.</p></speech>

Coming from a rural community, I know the role they play in tackling social inclusion, addressing poverty and many other issues that affect communities.  The credit union movement is crucial in that regard and will be even more crucial going forward.  If credit unions are allowed to fulfil their true potential in rural, as well as urban, communities, we all will have a lot to gain.</p></speech>

I am trying to reconcile the gap between the Central Bank, the Department of Finance and the individual member of a credit union, as represented by these groups today.  If I start with Consultation Paper 76 - or CP76 - my understanding was that the representative organisations made specific proposals on tiered regulation.  I note the point made by Mr. Tim Molan of CUMA earlier:</p><blockquote>Tiered regulation, proportionate to the scale and risk in each credit union, has not been delivered.  This was a key deliverable of the commission report.  Consultation and engagement have been less consistent and transparent than was originally envisaged &hellip;  Where consultation has been triggered, sector views have often been ignored, as was the case with CP88.</blockquote> <p>I want to drill further into that dynamic.  I read the speech by the Registrar of Credit Unions to the CUMA spring conference.  Objectively, one would think that, from a regulatory point of view, the issues raised by her in that speech seem to apply to many credit unions.  If there are still outliers in the system that are not ticking all the regulatory boxes from a legislative point of view, should they be dealt in one parcel, while those credit unions, whether they are large or involved in the hub-and-spoke model, are allowed to progress into areas such as payment accounts, debit cards, longer term lending and investment in social housing?  Is it the case that the Central Bank is trying to apply a one-size-fits-all approach?  If that is the case, will that hamper the ability of the credit union movement to progress in lending for productive, social and other purposes?</p></speech>

At the time, the commission envisaged a three-tier regulatory approach.  In CP76, issued by the Central Bank in late 2013, a two-tiered regulatory approach was proposed.  The tiers were supposed to be around the level of risk and complexity that would be involved.  All three representative associations were in favour of a tiered approach to regulation.  It never happened, however.  That is part and parcel of why, for instance, this CUAC report is being debated.  Generally, there are several downsides to the one-size-fits-all approach.  First, it overburdens the small credit unions, and, second, it restricts the ability of the larger credit unions to innovate.  Innovation is absolutely key to the future for us.  The whole area of tiered regulation has to be addressed by this committee.  Other than that, we are just going to stagnate.</p></speech>

I read her speech to the CUMA conference in which she addressed issues such as everyday payment accounts.  She stated:</p><blockquote>[T]he market is not large enough to support multiple offerings of the same products and services, but that limit is not one confined to one service model.  So far, we have not received any formal applications beyond MPCAS, although our sectoral engagement suggests that this is an area of active interest.</blockquote> <p>If the credit union movement is talking about innovating and the potential for payment accounts, how does that work its way through the system?  What does that mean from the credit union movement's perspective?</p></speech>

The regulator should be there to regulate - full stop.  If one considers how the system is currently constituted, the regulator essentially dictates who is in the chair, who will manage, who might be on the board, to whom one can lend, the amount one can lend, the reasons for which one can lend, the duration of one's investment, the nature of one's investment and the amount one has on call by way of cash.  We proudly espouse our status as a democratic movement.  This has essentially been stolen from members because that democracy no longer exists.  We do not even have the wherewithal or the freedom to call an AGM or a meeting of our members because the bank can decide not to allow us to do so.</p></speech>

I think the legislation provides for a stay of nine months, but in many instances in the past and currently, that has been exceeded.</p></speech>

We are trying to get a better understanding of this.  As I said, it is still about the gaps that exist.  Mr. McCrory has already articulated a gap in respect of CP88 and spoken about the indefinite delays in the holding of AGMs.  What the average member wants to know is why this is the case.  How do we close this gap?  The theme of the registrar's speech was &quot;Mind the Gap&quot;.  She referred to:</p><blockquote>- Your current v. your needed level of regulatory compliance.  Given some of the issues we have found in recent supervisory engagements, I could characterize this as &quot;Mind the basics&quot;, and<br /><br />- the sector's current business model and capability, and the ambitious proposed or evolving business models, which often carry very much different risks and capabilities.</blockquote> <p>There is then still a massive gap between how the registrar perceives the Credit Union Managers Association and how the organisation perceives itself.  Somewhere in between, we are trying to see if we can broker or mediate that gap, and in broad terms there seems to be a long way to go.  On the face of it, the registrar seems, if I am reading the speech correctly, to put a major limit on the issue of the payment accounts and debit cards.  She seems to suggest a major curbing of one's enthusiasm, for want of a better expression, in respect of long-term lending.  She is very reticent, if I interpret her correctly - and she will have a chance to respond to these comments on Thursday - on the investment in social housing.</p><p>In addition, I have a difficulty understanding the issues regarding section 35.  No review has yet been undertaken, even though we are technically out of recession, on the section 35 rescheduling restrictions because individual impacted members - and this is based on anecdotal evidence - are back in work and have continuing borrowing requirements in excess of the emergency amounts allowed under the regulations.  Again, the question on my mind is whether it takes a legislative change to amend this or whether a cultural change is needed within the Central Bank to broker that.  I hope that makes sense.</p></speech>

Moving away from prudential and regulatory matters, the gap, as we perceive it, is between what the members need and what the credit unions can provide.  That is the biggest and most important gap.  As we are aware, nature abhors a vacuum, and when that gap exists, our concern is that others will enter the market, and others have been entering the market.  As we perceive it from the outside, there are fewer constraints on those new entrants to the market than exist on the credit unions.  We have a concern about section 35, which we have mentioned.  We are all living longer and we all work longer.  Long-term lending, therefore, needs to match these requirements.  That is a big issue for us.  We know there have been amalgamations in the credit union sector but the credit unions have long-lived relationships with their communities, and we are concerned that some of the new entrants do not have such long-lived relationships with borrowers.  People are therefore experiencing a real gap day by day in what they need from credit unions.</p></speech>

There is diversity and variety within the credit union movement, and the gap arises when a one-size-fits-all approach is taken.  The problem is that there will not be an average, so everybody is probably suffering.  These matters of proportionality and regulations that match the nature, scale and complexity of the individual credit union are set out in the legislation.

That attitude has deteriorated over the years since the Central Bank took over the regulation of the credit union movement.  There are thousands of volunteers and staff in credit unions working hard every day to keep their 3 million members serviced well.  All these regulatory and governance improvements have been made since the 2012 Act, yet this is the thanks or the praise we get.  Also frustrating is that all during the CP88 campaign, all the representative bodies went to long yards to stress that the Central Bank had said the current business model is broken and not viable.  However, not only do the CP88 rules not allow enhancement to business and services, but they actually reduce and restrict the investments and lending, as we said earlier.  We therefore all agreed we would have to do new things, yet the new rules allowed less than the current rules, and certainly not new things.</p></speech>

The Central Bank is often keen to quote international comparisons.  The reality is that many of the international movements were created on the basis and experience of the Irish movement; the sad reality is that they have been allowed to pass us at speed.</p><p>One third of their book is SME lending, one third of it may well be unsecured personal lending and the other third is either in the form of supporting social housing or other social objectives.  The credit union movement in Ireland has been curtailed from evolving.  It is not that long ago since the Minister for Finance stood up in the House and said that he foresaw a time when the credit union movement would be the third pillar of financial institutions on the island of Ireland, but I have yet to see action that would enable that to happen.</p></speech>

Much of what happened in the North by way of decline has been caused by uncertainty, that is, economic uncertainty, the fragility of the market and at one stage there was the threat of the withdrawal of British Government funding.  Much of the North's employment base is, essentially, Government-funded.  Had that funding gone, peoples' job security and associated securities would have disappeared with it.  There was a reluctance to borrow, and following the financial crisis, there was a tendency for people to consolidate their household moneys and to reduce their outgoings.

They would be very modest dividends because the European Central Bank rate is zero, but most credit unions would be paying modest dividends linked to the ECB rate of less than 0.5%.

However, one must bear in mind that there are attendant benefits <i>in situ</i>for credit union members that have not been expanded upon.  For example, in the ILCU and some other credit unions, members' debts die with them.  Savings are doubled on death, and in the ILCU, in the event of accidental death, savings are trebled.  The credit union provides a death benefit grant in many instances.  These are not benefits that one will find in any other lending institution but they are part of our operating costs.  Those costs are not borne by the members</p></speech>

When others appear, the rhetoric is that they are simply trying to protect members' savings and that we are not trying to do that.  On the contrary, we are there, first and foremost, to protect members' savings.  We try to afford members the opportunity to reinvest their money in their local communities, whether through social housing, SME lending or some other way to empower the community, such as unsecured personal landing.  Such people are not being afforded that opportunity and there needs to be radical change in the mindsets of the people who regulate and govern.</p></speech>

Lending limits were embedded in section 35 of the 1997 Act but this was replaced by a provision giving the regulator the authority to set the limits.  In the commission report, the expectation was that in transferring that authority from legislation into regulation there would be a thorough review and that under the tiered regime some credit unions would be allowed to do more.  In fact, the existing term rules found their way into the regulations and concentration limits, based on different categories of loans, were placed on top of them.  A lot of these rules resided in the legislation but are now the remit of the regulator.</p></speech>

We have had a couple of meetings with his officials since then, such as one nearly a year ago on social housing at the time of the formation of the current Government.  A lot of action and work were promised and the Department of Finance, the Department of the Environment and the Central Bank were engaged to push on with social housing following requests by Independent Deputies who were in talks about the formation of a Government at the time.  Despite the urgency of that time and meetings of those three bodies with the credit union movement, almost a year later no credit union money is being put to use for social housing.  Since then the Central Bank has said that consultation would have to be done in any event and that, even if it wanted to, it could take between six and 21 months to change the rules.</p> <p>  Each of the representative bodies meet the Central Bank on a regular basis, though we do not meet the Department of Finance as regularly as we should or would like to.  We pushed very hard for the Minister and the Government not to take the rules out of the legislation because we feared the Central Bank would be more rigid once the rules were taken away from the control of the Oireachtas.  During the work of the commission in 2011 and 2012, the thinking was that the rules would be less rigid because they would not require Acts of the Oireachtas to change small operational details relating to credit unions.  However, it is actually more straitjacketed now. </p></speech>

I am sorry but Mr. McCrory should tarnish someone with the brush because we are here and listening to the submission he is making.  Mr. McCrory said in his opening statement that he is searching for champions.  I do not believe there is anyone in the Houses who would speak against a credit union.  I am a member of a credit union and many Members right across the political divides are members of credit unions.  We support the credit unions.  I want to see the credit unions allowed to be developed but when we meet with the other side of this argument on Thursday, we want to have all the specifics on this subject.  It is either a case that regulation within the Central Bank and its response to the Irish League of Credit Unions is just not up to it or it is the case that the legislation in its entirety needs to be re-examined and amended.  One cannot help but note from Mr. McCrory's contribution the frustration and, at times, anger over the fact that credit unions do not have somebody to champion their cause and we note his reference to the poor response from the Government, particularly, in the example given by Mr. McCrory, with regard to the housing strategy.  My answer is that within the House and among its Members, the credit unions would have the greatest of respect.  I can point to my own constituency and county and say that St. Canice's Credit Union is a magnificent example for anyone to follow.  It has helped those who were in debt to moneylenders. It has helped with the local enterprise board in supporting business and helped some of us with regard to election campaigns.  A credit union is an essential element in the make-up of any community.  I know from listening to the committee members' questions that they want to support what the Irish League of Credit Unions is doing.  The fact is that credit unions have champions.  Within this committee there would be an agreement to continue to champion and highlight the issues that concern credit union representatives to drive on the change and reform the Irish League of Credit Unions believes is necessary.  I am taken aback at the lack of exchange by those who hold the reins, be it on the Department's side or the regulatory side, and that they do not see the value and do not engage sufficiently well to allow credit unions to perform to the full extent in the marketplace.  If that is the case then we must go back to identify where the problem lies.  We must first identify it and address, as parliamentarians, what appears to me to be a highly disrespectful approach by the regulator to the credit unions.  This is how it appears to me.  There is also a misunderstanding or lack of understanding about the role credit unions play - and are trying to play in an extended role - in the community, which is a positive for community development.  That must be addressed.  Mr. McCrory spoke of the housing investment.  What kind of money are we talking about?  If he was asked to invest in the morning what money would credit unions make available?</p></speech>

That figure would have increased substantially.  Credit unions want to play a part in developing, supporting and contributing to their communities.  Part of that will be social housing.  We are not talking about putting all the eggs in one basket.  It will be part of a range of activities in which they want to be involved.  To preclude credit unions from that-----</p></speech>

The Credit Union Development Association has a lot of engagement with the registrar, as do the Irish League of Credit Unions and the Credit Union Managers Association, and it is quite a professional relationship.  There are a lot of good people trying to do their best.  This is why it really makes one challenge and question where is the logjam.  The Central Bank published information in the last few weeks which highlighted its own concerns around the future viability of credit unions.  The Central Bank is very conscious of the financial strains coming down the tracks but at the same time, we do not seem to be able to figure out how to relax these rules to allow credit unions to prudently use the funds and the strength they currently have.  The time to act in this regard is now, while we have the strength.  We need to look at the structure within the Central Bank and we need to look at how the registrar is positioned within the Central Bank.  Increasingly, we are finding that regulations that are appropriate for other types of institutions are coming our way.  We have to be conscious of the uniqueness of the credit union sector and it is something that must be preserved in all of this.  All we have sought in recent engagements, including in engagements with the deputy governor, is greater transparency around the Central Bank's expectations of what it wants us to deliver.  In public speeches we constantly hear about the poor quality of proposals or the lack of proposals, but as Mr. McCrory has said, it would certainly help us if we could have greater transparency around the expectation of what those proposals should be like.  If the proposals do fall short of expectation then what is required of us to bring it up and turn a "No" into a "Yes"?</p></speech>

I got to hear most of the their contributions and to study them in advance of their attending.  The league is focusing mainly on the Republic aspect.  There are 297 credit unions within the Republic.  We were saying one size does not fit all.  Are there bands of credit unions?  Are there ten or 20 that are huge and 80 that are minute?

There have been approximately 100 mergers or transfers of engagements.  There were approximately 400 credit unions but there are now 300 approximately.  As I stated, that has resulted in a smaller number of much bigger credit unions in addition to a number of smaller credit unions.  There are approximately 50 credit unions with a balance sheet of more than &euro;100 million.  They comprise roughly 50% of the total number in euro and assets.  The Central Bank of Ireland has three asset bands, namely, under &euro;25 million, between &euro;25 million and &euro;100 million, and more than &euro;100 million.  By and large, those in the latter category have taken over credit unions in the past three years under the restructuring project.</p></speech>

During the restructuring in the past couple of years, credit unions in that band felt a lot of pressure to merge with a bigger neighbour.  Now that band is for assets worth under &euro;25 million.  Those in it fear there will be pressure put on them to continue.  We are all in favour of full voluntary transfers of engagements, whereby the board of the smaller credit union, perhaps in the village or smaller town, voluntarily engages with the county town credit union or a bigger credit union that is reasonably close geographically.  If it is a matter of two voluntary boards of directors coming to a good conclusion to the joint benefit of all their members, we are all in favour of it.  We do not like to see undue pressure being exerted just because of the size of the balance sheet.</p></speech>

One might cynically ask whether one should create a bigger entity simply to sustain the burden of the regulatory cost that has emerged in recent years.  The regulatory cost is a considerable burden for many credit unions.  It effectively takes money from members' pockets.  Credit unions are not against proportionate and relevant regulation but what they are challenged with is a costly exercise.  I refer to the creation of the number of statutory instruments that require credit unions to contribute to funds that require efficiencies of scale.  This has made some credit unions feel compelled to jump.  There may not necessarily have been a very sound underpinning business reason in some mergers.  In other cases, there might have been compelling reasons.  That is fine but the idea that the creation of economies of scale somehow achieves a better outcome is questionable.</p></speech>

The rules state every credit union must have a risk officer, risk committee, compliance officer, compliance committee and an internal audit function.  The external audit function was always in place.  A credit union must have a board of directors and board oversight committee.  There are six or seven layers of checks and balances.  With the absence of tiering, the smallest or simplest credit unions are subject to the same requirements as the largest.  Some of the bigger credit unions might have a simple business model.  We are not necessarily saying it a case of the smaller versus the bigger.  The one-size-fits-all-regulatory burden has been imposed and there is a cost to implementing those systems.  As Mr. McCrory stated, when the Government talked about the big hole in the credit unions, it created funds, and the credit unions are levied every year to put money into them although the money was already in the movement.  Some &euro;20 million or &euro;25 million per year is going into three or four of these key funds.  It represents approximately 20% of credit unions' income.  The funds are not needed.  The rainy day has passed, as it were.</p> <p>  Without giving too much detail, one of those funds was the credit institutions resolution fund.  It was set up for four years and it was to have &euro;100 million after that period.  The banks were to pay in &euro;17 million, the credit unions were to pay in &euro;7 million and what I call the IFSC companies were to pay in &euro;1 million.  Therefore, &euro;25 million per year was to go in for four years.</p><p>The four years have passed.  We have been asking the Central Bank and the Department of Finance if that is the end of it.  It was a four-year fund.  Is that the end of our levy going into that fund?  Before they answered us, they took a fifth year&rsquo;s levy into a four-year fund and we still cannot get an answer.  One is pushing it to the other and we are not able to tell our credit unions if the fifth of four is the last one or if there will be six or seven or four.</p><p> At the same time, they commenced another fund, the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Fund.  We got reassurances in November.  Last May we had been expecting it by year-end.  We got reassurances in November it was not current, but in less than a month invoices for &euro;12 million went out to credit unions after we had been reassured a month earlier it was not current.  That &euro;12 million and &euro;7 million gives a total of &euro;19 million in levies that went out in December.  The &euro;7 million is the fifth year of four and the &euro;12 million we were told was not imminent.  It is 20% of the credit unions' income and the income is under pressure because of the interest-rate cycle we have been talking about.</p></speech>

The deposit guarantee scheme exists throughout Europe and Ireland for every bank, building society and credit union.  If one of them fails, the money comes from that scheme.  This resolution fund was set up and has not really been used.  A stabilisation one has been set up and it is only for credit unions within a very small bracket.  It has not been used yet and I do not think there is any real expectation that it will be used.  It was a sledgehammer to crack a nut to set up these multi-million funds.  Despite the movement maintaining there would be no contagion and that the credit unions would be able to handle it themselves, the money is being taken out of the credit union movement.  We cannot even plan ahead; the individual credit unions cannot even plan in their cashflows because we cannot even get answers as to when some of these are ending or being reviewed.</p></speech>

The discussion on what is going on in the credit unions has gone on for some time.  The CUAC report sets out clearly what has been achieved in terms of the commission's recommendations.  What has been achieved is hugely significant.  The financial inclusion side seems to be lacking.  Listening to some of the dialogue there is frustration over a credit union movement that in part cannot borrow and also people cannot save in it.  Where will that end up particularly for people who want to have that service available in their local community?  I am concerned at the potential for people to drift out of this model now.  The old supports that were once there for many people are not facilitated by the regulatory model.  We have an opportunity now; we have a very well structured movement.  It is time to put some of those arguments to bed and for the credit union movement to have a vision that supports its membership and indeed new members.</p></speech>

The Chairman alluded to the idea of champions and so on.  Most members, not just in this committee but Members of the Houses, have been supportive of the credit union movement over the years.  One of the positive points about financial inclusion is the aspect of the "It Makes Sense" loan scheme in co-operation with the Department of Social Protection and MABS.  I ask Ms O'Connor to elaborate on that and how it takes over from some of the licensed moneylenders and so on.</p></speech>

It is currently available through 100 credit unions.  It came from a pilot project and is now almost a mainstream product across the movement.  It targets low-income borrowers.  There is a link through the household budget scheme.  Borrowers can repay from their social welfare payments where it is linked through the household budget scheme.  That provides a degree of reassurance over the repayment of the loan.  In our experience of our clients who have accessed it, it is very effective for those clients who were thinking about taking a loan from the doorstep lender or the licensed moneylender.  This is a viable alternative for them; there are thresholds on the loan value and so on.  We believe it is a product that offers an alternative to that.  Given the amount of money credit unions have and given that moneylenders have a client base of I believe 300,000 clients, we wonder what more we can we do now.  We have to make this loan and products like it much more widely available to low-income borrowers because those borrowers are simply not attractive to the high street, mainstream-----</p></speech>

As Ms O'Connor said, it was a multi-stakeholder group so the representative bodies of the credit unions, Citizens Information Board and the Department of Social Protection were involved.  In his opening address, Mr. McCrory gave it as an example of how we can make a great success of something where we find willing partners.  It was done with the Department of Social Protection and the Citizens Information Board under the former Minister of State, Senator Humphreys, and the then senior Minister, Deputy Burton.  Even more recently we had a very positive meeting with the current Minister, Deputy Varadkar, as we were moving from a pilot to the nationwide roll-out.</p> <p>  We have 100 credit unions covering more or less every county.  The geographical base would be large because the larger towns' credit unions would cover a lot of a county and the people working or living in that hinterland can be a member of the credit union.</p><p>A larger than normal provisioning requirement for the pilot was agreed to by the multi-stakeholder group.  The good news was that when the pilot was finished it was agreed by all, and the Central Bank is on that stakeholder group, that the arrears were not at a level that required it.  I believe it is running at only approximately 2% arrears.  The people who have been dogged by the moneylenders are very happy to be able to get back in.  The credit unions had almost been afraid to lend to them due to the restrictions and whatnot that had been on them.  Everybody is happy to get back in.</p><p> The credit unions are not making any money out of it.  By law, credit unions cannot charge more than 12% interest, whereas moneylenders are allowed to charge percentage rates in the hundreds.  There are numerous reports on the unfairness of that.  We have a close relationship with English credit unions and they are allowed to charge 3% per month, which is 36% to 40% APR for that type of payday, as they call it in England, or small lending in that moneylending space.  They can charge far more.  That is mentioned in the CUAC report.  The maximum interest rate of 12% was probably okay 20 or 30 years ago but there is a need to look at that again.  We could do a very good social job by helping these people move away from the moneylenders, but at more than 12% we could make a few bob on it as well so it would be a win-win situation for everybody.</p></speech>

The average loan has been approximately &euro;500 so the loan for the year will generate less than &euro;50 in interest, whereas for the moneylender it is &euro;150 in interest.  There is a burden in collecting any loan.  Certainly, credit unions stood up to the plate.

If the credit union is to do more to deliver this social benefit this is where the balance is critical, to get the economic return to be able to do more and deliver more of the social benefits.  One can see why the business model must evolve so that the less fortunate can benefit more from the credit union, as well as those who are fortunate.  The credit union is there for all.  The more we can do, the more good work we can do.</p></speech>

I will ask my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, to speak shortly, but there is a fairly united message from all of our guests to the effect that they are frustrated with the system as it is.  They are being encouraged to contemplate doing certain things but when they try to do them, there appears to be a barrier or a wall of silence.  I am not sure what it is, so perhaps on Thursday we will ask those questions, on their and our behalf, as to why some of the progress has not been made.  It is almost frightening to think that the implementation group of the CUAC has met only once since that report emerged.</p></speech>

I had to cover for the party leader in the Chamber this afternoon.  There is nothing worse than somebody arriving late, repeating many of the points that have been made and asking the same questions, so I will make a couple of observations and put one question.  The question will be on the recommendations the witnesses would like the committee to make.  When I suggested to the Chairman that we hold these hearings, it was with a view to the committee, on an all-party basis and including members of no party, collectively making recommendations to the Oireachtas and the Government that might make a difference.  It is not about a long wish list but about the priority areas where we could make meaningful changes.  That will be my question presently for each of the witnesses.</p><p>The frustration coming across is palpable, but there is also an honesty that is welcome.  When we consider what has happened over the last number of years in the approach to regulation and so forth we should also recall the context.  In October 2011, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, was obviously advised by somebody to tell the Seanad that the cost of rescuing credit unions would probably be over &euro;500 million and might be up to &euro;1 billion.  That was the thinking and the context.  Somebody advised him that this was the likely scenario for credit unions.  It was very wide of the mark.  A small number of individual credit unions got into difficulty and did not have good practices.  Everybody must acknowledge that.  However, I have gone through the numbers and when one takes into account the various levies that have been paid into the different funds, the net cost is negligible.  It is a net cost to the State of a few million euro to support the movement.  There was a real suspicion within the system as to what credit unions were doing and how healthy or unhealthy they were and that informed the approach of the Central Bank in particular to the credit union movement.  That is my understanding of it, and I could be wrong.  However, I believe there was a feeling that the movement was in far worse shape than it transpired was the case when the deep-dive assessment was carried out.</p><p>The failure to implement the tiered approach to regulation was a travesty and a betrayal.  All of the changes that were introduced were supposed to be in the context of the tiered approach.  If that approach had been the overarching strategy within which all the other changes to regulation occurred, it would not have been anywhere near as bad as it has turned out to be for credit unions.  The CUAC report of last June was refreshing and straightforward.  It contained many interesting items.  One that struck me was the following statement:</p><blockquote>The loan to asset ratio has fallen steadily in recent years to a present level of 26% which is a cause of deep concern.  There are only 5 countries out of 105 with credit union movements, which have a loan to asset ratio inferior to that in Ireland.  A further major issue for the credit union loan books is that over the period there has been a significant shift away from larger value, longer duration loans to smaller value, shorter duration loans.  Both trends raise fundamental questions around the credit union business model(s).</blockquote> <p>The main recommendation of the report was that there should be an implementation group to oversee the implementation of its recommendations.  However, it took eight months for that group to meet.  That says it all about the lack of priority afforded to the movement.</p><p>We are here to try to make a difference.  We will be meeting with the Department and the registrar.  What would each of the witnesses like us to recommend?  There are many issues involved, including the restrictions on where credit unions can place their investments, the different types of lending restrictions, the longer term restrictions, the issue of the reserves, the difficulty in getting sanction for new services and the issue of lending to approved housing bodies and local authorities and legislation to address that.  What can we usefully do?  At the end of this process, I hope the committee will agree unanimously on a report, which will go to the Oireachtas for debate and to the Minister for Finance for implementation.  If it requires legislation, which I expect it will, so be it.  We can do that.  If the witnesses would state the key items they would like the committee to recommend after we have had our engagement on Thursday, that would be very helpful.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-21a.221" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Annmarie O'Connor" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017032100002#P00100"><p>Our emphasis is on financial inclusion.  In terms of the regulatory issues, the review of section 35 and the capacity for long-term lending is important.  I also want to reiterate the importance of the personal micro finance loan, the "It Makes Sense" loan.  When I look across at the UK, much research has gone into this area and many actual bodies have been set up by industry to examine responsible credit.  There is no such analogous organisation here independent of the credit union movement.  We have no real think tank on credit.  Organisations such as ourselves can make inputs.  Organisations such as the Social Finance Foundation have provided research for the credit unions on the "It Makes Sense" loans.  There is no independent think tank, however, looking at building financially healthy communities in Ireland which is happening in the UK as part of the recovery.  There is this gap and there is in-thinking.  We need new thinking if we need to get innovation in the sector.  We need to ask those most in need of the support the credit unions can provide about they want for the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-21a.222" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian McCrory" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017032100002#P00200"><p>Part of what needs to be changed does not require legislative change but a change in mindset.  They very same people advising the Minister in 2011 are the same advising him now and those attitudes still prevail.  There is still an undercurrent of suspicion that there is something radically wrong with credit unions.  I am not saying there are no flaws or issues which need to be addressed or that there have not been problems.  In every instance, despite a suggestion by the regulatory authority at one time, credit unions which found themselves temporarily in difficulty have traded their way out of it.  At one point the advice to the Minister was that they should be shut.  The consequences for society of such an action would have been dire.  There must be a change, whether it be legislative or regulatory, that will allow credit unions to invest their collective moneys in the citizens of this State, whether it be for social housing, SMEs or other purposes.  There needs to be liberation from the &ldquo;computer says no&rdquo; mindset at every turn.  There needs to be a relaxation of the lending limits and a reconsideration of the directives issued to credit unions that precludes them from lending to many of their members.<br/><br/>The decline in lending can be precisely traced to a communication from the Central Bank to credit unions which grossly impacted on their ability to lend to a significant number of people.  Over time, one can track the pronouncements from the Central Bank and the regulatory authorities and the reduction in lending.  A couple of years later, credit unions are heading for difficult times.  It is a virtuous circle.  What is it that the credit unions are supposed to do to break that virtuous circle because those gifts are not within our control?  There needs to be a review of the rules taken from legislation and put into regulation.  The rules need to be legislated for, specifically defined and not to be arbitrary.  There needs to be a willingness to allow what was at one point a democratically controlled movement to be in control of its own destiny.  Whenever people make the statement that we are here to protect members&rsquo; savings, the direct inference is that we are not.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I find that irksome when it is repeated <i>ad infinitum</i>.  It is as if there is one particular party to this with the fitness and probity who can protect members&rsquo; money.  That requires a mindset change, not a legislative change.</p></speech>

That would be a definite win all round.</p> <p>  The classes of investments and the long-term lending limits are two urgent areas which need to be addressed.  We are entering into the discussion with the CUAC implementation group in good faith.  There were seven areas highlighted which were not delivered the first time.  We would urge the committee to play a monitoring role to ensure it does happen this time.  The tiered regulation is like an umbrella which sits over many of the other parts of the movement.  It is there for the benefit of the small, medium and large credit unions and we get that proportionality with the nature, scale and complexity factored in properly.</p> <p>  We have no idea how the &euro;1 billion figure was arrived at.  At other committee meetings in the past, concerns were raised that there were more than 100 credit unions on solvency watch lists.  The one learning we have taken out of all this is the Judge Judy rule.  Things were not written down, so it was assumed they did not happen.  We have taken on all the burdens of the 2012 Act and have strategies, policies and procedures coming out of various orifices.  What we need now is to use all that newfound capability in a constructive way to deliver more services to more members.</p></speech>

They, more than us, need a champion.  That champion is this committee.  Its oversight and scrutiny over the next several months is critical for going forward.  CUAC has isolated several specific areas.  There is the spirit and the intention of the commission&rsquo;s report which was agreed by all stakeholders, the Central Bank and the Department.  That has to be followed through.  All the questions on the outstanding issues have to be answered to our satisfaction.  As bodies, we are up for engagement.</p> <p>  Our job is to manage prudentially the funds of our members and to lend to them.  Those are the goals on which we need to pursue and deliver upon.</p></speech>

Also, we have not received any specific proposal on changing long term lending limits at the sectorial level, or any proposed risk management framework to accompany greater long-term lending.</blockquote> <p>One can argue there is a lot in that and maybe there is not a lot in that.</p><p>What is Mr. Johnson's response to the comment that there is no specific proposal on changing long-term lending or that there has not been that much exploration as to how credit unions intend to use that long-term lending to boost profitability?  </p></speech>

When we spoke about this previously, what was quoted was the very low percentage of lending in that particular category.  It was stated that little over 2% of the total loans were in the long-term lending bracket.  We then set about trying to bring in the capability and expertise.  It comes back to the earlier point about what actually constitutes a proposal.  We discuss these things and have very good engagement at times.  There is a good professional relationship there.  At deputy governor level, we have asked for greater transparency around that expectation.  We will then set it out and deliver it.  We can argue about fairness or otherwise after that but at least if we understood what is expected from a proposal, we can do that.  To say there is none is probably unfair.</p></speech>

Credit unions, CUDA, the ICLU and individual groups have been seeking to introduce debit cards.  This technology is almost 60 years old.  That process has been in train for over two years.  I have lost count.  We are no further down the track than we were at the start.  It would be mildly disingenuous to say that no propositions have been offered.  As Mr. Johnson alluded to, it is semantics.</p></speech>

It is part of what we are trying to consider.  By and large, Mr. McCrory knows this industry better than we do.  We just want to hear everybody's perspective on it and try to see where the logjams are.</p> <p>  The final point, which I raised at a committee meeting with some people from the Central Bank, is that some credit unions have been fined for non-compliance.  One was in Wicklow while another received a fairly substantial fine relatively recently.  What are the witnesses' thoughts on or reactions to that level of fine?  Were they valid?  </p></speech>

All I would say is that when there is a movement with 9,200 volunteers and 3,500 professional staff, there will be occasions when something goes wrong.  As we said in our opening comments, while 1% of the system fails through the greatest crisis we have experienced, overall, we have seen an excellent performance.  We certainly would not condone any breach of requirements.</p></speech>

There is technical training in money laundering and finance as well as soft skills training so all those volunteers and paid staff do ten, 12 or 15 hours training.  It can be online courses, days in classrooms or accredited courses where they are studying for certificates or diplomas.  The movement takes training and learning very seriously.  The credit unions are as disappointed as we are if any of them falls into a fine category but it seems to be an area where the Central Bank is eager to name and shame.  None of us condones that.</p></speech>

However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>Before I invite our guests to address the committee I must highlight the following.  Members have been advised that the witnesses are attending for the purpose of establishing facts and giving the committee a factual account of the matter, and that they cannot be required to offer an opinion on a matter of Government or ministerial policy.  As Chair, it is my role to ensure that questions directed at the witnesses do not breach this principle.  Members have also been advised that, if necessary, the witnesses will also be available when the delegation from ConnectIreland has finished making their contribution to provide any necessary clarification in so far as they are in a position to do so in terms of matters that are the responsibility of the Department.</p><p>I remind our guests that their presentations should be of no more than five minutes in duration.

Before setting out some information and details regarding the initiative, I will briefly introduce myself and my colleague, Ms &Aacute;ine Maher.  We are part of the inward investment team in the innovation and investment division of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  We work closely with IDA Ireland on issues, be they budgetary, administrative or financial, concerning the agency and more broadly on the implementation of effective foreign direct investment policy in Ireland.  This includes the Succeed in Ireland initiative, which is the subject of the committee's deliberations today.</p> <p>  The Succeed in Ireland programme was borne out of the 2011 Global Irish Economic Forum.  The concept behind the initiative was, in essence, to engage individual members of the Irish diaspora in helping to attract new foreign direct investment to Ireland in return for a financial award.  The Government asked the IDA to oversee Succeed in Ireland, and following a tender in August 2011, ConnectIreland, a subsidiary of the Taxback Group, was appointed to implement the initiative.  The programme was subsequently launched as part of the 2012 Action Plan for Jobs, with a target of creating 5,000 new employment positions in Ireland.  It has been in operation since then and has contributed to the Government's efforts to win more foreign direct investment and jobs for the people of Ireland.  According to the IDA, which is responsible for its oversight, 535 positions have been created through the initiative.  As a financial reward is due in respect of each job that has been verified as having been created on the ground, ConnectIreland has received payments to date totalling &euro;2.11 million from IDA Ireland.  This figure does not include an additional &euro;150,000 which ConnectIreland received from the IDA for marketing support.  I should point out that the figure of 535, representing the total number of jobs created to date by the initiative, may yet increase.  This is because jobs generated by approved projects under the programme will continue to be counted up until March 2020.  Moreover, the verification process for any such jobs will continue to operate until March 2022.</p> <p>  As regards the conclusion of the contract underpinning the programme, it was originally due to end in March 2016.  However, in advance of that date, ConnectIreland and the IDA agreed to extend it for a further 12-month period.  The express purpose of that extension, which was mutually agreed by both parties, was to effect an orderly wind-down of the original agreement signed in 2012.  The original agreement is now set to conclude on 26 March, this coming Sunday.  The IDA has advised the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation that granting a further extension to the agreement, which would allow the programme to continue beyond 26 March, would legally not be permissible.  This is because of public procurement law which provides that in this instance a new tender would be necessary before a further contract could be entered into.</p> <p>  At its meeting in November 2016, the board of IDA considered the future of Succeed in Ireland and whether a new tender should be issued in 2017 for its continuation.  The board made the decision not to re-tender and the agency informed the Department of this immediately thereafter.  The fact the IDA board opted against retendering in November 2016 does not necessarily mean - this is an important point to make - that a definitive decision has been taken in respect of the long-term future of the initiative.  There is nothing to prevent, for example, the IDA from deciding to proceed with a tender for a further Succeed in Ireland programme at a later stage.  The IDA has decided instead not to pursue that route at this point.  The conclusion of the contract will also allow us to take stock of the programme and the contribution it has made to employment generation in the State.</p> <p>  We will be aided in this process by a review which, on the instructions of the Minister, will shortly be commissioned by the Department.  In short, this review will allow for a full and comprehensive assessment of the costs and impact of Succeed in Ireland.  Once completed, it will improve our understanding of how the initiative has functioned, its strengths and weaknesses and, crucially, how we could improve it for the future.  As made clear by the Minister it is important that this review be undertaken before a determination is made on the ultimate future of the programme.  The committee should be aware that the terms of reference for this review have not yet been finalised.  A decision on the start date and authorship will be taken in due course following the conclusion of the current Succeed in Ireland contract.  Confirmation of details concerning the review, once finalised, can be supplied to the committee in due course.</p> <p>  I want now to turn briefly to the well-publicised differences that have arisen between ConnectIreland and the IDA regarding the operation of the initiative.  While this is unfortunate, it is the case that the contract between the parties provides for a procedure to resolve any such differences.  This dispute resolution mechanism has been triggered and I understand the two sides have been engaged in efforts, pursuant to that contractual provision, to find a solution.</p><p>That process remains ongoing, and the Minister is hopeful that a mutually acceptable outcome can be reached for both parties.  As the committee will appreciate, I am unfortunately precluded from commenting any further on the substance of this dispute or anything in connection with it in the event that I inadvertently prejudice the position of either of the parties in any future proceedings.</p><p> The Minister has asked me to emphasise that the attraction of further foreign direct investment to Ireland will remain an absolute priority of hers in the time ahead.  The Government, together with the IDA, is continuing to do its utmost to attract more overseas companies to expand or locate here and to create new employment opportunities.  ConnectIreland, through its operation of the Succeed in Ireland programme, has made a useful contribution to the collective efforts made in recent years to win more FDI for Ireland.  The Minister is grateful for this contribution.  We look forward to undertaking a review of the programme to be in a better position to make a determination as to how to proceed with Succeed in Ireland.</p><p> I am now happy to answer any questions the committee may have.  I may not, however, be able to address certain operational or legal queries in connection with the programme for reasons I have just described.  I trust the committee understands why that is the case.</p></speech>

I have a number of questions about the review.  Why have the terms of reference for the review not been finalised yet?  What is the reason for this delay?  When will the terms of reference be finalised?  How long is the review scheduled to take?  Will it be made public?  Why close the initiative when the review is ongoing?  Why not operate at least until the review is complete?  Would it not be more efficient to review the initiative before the contract ends, or has the Department already decided to end the Succeed in Ireland initiative and is the review just a cover-up?</p></speech>

I am not in a position, unfortunately, to provide any more details on that.  As I said, the idea is to wait until the contract concludes, after which a decision will be taken on the review and how it will be conducted.  Why is the review not being undertaken while the contract is ongoing?  I think the decision was that it would be better to wait until the conclusion of the contract to be better able to assess and get a better understanding of the results of the programme.  Generally, it is more difficult to undertake a review of something that is ongoing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-21a.254" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1327" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017032100002#J00600"><p>I am disappointed by Mr. Scannell's response.  I do not accept that the Department cannot do a review while the matter is ongoing.  That has been done in the case of every project I have ever been involved in or worked with.  Companies do reviews all the time.  It is unacceptable that Mr. Scannell cannot tell us when the review will take place.  Why have the terms of reference not been finalised already?  It is just unacceptable.</p> <p>  I wish to raise my disappointment with the IDA for not turning up before the committee.  I know the IDA sent us a letter but I do not accept what is in the letter.  We could have asked representatives of the IDA questions without breaching what they were worried about, so I am disappointed.</p> <p>  Mr. Scannell did not answer any of my questions properly.  There is concern that this project will finish on Sunday, which is five or six days away.</p></speech>

They are State-funded organisations, they are funded by the Exchequer, and Enterprise Ireland sending us a one-liner that it has no one available absolutely beggars belief.  It is a large organisation and was invited here on a number of occasions, such as during the Brexit exercise we undertook.  It came before the committee on that occasion, as did the IDA, and I wish to put that on the record.  It is simply not good enough.  This is coming off the back of St. Patrick's Day and the diplomatic offensive in which this country has traditionally engaged over the years in reaching out to the diaspora.  The core business of ConnectIreland is exactly that: connecting with our diaspora to try to promote economic activity in the country.  I ask that we write to these two organisations again.</p><p>We should demand that they come before us so we can register with them our disapproval and the fact that it is disrespectful to the Houses of the Oireachtas and, by extension, to the people of Ireland.  We are here to represent the people.  We should set a date for them to come back in.  Failing that, and given I am not sure we have powers of compellability, we should ask the Committee of Public Accounts, which would obviously have an overlapping role in this regard because the organisations are funded by the Exchequer, to examine the situation.  The Committee of Public Accounts might be able to exercise its powers of compellability.  This is simply not good enough.</p></speech>

I expect that would be unanimous from us all and there is no issue in doing that.  However, we cannot compel them to attend.</p></speech>

However, if they become a no-show again, perhaps we might consult the Committee of Public Accounts in respect of the matter.  I am just saying that.</p></speech>

I find it incredible that the Department is still drafting the terms of the review.  Deputy Quinlivan was right in how he reacted to the answer.  I raised this matter in a priority parliamentary question a number of weeks ago, as Mr. Scannell will be aware, and the answer I got from the Minister was wholly unsatisfactory.  A number of weeks have now elapsed yet the Department is coming in here and saying that the review is still being drafted, that we will have it in due course and that a decision will ultimately be taken, but we do not know who is taking the decision.  It appears that IDA Ireland is happy to let the clock run out on this.  I am at a loss to know who exactly has the responsibility for driving this review.  Is anybody within the Department, from the Minister down, concerned that the current initiative will cease on 26 March, that we will then go into a period of drift and that the momentum that has been built and the connections that have been made could potentially come to naught?  This is despite all the work that has been done and the money spent.  Mr. Scannell outlined the amount of money that has been paid to ConnectIreland to date.</p> <p>  I find what is happening incredible.  Is this is what the Department is serving up to us at this point, namely, that the review is being drafted?  As Mr. Scannell indicated, the initial contract ran out last year and an extension was agreed for a further year.  I find this wholly incredible.  Can Mr. Scannell tell us what the term "due course" means and who will actually make the decision on the review?  As we know, there is a dispute between the two organisations.  If we are to wait for IDA Ireland to make a decision, I think we will be left waiting.  Will the Minister or the Government make a decision on the matter?  Is that the nature of the decision-making process?</p></speech>

That is all I am in a position to inform the committee of at the moment.  The review will be undertaken after the contract concludes.</p> <p>  Generally, on the question of what happens to the programme after its conclusion, when the contracts were originally agreed, it was never envisaged that the contract would run in perpetuity.  The contract was for a set period.  It was extended for the maximum amount of time and a further extension was granted to effect an orderly wind-down of the contract.  That is now coming to an end.  It was not envisaged, unfortunately, that this would run for ever.  It was to run for a set period and the decision has now been made to undertake a review so that we know where we stand, exactly what the programme has contributed and what are the results.  A longer-term decision will then be made as to its future.</p></speech>

I understand that was a factor.  Other than that I am also aware that the board and IDA Ireland more generally would have looked at the results that have been achieved to date in terms of the job numbers achieved by Succeed in Ireland against its targets.  Those are factors that would come into consideration.</p></speech>

I know there is a dispute about the number of jobs to be verified versus the number of jobs that ConnectIreland would claim are actually on the ground at the moment and they are evolving over the next period of time.  That is very much at the heart of what we are discussing here today.</p> <p>  I place on record my appreciation of the work of ConnectIreland particularly in rural areas.  I was instrumental in developing, with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the agencies, the regional Action Plan for Jobs approach.  Based on the results ConnectIreland has delivered, the jobs on the ground are mainly outside the main cities and urban centres, areas that on the basis of current IDA Ireland policy will never attract an enormous number of foreign direct investment jobs in particular sectors.</p> <p>  It is bizarre and reckless to engage in a review at this point.  I agree with colleagues that if we were to have a review, that review should have taken place much earlier than now and the evidence from that review could then have informed Government policy as to the approach to ConnectIreland and the Succeed in Ireland initiative generally.</p> <p>  Clearly the protagonists, if I can use that description, are in a process at the moment.  ConnectIreland, for obvious reasons, would favour a bridging contract arrangement being provided.  I will not ask Mr. Scannell to comment specifically on whether he thinks a bridging contract should be awarded to ConnectIreland to allow the initiative to proceed in the context of the review that is now being undertaken.  Does Mr. Scannell believe from a policy perspective that it is feasible for a bridging arrangement to be agreed in a short period of time because, obviously ConnectIreland is staring down the barrel of a gun with the conclusion of its contract and all that flows from that?  From a policy perspective and in the context of public procurement and tendering guidelines, is it feasible for the Minister to award a bridging contract to the organisation, staying within the confines of legal parameters?</p></speech>

As we understand it, the legal advice that has been received provides that because of public procurement law, unfortunately no further extension can be granted.  That basically precludes any bridging contract or any such device to allow prolongation of the initiative.  An extension is effectively off the table; there would have to be a new tender before the programme could continue on the basis of a renewed contract.</p></speech>

As I explained, in November 2016 the board of IDA Ireland decided not to retender.  The Department accepted IDA Ireland's decision.

Mr. Scannell says that this plan was extended on numerous occasions.  I am an ex-emigrant - I was out of the country from 2010 to 2013 - and I was well aware of this when I was in Australia, when there would have been much talk about it among the diaspora to kick-start the economy and get investment in.  There was a mechanism in place if there was a dispute or conflict and there was an extension given.  Am I correct in assuming that there was a process written in for how an extension would be granted or was there a review at the time which resulted in that extension?  If so, was there a review mechanism with a timeline written into it, rather than what is being highlighted here, namely, carrying out a review at the last minute?</p></speech>

I do not mean that disrespectfully but he has told us absolutely nothing in relation to the key issues here.  Like my colleague, Deputy Niall Collins, I have to express my huge disappointment at IDA Ireland's decision not to attend, Enterprise Ireland's decision not to attend and the Minister's decision not to attend. To be frank, something very strange is going on here when no one wants to turn up and when the people who do are extremely restricted in what they can say.  I find it odd.</p> <p>  I do not mean to be flippant but my first question is do the people here now report to IDA Ireland?  If they do not - and I take it that they do not - then perhaps they could tell us why the Department accepted IDA Ireland's decision not to retender.</p> <p>  One thing in particular puzzles me.  My understanding was that the wind-down period - that last 12 months - was to allow for a retender to take place.  We have not been given any credible reason why that retendering did not take place.  This seems to be a very cynical exercise designed to wind down time and then say that there was nothing that could be done.  We are up against it now in terms of next Sunday.</p> <p>  I live in rural Ireland.  I think ConnectIreland has done a huge service to the country.  The Department's statement refers to the absolute priority to attract further foreign direct investment to Ireland.  How does the Department reconcile that with the fact that it is going to close ConnectIreland on Sunday?  I am absolutely stunned.  There is something really odd about this.</p><p>It is completely unacceptable that IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland decided to duck the issue today in the hope that time would run out.  I hope I speak for every committee member when I say that we are not going to allow this to happen.  It is beyond reasonable and beyond what the taxpayer should tolerate.  ConnectIreland delivered jobs to rural Ireland which the IDA will not because it only works with projects of 30 employees and upwards.  Many of the ConnectIreland projects involve smaller job numbers.  There is a gap there.  We are facing into Brexit and this committee has spent much time dealing with the challenges of Brexit.  At the very time it is about to hit us, the Department is shutting down one of the key elements in our army to fight back for jobs.  Will the Department please tell us it has something more to say?</p></speech>

I agree wholeheartedly with the Senator that it is regrettable that IDA Ireland is not here.  We saw the letter issued from IDA Ireland which said it would consider it regrettable if the committee proceeded with a hearing on Succeed in Ireland.  It is regrettable the IDA is not here.  In fairness to Mr. Richard Scannell and Ms &Aacute;ine Maher, they are left trying to pick up the pieces.</p></speech>

That is not what is happening here.  The two parties, to be fair, entered into a contract which had a conclusion date.  The contract was not intended to run forever and it is ending.  That is effectively what has happened.  No decision has been made in that respect.</p> <p>  In terms of accepting the decision of the IDA, the Minister and the Department have great respect for the work IDA Ireland has done.  It has a stellar track record in attracting foreign direct investment to Ireland, creating jobs and investment across the country.  There is no reason in this instance to second-guess the judgment of the IDA.  The purpose of the 12-month extension, as I understand it, which was agreed in March 2016, was not to allow for a further tendering.  In fact, the express terms of that extension, if I recall correctly, were to effect an orderly wind down of the agreement, to effectively bring the original contract to a conclusion and not to allow for the re-tender.</p></speech>

Taxback has been extremely successful in the work it does and, likewise, with ConnectIreland.</p> <p>  I want to put on record that the level of arrogance shown by the IDA by not turning up is something I have not seen in this House for quite some time.  The manner in which the opening statement was given and the lack of content in addressing the issue is further shocking from the Department.</p> <p>  How much does it cost IDA Ireland to create a job?</p></speech>

The Department is the body setting out the strategy and policy in regard to this.  I simply want to find out how many people are going to be unemployed after the decision is made and whether it is the Department's intention to save the jobs, pay ConnectIreland for the intellectual property rights and deal with the outstanding issues because this affects the profile of Ireland abroad.  It will have a major negative impact at a time when we are attempting to build up our response to Brexit.  It is a fair question.</p></speech>

I have a final question.  IDA Ireland has paid over &euro;2 million to this company for the magnificent work it has undertaken abroad and in respect of the creation of jobs at home.  Presumably, that comes through Mr. Scannell's Department.  That is a type of investment because it is constantly working with ConnectIreland.  Would the Department consider that to be value in terms of what this company did?  Mr. Scannell said it contributed to the Government's efforts and that it made a valuable contribution.</p></speech>

I apologise for being obliged to leave but I have other business.  I agree with other speakers that there is an extraordinary atmosphere and a chill factor in respect of this issue.  There is a legal process going on but representatives of IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the Minister are not here and two civil servants have been left to take the rap for everything that has been thrown at them.  That is what they are paid for and what they are employed to do but it is clear that other key people are missing from the room-----</p></speech>

That contrasts starkly with the kerfuffle and glamour around the formation of this project - involving the Taoiseach, the Minister at the time, Deputy Richard Bruton, Michael Flatley dancing around the place, the talk of foreign direct investment coming into the country, etc. - and the fact that this organisation will be shut down next Sunday.  What position does the Government see the 78,000 connectors around the globe being left in?  I will pre-empt the answer to my question by saying that I am a member of this committee because I am interested in the creation of real jobs.  However, I have no way of knowing that the jobs that ConnectIreland or IDA Ireland bring to this country are well paid and that the workers who take them up are looked after.  From time to time, companies attracted here by way of foreign direct investment are brought to my attention by those who work for them.  I am interested in this committee discussing ways to save jobs at Bus &Eacute;ireann and An Post and how we can attract nurses back to the country.  We never seem to discuss those issues, however.  We are always discussing foreign direct investment and where it is leading us.  I regret that very much but nevertheless it is important that I ask what the Department believes will happen with the 78,000 global connectors affected by this contract being brought to an end.  I will watch the proceedings later.</p></speech>

First, in his opening statement Mr. Scannell said the Government asked IDA Ireland to oversee the programme.  I presume that, by extension, it was the Department which  asked IDA Ireland to oversee it.  Mr. Scannell said the contract was extended for a year to facilitate an orderly wind-down.  Can he explain the reason he allowed the extension of one year and why we have had drift and no succession planning?</p><p>Second, Senator Gerald Nash mentioned a bridging arrangement and said IDA Ireland had presented legal advice to the effect that the contract could not be extended and would have to be retendered for.  How long does it take to retender?  IDA Ireland does not want this initiative to continue, but, given its record on job creation and in addressing the urban-rural gap, not to mention the difference in cost between the jobs created by ConnectIreland, at &euro;4,000 each, and those created by IDA Ireland which cost &euro;10,000, why does the Department not step in and have an arrangement with ConnectIreland?  That would keep it going and ensure there was no interregnum.</p><p> What is the Department's view on the operation of the system whereby connectors are red flagged, which is crucial to the operation of the programme?  IDA Ireland states the initiative has not been a success, but it has been.  IDA Ireland has given the operation of the red flagging system as one reason the initiative has not been a success.</p></speech>

It has to clear the contact with IDA Ireland to ensure the latter is not already in consultation with the company.  It has been reported that the system has experienced difficulties.  In some cases, ConnectIreland received feedback that IDA Ireland was talking to target clients, but these clients stated they had had no communication whatsoever from IDA Ireland.</p></speech>

The intention was not for the contract to run continually but for a set period.  When the board of IDA Ireland decided not to retender, it was natural for it to come to a conclusion.  That is why there was no succession planning.  I do not know how long it takes to retender as I am not well versed in procurement procedures, but I think it takes some four or five months.  I can come back to the Deputy with a more authoritative answer.</p></speech>

It would have been very useful and helpful today if we had been informed of what was written into the original process when it came to the review.  I assume there is factual information.  I cannot understand why that could not have been presented to the committee today as part of an appendix or whatever.  To me, it lays down the precedence of what reviews took place before and what the rationale was for the roll-over.  From that, we could draw our own conclusions on the lack of interaction we had today and maybe highlight some of the conclusions that could be arrived at or rebutted.  We are operating in a complete vacuum.  That factual information should have been presented today.</p></speech>

As to why there is no re-tender, it is because the IDA decided not to re-tender.  As to whether someone else would re-tender, we are going to await the outcome of the review before any future decision is taken.</p></speech>

By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>Before I invite the witnesses to address the committee, I must highlight that the committee has already been advised that the contractual dispute between IDA Ireland and ConnectIreland is a matter between those two parties and the committee cannot, therefore, inquire into the matter in dispute.  I understand ConnectIreland has already indicated orally that it will not raise the matters in dispute in the course of its meeting with the committee.  Although we have not had sight of the contract, our understanding is that it also contains provisions relating to confidentiality.  Can I assume that ConnectIreland will not volunteer information to the committee that pertains to specific matters in dispute between it and IDA Ireland or that breaches any confidentiality requirement, contractual or otherwise?  Can I ask for an assurance from ConnectIreland that if members ask questions of it that present a difficulty in this regard that will be clearly signalled by it?</p><p> I remind our guests that the presentation should be of no more than five minutes' duration.  The presentation has been circulated to committee members.  I invite Ms Joanna Murphy to make her presentation.</p></speech>

It is a tremendous privilege for ConnectIreland to come to the Houses of the Oireachtas to present a successful job creation initiative, primarily for rural Ireland, of which we are very proud.  Before reading my presentation, I wish to offer our sincere condolences to those in Sinn F&eacute;in on the loss of their colleague last night.</p> <p>  The purpose of ConnectIreland's appearance before the committee is to appeal for a bridging contract to allow us to continue to operate the Succeed in Ireland initiative, preferably with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The contract for Succeed in Ireland is due to expire on Sunday next.  Recently, the Minister for Jobs Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, confirmed in the D&aacute;il that she has asked her Department for a review to be conducted on the initiative after it has been terminated.  ConnectIreland welcomes the review but we respectfully request that it be independent, that it be carried out by third party and that it include the experience of ConnectIreland in implementing this programme, overseen by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  We have received tremendous support from tens of thousands of loyal members of the Irish diaspora who continue to introduce valuable leads every day, thereby benefiting rural Ireland.  We wish only to continue the work that we do until that review has been concluded and recommendations arrived at.  We see no advantage in the discontinuation of this vital job creation programme before the review is complete.</p> <p>  ConnectIreland is a not-for-profit patriotic initiative founded by Terry Clune to operate the Succeed in Ireland initiative to bring jobs to Ireland in the wake of the recent financial crisis.  The initiative is an idea which came from the Global Irish Economic Forum in 2011.  It utilises Ireland's relationship with its diaspora and global connections to persuade companies to move to Ireland.  The way it works is simple: people - connectors - who know someone planning to move a company into Europe will get in touch with ConnectIreland which will then provide a wide range of supports to that company to help it decide to choose Ireland.  For passing on the lead, the connector will receive a reward of &euro;1,500 for every job created.  ConnectIreland has operated under the auspices of Industrial Development Agency, IDA, Ireland.</p> <p>  ConnectIreland has proved very successful in bringing small companies to Ireland.  We have also been very successful in bringing jobs to rural Ireland, not just Dublin.  We have brought 82 new-name, greenfield projects to Ireland, with a heavy rural emphasis.  We have had 2,351 jobs approved by IDA Ireland's management investment committee, scaling over three years, with 1,046 jobs already on the ground.  There have been 527 verified by IDA Ireland.  There are almost 80,000 connectors, loyal members of the Irish diaspora who continue to introduce companies to us every day.  They understand the initiative and support its ambitions.  They are an army of volunteers working for Ireland.  I take this opportunity to introduce Mr. James Moran, a connector in the first instance but now also running a company called SLM Connect in Gweedore, Donegal, and his colleague, chief executive of SLM Connect worldwide, Mr. Abdul Salam, who has graciously taken time to travel from Manchester today.  Mr. Moran has travelled from Donegal to tell the committee why they chose Gweedore and why relationships with the Irish diaspora are so important.</p> <p>  Beyond what IDA Ireland has approved, we are working with 957 additional companies.</p><p>I direct Deputies and Senators to the list which shows the companies with which we are currently engaged and the relationships that will be lost on Sunday should we not be able to continue.  We encourage them to relocate to Ireland.  Should the programme be discontinued, the relationship and trust ConnectIreland has built with them will be lost.  There is no cost to the taxpayer unless jobs have been created.  At &euro;4,000 per job created, of which we share &euro;1,500 with our connectors, the initiative is 250% cheaper per job than the cost for IDA Ireland.  We consider this to be something of which we are very proud.  IDA Ireland's track record in attracting foreign direct investment to Ireland is exemplary, but as a new company, we are working with the diaspora to deliver jobs at a much lower cost to the taxpayer, of which we are very proud.  Our connectors are based in 147 countries worldwide.</p><p> IDA Ireland is not renewing the contract which is due to expire on Sunday.  We have had some significant challenges in implementing the programme, none of which was getting a lead from the diaspora in attracting foreign direct investment to Ireland.  We are committed to resolving these issues.  This is more important than structural difficulties.  We are here because we want to continue to create jobs in Ireland which needs as many channels to job creation as possible.  Closing down ConnectIreland is not in Ireland's national interests.  Shutting down the Succeed in Ireland initiative will have an enormously negative impact on job creation in Ireland.  Our global network will be lost and all jof the jobs in the pipeline will be put at risk.  It will be extremely damaging to Ireland's reputation for thousands of investors.  We will be missing huge opportunities for dozens of small towns in Ireland.  In the context of Brexit, does this make sense?  We see the continuing volatility of the jobs market and global uncertainty on the political landscape which confirm the need to have all possible job creation measures.  This will be another killer blow to rural Ireland.  We need the initiative to be extended to facilitate a review, of which we would be part, and until such a time as a path forward can be found for the initiative.  We plead with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to step in to save jobs in rural Ireland and provide cross-departmental support for ConnectIreland.  ConnectIreland has been the recipient of huge support from various Departments which we acknowledge and also from Irish embassies and consuls, as well as from significant Irish organisations such as the GAA.</p><p> I thank the committee for its time.</p></speech>

I am perplexed by the decision of IDA Ireland not to renew the contract.  I cannot get my head around the reasoning for it.  From speaking to ConnectIreland in the past and seeing the jobs it has delivered in areas where IDA Ireland is not going to deliver them, especially in rural Ireland and the more remote parts of the State - IDA Ireland would not even make a site visit, never mind bring jobs there - I cannot understand why IDA Ireland is not renewing the contract.  What are the connectors saying?  They must be absolutely perplexed about what is happening.  Have there been instances where jobs sourced through the Succeed in Ireland programme have been claimed by IDA Ireland?</p></speech>

Our initiative was designed to be collaborative, to bring small companies to Ireland, to complement the work of IDA Ireland and to add value.  The jobs that have come through our initiative are additional and there is no State subvention required.  We are paid on a success-only basis.</p><p>We, like our connectors and this army of companies, are utterly perplexed.  I do not know what we will say to them on Monday if we cannot resolve this today.</p><p> Unfortunately, I will not be able to answer the Deputy's second question, bearing in mind what the Chairman said earlier.</p></speech>

In addition, it is filling the gap, particularly in rural Ireland.  In the past two weeks, a closure in Nenagh was announced.  Brexit was one of the reasons cited.  Brexit was mentioned a number of times in the earlier session and we have done our own exercise in relation to this.</p> <p>  Will the representatives of the Department tell us how the red lighting or the red flagging system works?  What has their experience been of its operation?</p></speech>

As I said earlier, our goal is to add value.  What we do is additional.  We submit the lead to IDA Ireland and it tells us if it has been in dialogue with that company on a specific project within the past six months.  I cannot comment further on that subject other than to say that we were surprised at the volume of companies that were red-lighted to ConnectIreland.</p></speech>

The reason given by the IDA is that it had already been in contact with those people.  However, ConnectIreland subsequently found out from those people that the IDA had not been in contact with them at all.  Is my understanding correct?</p></speech>

His understanding is correct.  We cannot comment on that particular topic.</p> <p>  For ConnectIreland, today is about a continuation.  It is about the positives that have come out of this initiative at a time of deep economic uncertainty in Ireland.  We are now facing into uncertainty once more, which is why we have brought with us an example of the type of relations that Ireland needs to use.  Having come back from a world painted green last weekend, we all know the latent energy and power that is in our Irish diaspora.</p> <p>  With the indulgence of the committee members, I will introduce Mr. James Moran, who has an interesting story to tell of why Gweedore has a special place in his heart.  I will then introduce Mr. Abdul Salam to talk about why he chose Gweedore over Scotland or Wales.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-21a.412" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Moran" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017032100002#W00700"><p>I thank the committee for allowing me to share our story.  I was born in Manchester and raised in Donegal.  After my leaving certificate, I went to university in the UK and stayed there for a number of years.  I subsequently worked in Dublin and, in recent years, in the US.</p> <p>  In 2015, I was working for a US technology company in Manchester.  It shared a building with Mr. Salam's company, SLM Connect, which is a contact centre or call centre organisation.  I got to know Mr. Salam on a personal level.  One day while chatting, he said that he wished to expand his operation outside Manchester, possibly to Wales or Scotland.  I put my green hat on and threw Ireland into the picture.  He was happy to consider that.  I was aware of the ConnectIreland initiative through a friend of mine back home.  I became an approved connector.</p><p>When the management of SLM and ConnectIreland subsequently spoke, that set the seed for encouraging the company to set up in County Donegal.  After a few months, when the project was progressing well, Mr. Salam asked me to consider joining the company to look after its Irish operation.  I jumped at the chance for personal reasons.  My mother has been on her own in County Donegal since my father passed away a few years ago.  Her five children are scattered all over the world, as many Irish families are.  I have a sister in the United States and another in New Zealand.  I jumped at the chance to go back home to look after my mother.  She would probably be adamant that it is still a case of her looking after me and she is probably right.</p><p> Our operation in County Donegal is off the ground.  We employ 36 people and are looking to increase that number to 125.  Our facility can probably hold approximately 150.  We are hoping to have 50 employees by Easter and 125 within two years.  It has been a great experience.  It is good to be back home.  We have been very impressed by the calibre of people we have managed to get.  It is probable that approximately 50% of our staff have third level degrees.  I am sure they did not envisage working in a call centre or a contact centre when they were in college, but to be fair, they appreciate and are grateful for their jobs.  A few Deputies have hammered home the point that rural jobs are much more important.  People in County Donegal really appreciate their jobs and are committed to making this operation a success.  A significant cohort of our staff had been among the long-term unemployed.  Just as I wanted to move back home to be closer to my mother, many people in County Donegal are tied to the area because of family commitments.  They want to stay in the county in order that they can remain part of the fabric of the community.  The great ConnectIreland initiative is helping us to provide 125 jobs in Gaoth Dobhair in the first phase.  Mr. Salam and I are quite keen to increase the number of jobs provided by the company to between 300 and 500 in the second phase, which might be closer to Letterkenny or one of the other bigger towns in County Donegal.  I reiterate that all of this has been made possible by the ConnectIreland initiative which has enabled me to get in touch with officials to take the project onwards and upwards.</p></speech>

I ask him to outline why he has chosen Gaoth Dobhair rather than one of the competing markets.  What was it about this location that appealed to him when he was planning the expansion of his company?</p></speech>

We received huge support from ConnectIreland and Mr. Moran.  The culture and community within Gaoth Dobhair were the deciding factor when we decided to establish an Irish-based footprint.</p></speech>

It was suggested the cost of a ConnectIreland-created job was approximately &euro;4,000, whereas the cost of an IDA Ireland-created job was over &euro;10,000.  According to the Department, ConnectIreland claims to have created over 2,000 jobs, but the official figure from IDA Ireland suggests ConnectIreland has created just 535.  Will the ConnectIreland officials clarify the position?</p></speech>

I understand from IDA Ireland's recent figures that the figure of &euro;10,500 has been well documented.</p><p>The reason we can do that is because of the enormous goodwill that ConnectIreland has received.  I will ask my colleague, Mr. Clune to give examples of what ConnectIreland's goodwill has generated.</p></speech>

Some of the connectors are recent graduates and others are very senior business people.  We have been very lucky that Mr. Michael O'Leary from Ryanair has given ConnectIreland significant coverage across Ryanair's in-flight magazine in the past two years.</p> <p>  People really understand what we are looking for.  It is not a difficult ask.  What we ask people to do is simply to keep their eyes and ears open for Ireland.  During St. Patrick's week the Tricolour was out in force.  There is massive loyalty to Ireland and this initiative gives people something useful they can do, a simple channel through which they can keep their eyes open and if they hear of a company that is expanding to Europe, they should let us know and we in ConnectIreland will take it from there.  This concept has been working very successfully.  </p> <p>  In terms of the numbers, SLM Connect's numbers are not included in the IDA's 527 verified list.  The IDA has not verified them.  We hope that as part of a review, the verification process or how long it takes to verify the jobs would be looked at and reviewed.  Equally, and we cannot discuss it here unfortunately, the red lighting issue would be a key aspect of what we would like to be able to review and ensure that issues and opportunities are not lost for Ireland.  We have a significant number of red lighted companies.  We would hope that in a review of the project with the Department and IDA that we would be able to overcome that issue in the future and that those companies would no longer be blocked to Ireland.</p></speech>

We pressed the previous witnesses quite hard on what I have described as the drift in the past 12 months.  The contract of ConnectIreland was extended for a 12 month period.  Will the witnesses comment on the level of engagement with the IDA and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in terms of ensuring that the programme continues in some shape or form, whether it be by ConnectIreland, which is my first choice or in its absence some other entity that would be equally as competent?</p></speech>

I welcome the comments of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation earlier today.  Unfortunately we cannot agree on one particular item.  The contract extension was set down in order to facilitate a new tender.  What was communicated to ConnectIreland was that within the second six months, which was described as "blue ocean", there would be an opportunity for the tender to be reissued.  We in ConnectIreland would have bid for the contract as part of a competitive call and would hope that our work was sufficient to win such a contract.  A public information notice was issued on 23 September 2015, with a budget earmarked.  To our disappointment that was never progressed and we were left in a state of dismay when we found out the week before Christmas that it was the intention to dismantle all the good work that has been done.  That is the difference we have with the Department.  That was not our understanding of the extension.  The point was quite expressly made to us that there was a need for ConnectIreland to stop promoting to facilitate a new tender.</p></speech>

We waited and we still continued to engage with companies in that six month period.  We have companies contacting us every single day and we have not withdrawn any support from them.  We continue to support those companies and our connectors with them.</p></speech>

We now find ourselves in the situation we are in today.  Did the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation have an input or was it trying to be hands off on this?</p></speech>

We have spoken to the Minister in the past.  We have written to the Minister asking for intervention, for somebody to assist in that regard.</p><p>We have not had any action or output, as yet, on that.  We are here to resolve matters and not to look back.  It is important to put on the record that ConnectIreland of itself is an innovation.  It is a disruptive FDI, if I can use that expression.  It is doing something different.  We have been internationally award-winning and that is not to celebrate ourselves but to celebrate the likes of Mr. James Moran, who has done all of the work.  We would not exist were it not for the great leads that come in.  We accept that there can be gaps and challenges in innovation and all we want to do is resolve.  We just have not had any engagement in that respect, unfortunately.</p></speech>

I first heard of ConnectIreland when I emigrated in February 2010.  In terms of marketability, ConnectIreland appealed to the ordinary emigrant on the ground as opposed to the key decision makers in established industries across the world.  That was the strategy and key focus at the time, in terms of getting companies to set up in Ireland but also to re-establish our reputation.  The organisation was trying to do that from the ground up; it was a bottom-up approach.  When I went to Australia, I was working in recruitment and every Irish emigrant knew about ConnectIreland within 24 to 48 hours of arriving.  It was a way for emigrants to reconnect with Ireland because most of us were forced to leave.  We never thought we would have to go.  Our country educated us to the hilt, we thought we had endless opportunities and then bang, we had to go, like the generations before us.  We were the first emigrants who were highly educated and we were able to speak in business language with key decision makers in order to attract businesses back to Ireland.  We were the ordinary punters on the ground at the time and that was the strategy behind it.  Indeed, that is where ConnectIreland worked.  I know that the company was spoken about by The Ireland Funds Australia and other network groups.  I wanted to put that on record from my experience on the ground, as a modern emigrant.  That is the way we saw it.  There was an incentive there.  The question was always asked, it was spoken about around the tables - can we get companies back?  We wanted to help the country.  We wanted to give something back and to have that connection, unlike previous generations who, through no fault of their own, did not have that opportunity.  Indeed, as a country, we were not as commercially aware back then as we are now.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions for the witnesses.  They mentioned interactions, spoke about prospective clients interacting with either IDA Ireland or ConnectIreland and referred to a six-month timeframe in that context.  I ask them to define what is meant by interaction.  Does it mean a conversation, a phone call or documented interaction?  Second, was ConnectIreland privy to any information regarding the review mechanism or the roll-over mechanism?  Do the witnesses know what criteria were used in the decision to roll over and continue the contract?  I asked the previous speakers the same question but they did not have that information.  In terms of the review, were there key performance indicator targets that ConnectIreland had to achieve and did that have an impact on the roll-over time period?</p></speech>

Every year at the All Ireland Hurling and Football Championship finals, the GAA affords us an opportunity to reach the four corners of the world with a video message about getting involved in ConnectIreland.  The GAA became so heavily involved because it is a community benefactor and ConnectIreland is, ultimately, a community organisation, supported by city and county councils across Ireland.</p><p>It was also because it had difficulty in fielding football teams at that time and it wanted to reach out to young men and women from Ireland across the world to tell them they could do something too.  One of our ambassadors is M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Muircheartaigh, who members will be well aware of as he is almost a president of Ireland.  He is more than 90 years of age now and he never travels outside of the country without a box of ConnectIreland brochures under his arm.  He insists on it because he wants to do something useful.  He wants to talk about job creation and the value of our diaspora.  We receive that type of contact and support from a mind-numbing number of people.  I recognise what the Deputy described as it is what we feel and see every day in ConnectIreland.</p><p> We welcome the review but we were hoping to be part of the review and that perhaps somebody might ask us what we thought was good about the programme after operating it exclusively from when it began to where it is now.  Certainly, we believe there are areas that can be improved but we would also like to celebrate the success of the initiative.</p><p> The Deputy also asked about the roll-over and key performance indicators.  There was no key performance indicator, as such.  We had what we have now, which is monthly operational meetings.  We are delighted and proud that we have another three announcements today.  They involve three companies, two of which are outside of Dublin, and 35 jobs.  They are small, sustainable and valuable jobs for Ireland.  That is, and has been, our success.</p></speech>

How does the witness prove it?  Is it documented?  I was a recruitment consultant and when somebody sent in a curriculum vitae, it was in an e-mail.  That depicted that it was one's candidate or client.  Was there a formal process in place between ConnectIreland and the IDA to depict a client?</p></speech>

There was obviously some type of review, or something happened, and the decision was made to roll over and that ConnectIreland would continue.  Is the witness aware of or can she outline the criteria that were used to make that decision?  I asked the previous witnesses and they were unable to tell me.  We have asked that a letter be written to the Department on that.  If the witness is aware of them and can share them, that is fine.  If she cannot, I understand that.</p></speech>

There was also a review after the first year, and I expect that was to make sure the initiative was working and growing as expected.  After the first year it was automatically renewed.  Then, up to 12 months ago, ourselves and the IDA discussed renewing it for one further year with a view to winding down that agreement, on the basis that in the last six months there would be a further tender issued by the IDA.  The only thing that has not happened is that last piece.  That is what we have been promised all along-----</p></speech>

Again, generally speaking, we would not renew State contracts with a 50% success rate either.</p></speech>

The IDA would also say, if its representatives were here, that it recognises that there are many hundreds more jobs that have not been verified yet.  It is explicitly clear on that point.</p> <p>  In respect of the 527 verified jobs, ConnectIreland knows that this is not the case because we have a relationship with these companies such as our colleagues here from SLM Connect.  Let us imagine it was the case that only 527 jobs had been created, and we say the figure is much larger.  There is still a return to the Exchequer in respect of the 527 jobs generated by an initiative that required no State subvention and which was based only on success.  The figure is enormous.  What is wrong with creating jobs on a success-only basis?  What is wrong with rewarding the Irish diaspora for doing so?  They reach areas of Ireland where, understandably, the IDA is concerned with attracting very big companies.  The organisation does very big business on behalf of Ireland and does it well.  What is wrong with a success-only initiative?  Why would anyone bring the initiative to a halt in the context of a creative Ireland, a looming Brexit and a new US Administration?  Why would anyone stop a channel to job creation that does not cost the taxpayer unless it succeeds?</p></speech>

I know the witnesses are subject to legal process.  If they cannot encroach on any of this matter, then by all means they should say so.

The IDA has not verified the jobs yet.  This process is ongoing and evolving.  For the committee's benefit I have brought along a form.  Obviously when IDA celebrates its jobs number every year, it uses the annual employment survey to do so.  By way of illustration, and I hope nobody minds, there are two boxes on the form on which employers can write the number of their employees.</p><p>If they do not know the exact number, an estimate is sufficient.  As I said, there are two boxes to be completed.  The employer then signs the form and returns it to the IDA.  This is the ConnectIreland verification process, which members will note runs to two pages.  It is a 26 stage process which involves redacted bank statements, contracts of employment and post-six months probation information, which in the digital age involves a physical visit to Gweedore by one man based in Wilton Place in Dublin.  This is an enormously impractical verification process than can be improved.  In regard to the review, we would be suggesting to the people carrying out that review that the verification process be simplified.  We have very good ideas as to how that might be done.  I hope that clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></speech>

I am loth to speak on behalf of anyone other than ConnectIreland but it is fair to say that the Department and IDA also recognise that the verification process is extraordinarily laborious.  In many cases our client companies get no material benefit.  In most cases, they do not get grant aid.  They do not come here for that reason, rather they come here because Kinvara is the centre of the world.  To ask a company to step through a process from which they obtain no material benefit is not right.  With all due respect, these are busy people, scaling companies.  Regardless of how much they like ConnectIreland they have a job to do.  It is too much to expect of them.</p></speech>

Perhaps Ms Murphy would define "lead".  Is a "lead" a person within a company or the company itself?  Am I correct that if ConnectIreland has a lead in a company and the IDA also has a lead in the same company it is then that the red lighting process kicks in or is it that both agencies are chasing the same individual?</p></speech>

ConnectIreland is different in that its ambassadors are connected and they have business networks and relationships with the particular companies, which enable them to tell ConnectIreland whether there has been active dialogue in their experience.  Unfortunately, I cannot take this conversation any further because it is a topic that is currently under dispute.  ConnectIreland never envisaged working on any companies where the IDA already had traction and was making progress.  That is not our intention.  We only ever intended bringing new companies on board, particularly companies that fall outside the target sector.  It is important to point out that in terms of the work that we do, we are an additional and complementary service that assists smaller companies.  There is a gap in this area which we are only too happy to fill.  We are not competing with other agencies for the same companies.  That is not the correct characterisation of ConnectIreland.  We seek only to bring new leads to Ireland, of which our connectors become aware through their own business dealings and spread around the globe.</p></speech>

I was very interested in the information provided regarding the cost per job.  Ms Murphy stated that the cost in this regard via the ConnectIreland process is &euro;4,000 versus &euro;10,000 via the IDA process, which chimes with an article I read in the media some time ago - possibly, the Sunday Business Post  - that ConnectIreland is effectively seeking millions of euro from the IDA.</p></speech>

ConnectIreland is concerned only with ensuring that its connectors are treated fairly and appropriately.  We have run, with great pride and, I hope, with some dignity, this Government-backed programme.  Up to December last, Mr. Moran, through his connection, had brought 125 jobs to Gweedore, which is a beautiful part of the world on the edge of Ireland.  ConnectIreland is focused on ensuring that Mr. Moran, and all other connectors that have done as Ireland has asked them to do, are duly recognised.  I hope I have answered Deputy Rock's question.</p></speech>

The reward that he is entitled to under the Government programme is not forthcoming.</p><p>This is part of the financial element we are seeking on behalf of our connectors, so "yes" is the answer.  If there is a dispute, it is over whether this is a successful initiative.  It is a success-only model.  If we get no jobs in, it costs the State zero.  I do not know of any similar initiative or any contract under which the Government works in such a format, but this is what we proposed at the start, purely as a patriotic initiative, to help attract jobs into the country.  It is as simple as that and it is working.  We have built a network of 78,000 people around the world, and as of Sunday we will ask these people to stop sending us leads.  This does not make sense to me.  Why-----</p></speech>

I just wonder how many villages in rural Ireland will not get their SLMs as a result of the fact that it appears the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is prepared to see ConnectIreland lapse this Sunday.  When we hear the figure of 957 companies in the pipeline, any of us who knows how the IDA works - and I used to work with the IDA regularly in a previous life - knows there is no way in heaven the IDA will be able to take on that pipeline in any way.  Let us be absolutely honest about that.  I find it very disturbing.  We have all worked collegiately on Brexit and produced a report last week.  I must put on the record that I am absolutely bewildered that the Department could consider letting ConnectIreland lapse in the way it proposed to do so.  I hope all of us, despite our ideological differences, can agree that we cannot allow this to happen and I appeal to my colleagues in Fine Gael, in particular, to use their influence to ensure that something happens before Sunday because the real victims will be the people in rural Ireland.</p> <p>  I have two questions.  It is important to get a perspective on this.  Why did Mr. Clune set up this initiative in the first place?  I think he has put up &euro;5 million.  Given what he has experienced, would he do it again?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-21a.489" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Terry Clune" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017032100002#DD00600"><p>As to why it was set up, the Taoiseach in 2011 was seeking ideas as to how we might attract more jobs into the country.  I participated in a business talk in Kilkenny, where I live, and said to those present that we should use our contacts around the world.  A lady stood up to say she was a distant relative, going back 120 years, of the Coca-Cola family, who had left Callan, County Kilkenny, and went on to be one of the founding families of Coke.  She still has a distant connection she has never utilised.  She also said to us that within three of miles of where she lives, in Windgap in rural Kilkenny, lived the man who designed the White House, and within six miles of where he in turn lived, the grandfather of Walt Disney lived.  This elderly lady told us of her connections and the connections of those connections in this tiny region of rural Kilkenny, and it just struck me that we really should utilise these connections.</p> <p>  There has been much talk of the diaspora for several years.  I proposed my idea to the Taoiseach and he really liked the concept.  I also proposed that I would finance it at the start and get it up and running and that we would be paid back over time as we became successful.  I proposed that it would run as a break-even initiative, which is ultimately the way it is materialising now.  We now have a huge network of educated connectors who know about the project, people all around the world who are eyes and ears for the country and are keeping their eyes and ears open.  If they hear about companies that are expanding, they let us know.  We receive huge numbers of leads every day.  Not all of them convert or turn into jobs for Ireland, but the State does not have to pay in that case.  The State simply pays us a small amount, two and a half times less than the cost of the IDA, for each job we get into the country.  It is a success-only model, so I see absolutely no national advantage in shutting it down.  To answer the Senator's question, I set it up as a patriotic initiative and thought I could get it done.  We had not only a fantastic team led by Ms Murphy, but also a massively loyal network of connectors around the world that we have now built who help the country for nothing.  We give them an opportunity to help the country, and it is as simple as that.</p><p>Would I do it again?  Absolutely.  It works.  There are challenges with it so we would like very much to be involved with a review rather than it being this contract whereby we are a direct contractor to IDA Ireland.  It should be a public-private structure whereby one can use the best of the private sector and the innovation of entrepreneurs with the structure and infrastructure of the State organisation to get a job done.  Ultimately, that is what we are doing but there is a lot of opportunity to fix the structure and make it much more successful into the future.</p><p> What we would really like is that, as one of the Deputies suggested earlier, rather than closing it down on Sunday, the Department would take it over as a short-term measure and operate it or oversee it until the review is conducted and completed.  Based on the outcome of the review, either the Department would continue running it, IDA Ireland would run it or Enterprise Ireland would do so.  However, somebody would run it or else the Department would deduce at the end that this does not make sense.  Closing it down and then carrying out a review does not make sense and is not in the national interest.</p></speech>

We have sought exactly that for almost three years, non-stop.  However, it is worth noting our legal advice on this issue is that, because of the unique nature of this programme, it does not require a tender.  We have it from one of the pre-eminent procurement lawyers in the country that in time of national emergency, such as with Brexit and given the fact it is unique, that is not required.  However, ConnectIreland would have been, and still is, very happy to enter into a tender process in order to facilitate that.</p> <p>  ConnectIreland is not a business.  This thing does not make a profit; it is a not-for-profit entity.  However, it is a passionate, wonderfully vibrant community of people who all have one golden thread running through them, namely, an affinity toward Ireland.  It is not a case of them and us.  It is not a case of wanting to put down the State agent partners.  We want to work with them.  We want to unify more and become more collegiate.  We want them to find a way to work with us also, understanding that the number of jobs we bring is smaller than what they are used to and may not be as interesting to them as other announcements may be, but that they are vital for Ireland.  ConnectIreland is open to any single iteration that allows us to continue our good work and to facilitate rural job creation in Ireland.</p></speech>

It is a challenge to be here on a Tuesday morning.  This is a very important issue and I want to put on record that I have met representatives from ConnectIreland.</p> <p>  Although we want to conclude this meeting quickly, I am struck by a host of issues.  There is no doubt one of the great things Ireland has is an extraordinary network of people around the world who feel very passionate and strongly about the country.  What disturbs me most from what the witnesses had to say is an impression I get that we will be saying to the diaspora, to which we put out our hands at a time when the country was in crisis, "We are all right now thanks very much".  That would be very wrong.</p> <p>  I sincerely hope the Department will reconsider this situation and I will certainly be talking to the Minister about it.  I am fully aware of the fact that this is very different to the work ConnectIreland does, and that it is a case of no fee, no foal.  It is about providing better value for money in a different sort of way.  It is going for the smaller scale of one to ten, 20 or 30 jobs as opposed to IDA Ireland, which works in the hundreds and thousands.  We want to support IDA Ireland and that is fantastic.  I fully accept the witnesses' point that it is not a case of either-or but, rather, that it is both working in tandem.</p> <p>  In Swords yesterday, I visited a home-grown company that started off in 2010 with six people, that now employs 120 and that is going to invest &euro;25 million in order to increase its workforce to 400 over the next three years.  The company in question began with a turnover of &euro;40,000 and this has risen to &euro;220 million.  From the little acorn, the great oak doth grow.  There are hundreds of such companies and we want to support them.</p><p>As the Taoiseach once said, if every SME in the country just took on one extra employee we would have 80,000 off the dole immediately.  The small ones also work really well.  I know there are disputes over figures and I accept that it is not the full story, that the verification process is much more difficult from ConnectIreland's point of view and it is not the same verification process used by IDA Ireland in other areas.  We certainly do not want to lose 78,000 connections around the world.  Perhaps rather than having a relationship with IDA Ireland, ConnectIreland might look to having a relationship with Enterprise Ireland.  One way or the other, I would be very strongly in favour of ConnectIreland continuing.  I do not believe one should turn off the light before examining what will replace it or how it was working.  It should be left on.  I hope the Minister will take action.  We will certainly be lobbying her very strenuously to ensure that happens.</p></speech>

We have been enormously proud.  We talked about 82 new-name greenfield investments over the short life of the programme.  It is not quite five years yet.  We are so proud.  IDA Ireland is one of the most successful inward investment agencies in the world.  We are terribly proud to have been able to contribute 22% of its own new-name greenfield projects over the same timeframe.  I hope that in some way answers the question.  It has been very successful.  We would not want to do it if it was not.  It is an evolving thing.  For 14 months consecutively we have had job announcements every single month coming through the initiative, including smaller companies.  It works.</p></speech>

We were talking about the seeking of the money from IDA Ireland.  I am curious about that and I ask the witnesses to deal conclusively with that.  Newspapers reported figures in the millions.  From where is that derived?  What exactly is that?</p></speech>

We have now got 2,351 jobs approved.  As those jobs are created on the ground, it will trigger a payment of &euro;4,000.  I imagine that the figure has come from 2,351 multiplied by &euro;4,000.</p></speech>

However, if we add to that consideration that rather than multiplying it by &euro;4,000, we multiply it by &euro;10,500, we can very easily deduce how much we have actually saved the State.

That would have been the path of least resistance.  We do not wish to do that.  We seek to continue and to grow.  Every day we are blown away by people, such as the two gentlemen on my right hand side, who have chosen this country.  To reiterate, I do not believe that this is a them-and-us situation.  There is little wrong with this initiative that a few people in a room with a constructive frame of mind could not resolve in a number of hours.  Issues such as verification and red lighting can be resolved.  There is not much wrong with it.  It is okay that there are gaps and that these things did not exist.  The programme is new and, if members will excuse the phrase, one does not throw the baby out with the bathwater.  One figures out where the issues are and resolves them.  That is what ConnectIreland seeks to do, and that is why we did not trigger an arbitration.  We did not want to.  We want to continue on behalf of our network across the globe.  We feel enormously pressurised in the context of Monday.  How do we tell those companies?  What do we say to them?  We have not figured that out yet, to be honest.</p></speech>

That is what we will be saying.  We are at various levels of dialogue with 900 companies.  The IDA is a very successful organisation, but we have the ongoing relationships with these companies.  We have built them and we have the dialogue.  The IDA is not structurally able and I assume would not be in a position suddenly to take over 900 other new companies when it is already stretched enough.  Again, the cost of our initiative is pay on success only.  In the interim, we hope the Department will be able to step in for a short period and have an interim or temporary contract with us while the review is done.  It will see the good aspects and we can share the things that could be improved.  That is good for the country.</p></speech>

We need all the connectivity we can muster to remain in place.  I thank the witnesses for the work they have done and for all the jobs and goodwill they have brought as well as for cementing the connectivity with the diaspora.  The last message that should come from this meeting is, "Thanks very much, we are all right now."  The message we should convey is that we appreciate the tremendous patriotism and connectivity of the people who have left this country, we value it above and beyond jobs and that it is something we want to grow and flourish in good times as well as bad.  Although we are in a much better place than we were previously, we still need all that connectivity.  It works both ways.  Much goodwill and many possibilities can flow back to the countries that make the connections here.  I thank the witnesses and assure them we will lobby the Minister very hard on this.  We want the message to go back to the 78,000 connections, and to the many more it is hoped the organisation will make, that we appreciate and value them, regardless of the jobs side of it.</p></speech>

It is a great pity and a great contrast that while ConnectIreland is here and giving us answers, the Minister and the IDA are not present.

Its endeavours have been very worthwhile.  I thank Ms Murphy for her efforts.  She has worked extremely hard for the past few years, especially in the past three months, to ensure that ConnectIreland will still be working for Ireland next Monday.</p> <p>  I thank Mr. Moran and Mr. Salam for connecting with each other and bringing jobs to Gweedore in County Donegal.  We like to hear such news as we all have rural and urban areas in our constituencies.  It is fantastic to see jobs created in a rural part of Gweedore.  Both men are more than welcome to bring jobs to County Waterford.  </p></speech>
