We are delighted to be here and we are thankful for the invitation to attend.  When my colleagues have introduced themselves, Dr. Nicholas Breakwell will give a short presentation on Hibernia College's experience and what it does.

T&aacute;im ag obair leis an gcol&aacute;iste le dh&aacute; bhliain ag iarraidh c&uacute;rsa&iacute; Gaeilge a chur chun cinn ann agus an teanga a fhorbairt i measc na mac l&eacute;inn agus na foirne.

I will give a brief overview of the college and the programmes it offers, and perhaps say a little about our history and how we arrived at our current position.  I will talk members through the document we sent them and pick out some highlights.  We were established in 2000 and therefore have been in operation for approximately 12 years.  We started our first HETAC-accredited programme in 2002, a master's degree in public administration in partnership with Dublin City Council.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-13a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/999" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="13:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013031300004#C00200"><p>I welcome the representatives of Hibernia College and thank them for outlining to us the developmental progress the college has made in recent years.  The witnesses have highlighted a very interesting development in terms of how it is providing its educational programmes and the fact that web-based learning is a very significant element of those programmes.</p><p>  Regarding the primary education qualification at postgraduate level, how does the cost compare with the cost of such courses in the State colleges?  Is Hibernia College cheaper or more expensive?  I presume 100% of the costs are covered by the students themselves.  The supply and demand issue is often raised with regard to the development of web-based courses.  Such courses are obviously more convenient and flexible in terms of being able to increase numbers, in comparison with the more traditional, college and classroom-based system.  What is the college's view on the fact that there are many students graduating with primary level qualifications who are struggling to find jobs as a result of the increase in the pupil-teacher ratio in recent years?  The number of children at primary level is expanding and an additional 10,000 pupils are expected to enter the primary school system this year.  I ask the witnesses to comment on this.  Is it an issue for the college's students?  Is the college getting feedback from its graduates on this matter?  Do the witnesses believe it is something that needs to be addressed?  I also ask them to comment on actual employment numbers and the statistics for graduates of the college.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-13a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/984" speakername="Jonathan O'Brien" time="13:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013031300005#D00200"><p>Deputy McConalogue covered most of the areas in which we are interested.  Could the witness perhaps profile the type of student who accesses the courses?  Is it an older student returning to education?  It would be interesting to know if they are people who are changing careers or people who are out of work and seeking to return to employment.  Using the facility to learn online is much easier for them than going to a college, particularly if one has been out of education for a long time.  Sometimes returning to a college setting can be a little daunting and it might suit to do the course online.  I am interested in hearing about the type of student involved as well as the number of students.  The outstanding figure for me is that the college is producing between 35% and 40% of all newly qualified primary teachers.  That is a huge number for a single institution to produce.  There is also the issue of supply and demand.  One of the criticisms levelled at Hibernia College is that it produces too many teachers when the demand does not exist.  How would the witness respond to such charges?</p><p>  Obviously, there are huge advantages to e-learning.  Are there any disadvantages to learning solely online in terms of the personal development between teachers and students?  Are there areas where it can be improved but the technology has not yet caught up with what the college wants to do?  It would be interesting to hear how the college envisages the e-learning experience developing over the next ten years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-13a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1131" speakername="Fidelma Healy Eames" time="13:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013031300005#D00300"><p>I welcome our guests.  It is nice to meet Dr. Se&aacute;n Rowland again.  I know a little about what the college does as I did supervised teacher practice for a time for Hibernia College.  Will the witnesses give a breakdown of the percentage of face-to-face encounters for students versus the percentage of the course that would be totally online?  Face-to-face encounters would include weekend tutorials, as well as the teaching practice.  I congratulate the college.  It appears to be a global provider of education now.  It is good that it started here at home.  The teachers bring an extra experience to the classroom, in terms of e-learning and digital learning awareness, which does not exist in other colleges.  I have met the college's students and they are the same as students who go to the regular colleges, having worked in one such college previously.</p><p>  I will offer some criticisms to the witnesses to give them an opportunity to respond to them.  Like Deputy McConalogue and Deputy O'Brien, I am frequently told that the Government should cap the numbers going into teacher training colleges, especially Hibernia College, because there is no hope of that number of teachers getting posts when they graduate.  I am sure the witnesses will respond to that.</p><p>  The witness said the college has gone into the second level sector.  What is the position with that?  Will the college use the same model?  I feel bad for second level teachers.  It sometimes takes them up to ten years to get a permanent position in this country.  What will the college bring to that level that will be helpful, given the situation as it is?  With regard to qualifications, Dr. Nicholas Breakwell said that academic accreditation is critical.  Of course it is.  How does the qualification rank <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the traditional qualification from teacher training colleges?  I realise it is a BEd postgraduate.  Has any independent study been carried out in which the Hibernia College qualification has been compared with, for example, the qualification from Mary Immaculate College, St. Patrick's College or Marino College?  If not, would the college be open to that in terms of, perhaps, even contributing to or sponsoring such an independent study?</p><p>  To return to the schools' experience, what type of supports does the college give to the schools that take its teachers?  I used to receive criticism in that regard.  The schools felt that they had to do a good deal of the training of the teacher because the teacher did not have as much face-to-face experience.  When the teacher came to the classroom, it was left up to the school.  The chances are that the college has improved that aspect hugely, but I am anxious to know a little more about it.  Has the college surveyed the students regarding their experience of distance learning and what was their satisfaction with it?  Would they like a little more face-to-face time and how is the college working on that?</p><p>  Are the college's students subject to the same external qualification examination as the students of Mary Immaculate College, St. Patrick's College and Marino College would be?  Hibernia College has now expanded to the UK.  How did the college get started there in terms of linking in with the government and so forth?</p></speech>

I will address them directly and if I omit anything, just pull me up on it, Chairman.</p><p>  I thank the members for their questions.  It is great to have the opportunity to discuss this.  I will ask Dr. Nicholas Breakwell and Ms Anna Davitt to intervene as appropriate.  We interview all of the candidates who will be accepted.  We interview them in Irish and in English.  They all hold level 8 or university college degrees already and they all must have a standard of Irish that we consider to be sufficient to sustain and develop them through a postgraduate level course.  Most of the people who come to the college would have had a career already.  They tend to be in their late 20s, 30s, 40s and 50s.  A large number of them are regionally based throughout the country.  They do not have to move to a city, rent an apartment and leave home.  Many issues do not arise for them because they can study from home.</p><p>  The cost is the same.  All of our students pay their tuition, just as all the graduate students at other colleges pay their tuition to go to a teacher training programme.  However, the one difference is that obviously the other colleges get State intervention for the students.  We do not get that.  However, the student pays the same amount, &euro;9,000, for a two year course.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-13a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Nicholas Breakwell" time="13:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013031300006#E00200"><p>I will first address some of the questions about the nature of e-learning perhaps with an anecdote.  Massive open online courses or MOOCs are a phenomenon sweeping through higher education currently.  The first was a course in artificial intelligence run by Stanford University.  More than 100,000 first registered for the programme while significantly fewer finished it.  The course was run concurrently on site at the university as well.  Several thousand students finished the programme and of the top 100 performers in the examination, only one was in the on-site programme.  Increasingly, the question is not how online learning can be as good as traditional face to face learning but how can face to face learning up its game to become as good as online learning.  That is what we would say to anybody who has any doubts or who is seeking comfort in the value and the quality of online provision - not just our provision but high quality online provision anywhere else in the globe.</p><p>  With regard to comparisons of our initial teacher training provision in Ireland with other providers of such training -  we are talking here about the postgraduate programme - as far as costs go, we have benchmarked our fees against those charged by other providers but they also receive, in addition to the fee paid by the student, a considerable and variable amount from the Exchequer to supplement that ranging from &euro;8,000 in the case of the large colleges such as St. Patrick's college and Marino college to &euro;40,000 in the smaller colleges which only train a small number of students.  As far as the students go, they pay almost the same at plus or minus 5%.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-13a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1010" speakername="Joanna Tuffy" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013031300007#F00400"><p>Yes, of course.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-13a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Nicholas Breakwell" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013031300007#F00500"><p>There is no formal workforce modelling system in place in Ireland.  This was a point raised by the Teaching Council of Ireland and in other fora.  It would appear to be extremely difficult to achieve.  Therefore, in the absence of any formal measures, Hibernia College, along with other providers, departmental officials and the Teaching Council of Ireland, is attempting to make a guesstimate of what the future demand for teachers might be.  We have commenced our post-primary teacher programme because we believe that by the time the students graduate in any substantial numbers in 2014 there will be a demand for post-primary teachers because of the significant demographic explosion of which the committee members will be aware.</p><p>  As members of the committee mentioned, there appears to be an over-supply of teachers in the post-primary market at the moment.  That over-supply is being funded and provided by the State because Hibernia College has not yet produced any graduates from those programmes.  There is a need to look at both State provision as well as private provision.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-13a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Se&aacute;n Rowland" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013031300007#F00600"><p>Since times have become more austere we have introduced dozens of scholarships to provide tuition at a greatly reduced rate, often 18% or 20% of the total.  This came about because we found that successful applicants could not get the money together to pay the fees.  We cannot be an instrument that allows only the rich to take these courses.  We have literally given out dozens of these scholarships.</p><p>  We also give scholarships to athletes in different sports from around the country.  It has been the case that the more elite athletes tend to leave their communities in favour of an educational institution where the facilities are better for them.  We have been pleased to facilitate more athletes staying in their own areas which they had been unable to do previously, while continuing to study for their qualifications.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-13a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1154" speakername="Averil Power" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013031300007#F00700"><p>I thank the delegates for their presentation.  I had the benefit of a briefing from Hibernia College last year and as a result I asked the committee to invite the delegates to attend today.  It has been a very interesting discussion.  In my view, e-learning has massive potential as an education system in general.</p><p>  We have been overly conservative in our attitude to e-learning.  The delegates explained that the students are visible online.  There is a lot of myth and suspicion spread about e-learning.  Some people think that the students will only click into a tutorial and then not stay for the duration of the class because it is online.  That is a very conservative and unfair attitude.  I have seen how the system works.  I can see the potential for people who have had the experience of college life but who wish to upskill without the need to be physically present or to travel distances.  It is most useful for lectures because all one needs to do is listen to the lecturer.  </p><p>  My questions have been asked by other members.  I refer to Deputy O'Brien's question about age profiles.  I ask the delegates to clarify that point more specifically.  Are they people with families?  I can understand why this would be the case in the primary teaching courses.  Is there a younger student profile?  I ask for the delegates' views on the progress of e-learning in Ireland in general.  They may not wish to comment on the practice in other institutions.  I think we have been too conservative in general.</p><p>  There is potential for the use of e-learning at second level.  I noted recent coverage in the newspapers about a school in west Dublin - in Deputy Tuffy's area, perhaps.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, referred to the school in a speech to the Seanad last week.  He said that two schools were doing honours maths through an online platform.  I think the delegates may have some advice in this area because there is a need to extend this form of teaching.  Hibernia College has partnership arrangements with the pharmaceutical sector as a response to a business need.  Is there potential for partnerships with other sectors that may be looking for similar programmes?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-13a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1166" speakername="Jim D'Arcy" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013031300007#F00800"><p>I welcome the delegates.  In my years as a school principal I had many students from Hibernia College doing their teaching practice in the school.  I am thinking of the three students who were in the school in 2007 and 2008 who were excellent.  They all have jobs now and one of them is a vice-principal after a couple of years.  The other two are very well regarded.  I visited one of them recently in my old school.  Hibernia College is doing a good job training teachers and the standards are very high.  The teaching practice examiners are also very good and they give good advice.</p><p>  I have a couple of questions.  The legislation for the new education and training boards is going through both Houses.  Is there a role for Hibernia College to use e-learning to teach language skills?  A jobs fair was held recently in Dundalk.  Persons with language skills are in demand from companies such as PayPal which hopes to employ more than 1,000 people.  Currently, PayPal employs 220 but only 35 of those employees are Irish.  The company is advertising abroad for workers.  </p><p>  T&aacute; Anna Davitt anseo agus t&aacute; c&uacute;ram na Gaeilge uirthi.  An f&eacute;idir le&iacute; cur s&iacute;os a thabhairt d&uacute;inn ar caid&eacute; at&aacute; ar si&uacute;l &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge de i gCol&aacute;iste Hibernia?  T&aacute; an-suim agam san &aacute;bhar sin.  </p></speech>

I have anecdotal evidence that there is concern among members of the teaching profession and in the teacher unions about the size of Hibernia College's share of the market.  The number of qualified teachers from the college is very high and concerns have been expressed to me about what that might mean for the quality of teachers in the future.  While I agree that online education is very much a part of the future, having had a look at it myself, I believe students are losing something by not being in the lecture hall.  I accept that with the technology, which is similar to Skype, one is seeing the person delivering the course but the lecturer is not physically present and in that sense, there is something missing.  The Open University has that problem too but it has a certain amount of on-site tutorials built into its courses.  Perhaps the representatives might clarify if they have on-site provision too.</p></speech>

What is the bottom line?  The college is not a charitable organisation but a business, and I would like some information on the financial aspects, if possible.  My final question relates to the education system in Finland.  This committee examined the system in that country and has prepared a report for the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In that country, they place great emphasis on pedagogy.  I know it is part of the curriculum here, as it stands, but how much emphasis would the college place on that and how would it compare with the other teacher training colleges in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-13a.31" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1131" speakername="Fidelma Healy Eames" time="13:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013031300008#G00600"><p>The college works with postgraduates in the main, which is good because, as the witnesses have said, they have had the university experience.  Do the witnesses believe there would be benefits in working with undergraduates?  Does the college have an interest in the area of second level education at all?  As Senator D'Arcy mentioned, there are particular areas where our performance is very poor in this country, one of which is language learning.  Our performance in digital learning at second level is also relatively poor because we do not have enough students with the confidence to apply through the CAO system for computer science and information and communication technology courses.  This is happening despite the fact it is estimated that there will be approximately 900,000 jobs across the EU in those areas by 2015.</p><p>  Has the college tracked the progress of its graduates, in terms of longitudinal work and whether they are staying in teaching?  To elaborate a little on what the Chairman said about empathy, will we get empathy from a teacher who does not have much face-to-face interaction with students?  I think 50:50 is pretty good but empathy is a key ingredient in relationship building, and relationships are the key factor for children and teachers.  If there is not a good relationship between teacher and student, there will be no learning.</p><p>  In these austere times, would there be a temptation on the part of the State to move the majority of students to the private education sector so that the State would not have to pay for their education in the teacher education colleges?  It might save State funding to the public colleges like Mary Immaculate College, Saint Patrick's College and the Marino Institute of Education.  Do the witnesses have any thoughts on that?</p></speech>

Does that also apply to Hibernia College?  I ask the witnesses to expand on what has happened in the last ten years since the college became involved in providing postgraduate courses at primary level, in terms of the numbers of graduates and the number of jobs available in that period.  During that period, have the numbers graduating from the State training colleges remained constant?  If they have remained constant and Hibernia College is graduating 40% of new teachers, that implies there are 40% more graduates now than there were ten years ago.  I ask the witnesses to compare the increased number of graduates with the demands within the system.  The witnesses said that 80% of their graduates are being hired, according to the college's own internal survey.  I am seeking figures for the number of jobs available and the number of graduates qualifying.  While Hibernia College has been increasing the number of primary teaching graduates, the State has been paying the same money to the traditional teacher training colleges.  If there is a big gap between the total number of graduates and the total number of teachers in the education system, then perhaps the State needs to reassess its funding of teacher training.</p><p>  Obviously, the representatives are here promoting their own case.  Hibernia College is a profit-making education provider and there is nothing wrong with that.  Obviously, the programmes it provides must be of high quality in order to attract students.  I was interested in the points made about the additional costs involved in educating students in the State colleges.  The estimate provided was that it costs an additional  &euro;8,000 to &euro;10,000 to educate students in the larger teacher training colleges.  I ask the witnesses to give a breakdown of those figures and explain how they arrived at that estimate.  The estimate given for the smaller training colleges was up to &euro;40,000 per student, which is very high.  I ask the witnesses to elaborate on that figure too.</p></speech>

When one looks at the history, psychology and sociology of education, as well as the philosophy of education, all of these courses contribute to the core of the curriculum that student teachers must successfully complete and be examined on in order to graduate.  In looking at our provision, we have been very fortunate to attract the input of some international experts.  The dean of the Graduate School of Education at Harvard University, Kathleen McCartney, is on our board, for example, and she offers great insights into education in Finland, a country she frequently visits, as well as education in the United States.  We also have many colleagues in the United Kingdom and here in Ireland too.  I know that Senator Healy Eames has been in the United States and got her doctorate there.</p></speech>

I first heard the word "pedagogy" in the 1970s; this is the core of every teacher education programme.  Teacher educators and teachers share a respect for it, but it is multi-faceted.  It must be consistently nurtured through theory, practice, research and common sense.  Going back to what Senator Healy Eames said, it is all about the relationship and whether a person can nourish a relationship with children in the classroom as individuals and as a group.  The pedagogy around the curriculum would support the person if he or she is the right person, which is why everybody must be interviewed face to face.  We also have a system under which approximately 25 people are on interview panels; these are rotated so that the same three people are not on any panel.  If a person comes before them whom they know or whose parents they know, the person on the panel must recuse himself or herself.  A different panel would do the interview.</p><p>  We have had cases in which letters were sent supporting applications.  If an interviewer is ever contacted on behalf of a candidate, he or she must step back.  We are incredibly rigorous about interviews; a member of my family has been turned down.  The interview is where the door to the career is opened, and it can be a long and difficult career for the wrong person.</p></speech>

We need to look at a potential teacher as somebody who can absolutely enrich, educate and support a child or children.  We must build tools around our programme to ensure we make that person the best teacher possible now.  We cannot predict what those people will be in future, as different people engage in long-term careers in different ways.  We must start with the right ingredients by building empathy and relationships while having the academic and intellectual capacity to be an education leader.  The worst thing to hear in a staff room is a conversation about "Coronation Street".  I want to hear about the latest research on pedagogy or child development from Yale, etc.  That is professional education.  We are in a strong place with teachers and we have managed to keep the quality of people going into teaching, particularly in Irish primary schools, very high.</p></speech>

Bhuna&iacute;omar cumann Gaelach ansin le d&eacute;ana&iacute; agus t&aacute; oifigigh Ghaeilge againn sna gr&uacute;pa&iacute; difri&uacute;la.  Beidh scol&aacute;ireachta&iacute; &aacute; mbronnadh againn am&aacute;rach, scol&aacute;ireachta&iacute; Gaeltachta, ar mhic l&eacute;inn.  T&aacute; an Ghaeilge ag f&aacute;s agus ag forbairt sa chol&aacute;iste agus t&aacute; an-b&eacute;im ar an nGaeilge mar theanga bheo agus mar theanga chumars&aacute;ide.

They are outside the CAO.  The person applies directly to the college and if the application gets through us it goes into the University of London.  The person ends up getting a B.Sc. from the University of London, the London School of Economics or Goldsmiths College, which are unquestionably world class.  It is very hard work.  These people work really hard.  The application pool has been older.  They are from people who have decided that they must get a degree because they do not have one, because they started one and did not finish it or for whatever reason.  There are thousands of people who do not have a college degree and some of them decide they want one and are willing to do the time.</p><p>  Yes, they are older.  Most of them would not be able to afford to give up work, go back to college, pay rent for an apartment and pay tuition and all that goes with it.  It is just not possible for them.  With this, they can still work.  To be fair, some of them work part time.  They can stay at home and if they have child care needs they can attend to those as well.  This is not generally for the 18 year old.  The last thing one wants to do is send an 18 year old up to his or her room to click Skype and go on seminars.  There is a social personal development dimension to going on campus.  We do not argue with that at all.  However, that is not an option for some people, so one is denying them access in a way or they are denying themselves, whether it is for financial, geographical, age or job reasons.  Basically, the two words we live by are "quality" and "access".  Access is very possible when one can access this from anywhere in the world.</p><p>  We have been focusing primarily on the teacher education programme, which is very important.  However, we must also look at Ireland as a resource for course work that could be delivered into countries that do not have those courses.  It is huge and we have the technology to do that.  We just need to get the team together.  The team members at present are all playing their own game on their own pitch, and we will not win unless we get together and play an Ireland team game.  I really believe that is possible.  There are some talks now in progress among institutions, that would not have been a regular occurrence in the past.  We are beginning to realise that whether one is a State, private or public concern, we are all Irish, we all want a quality product and we all want to go out into the world and sell it.  There is nothing to be ashamed of, so sell it.  We gave it away for a long time, but there is no reason not to sell it.  It creates jobs here, which is what we are supporting.  Our M.Sc in pharmaceutical medicine is in 36 countries and is delivered out of Mayo.  It is a remarkable opportunity.</p></speech>

Where does Dr. Rowland see the concept of e-learning going over the next ten years?  It is an important development.  He has been involved for the last decade so he has seen the advantages.  How does he envisage it progressing over the next ten years?  Will it be based more on research?  Will the technology itself hinder the progress that can be made?</p></speech>

Are those relationships getting in the way of finding opportunities for Hibernia College's students for teaching practice?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-13a.80" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Se&aacute;n Rowland" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013031300010#J00800"><p>I will address the last question first.  "No" is the answer.  There are more than enough schools that are interested in taking student teachers for every college.  Traditionally, it is fair to say that some schools would claim they would never take a student from college X or would only take students from another college.  That is fine.  That is the way life is in most countries.  However, there is ample opportunity and the teachers and principals are very engaged.  They are extremely supportive.  There are many new schools in suburban areas that have never had student teachers and they are eager to participate as well.  We tell our student teachers that they must be prepared to travel for teaching practice, because we cannot always give them the school around the corner from their house.  That said, one finds that many students tell us that they have already asked the principal of the school down the road.  It is a community event; it is a piece of everything.  We tend to follow the students' lead on where they want to do the practice.  However, there is a variety of experiences that they must have in different teaching practices, so they cannot get the cosy third class for the entire period.  Does that answer the Deputy's question?</p></speech>

This addresses the quality of provision, access and flexibility.  I did not make it up.<blockquote><br />I would like to take this opportunity to say thank you to you and your wonderful staff.  I have enjoyed immensely my course to date.  Without doubt it has been one of the most challenging things I have undertaken.  Balancing working full-time and four children under nine, on top of a postgrad, has been tough going but I don't think I will ever find the words to explain how satisfying and fulfilling it has been.  It has given me the opportunity to fulfil a dream that, without Hibernia, would not have been possible.</blockquote></p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-13a.86" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Con McMahon" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013031300011#K00400"><p>I thank the committee for inviting us.  I am joined by Mr. Philip O'Callaghan and my presentation is on ICT and e-portfolios in schools.  The name of our system is Schoolbag or An M&aacute;la Scoile.  Some of the key principles on which the new junior certificate is built include the idea that people learn best when they work collaboratively with others, take greater responsibility for their learning, deepen learning by embedding key concepts through active engagement in their learning and can reflect on their portfolios of work.  It is recognised that limited assessment techniques undermine the goal of achieving collaborative learning and the objective of embedding student learning.  The priority today is repeating information and, to a more limited extent, applying and analysing information on examination day.  The current assessment techniques are built around working out the right answer.  Individual achievement is generally only valued for assessment purposes and collaborative effort, in most cases, is considered a form of cheating.</p><p>  Therefore, central to the success of the new junior certificate is to broaden not just the modes of learning but also the modes of assessment.  The need for a change in assessment is accompanied by a need for a means for schools, teachers and students to create and store work.  The current tools available to teachers to record evidence of learning, which are all paper-based, are unlikely to meet the needs of schools or the needs of the economy.  Schoolbag looks to meet the challenge of a change in assessment.  It was built to create a digital workspace where students can create and store work and teachers can provide feedback.  It is a cloud-based solution and students' work will never get lost.  Schoolbag provides a technology infrastructure which facilitates the broadening assessment modes of the new junior certificate.  With further development, it can allow for greater external moderation of student work.  </p><p>  Schoolbag is a 100% Irish-owned company which was founded by me in 2011.  The platform is now being used by more than 20 schools.  An Irish language version of the system, An M&aacute;la Scoile, is also in operation.  The Schoolbag software solution provides particular features.  Schoolbag is an online e-portfolio in which students can place their online work and present it for feedback or correction by teachers.  Teachers can post questions or projects online.  The input of all students can be seen and this encourages and directs collaboration.  It works to provide a better understanding of individual contributions in group work.  It improves and speeds up communication with parents as they can receive e-mails directly from teachers about issues concerning their children.  The teacher can automatically assign homework to students or groups of students.  If students are absent, they will know what has been covered in class.  Teachers can provide students with electronic notes that are permanently available and never get lost.  This significantly reduces the cost of photocopying for schools.</p></speech>

I apologise in advance, as I will need to leave this meeting shortly to attend another appointment.  I met Mr. McMahon last year and discussed this in detail.  It is a really interesting initiative for students to be able to have all that content there and also for parents.  In this day and age we need to move away from homework journals and notes going home in the physical schoolbag.  We need to give parents a way to check in with what their children are doing, particularly at primary level in an online space where they can do that from work and can check in and out at different times.  I will not pose any questions because it would be rude to do so when I know I will not be here to hear the answers.  I hope other members found the presentation interesting and I am sure they will have questions for him.</p></speech>

I know that it offers a service to the more than 20 schools in which it is being used.  How does it work?  Do the schools get a software package from Schoolbag?  Do they pay for that?  Obviously Schoolbag is a new initiative and that may be why only 20 schools work with it.  Are they all based in a particular region in order to try to develop it first or is this something that can be delivered to any school anywhere provided they have the technology to use it?</p><p>  The homework diaries etc. are all online and a teacher can upload it from the class.  Even a student, who is away on holidays or out sick, can access work online.  Is there a facility to do the homework online and submit it to the teacher to assess it?  While it might not happen often, a student might fall ill or be involved in an accident and miss a few weeks of school.  Particularly in the exam years in post-primary education missing a few weeks can be critical.  Are the schools with which Schoolbag currently works primary, post-primary or both?</p></speech>

What kind of hardware is required?  Does everybody need a laptop in the classroom?  What kind of hardware is required at home to facilitate parents interacting with this?  Some working class families may not be in tune with modern technology.  Will that be a barrier for entry in getting those families involved?</p></speech>

Approximately 18 months ago I requested that he would appear before the committee and I am delighted to see him present.  I was not a member of the previous committee.  I have sat in a schoolroom with him and seen the entire operation at first hand.  I am really disappointed that the Department of Education and Skills has taken an individual on secondment from a major multinational company to advise the Department on the way forward on issues such as this.  There is a huge conflict of interest given the company for which that individual works.  There is a lack of foresight in not picking up on an operation such as that of Schoolbag.  I know some of the schools in which it is involved and some in County Kildare are quite positive towards it.</p><p>  What are Mr. McMahon's views of e-books which would be part and parcel of the ongoing learning process?  E-books are more expensive than printed books because the VAT rate and EU-wide VAT rate.  We cannot solve the problem in Ireland - it can only be done at EU level.  What is the best way to reduce the costs in future?</p></speech>

It is rare that we will invite a private company to appear because issues of fairness arise as we cannot cater for everyone.  The purpose of this meeting, therefore, is to identify what we can learn from different private sector organisations involved in the education sector.  This is being done with a view to identifying the bigger issues, rather than promoting their respective businesses.  The purpose of these meetings is to examine issues related to e-books and so forth, after which we will compile a report that will address some of the issues raised.  What size is the Schoolbag company?  How many staff does it employ and with what percentage of schools does it engage?</p></speech>

The system is cloud based, which means we visit schools and offer them the system.  Previously, there was no such system operating in Ireland and we spotted a gap or need in the market and sought to service this need.  We visit schools and offer a pilot service free of charge because it is hard to charge for something that no one has heard of and which does not have a track record.  The past two years have been a process of bringing schools along by educating and learning from them.  We take a pilot group of perhaps five or six teachers who are interested in innovation and bringing more information technology into their classrooms.  We then sign up each teacher with his or her own online schoolbag - we do what it says on the tin - and they, in turn, sign up their students with their schoolbags.  This creates a connection between the teacher and students and their work can be completed online or offline.  Students and teachers can communicate and store and complete work in their individual e-portfolios.  It is a requirement of the junior certificate curriculum that continuous assessment work be stored in portfolios.  We have tried to develop a vehicle that can take us from the current position where not much information and communications technology, ICT, or portfolio work is being done in schools and the majority of students and teachers are not sufficiently ICT literate to where we need to be in the a few years from now.  Schoolbag has been working to achieve this objective.</p><p>  In terms of the hardware in place, we have never specifically targeted advantaged or disadvantaged schools.  Schoolbag has always been offered as another medium in class.  Handouts, textbooks, copybooks and online work can be facilitated by our technology.  Leaving certificate applied programmes are provided in some disadvantaged schools.  Much of the work in these programmes is done online, for example, maintaining curricula vitae and so forth, and can be facilitated and stored in Schoolbag.  Many schools are organising events to raise funds for software and asking parents to fork out money to purchase a new device.  Some are forsaking the information technology their students already have, namely, smartphones, which provide access to greater amounts of information.  Schoolbag<i></i>seeks to control, monitor and curb this access in order that social networking and so forth can be promoted and used positively by schools, rather than getting out of control, as is sometimes the case.</p></speech>

Deputy Brendan Ryan mentioned the digital divide.  Last year, approximately 50 schools had iPads for first year students and the view is that this number will increase significantly in the coming years.  The feedback many schools are receiving is that if students are to have an iPad, people do not want the added expense of buying hard copies of books, journals, etc.  What Schoolbag does is digitise some of the resources that have been used thus far in hard copy.  As Deputy Jonathan O'Brien suggested, homework can be accessed online, including by students who are off school for reasons such as sickness.</p><p>  In terms of employees, Schoolbag was taken over by the Peak Learning company earlier in the week.  Peak Learning has between ten and 12 full-time employees and a number of seasonal staff.  We have been working in education for approximately ten years under a number of divisions, including the mock examination area.  We see great scope for synergy in the first schools division and are focusing on the provision of hard copy student journals in that area.  As schools go digital in the years ahead, they will require a digital solution.  The way in which schools can process data is an issue of great significance.  If students have information written in hard copy books and there is no centralised means of accessing this data, it is difficult for principals, form teachers and so forth to intervene at an early stage if an issue arises.  With the type of system we provide, which offers parental access and so on, early intervention becomes much easier if there is an issue.  </p><p>  As we indicated, approximately 20 schools are using the system, essentially on a pilot basis.  On the fees charge, to date, none of the schools in question has been charged for our service, although that model will obviously change.  The reason we have engaged with Schoolbag is our belief that it offers enormous potential.  The market will decide whether I am correct.</p><p>  Deputy Anthony Lawlor suggested the most expensive part of the entire process is e-books.  If one looks forward, the nature of the e-book will change.  It currently comes in standard book form, perhaps in a PDF format with some additional resources.  The new junior certificate curriculum will offer many short courses.  What one will probably find is that there will be many more teacher-generated resources and much more sharing of these resources.  The nature of learning on the Internet is different from the nature of learning from a hard copybook in that it is a more interactive experience.  We will find that the types of resources being used in schools will change over time.</p> <p>Obviously the e-book is expensive and there is no secondhand market for an e-book.  That adds significantly to the cost, or at least to the whole cost of ownership but over time that will change.  Are there any other questions that I have missed?</p></speech>

Is the software registered to the school or to the teacher?  I understand the teacher has the portfolio set up online and then signs up the students to their own individual portfolios.  Is their an issue with maintenance and technical support?  I presume it is not a case of going into the schools and selling the software to the teachers or the schools as ongoing support must be available to those teachers.  In the event of an issue with the software whom they can contact?  After the school decides to sign up to the software and receives it what is the connection with the company?</p></speech>

It provides a framework for that early intervention, which is very important, and it provides a framework for the sharing of resources between teachers within a school, teachers cross-schools and between the teacher and the student.</p></speech>

In essence it brings competition into learning.  Students excel when they have to compete against themselves and against others.  It is a very valuable way to encourage learning.  Schoolbag is involved in an ICT policy unit with the Department of Education and Skills which is seeking to develop technical specifications for a national e-portfolio system.  Within those specifications it looks for collaborative learning which is a feature we have in Schoolbag, a discussion area that in essence is competition where a teacher might post a question or put students into a project group and they will see each others' learning.  This has a huge influence on students.  When they see that somebody else is able to read their post they can delete it and rewrite it.  It puts a whole new emphasis to what they are writing.  It will not just be corrected by the students, it is peer-to-peer learning.  It brings in competition which has been one of the most successful features in Schoolbag which is a feature that the ICT policy unit in the Department of Education and Skills is promoting along with many others.</p></speech>

Smuggled cigarettes are on open sale at markets and fairs all over the country.  Door to door selling in urban areas is rising rapidly.  It is distressing for shop-keepers who pay rates and comply with a multitude of regulations to see an illegal cigarette seller undermining his business without any restraints.  The illicit trade is not a small-time, petty criminal's activity.</p><p>  Last autumn the US Congress published a report, citing its own Department of Homeland Security, which listed the Real IRA alongside Hezbollah, Hamas and the Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, as global terrorist groups financed through the illicit tobacco trade.  Closer to home, the 2012 cross-Border organised crime assessment prepared by the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Justice in Northern Ireland in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI, stated that dissident republicans are generating significant sums of money from fuel laundering and tobacco smuggling.</p><p>  According to a recent survey, 29.8% of cigarettes consumed in Ireland had not been taxed here.</p></speech>

Mr. Sweeney's points are well made.  It is always in our interests to combat the black market.  What does he say to arguments made by respectable groups such as the Irish Heart Foundation, in a submission to the committee, that there is an excessive focus on the issue of smuggling as a means of arguing against increased taxation on tobacco?  They argue that there is a proven link between taxation on tobacco and reduced risks and better health outcomes.  They also argue that those such as the tobacco companies, but also the retailers, who argue against increases in tax on tobacco continue to raise prices.  What does Mr. Sweeney say to those arguments?</p></speech>

It creates a bigger gap between the retail price in a legitimate outfit and the price on the black market.</p><p>  We are responsible retailers.  We observe the law.  We implement regulation on behalf of the Government.  How will the Government implement the regulation if it does not control the black market?  We are their source of implementing regulation.</p><p>  We have co-operated with Government for many years.  We have implemented age-restrictive regulation.  We have banned the sale of cigarettes in tens.  We are now subject to a ban on display - we cannot display the product.  All of this has contributed to more focus on availability on the black market.</p><p>  I stated in my opening remarks that we now find that those under the age of 30 are not coming in to our shops to buy tobacco, and yet they are smoking it.  In previous years, we had a problem with those under age trying to buy tobacco in our shops.  Many of us had a difficult time identifying them, checking their age, etc.  In my case, as a retailer in north Dublin, I now never get approached by juveniles for tobacco.  They do not need to come to my shop.  They can get it so easily and so cheaply.</p></speech>

Recently I attended a briefing in Limerick organised by the retailers at which the tobacco companies and the Revenue customs officials were present, and it was quite informative.  They said much of what Mr. Sweeney said here today.</p><p>  I ask Mr. Sweeney to be a little more prescriptive in how the illegal tobacco trade should be dealt with.  It is fine saying there should be more enforcement and more penalties, but one is dealing with Premiership-style criminality in the crime gangs involved.  If the State seeks to increase the taxation on tobacco, it is a matter of balance in trying to raise revenue but also not drive more of the market into the hands of those who are peddling the product on the black market.  What exactly is NFRN Ireland saying is the best way to deal with it?  Could Mr. Sweeney be a little more prescriptive and give a little more detail in terms of what NFRN Ireland is looking for?  Rather than merely stating they need more enforcement or more penalties, could he give more detail on that?</p></speech>

We feel that over the years not enough people such as ourselves have contributed to the debate and put forward suggestions.  NFRN Ireland has a number of suggestion and I will speak about some of them.</p><p>  Recently, in Switzerland, a new development based on a smart-phone application has been launched.  What is probably needed here - we are looking to Government to do this for us - is legislation to allow the Garda and others use this smart-phone application.  At present, garda&iacute; cannot do very much if they suspect somebody of being in possession of counterfeit cigarettes but if this smart-phone application were allowed, they would be able to check a packet of cigarettes and the application would tell them instantly whether it was duty paid, whether it was counterfeit.  It is based on a technology called Codentify and at present, it is being rolled out in Switzerland.</p><p>  I will explain how the application works.  A special barcode would be imbedded on the pack at manufacture.  So far, the counterfeiters have been able to rapidly copy anything that has been produced, such as the pack.  Even the Irish Government tax stamp can be produced in a factory in China and delivered here.  With this application, however, the barcode which is called a rolling barcode, embedded in the pack would change every day and it would be very difficult for counterfeiters to keep up with it.</p><p>  We would also ask that the sale of tobacco be banned completely at markets and fairs in Ireland.  It is too easy for illicit traders to sell their product in such places.</p></speech>

We know of people who have been fined as little as 50 cent.  We would like to see an amendment to the Casual Trading Act 1995 to make the penalties in respect of the casual trading of tobacco products as strict as those which apply under section 109 of the Finance Act 2001.  Under the Casual Trading Act the fine for a first offence is a paltry &euro;63 and for a second offence the fine is only &euro;317.  We would like to see a minimum fine of &euro;10,000.  This would act as a more serious deterrent to selling this type of product and would also narrow the price point between legitimate tobacco and contraband and counterfeit tobacco as criminals would have to recover their costs.

Three counties had no convictions for tobacco offences and Kildare was one of them along with Sligo and Roscommon.  I am from the heart of the midlands and I see people trading openly and going door to door with tobacco.  It is amazing that these counties have had no convictions.</p></speech>

We only have two mobile port scanners, and to be honest the criminals are just playing a game with them because they know where they are and when they will be moved.  Port scanners cost a lot of money but the federation will assist in their purchase.  The smart phone app would not cost the Government a penny because the National Federation of Retail Newsagents will pay for it.  It is not a big amount of money, which may be surprising.  An app can be produced for &euro;10,000 or less.</p></speech>

It is opened up and trucks drive through it to be scanned.  A number of seizures have been made in this way.  It is a very successful operation but we need one at every port in the country so we need eight or ten of them.  It is a no-brainer as far as I can see because they would save the Government so much money in lost revenue.  The amount of revenue lost to the Government through the illicit tobacco trade is approaching &euro;1 billion.</p></speech>

We have tried to increase taxation on packets of cigarettes and put the revenue towards the health system and the consequences of an addiction to nicotine and cigarette smoking.  Huge progress has been made internationally in this battle, particularly in recent decades.  This trade fundamentally undermines this and makes a mockery of what we are trying to do.  Anything that can be done to increase the armoury of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue to tackle this must be done.  I must commend the witnesses on their offer to contribute financially towards this.  It would be very welcome.  Have the witnesses engaged with the Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, on these matters?  Have they made a submission on these very solid and practical proposals?</p><p>  As somebody would describe himself as an Irish republican, anybody involved in diesel laundering or cigarette smuggling does not deserve the name republican in any way shape or form.  It is up to themselves if they want to call themselves republican dissidents, but they are not republicans.  A republican is of the people and acts in the interests of the people, and they do not act in either.  They are criminals and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI should be given every bit of armoury to track them down and take them out of the equation.</p><p>  Unfortunately in many European countries and other places overseas one can purchase large numbers of cigarettes and take them home.  What do the witnesses think of people filling their suitcases with cigarettes and bringing them home and taking their own initiative?  What can we do to tackle this?  The witnesses have made a superb presentation and I cannot disagree with anything they have said.  I would like to think the committee will do all it can to assist them in their endeavours.  The issue they are raising is making a mockery of what we are supposed to be trying to achieve.  Well done.</p></speech>

I may even be a member of the National Federation of Retail Newsagents, but I am not sure.  Ms Drennan's presentation was remarkable.  We have had a lot of presentations at this committee since I joined it two years ago.  The contents were remarkable, as was the offer on the table.  I presume Ms Drennan has costed these port-scanners and applications.  I am glad she is in a position to do that and I am sure she will be greeted with an open door.</p><p>  I would not necessarily agree with her conclusion that it is those over 30 who purchase cigarettes in shops.  I am not sure if she is familiar with the work being undertaken by Senator John Crown.  He wants cigarettes to be banned completely in this country by 2030.  I concur with that position.  It breaks my heart to see the number of people smoking and the amount of cigarettes being purchased legally and illegally.  It is costing this country billions in health care provision annually.  We should eliminate smuggling.  All elements in society should work diligently to encourage people to stop smoking.</p><p>  What does Ms Drennan think of cigarette companies selling packs of 23 at a cheaper price per cigarette than a packet of 20?  That is promoting and discounting the sale of cigarettes.  What does Ms Drennan think of incentives being offered to retailers, particularly staff in retail shops?  If the sale of a certain product is increased, the staff receive vouchers.  I think that is horrendous.  When cigarette companies made my management aware of that, they were almost run out of the place.</p><p>  We may talk about illegal cigarettes, which is an issue, but there is an overall societal responsibility.  I would like to hear Ms Drennan's thoughts on that.</p></speech>

In speaking to retailers, I am happy to say they are aware of the health issues and their responsibility in that area.</p><p>  With regard to Senator Crown's effort to ban tobacco altogether, our organisation is working on the theory that tobacco will eventually be banned from sale completely.  We are working towards the idea that the sale of tobacco will be banned, so we will have to replace it with some other categories which will help us to stay in business and remain profitable.</p><p>  At the moment, it is true that tobacco sales account on average for 30% of retailers' and newsagents' business.  To stay in business, it is almost a vital part of a retailers' business at the moment.  Currently, it is a legal product and we want the Government to ensure it is sold through our legitimate sources.  That is the only way they can fully implement the health regulations.</p></speech>

We are here to promote the sale of a legal product so that informed adults can make an educated choice as opposed to having minors buying something illegal from a criminal.</p><p>  The EU tobacco product directive is currently going through the European Parliament.  One of the measures in that legislation is section 3.7 which refers to products containing nicotine.  It does not specifically say electronic cigarettes, but that is what it is referring to.  One of the proposals in that section is that electronic cigarettes be moved out of newsagents and convenience stores into pharmacies or health shops.  We feel that would be a short-sighted measure from the health lobby's viewpoint because products containing nicotine are a weaning tool.  Nobody began smoking by using an electronic cigarette.  If we want people to give up cigarettes, the alternative should be beside the traditional because it is largely an impulse purchase.  It should be as readily available as it possibly can be.  If it is put in a different building, people will not move up the street to get it.  There will be shorter trading hours as well.  I see the Deputy's point, but if he wants to do that, there should be alternatives to support it.  That tobacco legislation goes the opposite way, however, making it more difficult to wean oneself off.</p></speech>

Smuggling is a problem and I have spoken to some of the witnesses before about it.  I can see where the problem is for retailers, particularly small ones.  They are having a tough enough time competing against larger outlets, particularly on main streets in small towns and villages.  Ms Drennan mentioned the ban on the display of cigarettes, but I think that is a good idea.  I have to confess that, as a smoker myself, I am one of the voices for the small number of smokers who are left.</p></speech>

She mentioned the question of people going on holidays and bringing back cigarettes but is it not the case that one can only bring back 200 cigarettes or one must pay the customs duty if one is caught at the airport?  While I believe Ms Drennan stated that people bring back 1,000 cigarettes and sell them on or whatever, I do not believe this to be the case.  Second, I seek the witnesses' comments regarding the figures from the United Kingdom.  As they probably are aware, the level of cigarette smuggling there has fallen from 21% in 2001 to 9% in 2011.  The joint committee got the figures showing that despite the price of the cigarettes having risen over that ten-year period, the rate of smuggling decreased.  This runs somewhat contrary to the argument the witnesses have been making and I invite them to tease out this point.  However, I understand the problems they are experiencing.  The black market is absolutely illegal and wrong.  It constitutes unfair competition to the retailers represented by the witnesses and something must be done in this regard.</p></speech>

Other routes come from Eastern Europe and alongside counterfeit cigarettes, there also are what we call "illicit whites".  Such cigarettes are properly manufactured in a legitimate factory but are taken through routes via countries in Africa and so on, in which low tax regimes are in operation, and are then brought into this country and distributed.

Consequently, one can see where the illegal organisations are making big money.</p></speech>

The HSE's own survey of registered and licensed retailers indicates they are 98% compliant.  Our organisation agrees with that because we carry out our own survey.  The Deputy is correct in stating that cigarettes are available in shops.  They are available in chip shops and in a number of different outlets under the counter.  These are known to those who purchase counterfeit cigarettes and they are available in a number of shops that are run and operated by foreign individuals.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Sweeney, Mr. Mulligan and Ms Drennan and thank them for their submission.  I wish to focus on the illicit trade in tobacco.  I disagree with some of my colleagues.  The submission relates, first, to the preservation of jobs in the retail sector and, second, to how we can improve the amount of tax we contribute to the Exchequer.  That is the key issue in terms of the argument put forward by the witnesses.  Having examined the issue and as a smoker, I am strongly supportive of the proposed solutions.  I am aware of what is happening on the ground.</p><p>  Senator Martin Conway said that 76% of what we pay for a packet of cigarettes goes straight to tax.  People such as Senator Conway lecture us on costing the State money but we give approximately &euro;1.2 billion every year in taxation to the Exchequer.  A total of 29% of the population smoke.  That is the reality and there is a market for those who wish to smoke.  Does the federation want to regulate it and make it a professional service or does it want smoking to become an illegal service?  That is the bottom line as far as I am concerned.  In the past decade we spent hundreds of millions of euro, yet 29% of the population still smokes, as was the case ten years ago.  One could ask where the money went and whether the approach worked.  We must examine other policies.  However, that is a health debate.  I am speaking about jobs in this context.</p></speech>

I strongly support the federation&rsquo;s submission because I know the reality on the ground.  One issue to which reference has been made is illegal cigarettes and smuggling.  However, reference has not been made to the fact that some of the serious drugs gangs have moved from cocaine to cigarette smuggling.  Armed criminals are involved.  It appears that more money can be made from cigarettes than cocaine or heroin.</p><p>  People are selling illegal cigarettes in the poorest parts of Dublin city.  The local shopkeeper on the corner is being hammered once again.  That is the economic reality.  The illegal cigarette trade is dangerous.  As Members of the Oireachtas we must examine the issue as it is getting out of control.  We must ensure that regulation is up to date.  Newsagents are implementing the regulations.  From talking to people in the industry, the majority of retailers &ndash; 99.5% of retailers - and those who sell cigarettes do so legitimately and are above board.  It is people outside the sector who are the problem.  If the committee does not act we will have a serious problem.  We regularly speak about job creation and job protection.  We must support small businesses.</p><p>  I fully agree with the point about electronic cigarettes.  Efforts are being made to try to get people off cigarettes.  I sometimes use them myself when I am trying to give up cigarettes.  I go on a health binge every now and again.  I would like to be able to buy electronic cigarettes in my local shop or pub rather than having to go to a chemist.  To be honest, I would not go near a chemist unless I was dying with the flu or had a major health issue.  I would not go there to buy an electronic cigarette.  It is time we stopped making it difficult for people to give up cigarettes.</p><p>  Holiday cigarettes are a significant issue.  Deputy Ferris is correct about 200 cigarettes per person being allowed.  Most people I know in the Border community come back with up to 1,000 cigarettes.  Whatever they do, they seem to get through.  We must introduce stronger penalties and ensure that legitimate business which is regulated and supervised and that makes a major contribution to the Exchequer is supported.  That is what is important in the debate.</p></speech>

They sell cigarettes by the carton and they are delivered direct to people&rsquo;s homes.</p></speech>

Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  I have one or two questions for the witnesses.  Point No. 5 in the submission relates to the federation's call for a minimum pricing for alcohol.  Could someone expand on the point please because we are interested in the issue from a public order point of view?  We are interested in the anti-social behaviour aspects of the abuse of alcohol.</p></speech>

The multiples use below-cost selling to attract people and increase the foot-fall in shops.  The measure is being used for the wrong reasons.  That was not possible prior to the abolition of the groceries order.  Multiples are selling at below cost and they are able to reclaim the VAT.  They have the full invoice at the high rate and they get the rebate on the below-cost sale.  The Exchequer is contributing 23% of the VAT element towards the cost of below-cost selling.</p></speech>

The federation has called for action in that regard.  However, we are interested in anti-social behaviour associated with alcohol abuse and misuse.  Alcohol is available in every newsagent and garage.  One sees cheap alcohol stacked high.  Do the witnesses have a view on the issue?  It has been proposed, for instance, that alcohol would be served at a separate till in a separate part of a shop unconnected with groceries.  What is the view of the witnesses on that?</p></speech>

On the segregation of the licensing, one of the problems is that many small retailers would not be able to afford the high cost of implementing such a change.  What would happen is that one would turn convenience stores into off-licences with grocery instead of grocery shops with an off-licence.  It would enormously increase the cost of doing business for small retailers.  It would not be that much of an issue for multiples and large stores because of the space available to them and the profits they make.</p></speech>

There is an aisle for the off-licence and they could put a till on either end of it, whereas an independent newsagent or convenience store owner would have to put a shop within a shop, which would make it cumbersome for consumers.  If I go to a shop on a Friday night and want to buy a pizza and a bottle of wine, I will have to go to one till with the pizza and another till with the bottle of wine.  That is awkward and it is not getting to the root of the problem.  The problem is that people can get too much drink too cheaply, not where the till is located in the store.</p><p>  There is no evidence to suggest that any independent retailer or convenience store owner has in any way contributed to anti-social behaviour.</p></speech>

Social media is changing the way many of our citizens interact with one another and we feel it is important that the committee hears about the various facets of this topic, particularly in light of the disquiet expressed in some quarters that there are no curbs on irresponsible use of these channels.  The committee has already heard the views of the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, the Office of Internet Safety and the primary social media networks, namely, Facebook and Twitter.  We will also hear from YouTube and Mr. T. J. McIntyre of Digital Rights Ireland and take submissions in writing via social media channels from interested groups or individuals.  At the end of this process we propose to publish a report and make recommendations to the Houses.</p><p>  On behalf of the committee I welcome Mr. Se&aacute;n Fallon, Mr. Colin Larkin and Mr. Paul C. Dwyer of the National Anti-Bullying Coalition.  I now wish to draw the witnesses' attention to the fact that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to particular matters and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.</p></speech>

With my two colleagues we will present a scenario.  I wish to address cyberbullying as part of a wider issue which is bullying in general.  Cyberbullying is one more means of doing what children have been doing to each other for generations when groups gather together. Some who are more dominant tend to pick on those who are more timid and, for whatever reason, they can find a way of doing it.</p><p>  I will begin with a PowerPoint presentation and take as a guideline, not a real definition, key factors in bullying, which include cyberbullying.  I am coming from the perspective that all bullying is deliberate, hurtful behaviour that is repeated over time either in act or in impact; in other words, one event which has an ongoing negative impact on a child day after day.  For example, if something is put on line and not taken down, each day it is left there, even though there is no act happening, the impact is still there.  Cyberbullying is one particular form of bullying behaviour targeting someone who is seen as vulnerable.  Research shows that most of those who cyberbully have already been bullying the person in the school yard, the classroom or wherever.  A year and a half ago when the Anti-Bullying Centre in Trinity College hosted an international conference the one aspect that stood out in my mind from all the research presented that day on cyberbullying was that there is a very close link between the person cyberbullying and the person who has already been bullying that child in the school yard.  The mystique as to how it might be somebody totally different does not necessarily apply.  The reason people cyberbully is not related to the technology but the mindset they have that they want to bully a particular person. The view of the National Anti-Bullying Coalition is that if one wants to deal with cyberbullying on a stand-alone basis, one is not likely to be successful.  My colleagues, who have the technical expertise, will tell the committee about things that can certainly help. </p><p>  Traditional strategies to deal with bullying in general have been unsuccessful, as indicated by the figures on the screen.  From 2008, Trinity College research on secondary schools showed that approximately 30% of students had been bullied during the previous couple of months.  Research from UNICEF in 2012 showed that 55% of secondary school students have been bullied.  A European Study, reported in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, in 2012 showed that 12% of ten-year old children are bullied at least weekly, before they go to secondary school.  Whatever has been happening in regard to bullying in general or cyberbullying, in particular, or both, has not been successful if that number of children are still affected by bullying.</p><p>  There are some proactive approaches that did not work in the past.  It is the law since the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 that every school in Ireland must have an anti-bullying policy.  Unfortunately, there is no legal obligation on them to implement it.  Schools are allowed draw up their own anti-bullying policy with, perhaps, certain guidelines.  That has not made a difference given that so many people are being bullied.  Depending on SPHE and CSPE classes to raise awareness about bullying has not worked given the percentage of people who have been bullied.  Three events in SPHE per year on bullying will not suffice.  One has only to ask any advertiser if three little events per year would convince people to buy their product.  There is not chance.  It needs a more sustained ongoing approach to awareness raising if that is part of what we are talking about.  Also, it is not part of the brief of SPHE and CSPE to deal with bullying behaviour when it arises; its only brief is to raise awareness about it.  Some children may be more aware than others.  Holding an anti-bullying week, which schools do, is very valuable and highlights the issue.  When we were all teenagers, a week later that was all forgotten and we were thinking about what we would do the next weekend.  Teenagers have forgotten what happened last week.  An anti-bullying week is brilliant at the time but it is clear from the percentages that on its own, it is not enough.</p><p>  Reactive approaches that have not worked in the past include expecting the bullied child to &quot;shape up&quot; and not let those comments bother them.  Even if there was a chance that it might work, people who get involved in bullying behaviour seldom act alone.  They usually have somebody else because they are showing off to the somebody else.  Whether it is traditional bullying or cyberbullying two people are huddled around a mobile telephone sending the text message showing off to somebody else while the person on the receiving end is outnumbered.  How can one expect him or her to &quot;shape up&quot; and deal with the issue at 12 years of age?  Ignoring the bullying in the hope it would stop is the reaction by many schools but it does not work.  Punishing or threatening to punish the person who bullies has not worked well either.  That leads to bullying being hidden and to the &quot;no ratting&quot; culture where a child will not let on that the other child is doing something wrong and will not get that child in trouble with a teacher.   Why is that &quot;no ratting&quot; culture there?  It is there because punishment is part of the treatment that schools use in relation to bullying.  I know from my own experience when the punishment is taken away and something else is put in, the &quot;no ratting&quot; culture disappears completely and the students will tell one what is going on.  All that is needed then is to find a way to deal with it.  Therefore, punishing or threatening to punish does not work.  The awareness raising events and the proactive SPHE events have been too little and dealing with it has been too late.  It is an example of being too little and too late, depending on which line one takes. </p><p>  The 1993 guidelines, which will be replaced thanks to the efforts of the working group and the Minister, contain two important and useful aims: to increase the awareness of bullying behaviour, such as the damage it does and the difficulties that arise as a result, and to assist schools in devising procedures to prevent and deal with it.  Both of those most happen in the school or the environment.  How can that be done?  An ongoing awareness raising programme must be set up in schools, not just one anti-bullying week, in order that the students are constantly brought face to face with the fact that bullying is a no-no, it is hurtful and damaging.  Students must be brought to a cultural position where they reject the bullying themselves.</p></speech>

I will finish up with the next slide.  That slide is about costs.  Bullying costs the country at least &euro;30 million a year.  On the last slide, which my colleagues will take up, cyberbullying is a social problem.  The technological side of it, on which I am not expert, is an important element.  If one can speed up the response to bullying and cyberbullying using technological means, one will make a significant difference.  The longer cyberbullying is left without being dealt with, the more dangerous it is for the person on the receiving end.  I am sorry for going on so long and thank the committee.</p></speech>

I have come along here to represent an organisation called the International Cyber Threat Task Force, ICTTF, which works on making the Internet a safer place.  I am here with my colleagues from the National Anti-Bullying Coalition, NABC.</p><p>  We need to address this area in a holistic way.  We should learn from road safety, and the three Es - education, enforcement and engineering.  We need to tackle those three areas.  My colleague spoke about the education side of the matter.  It is important that each different person, from a collective responsibility point of view, must be educated on what is their responsibility within those areas.</p><p>  On enforcement, the laws and treaties are not in place to be able facilitate a safe environment for children to socialise, operate and educate themselves online.  I refer to such matters as the European Convention on Cybercrime.  We need to have these treaties in place so that we can get co-operation from other sovereign states to deal with such issues.  This is not an Irish problem.  This is a global problem.  Fixing it in our own back garden will not fix the problem.  We need to deal with that area.</p><p>  On engineering, there are certain steps that can be taken that do not affect people's privacy because one of the things that will get people's backs up is technology solutions that may invade their privacy,  I refer to such matters as IP addresses.  We must acknowledge that these massive companies involved in making fortunes out of the Internet have the technology in place to identify users, not only by IP addresses or such numbers but by profiling the devices they are on and their behaviour online.  In such cases, one can ban or block users from the Internet on the basis of their behaviour but not from the context of what they are saying or doing online.  That would fall nicely into place and complement freedom of expression, freedom of information and such matters that seem to be arguments against being able to block or control what is being said or done online.</p></speech>

The simplest definition of telecommunications is the transmission of words, sounds or images electronically.  Regardless of whatever laws are put in place, we need to have some sort of infrastructure that allows organisations to build a case of some sort, whether defamation or whatever.  Typically, the telecommunications infrastructure for doing this is to use something like lawful intercept legislation.  This is what enables criminal and civil cases.  It is very clear and simple.  All stakeholders, whether the Garda, the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Judiciary, understand the part they play.  It forces equipment vendors and telecommunications operators to put lawful intercept infrastructure in place within their networks.</p><p>  However, telephony is changing beyond anything of which we know today.  The existing operators in Ireland are becoming bit carriers.  They only carry ones and zeros.  The telecommunications systems the members all use to communicate with their constituents are the new telecommunications networks.  We need to start thinking beyond the traditional operators we all know that have been here in Ireland for many decades and looking towards these new providers which just see themselves as being a website or application of some sort.</p><p>  Slide No. 4, for example, shows the new device that will be in the shops at Christmas.  It does not look anything like a phone, but that is what we have to deal with.  One of the challenges the members will be dealing with is trying to legislate for devices such as this.  More challenging still is trying to legislate for devices which persons have not yet thought of and that are just coming out of the skunk works of these large organisations that are supplying these really innovative interesting devices.</p><p>  Certainly, NABC has a much better understanding of cyberbullying than I do.  I come from a technical point of view.  Cyberbullying is 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  It is silent and it is anonymous.  There is no escape.  The traditional sanctuaries of a person's home or bedroom no longer exist.  People can reach into them any time of the day or night.  Victims' friends and families are largely powerless to help in this.  They do not understand it.  They do not know how to handle it.  There is a lack of education as to what is this technology, what it can do and whatever else.  It does not have to be like that.</p></speech>

I congratulate the work being done by the witnesses and the amount of time and effort they put into it.  Where are the flaws in the laws and treaties?  Bullying has existed since Adam was a boy and certain standards and positions have been put in place.  Many of the contributors who came before the committee last week stated it is an international issue with cross-jurisdictional aspects for which legislation does not exist.  Even in his opening statement the Minister stated there may be a gap in the law.  If the witnesses were asked to deal with this new phenomenon of cyberbullying which, as Mr. Larkin stated, goes straight into homes and bedrooms day and night, what laws and treaties would they say were necessary at international and national level?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-13a.235" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul C.

Legislation dates back to posts and telegraphs and has not kept up with the technology now in place.  It is multijurisdictional, so we need to consider the European Convention on Cybercrime, which creates offences with regard to copyright infringement and the illicit material of children, and creates a level playing field between countries.  The UK, the United States, Australia and Japan have all signed and ratified it.  We signed it more than ten years ago but we still have not ratified it.  Without such legislation we do not even have a foundation to start working in the area.</p><p>  Cyberbullying is one issue but these matters do not work in silos.  Protecting children is also about protecting them from cyber-predators who also frequent these sites.  An interesting aspect of the legislation is that it holds directors personally accountable and liable if they have not done everything they should and could have done to prevent a crime being orchestrated through their facilities.  Let us think about this in the context of the providers we are discussing.  It would focus their attention more than eye-watering fines or bad press if they were personally accountable for not preventing these incidents from happening, not that they committed themselves but that they did not prevent them from happening.  One can almost draw a Venn diagram of cyber-predators.  We even see the online grooming of autistic children by cyber-criminals who want to use their very special abilities and brains for hacking.  The types of websites mentioned, which are not the big ones but which are only a stone's throw from Ireland in countries such as Latvia, feed predators and bullies - the people we refer to as cyber-scum - and they should be made accountable in law because they do not take down material or co-operate in any way, shape or form.  It is wrong to keep pointing at the big guys all the time.</p></speech>

The legislation should appoint somebody to be responsible 24-seven as a point of contact for the country of Ireland who can co-operate with others to deal with these incidents.  Such a person or entity would then have a stick with which to beat the providers to ensure they played along and played fair with everybody else.  We need this level of co-operation in a treaty to empower this.  Otherwise people will decide their back garden is fine and they are okay, and we will not deal with the holistic problem.  We need to be part of a global solution instead of having something confined and narrow.</p></speech>

I see a big risk in what we are trying to do.  If we go too far in the direction of legislation, we would make social media worthless.  If we go too far towards ensuring a user ID is always made available, we will inhibit people giving their opinions on social media.  The figures are stark and show 55% of secondary school students have been bullied.  I take it not all of this is cyberbullying.  The problem is that children can walk from the schoolyard but they cannot walk from social media because it is in their pocket all the time.</p><p>  I am not aware of any international examples of countries which have solved this problem.  I would love if somebody could point to a jurisdiction which may not have solved it but is on the way to doing so, where international aspects may need to click into place but the jurisdiction is on the road towards solving the problem in a way that, without inhibiting people's liberty and freedom, protects children and vulnerable adults.</p></speech>

There are different levels and points of pain for younger or older children and some for adults.  In the United States, there are 20,000 cyber-related attempted suicides every year.  We may ask how they are learning from this, but they are at the cutting edge involving the change in culture within schools and organisations.  We can see that from statistics coming from Facebook about online behaviour.</p><p>  In Italy, for example, directors of the major search engines are being taken away in handcuffs because they have not prevented bullying on their search engines and websites.  That focuses the minds of everybody involved in using and dealing with this enterprise commercially.  The culture has a massive knock-on effect in terms of dealing with that because the directors are told that they will end up in jail if they do not take responsibility for dealing with these issues.  It is no longer just a case of words on paper.</p><p>  The solution to this lies in overall responsibility of the people who are commercially making money from this.  We have to take into context the fact that there are sites making a living from facilitating cyberbullying.  Some of these are in our European neighbours, but not within our own jurisdiction.  Why should they be allowed to broadcast, operate and make money from our citizens, including children, by preying on trolls and Internet cyber predators?  Those are the ones we need to go after initially.</p><p>  However, there is no silver bullet, so a collective effort is required between states to deal with it.  Perhaps that would follow through within the culture of parenting.  Parents could ask their children about the websites they are using - are they hosted in Latvia, Ireland, Italy or the United States?  In effect, that would give adults enough knowledge to empower them to ask children what playground they are playing in.  Those located in this jurisdiction may be quite safe if they are monitored, but other sites are ones to be afraid of.  We have to keep it in that context but, unfortunately, there is no silver bullet.</p></speech>

This is not necessarily a new problem.  We have all seen abusive telephone calls and text messages over the years.  We can look at expanding this into a global issue of cyberbullying but we need to look back in history to the existing defamation laws.  We can help people by providing the infrastructure for them to prepare civil or criminal cases.</p><p>  Yesterday's <i>Limerick Leader</i> contained a discussion about a school in Limerick.  It concerned the challenge the principal had in trying to get a particular post removed.  All the information that such a school principal needs to be able to take a civil case, exists within that social network.  Today, however, there is no infrastructure that allows that principal to make a complaint to the local Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, so they cannot use something equivalent to a lawful intercept which is used on a fixed or mobile telephone network to get the information they need to take a criminal case.  If they could do so, they would hold that organisation to account but they do not have the ability to create that case today.  All the information exists within the social network, however.  We should look back at how we fixed this problem before in terms of mobile telephones and fixed networks concerning text messaging.</p></speech>

I wish to ask Mr. Larkin a few questions.  He referred to the Limerick school, which is a fairly good example.  What happened there was that the school principal suspended some students for their behaviour, which seems like a common sense way of dealing with a particular case.  Mr. Larkin mentioned the need for the DPP to issue guidelines to Garda stations so that somebody with a complaint about cyberbullying can go to them.  Has that been done in any other countries?  Are there any other models we can copy in that respect?</p><p>  Mr. Dwyer referred to technological solutions to cyberbullying.  We had hearings here where we asked similar questions of other people.  Is it possible for an ordinary citizen to track or trace the source of an offensive or bullying tweet, which appears to be anonymous?  Is that technology available to the ordinary citizen?  </p><p>  Mr. Dwyer referred to those who indulge in this kind of behaviour on the Internet as cyberscum.  Perhaps he could elaborate on that. </p></speech>

I am not a lawyer, I am a technologist.  I am looking at it purely from a very basic infrastructure as to what is available and what can be done.</p><p>  The Deputy mentioned tracking twitter messages, but everything is there.  The GPS location of every person who tweets messages is physically recorded.  So much information about the device, including its serial number, is all recorded by the social network.  They know everything about it.  That is why I am suggesting that we should really look at the likes of a lawful intercept, or something similar.  As a quick fix, we should allow access to that information because they have everything stored.  That is a first step in the right direction to allow someone to have recourse to the courts to build a case.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-13a.244" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul C. Dwyer" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013031300007#G00600"><p>I am happy to add to that.  As Mr. Larkin says, in theory one can trace back if somebody has tweeted something.  The Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act is pretty good legislation to use if somebody is cyberstalking or hassling another person.  I could use that to try to get a prosecution, or the Garda could use it to take a case.  The problem is that subjectivity comes into it.  When someone goes to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and says that somebody has put up a voting poll for voting their child the tallest or smallest in the class, is that a crime or an opinion?  It is subjective because the Garda does not know where to turn next.  Does it bring a case to the DPP?  There is a vacuum there and we need to fill it by giving some sort of guidance to garda&iacute; on when it is a crime or an opinion.  We must remember that law enforcement comes back to making a complaint which is then investigated to see if a crime has been committed.  It follows that path.</p><p>  One can use the law to deal with that but it is very expensive for organisations to turn that material around.  The majority of fraud departments in telecommunications providers are now working on providing lawful interception requests for the Garda because it does not have the resources at its disposal.  What crime is not cyber-related these days?  What crime does not involve a mobile telephone or the Internet?  Every crime has a cyber element but the Garda is completely under-resourced to deal with that issue at the moment.  That is a separate area, however.  </p><p>  The term cyberscum covers cyberstalkers.  We get a lot of issues around ex-girlfriends or ex-boyfriends whose material is being put up online, thus making other adults' lives a misery.  We see criminal gangs who are sexually outing other people to blackmail them into providing information to help them facilitate a crime.  </p><p>  We have a huge element of bullying with cyber predators shoulder to shoulder in the same environment.  If one finds cyber bullies, one will also find cyber predators by which I mean paedophiles.  They are people who exchange indecent imagery of children within those network groups.  They are working with vulnerable children.  They will find a vulnerable child and groom them, which is a seduction technique.  They may say, "I see you are being bullied, so I will be your friend online".  Before one knows it, they are getting images off that child.  That is the nasty bit, but it is how it works.  That is the murky, sinister world of cyber scum.  </p></speech>

They must provide specialist resources to specialist groups.  For example, teachers could have a hotline to the social media companies in order to state their evaluation of a situation.  Perhaps they could provide specific training to teachers who can access a hotline.  Teachers could ask the companies to accept their word that bullying is occurring and must be stopped.</p><p>  Cyberbullying is a viral epidemic.  Members may think that we have a problem now but in two years time it will be a worse epidemic in schools with the arrival of iPads, smartphones and all of the other tech equipment.  Schools are only worried whether the devices will get damaged and not that children will bring in a weapon to school than can take pictures of kids in showers, share the images within seconds and is propagated around the world.  We need to pay more than lip service to the problem and put resources and specialist courses in place.  All of the facilities exist from a technology and education point of view and schools should not be afraid to build a fence around the hazard.  Schools should say that there is a hazard but children and adults can still enjoy the benefits of the Internet while making it safer by following certain procedures and adopt a responsible method for reporting instances.  My view is that cyberbullying cases should not end up on the desk of a garda all of the time.  Until it is a full crime, if that is the right phrase to use, then schools should try to deal with instances themselves from a certain internal governance point of view within the industry.  If an offence is committed and laws are broken then a Garda unit should deal with it.  </p></speech>

Telecoms networks are very diverse systems and information is scattered all over the place.  The social networks can make it quite easy to gather information.  There is a possibility of having an abuse button on a webpage that catches the information and dumps it in a central database with a case ID of some sort.  Once I have a case ID I can prove to the garda that I am the person who is referred to in a message and it is my account in the same way that I can make a complaint if I receive an abusive message on my mobile telephone.  I can easily get that information made available to me by the press of a button.  Such a provision would take the need to do so away from the Garda and Facebook.  I could then go along to my local solicitor and build a case using a case ID.  The process would be straightforward.</p></speech>

I am aware that his work in schools has reached the wider community, not just the school community.  Did he carry out baseline studies to examine the level of alleged cyberbullying in those schools and communities?  Did he carry out a study after he worked with the schools and communities to see what impact it had on the level of cyberbullying and bullying in the school and schoolyard?  Can he tell us a little bit about the matter?</p></speech>

I can speak about the school where I taught and can vouch that the amount of bullying was reduced.  We monitored it each year and found a way to indicate the success of the campaign and whether cases had been resolved.  Bullying still happened but we examined whether cases had been resolved even though it is very difficult to quantify in numbers.  The system gathered statistics from the start of the programme that we operated in the school in which I taught.  They indicated that either the situation was resolved fully to the satisfaction of everybody without a backlash or it was not.  On that basis our success rate for the first number of years was better than 90% full resolution in all kinds of bullying as they arose.  For the past three years since I have been out of the school, and in every single case without exception, there has been full resolution with no backlash for anybody and everybody lived happily ever after.  We did not conduct a study on just cyberbullying so it is opportune that the committee is examining cyberbullying now.</p></speech>

By way of background, EUFORES is a European parliamentary network with MEPs from all major political groups in the European Parliament, as well as the national parliaments of EU member states.  It promotes the deployment of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency within Europe.  It is a non-profit organisation and was founded in 1995 by Members of Parliament and other key sectors.  I thank Dr. Geiss for his presentation and words of welcome.  I found it interesting to hear about the role of EUFORES.  I also take the opportunity to wish him the best at his conference and I call on him to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I shall explain further who we are and what is behind our story.</p><p>  EUFORES stands for the European Forum for Renewable Energy Sources which is a network that promotes renewable energy and energy efficiency.  It was founded by Members of the European Parliament and European Commission people in 1995.  It has been the platform for renewable policies in Brussels.  The key people in EUFORES are the presidents<font color="#2F2F2F"> Claude Turmes, Fiona Hall and Anni Podimata, plus an extended board of members of the European Parliament from all of the political groups which promote renewables and efficiency in the European Parliament.  They are the ones who compiled the renewables and efficiency directives and the EUFORES president has always acted as rapporteur.  The directives are what the members of the committee must struggle with here regularly. </font><br /><font color="#2F2F2F">  EUFORES is a network </font>of Members of the European Parliament and of the EU 27 national parliaments.  The idea is to give MEPs a platform, the  information and a chance to exchange or improve their European and national policies in order to strengthen Europe's energy sector.  EUFORES hosts many events in the European Parliament such as dinners and breakfasts with Mr. G&uuml;nther H. Oettinger, European Commissioner for Energy, Ms Connie Hedegaard, European Commissioner for Climate Action, and others.</p><p>  The main product of EUFORES is the interparliamentary meeting or gathering of members of European and national parliaments which takes place each year in another national parliamentary.  The last one was held last November in Athens in the Greek Parliament.  One can imagine how emotional that meeting was and we tried to find ways that renewables could create business in Greece, not just send money.  It was a very interesting meeting.  Last year we were in Stockholm.  This year we will be in Dublin and we appreciate the help of the committee.  I wish to also thank Senator C&aacute;it Keane for helping and preparing the EUFORES event.  I also thank the Chairman and the committee for hosting us and for the great co-operation shown.</p><p>  The conference will be a two-day event which is usually in a parliament.  Obviously there was an added dimension to this Parliament and that is why the Taoiseach ensured that we got Dublin Castle as a location.  My delegation was at Dublin Castle an hour ago to check the facilities.  The interparliamentary conference will take place at Dublin Castle and we are happy with the location.  It is perfect.  A one-day renewables conference will take place on Friday, 21 June and the next day, Saturday, will be a half-day meeting on energy efficiency.</p><p>  I shall outline who will attend.  It is a closed meeting of members of parliament plus some invited guests.  We expect around 70 members of parliaments from all over Europe.  On average 20 member states are represented, plus some invited experts.  As I said, attendees will be from the European Commission, a few government representatives and some experts from industry associations and scientific institutes.  The idea is to create an atmosphere of a closed and confidential meeting where members of parliament can discuss and exchange ideas and get some input from the experts.  The meeting will be a pan-European event so there will be members of parliament from all of the countries in attendance.</p><p>  We always focus on the specific issues of an area.  We are in the north-western part of the EU and Ireland runs an incredible process comprising offshore and onshore wind and ocean energy availing of great interconnections.  Ireland is about to connect to the UK and to create an interlink which has never been seen before in Europe.  EUFORES wants, with Ireland's help, to teach other members of parliament from around Europe that such things can happen and not in 40 years' time.  We want to convey that it is not a crazy vision of a future technology but what can happen now.  Policy is about what is signed and decided in parliaments now.  We are very happy to place a special focus on these topics and there will be a detailed programme for the event.  Of course general topics are discussed with the European Commission such as the latest news on the renewable energy directive.  We will discuss whether member states are on track, the tendencies at present and where we are going.  During a time of crisis there are big questions.  We shall discuss whether member states should slow down the development of renewables.  It will be an interesting discussion on the first day.  </p><p>  On the second day we will discuss energy efficiency.  We will focus mainly on the new energy efficiency directive which emanated from the circles of the members of parliament.  We will take the opportunity to explain the contents of the directive and what will reach the national parliaments.  We have also invited the European Commission to explain the details.  The directive is complicated and the devil is in the detail so the European Commission should take to the stage to give answers.</p><p>   The two-day conference will lead to intensive networking.  If everything goes well then there will be even more intensive networking between the parliaments.  The Irish Government already works closely with the House of Commons and a specific group has been established to discuss the interlinking of activities, future markets, exchange and so on.  If the conference broadens and supports a debate that includes all of the countries located near the northern seas, such as Germany, Denmark and Norway, and improves the future of Europe then we will have done a good job.  That is the idea behind the conference.  We usually have intense negotiations with lots of speeches.  There is always room for discussions in order that members of parliament can join forces, build relationships and have a nice chat over a coffee or good wine.  </p><p>  We have tried to make the events accompanying the conference sexy in order to encourage more members of parliament to travel to Dublin.  On Friday evening we will host a large gala dinner in the Irish Parliament with the permission of the Government.  On Saturday there will be a site trip where everyone will be transported by bus.  We are arranging a nice tour with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland that will show something new and interesting.  Our first stop will be EirGrid because we want attendees to see how Ireland has balanced out the use of wind energy.  People all over Europe think that it is not possible to balance wind energy but Ireland has done so without causing blackouts.  We are very curious to see how that is done.  We are also interested in energy efficiency measures.  </p></speech>

I wish him well with the conference.  The debate on renewable energy has been ongoing for the past decade.  We have witnessed major investments, including in the interconnector between the UK and Ireland and in the wind energy section into which we are tapping.  I hope those attending the conference visit the wave energy site and so on.  The issue of how these developments impact on local communities and how they can be managed in such a way that they are integrated into them is increasing in importance.  There is a wind farm six miles from where I live and there is another one 12 miles from me on the other side of my home.  One was developed with great sensitivity to the community and it was integrated easily but the other was developed with major controversy.  A great deal needs to be discussed in this regard.  There are major benefits from renewable energy for member states and for communities.  However, the issue of the impact of these projects should be borne in mind during the conference and the deliberations in June.  A workable solution to this issue is vitally important.  The sensitivities of local communities should be raised during the conference because they have legitimate concerns, fears and anxieties over what is proposed.</p></speech>

The conference is an opportunity for experts to give their views, which might resonate with many people in Ireland.  It is a concern and national and local public representatives in this country have to deal with the same issue in their constituencies.  If it was discussed, it would resonate with many people in the system and some of the fear surrounding issues relating to renewables could be taken away.  It would be an idea if part of the programme for the conference dealt with these concerns and that attendees were conscious of that.  I support Deputy Moynihan's comments.</p></speech>

It is a great opportunity for Ireland and the issue is one of the main focuses of the committee.  Renewables are rightly a hot topic because so much could change in our energy needs and in our economy.  All the heavy hitters from Europe will attend the conference, including Marie Donnelly, head of renewables research innovation in the European Commission.  Both energy providers and energy regulators will be in the same room and it will be up to MEPs and other parliamentarians to ask the right questions because the right people will be in the room.  This is a great opportunity for consumers, providers, customers and regulators to come together, ask the right questions, and, hopefully, get some of the right answers.</p></speech>

I am sorry more committee members are not present; they should be.  We can learn a great deal from each other at a conference such as this.  I agree with Deputy Moynihan that we need to examine the impact of renewable energy projects on communities not only in Ireland, but in every European nation.  Sometimes a good project can be lost because the benefits are too distant and are not obvious to the host communities.  Perhaps we need to consider something that may be even contrary to wider European principles and legislation.  We need to examine the benefits for host nations and host communities of renewables.  Renewable energy is important and we need to consider the investment in this as distinct from finite fossil fuels.  I would like information to be available at this conference on such issues or there should at least be an exchange of views.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-13a.273" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Jan Geiss" time="10:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013031300010#L00600"><p>I fully agree with what the Deputy said.  In the past, I was a scientist and I always said that in renewables there is the natural potential - what we can harvest - the technical potential, the economic potential and the social potential and we should not forget this fourth dimension.  I am from Germany and we had the same discussion.  We called it the asparagus on the landscape -  <i>Verspargelung</i>.  If one goes for too much wind or for wind only, one will find these limits in social acceptance and this decentralised renewables revolution and energy transition cannot take place over the heads of the citizens.  There are several ways.  If it is done only with wind in the future, it will mean too much concentration on one solution.  We promote the mix of renewables.  There should be much more different technologies involved.  Ocean technology is not in the market now but there is huge potential in ten or 20 years.  The forces of nature are strong and it is difficult to harvest them but there will be solutions for sure.  I do not know if photovoltaic power, PV, can also be a solution in Ireland.  We are not Italy or Spain in Germany but we still have huge volumes of PV and it is getting cheaper.  It works like flat screens.  Twenty years ago, a flat screen cost &euro;100,000 but now we can buy it in a supermarket almost for free.  The technology market is getting cheaper.  They are all in different stages of ripeness but in the next decade other renewables will come in and the mix will be much broader and more adapted to landscape protection and so on.</p><p>  The second issue is whether the benefits are close enough to the citizen.  There are examples in Germany where at the beginning wind park managers were ignorant and arrogant and did not respects the needs of a village, for example, until they understood that people from the village should also make a little money and be part of it.  They were given shares or ownership and suddenly they did not see wind farms as a threat and looked on them as windmills with money coming straight into their pockets.  Suddenly they loved them.  It is an abstract concept for politicians to explain but in the end it will be shocking if we see money flowing out of Europe to buy oil, gas, nuclear resources and so on.  We will send our billions of euro to Mr. Putin and some Arab families and they will buy our football clubs.  Why can we not keep that money here and leave it with the citizens instead of burning it in the oven?  It is complex because people want something in their pockets today and they want to protect their landscape and we have to respect that.
