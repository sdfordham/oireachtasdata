    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-28a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Boland" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2012112800003#C00300"><p>Thank you, Chairman.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to meet it.  It is timely to discuss the national strategy as we step up a gear in terms of the implementation of the strategy.</p><p>  The HEA is centrally involved in supporting the Minister and the Department in the implementation of the higher education strategy.  We are very much guided by the principles and objectives outlined by the Minister in his recent speech to the higher education sector on Thursday, 22 November.  Those objectives are recognising the importance of higher education in producing the human capital and research outputs that will underpin continued competitiveness and national economic recovery; building on our favourable demographic context &ndash; our large and expanding pool of young people that is one of our biggest strategic assets and one that many OECD countries envy; and recognising that Ireland operates in an international context, and that our higher education system and its institutions must compete and be successful in that international context.  It is not just our institutions but our graduates that must compete.</p><p>  My colleagues from the Department for Education and Skills will outline the broad context for reform and the main actions for change we are undertaking in partnership with it.  I hope to complement what the Department will say by focusing on three particular elements of the programme.  The first is building the landscape of higher education.  The second is reforming the funding models, including introducing an element of performance into the funding of higher education, and the third is sustainability.</p><p>  The national strategy recommended that the future higher education system should consist of autonomous, well-governed institutions that are strategically led.  It also recommended that the strategy would be informed by a recognition of their particular strengths as institutions within themselves and within a broader higher education system, a recognition of national policy objectives, and a commitment by the institutions, individually and collectively, to meet those objectives according to their strengths and with a high degree of accountability.</p><p>  Over the course of 2012, the HEA has led an intensive process of engagement with the higher education institutions aimed at better understanding their particular mission both now and into the future, to set the basis for the future higher education landscape.  We have done this through our request for institutions to submit their vision for their future role in the system, and we have correlated this with extensive data collection on current institutional profiles and performance.  We have also received international advice and assessed the institutional submissions against the stated objectives of the Hunt report - the national strategy for higher education.  We have commissioned the ESRI to advise on the future demand for higher education, both student and employer-led.  We aim to undertake further discussions with the institutions early next year, and to provide final advice to the Minister by March 2013.  Thereafter, it will be a matter for the Minister to decide how best to move forward with the recommendations he receives on the structure of the system.</p><p>  The process will also be critical in setting up the further development of our funding model into the future.  In considering that future development, it is appropriate first to recognise the many strengths of the current funding model.  It is widely recognised, within and outside Ireland, to be fair and impartial.  I might also add that it is transparent.  Furthermore, it has been very successful in meeting critical State objectives.  The massive expansion from roughly 36% to approximately 65% participation in the past 20 years has been facilitated by a funding model that has incentivised efficiency and growth.  In addition, institutions have played their part by using the model to manage their operations consistently within budget.  It is noteworthy that despite the very severe funding restrictions of recent years and the significant rise in student numbers, all the HEA-funded institutions have managed within budget and produced quality outcomes in terms of graduates.</p><p>  We are conscious the HEA can and must do more in this space.  We are especially conscious that while our funding model is fair and impartial and drives efficiencies, it is relatively weak on assessing strategy and assessing performance against strategy, in particular the latter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-28a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Doyle" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2012112800004#D00200"><p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to attend.  We were asked to come before the committee to brief members on the higher education reform programme embarked upon following the publication of the National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030.  That was published in early 2011 and the key components of that strategy were subsequently endorsed in May 2012 by the current Minister, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, on behalf of the Government.  The implementation of that reform programme falls to the Department and also to the Higher Education Authority in a key leadership role.</p><p>  In summary, the strategy outlines the change agenda that will result in a modern, flexible higher education system which is more accessible to a much greater range of people and has a high quality and innovative provision of teaching research as its hallmark.  This will require having smaller numbers of large, high quality, well-governed institutions that are funded sustainably, each with a distinct mission to meet a growing diversity of demand and new challenges.  That is the key objective of the reform process.</p><p>  There are a range of recommendations set out in the strategy which I have provided to the members and which I do not propose to go through, but they range from the requirement to ensure diversity and flexibility of provision to meet demands to ensuring the quality and sustainability of the system is assured.  As I said, the strategy is being implemented in close collaboration with our colleagues in the Higher Education Authority and in partnership with higher education institutions and many other stakeholders in this complex landscape.</p><p>  I will talk briefly about three key areas, namely, the overarching implementation arrangements, the main challenges to be addressed, and the key priorities for implementation for 2012 and 2013.  Implementation is at the heart of this reform process and to ensure effective oversight of implementation, the Department of Education and Skills has established a high level implementation oversight group chaired by the Secretary General of the Department.  Members of the group are from a diverse range of organisations with lead responsibility for implementation of recommendations.  We have published the implementation plan on which the work of the group is based which shows the recommendations and the associated responsibility for implementation.  We have also published the latest progress report on priority areas and we are glad to make that available to members.  That is our key implementation structure.</p><p>  There are many challenges but among the main ones identified by the strategy is the much higher demand for participation by students - internationally and domestically - adult learners and school leavers in the coming decades.  Both the Department and the ESRI have predicted an increase in full-time demand in the region of 16% by 2020, which is a very high number in a short space of time.  A second challenge will be the continued constrained financial environment at a time when demand is rising.  The third challenge we would articulate is the pressing need to mobilise and prioritise resources while enhancing quality in all areas of activity in the higher education sector.  That would include the key pillars of research, teaching and learning, and engagement.</p><p>  Progress to date has been good, and I will now briefly outline some of the progress that has been made.  Regarding the key element of teaching and learning, last week the Minister launched the national forum for the enhancement of teaching and learning in higher education which will provide the national forum for the discussion of issues relating to the enhancement of teaching and learning and provide a key leadership role across all the higher education institutions in this crucial area.  To support that work and other work, national student and employer surveys are being developed because it is considered very important to have that feedback built into the development and implementation of policy.  A full-scale national pilot on the student survey will run in the first quarter of next year.</p><p>  A second key area on which significant progress has been made is in terms of advancing the agenda in regard to the key transition from second to third level.  That is a major agenda for the Minister and a transition steering group will submit a report on proposals for change, including timeframes for implementation, early in the new year.  We have also established an enterprise engagement forum, again chaired by the Secretary General, to formalise the engagement with enterprise given the importance of that agenda for the Department.</p><p>  In that context, in regard to skills and the labour market, there has been strong collaboration among the Department of Education and Skills, the Higher Education Authority, the expert group on future skills needs and enterprise agencies, among others.  That has led to the implementation of a suite of measures to address identified skills deficits.  Targeted funding has been made available also to provide high quality, flexible higher education opportunities for the unemployed and those seeking jobs in areas where there are identified skills shortages.  Members will be familiar with the Springboard and the ICT skills projects.</p><p>  The last area I want to deal with is system development, which is at the core of implementation.  Last week, the Minister for Education and Skills addressed the higher education sector and outlined four priorities for future landscape development and reconfiguration.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-28a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/999" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2012112800005#E00200"><p>I thank Mr. Boland and his team from the HEA, and Ms Doyle and her team from the Department.  They are present to discuss the very pressing challenges in the third level sector and those to be faced in the coming years.</p><p>  The Hunt report forms the basis of the plan for third level education.  The report outlined that we would require &euro;500 million per year for ten years to meet the challenges faced in expanding the education system and student numbers.  There are significant funding pressures in third level sector.  The Hunt report expected student numbers would increase from 160,000 to 250,000 by 2030.  Does this projection still stand?  The Hunt report is now at least two years old and it took 18 months to compile, which means it dates from late 2008.  Are we still working from the report's projections and assumptions on student numbers and the funding required to ensure our education system is fit for purpose?</p><p>  Following the Hunt report's publication, a report was commissioned by the HEA and compiled by a panel of international experts.  Did the HEA decide to commission it and was the Minister involved?  What is the current standing of that report?  When it was published, the Minister pooh-poohed it and said it was not in line with policy.  Does the report form part of the HEA's current work on planning?</p><p>  The Minister's comments of last week, which constituted a repetition of comments he made on a number of other occasions, suggest he wants the third level institutions to put their heads together to determine what kinds of efficiencies can be achieved and the additional value that can be obtained using the current spending pot.  What value might we be able to obtain from current expenditure?  Has the Department or HEA an estimate of what can be gained from improved efficiencies and better structuring?  While the delegates cannot give specifics, they should surely have an expectation as to what can be obtained, such that we will know where we stand.  Knowing this will help inform our understanding of the challenges that arise in obtaining additional required funding.</p><p>  How much additional funding will be required?  I referred to the &euro;500 million mentioned in the Hunt report.  How can the funding issue be addressed?  An increase in the student registration fee was announced.  Students will have to come up with the cash in the next two to three years.  The pressure this causes has been well documented.  It causes access issues for particular categories of students.</p><p>  Although technological universities are being considered, I am particularly concerned about the status of the remaining institutes of technology.  We should not allow the creation of  a third category of education provision in the higher education sector.  Institutes of technology are crucial to the economic development of an area and to attracting industry.  The quality of education in the institutes of technology needs to be maintained.  What is the status of colleges outside the technological university sector?  We must ensure another educational tier is not created.</p><p>  There is a recruitment ban across the public service.  Where will gaps emerge over the next five years, and certainly the next three years, on foot of staff retirements?  What difficulties may be created in institutions in regard to maintaining the quality of education in various faculties?  What is the plan to address this?  Our standing in this regard influences our international ranking.  Equally, it informs the quality of courses being provided.  We need to ensure the public service recruitment ban is not leading directly to a dilution of the product we are offering to students.</p></speech>

I apologise on behalf of Deputy Jonathan O'Brien.  He asked me to deputise for him today as he has to attend another meeting.</p><p>  We certainly agree with any strategy that aims to have a more modern and flexible education system.  It is good that the relevant studies have been carried out and that the Government is examining ways to improve education.  With regard to the economic and resource-utilisation aspects, approximately 80% of the higher education budget is spent on pay.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-28a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1010" speakername="Joanna Tuffy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2012112800006#F00400"><p>I ask the Deputy to be brief.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-28a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1083" speakername="Michael Colreavy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2012112800006#F00500"><p>There is concern in some colleges that funding has not been made available for next year and subsequent years.  I seek the witnesses' comments in this regard.  Finally, with regard to the designation of institutes of technology as technological universities, this is a good, progressive and exciting phase of work.  I work closely with the Institute of Technology Sligo and in many such institutes of technology, there is no fear of change.  They would welcome such change, as long as they can consistently perceive it will make matters better for the students they serve.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-28a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1010" speakername="Joanna Tuffy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2012112800006#F00600"><p>I will revert to each group on those questions because there is a lot of material therein.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-28a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Doyle" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2012112800006#F00700"><p>I will take the points as they were raised.  On the important point of demographic projections, there has been a revision of the projections in reference to the figures set out in the Hunt report.  Work subsequently was completed with the Department in collaboration with the ESRI and the recently-published ESRI report sets out the revised projections.  While the increases are on a smaller scale than those set out in the Hunt report, they still are highly significant.  We face a highly significant increase of more than 12% by 2015 or 2016 and of 20% by 2020.  Consequently, the scale of the task remains very large.  Moreover, as Deputy McConalogue asked in his next question, the question regarding the solutions to the funding of the present system and the estimated additional demand is key to this issue.  The Deputy also asked about costings and savings expected and this clearly is an area on which we have been focusing strongly for some time.  Most observers would agree there undoubtedly are costings and savings to be got from looking in detail at the existing system and to making sure that all fragmentation of courses and duplication are eliminated.  The HEA and the Department are about to enter a formal process to examine where the expenditure that already is in the system lies and to try to think through, in a strategic way, what are the best solutions for the higher education institutions and for the service they provide.</p><p>  Part of the system of reconfiguration leads me into a third point made by Deputy pertaining to the future of the institutes of technology, IT, sector.  As members are aware, there are two main elements to the higher education sector at present and a real focus and a real contribution is made from the IT sector.  In his speech last week, the Minister set out a programme of change for the sector in which he indicated that he envisaged in the first instance that stronger, larger, regionally-based institutions would be the first port of call for the sector and he encouraged the leaders of the institutions to think about what needs to be done to achieve this.  The strength of the IT sector in meeting the needs of the local economy, local businesses and local people is immense and must be enhanced, developed and valued in that process.  Moreover, the focus on the development of the regional clusters will allow this to happen in a structured way.  I believe the Deputy rightly stated this is a sector that must be valued and the contribution of which to the economy and local society is enormous and that this must be safeguarded within the process.  The process for designating ITs that make application for technical university status already has been set out and will be implemented in accordance with the strict criteria.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-28a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Boland" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2012112800007#G00200"><p>I hope I can make a coherent contribution to what has been a discussion of a wide-ranging mix of issues.  Underlying a number of the questions asked and the points raised was the issue of the sustainability of the system.  It arose in comments about alumni and in the context of additional student numbers and likely costs.  We now have firm figures for and evidence of the likely demand for higher education places, both from students and also, importantly, employers.  There is a clear message coming from the ESRI report which was compiled at the behest of the HEA, that we need every graduate we can get hold of to ensure future demographic growth.</p><p>  Sometimes, when people talk about sustainability, the default position - it has been my own in the past - is: how do we get more money into the system?  This morning I was looking at a website on which it was indicated that Pearsons, an international consultancy group, had published an assessment of the best education systems in the world.  Ireland ranks very well in 11th place.  The assessment report states:<blockquote>Throwing money at education by itself rarely produces results.  The individual changes to education systems, however sensible, rarely do much on their own.  Education requires long-term, coherent and focused system-wide attention to achieve improvement.</blockquote>That is what the national strategy is about.  The strategy and the restructuring of the higher education sector are intimately connected with the sustainability of the sector.  There is a temptation for agencies, even the HEA, to make a crude calculation - for example, X number of extra students by Y amount per student equals so many hundred million euro - but it does not really work.  As Ms Doyle said, we will be working with the Department in the coming months to try to develop a more sophisticated strategy to ensure the sustainability of the higher education sector.  It will deal with issues such as alumni and the use of technology in the sector.  Sligo Institute of Technology has been strong in this area.</p><p>  Underpinning all of this, we need a number of ways by which to reimagine how a higher education is to be provided.  The current model, not just in Ireland but also internationally, is increasingly becoming unsustainable.  The length of the academic year was mentioned, but it is not just that issue; there is also the way in which the academic programme is structured.  There is a big range of issues, long before we come to the question of how much extra the system needs.  </p><p>  The international experts' report was mentioned.  I will try to put the issue in context.  Creating a coherent system of higher education institutions, interlocking in a co-ordinated way, has never been tried in Ireland and only rarely been tried successfully internationally.  In doing this work, therefore, the HEA wanted to receive the best possible advice from as many quarters as possible.  We adopted a position of working from bottom-up and top-down in seeking inputs into the process.  In the bottom-up approach institutions were asked, with reference to the Hunt report, where they saw their future.  In the top-down approach the aim was to engage with some international experts, using the strategy as set out in the Hunt report, and ask how we might reconfigure the sector in the optimal way to create a co-ordinated system.  That is exactly what the international panel has done and the input its report will have into the process.  </p><p>  It is a mischaracterisation of the Minister's position to say he pooh-poohed the report.  In fairness, last Thursday he endorsed much of its contents.  He said mergers of universities were not a policy objective; they have been tried in the past and did not work.  From a national policy point of view, that issue is not on the agenda.  That is a perfectly reasonable position for the Minister to take.  In so far as it deals with specific configurations, the report covers relatively few pages.  It also deals with aspects that will be of enormous benefit to us in developing a co-ordinated system.  It talks about configuration parameters, general principles and examines international trends in the creation of higher education systems.  It also looks at the qualities a co-ordinated higher education system should have.  All of this is extremely valuable background material for us in our discussions with the institutions and for the institutions in seeing where they are placed on the landscape. </p><p>  While specific institutional proposals made by the panel, as being illustrative of an optimal system, are not being considered, 75% of the report is germane to our activities.</p></speech>

In the context of the Croke Park agreement, do the new rosters and time schedules for the third level sector relate to professors and senior lecturers as well?  We are all being asked to look at every way we can make a contribution to national recovery.  Has the Higher Education Authority, HEA, any savings made or planned in its overall running such as in overtime payments, employment numbers, allowances, staffing schedules, promotions and even office heating costs?</p><p>  We all agree the Central Applications Office, CAO, is just a bit short of perfect.  Has the authority any suggestions as to how we can improve it?  One can imagine the stress and concerns people have when logging on to the CAO website only to find their applications are blocked.</p></speech>

Focusing in on the ESRI prediction of an increase of 16% in third level numbers by 2020, how does the HEA intend to meet that challenge?  Has the authority any comparative figures on the higher demand for university places from international students?  Our seven universities are in the top 500 in the world.  It is often suggested each individual university is fighting its own corner rather than collaborating together.  If Harvard and various other universities in the United States can collaborate, why can more of our own not do the same?</p><p>  Has the HEA concerns about standards in distance and online learning?  There is a concern within the third level sector that we are churning out a large number of trainee teachers who are swamping the system but there are no posts for them.  Is there a danger this might also happen with the roll-out of online learning?  How can we maintain a standard and proper inspection system around that?</p><p>  There is an obsession with league tables and <i>The Irish Times</i> recently had an article about which schools are more successful, allegedly, than others.  The number of clarifications and corrections subsequently printed by the newspaper since that article has been alarming with many schools bending over backwards to inform <i>The Irish Times</i> about what really happens in their own individual schools.  Do we leave Access initiatives to individual colleges?  Has the Department and the HEA a centralised approach as to how we can encourage those from more disadvantaged backgrounds to enter Access programmes?  Is it recognised that some schools find it more difficult than others in this area and that in some schools to get a student through the leaving certificate is a greater achievement than getting a doctorate?  Is there a centralised policy with Access or is it left to the individual colleges and the goodness of their own hearts?</p></speech>

I accept savings have to be squeezed out across the year rather than the academic year.  I would not necessarily agree with squeezing courses to make them shorter, however.  There is significant potential in that third level teaching buildings are empty for up to half of the year and we could be running two terms within a year.  Is there an actual figure on the efficiencies that could be achieved through consolidation and collaboration of universities?</p><p>  I agree with the points already made on the potential of online education.  It is important there are proper contact hours with students along with tutorials, however.  There is as much interaction in taking a lecture on a computer screen in one's living room as there is in a lecture hall, particularly in large group lectures such as in arts but the engagement part of the learning process provided by tutorials is still necessary.  Some institutions have done good work in this area and some are miles ahead in it.  Dublin City University, DCU, has been a pioneer in this area for a long time.  However, it is very disparate across the sector.  Does the HEA have an overall strategy for online learning?  It has significant potential and instead of leaving it to individual institutions much more work must be done realising this potential.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in rightly pointed out that league tables do not capture issues such as Access and the effort put into such programmes by third level institutions.  They also do not capture the quality of teaching or learning as these tables are very much skewed by research and publications figures.  To what extent is the HEA monitoring teaching quality and the impact the cuts over the past several years have had on it?  Certainly, the indications from the institutions is that the interactive parts of education such as tutorials and lab sessions are being cut back.</p><p>  I note from the presentation that the university presidents will come back on recommendations on entry into third level by the end of the year.  When we had them before the committee, it was obvious there were different views on it and some were a lot less keen on it than others.</p></speech>

Obviously, there are other countries that manage to run a free third-level education system, including Finland and other Scandinavian countries which have similar populations to Ireland's.  How do their costs compare to ours?</p><p>  I note that the HEA publishes a report on who goes to college every six years.  There was one due out this year with the latest figures but I understand it will not be published until next year.  There was a story in <i>The Irish Times</i> that I did not read properly and I meant to go back and check, but I think it stated that 40% of students from disadvantaged backgrounds - or perhaps it was disadvantaged schools - go on to third level.  If that is true, it is a significant improvement on previous years.  I wonder whether the Department or the HEA has any figures on that.  That relates to the access issue.</p><p>  On the issue of the use of buildings raised by Senator Power, some universities in particular do not maximise their use, traditionally closing their colleges at the weekend.  There are also colleges that are open morning, afternoon, evening and at the weekend, with all sorts of flexibility.  Institutes of technology are particularly flexible in their delivery of education.  What pressure is the HEA and the Department putting on colleges to use their buildings more?</p><p>  On an issue raised by Deputy Colreavy and others, the idea of rationalising the education system might make sense but local facilities encourage people to attend college.  Will such facilities remain part of the future education system?  Are there any plans for outreach centres in terms of the future of higher education?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-28a.31" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Doyle" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2012112800009#J00300"><p>It is a broad canvas and we might share some of the responses.  One key theme emerging from all of the questions is that of increased numbers and reduced funding.  If we take a minute to reflect on what has happened over the past couple of years, we will see there has been a significant reduction in the funding envelope for higher education and a significant increase in numbers attending colleges.  There has been quite an improvement in productivity but the reality is that it will not be enough.  Given the twin pressures of reduced funding and increased demand, more must be done to close the gap.  As Mr. Boland stated, we are putting in place a systemic review of issues relating to sustainability in this area, which will give us a basis on which to move forward.  That, if you like, is a third leg of the reform programme as we have it.  Much work has been done in this area but more needs to be done.  We need to focus in particular on the key question: how do we ensure that the likely funding reduction from the Exchequer, coupled with demand, can be met without compromising quality?  It is a big question.  It is a big issue on which we must make decisions.</p><p>  There are a number of measures that can be taken with fairly immediate effect, such as examining duplication of courses and whether courses could be provided more sensibly and more efficiently in particular locations.</p><p>  There are important issues with regard to shared services.  It is not a magic bullet but we think there is significant potential within the higher education sector that has not been tapped.  We are looking at areas such as HR, finance and IT to try to do not only more with less but better with less.  There is a strong agenda in that regard.</p><p>  Another element of what needs to be brought into play here, which is a theme which has emerged, relates to transparency issues: how much funding is being spent, where is it going and what are we getting for it.  At the heart of the work on sustainability that we are undertaking is to be able to demonstrate to everybody what funding is going into the system and what the performance and output will be, because those are the issues on which we must focus.  Allied to that, there were issues with regard to staff productivity.  In a moment, I will ask Mr. Phillip Crosby, my colleague who works on the industrial relations side, to make a contribution on that.  Before I finish, however, there were a number of other issues on which I wish to comment.</p><p>  Another major theme that has emerged from the discussion this afternoon is the question of quality.  That is an issue of concern to everybody in this room.  It is essential.  One of Ireland's achievements has been to protect the quality of the output from higher education.  Mr. Boland might say a word about that.  Obviously, we have our national framework of qualifications and we have the new organisation Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, which has a role in that area.  The HEA and QQI have a close relationship on that shared agenda.</p><p>  Another theme that emerged strongly from the discussion relates to access.  A number of members asked about the arrangements for access.  This is another big theme within the higher education landscape.  As the committee will be aware, there are a number of dedicated programmes, including higher education access route, HEAR, and disability access route to education, DARE, for special admissions, and there are a number of criteria in place, including attendance at DEIS schools.  That is one string to the bow.  We have a national access plan in which a range of measures is pursued in conjunction with a dedicated office set up in the HEA on improving access to universities and institutes of technology, and there is a vibrant dialogue going on in that context.  There will be a review of the national access plan in 2013, which will be carried out by the HEA.  That will give us more information on which to assess policy.</p><p>  There is a premium for access activities built into the HEA funding model.  There are quite a series of pieces in the overall arrangements.  This morning I was looking at the ESRI report which was published recently.  It continues to signal that there are significant problems with access, but they are problems which go into a range of other issues.  There is a need to take that report, think about the issues it raises and see what the implications are for Government and society, and that is what we propose to do.</p><p>  My final remarks are on the transition agenda, which, as the Chairman stated, is a complex agenda.  The Secretary General of the Department is chairing a group.</p></speech>

These savings have emerged from the budgetary situation in which we find ourselves but they are supported by activity on both pay and non-pay aspects of the industrial relations front in the institutions concerned.  In the period covered by the Croke Park agreement, the student-staff ratio in the higher education sector increased by 18%, which represents a significant productivity gain.  A number of measures in the Croke Park agreement and other sectoral agreements in the higher education sector pursuant to the agreement supported these savings.  One such measure was the provision of an additional hour of working time by academic staff in the universities, which has delivered in the order of 100,000 additional hours annually.  Increased flexibility in the deliver of working hours in the institutes of technology in the 2011-12 academic year put an additional 150,000 lecturing hours into the institutes.  This equates to the negotiation and implementation of approximately 250,000 additional lecturing hours between the two sectors under the Croke Park agreement.</p><p>  Union co-operation has been required for introducing ongoing change in other areas.  Significant savings have been made on the non-pay side.  Ms Doyle referred to shared services but the main developments up to now have been in shared procurement, with initiatives such as the Shannon consortium involving multiple institutions producing significant savings in energy, laboratory gases and supplies, advertising, purchasing of journals and literature, office equipment and waste management.</p><p>  I will be slightly more circumspect in regard to planned savings but we continue to face a difficult budgetary position and significant savings will be sought from the unions across the public sector generally.  A process of engagement between Government and the unions will get under way today and we will see where that process goes on coming weeks.</p></speech>

One of the major reasons for the success of Ireland's higher education system is the way in which students have relatively easy access to education on a regional basis.  The institutions of technology in particular have played a major role in this regard.  One of the major objectives of the national strategy in the context of creating regional clusters of institutions is to maintain that comprehensive range of provision locally.  There will be always be areas in which consolidation is appropriate.  For example, it is not possible to have a veterinary school in every part of the country.  Apart from these areas, however, a comprehensive range of provisions is important in terms of regional development and, more important, student access.  Transport has improved considerably in recent years but cost issues arise nevertheless.</p><p>  I must express my interest in the CAO as a member of its board.  I agree that it is an excellent organisation.  If I was not appearing before this committee I would be attending a meeting of the board of the CAO to discuss a new strategic direction with the objective of leveraging its past success to support the higher education sector in other ways.  The CAO is mindful of the need to take a strategic view of its future.</p><p>  Closer collaboration among universities and institutes is a <i>sine qua non</i> of the current reform process.  Sometimes the discussions of reform of structures of higher education leave one with the sense that things will be done to the institutes of technology while the universities blithely go their merry way but that is unlikely to happen.  In fairness, there are good examples of collaboration in university research, including in particular the programme for research in third level institutions which is managed by the HEA on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.  Collaboration can and does work but we need to see it happening on a wider basis than research, such as in undergraduate areas.</p><p>  Ms Doyle addressed some of the issues in respect of quality monitoring by the HEA.  We are all wasting our time if we do not achieve quality outcomes from the higher education sector.  Quality is at the top of everybody's agenda.  The HEA has a key concern with quality but it plays an indirect role in quality assurance.</p></speech>

We must thank Professor Pat Clancy in UCD, who has done extensive research.  Over the past 20 years he has tracked for the HEA the participation rates of different socioeconomic groups, and there has been an increase.  The Chairman mentioned 14% and that is not far off the average for a number of the lower groups.  There are still disparities.  There has been significant progress but this is still a long way below the average for participation as a whole.  We therefore have a national drive to push institutions.  With our own data, we will be able to look for them to build on their strengths.  Some are at high levels and can do more given their region or focus and others are lower.  There is a national dimension as well as the institutions pushing locally.</p></speech>

We have not been given specific figures.  Mr. Boland said it was difficult to assess this in the way people can in other sectors but, at the same time, the Hunt report, which was commissioned three or four years ago, identified funding needs.  For a number of years, there has been much deliberation about what would required for the future of third level funding.  If we had asked this question four years ago, we would have been told that the sector was difficult and that the Government had set up the Hunt group to do this work.  However, the Hunt report has been in the system for two years.  It outlined specific figures, yet we still are not even considering ballpark figures for how much will be required through Exchequer and other funding or what savings will be made through the value for money exercise in which third level institutions have been asked to engage.  No matter what part of the public sector we discuss with the budget coming up and the Estimates process in train, a key part of undertaking a job is to identify the target.  It might not be achievable but, at the same time, in undertaking it, I would expect a ballpark figure for what is required or what is feasible.  I ask again for figures on what might be achievable in extracting additional value from third level institutions doing the work better.  Does Mr. Boland have ballpark figures for the additional funding that may be required in future years in the third level sector?  Ms Doyle mentioned increased productivity in the sector as a result of reduced funding of &euro;200 million and more students coming into the sector.  That is happening across all sectors.  If every Department could work its own version of the miracle of the loaves and fishes there would be increased productivity, but perhaps there are fewer loaves and fishes and more people eating.  This would mean more students leaving the system with a poor-quality education.  Productivity does not necessarily mean improved outcomes.</p><p>  Am I correct that the Minister would not allow the international report to be published?  He mentioned at the time that he felt aspects of the report were not feasible or desirable, while Mr. Boland said that two thirds of the report forms the basis of the way the authority expects to go forward.  Many in the IT sector feel they did not have an opportunity to engage with the international report, while many aspects of the report ran contrary to previously agreed national policy.  Will he comment on that?</p></speech>

One of the recommendations of the points commission is that colleges should publish the number of places they offer on each course.  There is a significant lack of transparency about the number of places offered on particular courses and why.  That affects the points for courses.  Do the HEA and the Department have proposals to address that issue?</p><p>  I used to work in the registrations office of the Dublin Institute of Technology at Bolton Street.  The education of apprentices was a significant element of its remit.  Is that part of the picture or is it separate from higher education?  An apprentice in Bolton Street could move on to a diploma, degree or postgraduate qualification.  Is that part of the vision?</p></speech>

Deputy McConalogue is trying to take us ahead of where we are.  As an indicator, the recent ESRI report says that based on our models, we estimate total enrolments in 2020 and 2030 will be 168,000 and 195,000, respectively.  These figures imply an increase in nominal recurrent funding to &euro;1.4 billion in 2020 and &euro;1.63 billion in 2030.</p></speech>

We get returns from the institutions in respect of each of the 1,000 or 1,100 courses with details of the number of students in first, second, third and fourth year.  We do not publish them because we would just overwhelm people with information.  If there are any particular queries we would be happy to follow up on them.</p><p>  Apprenticeship education is funded almost exclusively through the HEA in institutes of technology with two further education colleges.  A very positive aspect is that the progression issue the Chairman mentioned, has got better.  There was a time when it was difficult to progress from an apprenticeship qualification into a higher education qualification.  While I do not say it is perfect now by any means, we did some work on it last year and a variety of routes and institutions are offering recognition of prior learning and bringing students into second or third year of a higher education qualification.  We would hope that sort of seamless progression between sectors would become stronger in years to come.</p></speech>

I do not know how much taxpayers' money is spent on external consultancy work by national and local government, and State agencies.  I suspect some academic departments have people with the skill and knowledge to do much of that consultancy work.  Would the HEA tender for that type of consultancy work?  Would it welcome requests for tenders for such consultancy work?  Could that form part of the funding stream for the higher education institutions?</p></speech>

Certainly I know that many academics do consultancies of various kinds for private and public bodies.  In the case of some of the senior academics there is scope in their contracts for them to carry out that type of work.  I do not know and I am not sure I would even be able to find out the scale of it.  When the HEA is seeking advice on issues we are obviously very happy to engage with people in the sector or recently departed from the sector.  I will give two good examples.  Professor &Aacute;ine Hyland did a background paper on the teacher education review.  Mr. Jim Devine, the former president of the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Institute of Art and Design, did a background paper for the creative arts review in Dublin.

Ms Doyle gave the projected future student numbers, which are forecast to be 168,000 by 2020 and 195,000 by 2030, which are up from 160,000.  We currently spend approximately &euro;1.1 billion on third level education and the HEA suggests that it may take approximately &euro;1.4 billion by 2020 and &euro;1.6 billion by 2030, which is before inflation is taken into account.  The Hunt report mentioned a figure of &euro;500 million per annum for ten years.  That means the State's input would go from &euro;1.1 billion to &euro;1.6 billion, which is &euro;500 million over 18 years.  The Hunt report referred to &euro;500 million per year for each year over ten years, which would be &euro;5 billion over ten years.  Is the Hunt report also referring to private funding coming from outside?</p></speech>

The Hunt report suggested going from &euro;1.3 billion two or three years ago to &euro;1.8 billion by 2020 and &euro;2.25 by 2030.  That was in respect of recurrent and there may have been capital in addition.  The figures Mr. Boland has just quoted are considerably less than that, going to &euro;1.4 billion and then &euro;1.6 billion in 2030.  One of the big differences is the changed demographic projections that have already been explained.  It follows from that that as the projections change the expected costings change.</p><p>  The other point to make is that this is a costing.  Public and private pay for higher education so there is not an assumption that the Exchequer has to meet all this.  As Deputy Colreavy said consultancy and other sources of income have to play a part in the mix.</p></speech>

Does the HEA pay them?  No, it is the Department.  While the witnesses might not have the figure today, in terms of the 2012 Estimate, how much funding is built in or left to cover grants for this year?  I imagine that at the outset of the year it was probably all built in to be paid in the calendar year 2012.  In the event, it is likely that many grants will not be paid until 2013.  How does that work with the Estimates for 2013?  Will that be lifted from 2013 and added on to the 2013 figure or does it mean there is a bigger squeeze on the Department of Education and Skills next year as a result?</p></speech>

It is clear that we have been grappling and continue to do so with the issue raised by Deputy McConalogue, namely, how we get the funding and demand in sync.  As we move forward into the reconfiguration, we see that we need to match up and connect what happens in things like configuration, shared services, consolidation and eliminating duplication.  We see there is potential in all of those areas to achieve greater efficiencies and effectiveness in the system.  We are also acutely aware of the difficult public financial situation which will continue for some years.</p><p>  There are two main prongs to what we will be doing over the next while.  The first, as we have discussed this afternoon, will be the issues of reconfiguration and how that helps us to revitalise and renew the system.  A systematic review of the financial sustainability of the system must be connected to that in a very structured way.  Part of the work we must do over the next few weeks and months is to put in place systems relating to both those pieces of work and how we join them up.  At this point, it is fair to say that unlike the situation that pertained when the Hunt deliberations were ongoing, we know there is a very finite financial envelope so we must try within that reality to think about the best value we can get from the public expenditure and how we support the institutions in the really important work they do in raising money privately.</p><p>  There are a number of other streams, including the research stream which could and undoubtedly will be of significant potential.  The question of international students is another strand.  What we must do in the coming weeks and months is look at all of those opportunities and gather them together in an integrated way which helps us get to a point where the system is sustainable in its new configuration in light of the opportunities that technology and other forms of provision of education open up to us and where we are confident that we can ensure the quality of the education outcomes.  That is the challenge we face.  Over the next while, we will be moving on that agenda substantially.  </p><p>  There are a number of important elements to help us to do that.  The first is the performance dialogue that the HEA will enter into with the individual institutions over the next while in respect of their expenditure and the outcomes and role of the HEA in regulating the sector.  The HEA's role will change in this context and this will be another piece of the jigsaw.  Undoubtedly, we must bring more transparency to the system both in terms of managing the academic workload and reporting on academic performance.  When one puts those things together, that is the agenda for the next while.  A question was raised about whether there is a connection to further education and the answer is "Yes".  There is a landscape there which provides resources for people post leaving certificate.  A big job of work is ongoing in the further education sector which will take a lot of time to design and put in place but ultimately there will be a closer connection between higher and further education.</p><p>  In conclusion, what the Minister and the Department have been trying to do in this process is to bring the maximum amount of clarity to the process, namely, what the objectives for the system are and what the steps in achieving them will be and also to ensure that the process the Government has adopted in the Hunt report is not derailed and that the institutions in particular are clear about the Government's intent in this area and the steps the Government is putting in place to implement this ambitious programme of change.  </p></speech>

It is a Vote that is particularly difficult to estimate as the majority of persons covered by the Vote may, once they reach the age of 60 years, exercise an option to retire at any stage before reaching their compulsory retirement age of 65 years.  Eligible persons may opt to retire even earlier than 60 years under the terms of cost neutral early retirement.</p><p>  Persons are also, I am glad to say, generally living longer and therefore in on-going receipt of a pension for a longer post retirement period, which we all welcome. </p><p>  The 2012 gross Estimate for Vote 12 the subject of the Supplementary Estimate, was just over &euro;500 million.  This was based on existing pensions in payments; figures received from Departments on their projected retirement numbers for 2012 plus contingency and provision for scheme leavers in 2012 as follows: some 18,636 pensions in payment at the end of December 2011; some 1,400 officers estimated to retire in 2012; and 600 pensions leaving the payroll in 2012.  There will be a net estimated increase of 800 on the pension payroll by the end of 2012, or an estimated total of 19,436 pensions in payment at the end of December 2012.</p><p>  In terms of the estimated numbers retiring in 2012, we had regard to the level of retirements anticipated to take place prior to 29 February 2012 as persons availed of the final months of the grace period whereby their retirement benefits would be calculated with reference to their salaries at 31 December 2009, that is before the introduction of the pay reductions imposed with effect from 1 January 2010 under the provisions of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009.</p><p>  Having regard to the foregoing it is to be noted that the 2012 gross Estimate of just over &euro;500 million for Vote 12 was set at 16% higher than the 2011 outturn of &euro;432 million.  However, despite best efforts in estimation, including the provision of a significant contingency over the numbers provided by Departments in late 2011 as to their estimations of retirements in 2012, it has transpired that the level of retirements in 2012 has significantly exceeded estimation and therefore is now in the region of 20,000 pensions in payment, over 560 in excess of the original 2012 net full end of year estimate of 19,436.  The numbers who retired were greater and as a consequence we need an additional &euro;25 million to add to the subhead for the purposes of payment to the end of 2012.</p><p>  The higher than anticipated numbers retiring has an impact on the A1 subhead of the Vote from which pensions are paid but, most important, on the A4 subhead from which most once-off lump sum payments are made.  On 22 November more than &euro;134 million had been expended from subhead A4, where the 2012 Estimate had been &euro;116 million.  The reason we are seeking this Supplementary Estimate is because of the greater than expected amount under subhead A4, which is the lump sum subhead in the Vote.</p><p>  In this context the estimated allocation of just over &euro;500 million gross, published in the Revised Estimates for Public Service 2012 and voted by the House on 21 June 2012, will be exceeded when the December payments of entitlements to retired civil servants and dependants are made to the end of the year.  It is estimated that gross expenditure for 2012 may be in the region of &euro;522 million, that is comprised of the &euro;85 million we have expended to date in addition to &euro;32 million for the provision for the remaining two pay period in 2012 and another &euro;5 million which is the anticipated additional lump sum payments.</p><p>  It is however considered prudent to provide for a sum in excess of &euro;22 million in the event that Departments have underestimated the level of lump sum payments payable before the end of December.  In this context, to ensure that the required funding is voted before the excess costs associated with the additional retirements accrue to the Vote, a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;25 million is being sought.</p><p>  I appreciate that members may ask why the Supplementary Estimate is taking place this late in the year when it would have been known for a number of months that the assumption on which the original Estimate for 2012 had been predicated upon were no longer valid.  Seeking a Supplementary Estimate too early in the year, for example in September or October, runs the risk of either under or over-estimating the additional sum required due to the nature of the Vote.  It is not a case of seeking a Supplementary Estimate to provide funding to bridge the gap between an actual net increase at a particular point in time during the year over the original full year estimated increase as such a snapshot net increase will fluctuate, either up or down, over the remainder of the year due to a combination of the level of further retirements and the number of deaths.<br /><b></b>As an example of the volatility of the Vote, it is to be noted that some 300 new pensions, some of which would be reduced spouses' and children's benefits arising from the death of the pension scheme member, have been put into payment since August.  When a former civil servant passes away, his or her spouse is entitled to half of his or her pension, that is effectively a new pension for the purposes of the Vote and that of course is taken care of as well.</p><p>  As expenditure on this Vote is particularly influenced by the numbers of persons who exercise an option to retire before reaching compulsory retirement age, it would have been difficult to estimate the numbers who might choose to exercise such an option over say a four-month period between September and December of this year.  It is therefore only towards the end of the year that a more accurate assessment may be made and an appropriate level of additional funding sought.  Even at this late stage, absolute accuracy is not possible as, for example, persons may only now be actively considering whether to retire before the end of the year.</p></speech>

I ask members to confine their questioning to ten or 15 minutes each.  Before I call Deputy Sean Fleming, I would like to ask the Minister of State about the headline issue.  The annual retirement prediction for 2012 was 19,436.  This afternoon, we are discussing 560 retirements that were not anticipated.  Have these retirements taken place in line with the reductions that were sought in the overall public sector figure?  I assume that figure will be taken into account in 2013, in terms of meeting the overall target for reductions in public sector numbers.</p></speech>

As the Chairman is aware, the Government plans to reduce the total size of the public sector from 320,000 to 282,500.  I think the current figure is approximately 290,000.  To answer the Chairman's question directly, the additional retirements will be factored into these figures.  A greater than expected number of people have retired this year.  My understanding is that lump sum payments come from the Departments, which then recoup those moneys through the Vote process.  There has been a greater drag on lump sums because a larger number of people have come forward.</p></speech>

I thank him for attending in the absence of the Minister, Deputy Howlin.  I will make a few points and ask a few questions.</p><p>  As the Minister of State said, there are approximately 290,000 people in the public service.  I do not know how many public service pensioners there are.  Approximately 10% of our 290,000 public servants are civil servants.  The round figure is 30,000 or thereabouts.  We are dealing with a Supplementary Estimate that relates to the pensions of retired civil servants.  As I have said, civil servants account for approximately 10% of public service numbers.  Can the Minister of State explain what is being done for the 90% of public servants who do not have the facility whereby a Minister or Minister of State can come in and seek an additional Supplementary Estimate to cover their pensions?  If a local authority is finding it difficult to make additional pension payments in the last six weeks of the year, having already made payments to staff who left earlier in the year, it cannot ask the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government for an extra &euro;300,000 to cover these costs.  It has to suck it up.  It has to find the money somewhere.</p><p>  Most people who retire from the public service are employees of the HSE.  The Department of Health is the only Department that has yet to give us the details of the Supplementary Estimate it requires.  At this late stage, with less than a week to go until the budget for next year, the dysfunctional Minister in question cannot even give us a figure for the Supplementary Estimate for this year.  I do not know whether that Supplementary Estimate will make provision for pensions to be paid to staff who retired during the course of the year.  It might not.  I do not know.  Some 10% of public servants have direct access to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform through the Civil Service.  As long as the D&aacute;il has a vote on a special motion, they are able to have their pensions dealt with.  That does not apply to the other 90% of public servants.  I want to know what kind of equality will apply.  What will happen to pensions in local authorities, State agencies and semi-State agencies?</p><p>  I would have preferred to address my second point to the Minister, Deputy Howlin.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is a spanking new Department.  As it was established some time in 2011, this year has been its first full year in existence.  Given that it has been lecturing every other Department on the need to come in on budget, this has been one of its first big tests.  The Minister of State has given us some excuses to explain why its figures in relation to this issue were wrong.  That is not acceptable in the real world.</p><p>  I ask him to explain subhead A4 to us again.  According to the briefing notes, some &euro;116 million was provided under that subhead in the original Estimate for this year, but we have now been told that the anticipated spend is &euro;139 million.  The difference is &euro;23 million, or approximately 20%.  The Minister of State mentioned in his opening statement that factors like the number of people expected to retire, the current staffing levels and the need to make provision for people leaving were considered when the original Estimate was drawn up.  The Department's figure was 20% wrong.  The original Estimate under subhead A4 was &euro;116 million and the anticipated spend under that subhead is &euro;139 million.  The Department miscalculated by 20%.  I wonder whether it would have got its sums wrong to this extent if this issue was still being dealt with under the Department of Finance.  This is a serious criticism of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We will subject the Department to critical analysis.  We have not had a Supplementary Estimate like this in the area of superannuation and retired allowances for a number of years.  I suspect that in the old days, the Department of Finance would have projected its figures more accurately earlier in the year.  I want the Minister of State to deal with that.</p></speech>

I will begin with the second issue.  We got it wrong.  The Deputy's question is the first one I ask as Minister of State when people come to me looking for Supplementary Estimates.  The dilemma in this case is that we depend on other Departments to tell us how many retirements we are getting.  Any public servant who is over the age of 60 can retire at any stage in the year by informing the relevant Department of his or her intentions.  That cost is borne by the Department in question.  We recoup those moneys to the various Departments through this Vote.  It is not a question of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform getting anything wrong.  It is a demand-led situation.  As long as the scheme allows people to retire at any time - one could decide to do so at 11.50 p.m. on 31 December - a cost will have to be borne.  In response to the Deputy's suggestion that we have got it wrong by 20%, I would like to invite him to look at the overall Vote.</p></speech>

Over &euro;500 million is provided for in Vote 12.  We are looking for &euro;25 million today.  That represents a deviation of 5% by 31 December on what was in the Estimate on 1 January.  Fair is fair.  At a time when we are dealing with more extended exits from the public sector than ever before, and given that we are relying on information coming back from Departments, I think we have got it quite right.  The Deputy said we have never had this before.  We had this in 2009, when the Deputy's party was in government.</p></speech>

I do not think it looks after the politicians, thankfully.  Pension and lump sum arrangements in all of the other principal areas, including education, health and the local authorities, are determined in the Votes of the relevant Departments.  If a raft of additional pension costs arose in a specific sector in the manner suggested by the Deputy, it would be reflected in the relevant subhead.</p></speech>

According to the briefing note provided by the Department, staff who left the Civil Service this year are covered by subhead A4.</p></speech>

The shortfall of &euro;23 million under this heading is the reason for the requirement for a supplementary sum of &euro;25 million.  Excluding this subhead, the original Estimate for all other subheads was &euro;384 million and the anticipated spend at the end of the year is &euro;383 million.  The difference between the Estimate and the outturn is less than 0.33%, which indicates the Department's calculations in respect of those already in the system were spot on.  The request for a Supplementary Estimate refers to one subhead for which the original Estimate was 20% short.</p></speech>

The Estimate of slightly more than &euro;500 million is being superseded by the Supplementary Estimate of &euro;522 million.  Expenditure under subhead A4 proved difficult to predict because the lump sum of 1.5 times salary refers to the exit point at which staff leave the Civil Service and is, therefore, heavily dependent on their position.  A lump sum for a principal officer is much more than for a clerical officer.  Moreover, lumps sums must be paid immediately.</p></speech>

This difference is masked in the overall figure.</p><p>  The Minister of State is seeking an additional &euro;25 million to cover the costs of pensions for retired civil servants.  How many retired civil servants are in receipt of pensions of more than &euro;50,000, &euro;60,000, &euro;70,000, &euro;80,000, &euro;90,000 and &euro;100,000, respectively?

Before reading the figures for the total numbers of Civil Service pensioners and the amounts they receive, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform made a crucial point in this regard recently when he noted that 1% of public service pensioners were in receipt of pensions in excess of &euro;60,000 and that only a few hundred of them had a pension in excess of &euro;100,000.  During a debate in the House in Private Members' time some weeks ago I asked how many retired civil servants, politicians and judges had a pension of more than &euro;100,000.  I believe I am correct in stating the figure provided was 84.  The precise figures as of September 2012 are as follows: 84 retired civil servants had a pension of more than &euro;100,000, while a further 28 former Ministers and judges who come within the ambit of the Vote of the Houses of the Oireachtas were in receipt of a pension of more than &euro;100,000.</p></speech>

I want to be honest, we will look at any and every proposal that is made.  As the Deputy rightly said the great majority of public service pensioners are on very modest pensions.  She asked the number on pensions of &euro;10,000 or less.  I understand the number is about 7,000 who have a very modest pension.  We are all conscious of large pensions and exits upon which people leave the public sector.  That is why the Government has taken the decision to increase the amount of rebate for people over &euro;100,000, added to the amount of additional taxation and the levies that have been imposed and the reductions in pay at the top within the public sector.  I have made the point to Deputy McDonald previously that this is something for which people internationally have regard.  On the issue of pay and pensions, there is no point in separating them as they amount to the same amount of money coming from the revenue stream.  Three years ago, the totality of public sector pay and pensions was about &euro;20 billion.  Now, if one adds up public sector pay and pensions - pensions have increased but pay has come done because of all the measures that have been introduced - they amount to &euro;17.5 billion.  Over a three year period &euro;2.5 billion has been taken out of the total public sector pay and pension bill, in circumstances where not one day of industrial action has been lost.</p></speech>

The point I am making is that in a three year period &euro;2.5 billion has been taken out of the totality of public sector pay and pensions and, I hasten to add, there is another &euro;1 billion to go but it is an example of the road that has been travelled.  As the Deputy's point relates to those in receipt of pensions over of &euro;100,000, I make the point that the greatest reduction in terms of people's pay levels has been at the top of the public sector, up to 35% in cases.  If the argument is being put forward by the Deputy that those at the top have not made a contribution, it is not borne out by the statistics which show that those at very top have given a huge amount of their salary, rightly so, because they can afford it.  The Government has not been exclusive in this regard.  We have said to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, that we will look at any and every measure which could help to make further savings in this area and we are not ruling out options.</p></speech>

A 14% reduction in the pay of a clerical officer in the Civil Service is an incredible chunk taken from very modest earnings.  It is misleading to posit that position against a person on &euro;200,000 taking a bigger knock.  That person had so much more that the consequences for that worker and his or her family are not comparable with workers further down the scale.  That is a reality borne out and known by public sector workers.  Perhaps we can park the pay issue and return to the pensions.  Is the Minister of State comfortable with the fact that there are 84 people with pensions in excess of &euro;100,000?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-28a.122" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/958" speakername="Brian Hayes" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI22012112800006#E00800"><p>What the Deputy refers to is misleading.  Equally, it is misleading for the Deputy or anyone else to posit the view that simply going after people in receipt of pensions of &euro;100,000 or more will make a huge difference in terms of the totality of the saving.  I just make that observation as the Deputy referred to the point as misleading.  What I am happy about is the fact that the Government has introduced a range of measures to make sure that those who have more, in terms of their pension, pay more and have seen real substantial reductions in their pensions.  That is an issue on which the Government has set out its view since coming into government.  I am equally happy with the evidence on a legal basis because pension is a form of deferred remuneration, as the Deputy is aware, in terms of its property right component in terms of the Constitution.  If the Deputy is asking the straight question, have we pushed the potential of doing this in terms of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009, it is the strong view of the Department that if one goes after a cohort of people within the pension cover that we could leave ourselves open for a legal challenge.  The worst circumstance would be if we were to lose in the scenario because the entire legislation framework would fall.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, has repeatedly made this point that there has got to be a proportionate view as to the reductions that have been made.  That is why, as the Deputy is well aware, the reductions in pension cover for the entire cohort of salaries have been proportionate and we stand over that.  I am comfortable in stating that someone has a pension of more than &euro;100,000 will not change that situation.  Of course, there are other issues that can be examined, particularly in the taxation area.  That is one half of the equation if we are to introduce greater equality in terms of pension reductions; the other aspect is in terms of taxation.  The Government will consider all these issues in due course.</p></speech>

If he was to revisit that FEMPI framework protecting all pensions of &euro;60,000 and lower, which covers the vast majority of public service workers, and revisit the levies in a progressive way, we have demonstrated clearly that there is a saving of &euro;10 million to be made.   The Minister of State may dismiss that in the general budgetary arithmetic.</p></speech>

The money we are looking for is to ensure that we can balance our books in this Vote this year.  The Deputy is putting forward the view, for whatever obtuse political reason, that this money is for people who are on pensions of &euro;100,000 plus, but I suspect the major part of this money is for people on very small public pensions who have worked hard over time.

Perhaps he will help us out here.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, while liberally quoting this legal advice has steadfastly refused to produce it.

I do not accept the Minister of State's argument with regard to the emergency measure.  It is clear it is something he does not wish to do.  Likewise with the TLAC terms.  Every time it comes to dealing with people in the service who are on very high pay, it is a case of hands off and it is not possible to do anything.</p><p>  When it comes to somebody further down the chain, the Government has no difficulty introducing emergency measures that, in proportionate terms, hit those people very hard.

The &euro;25 million is for paying people between now and the end of the year.  That is what we are looking for.  Without labouring the point, the majority of those people are people who will have very small pensions for the rest of their lives.</p><p>  There is a political point here too.  This is about alternatives.  If people put forward alternatives, the Government will look at those, but it is about the totality of those alternatives, not just parts of them put forward on the basis of the Government taking a decision.  Many people will be interested in hearing the Deputy's view that Sinn F&eacute;in would abolish the universal social charge, which would have an effect on all of these pensioners.  However, they would like to know how we would pay for that.  In the round, people will ultimately be caught out on such questions.</p></speech>

At the same time, when putting forward proposals, we must try to be as realistic as possible.  I am sure the Minister of State got his advice from the Attorney General, but did Deputy McDonald get legal advice on the imposition of 99% levies on large pensions?  I do not think it would withstand a legal challenge.  Did Sinn F&eacute;in get legal advice to the effect that such a levy would be lawful?  If such advice is available, the Department should review it because during discussions on this matter in recent years the advice has been that imposing levies that are considered to be disproportionate on one group above another would be unconstitutional.  The question of how much can be taken from existing pensions is a difficult one to answer.</p><p>  Deputy Fleming criticised the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, in the context of what is happening with his Department's Vote but I remember a meeting with the previous Minister for Health and Children during the last Administration, where he could not tell us how many people were working for the HSE.  He had no idea of the numbers.  Furthermore, memorandums were sent by Ministers in various Departments to the effect that no additional staff should be hired, but people were being taken on left, right and centre.  When the HSE was set up we were expecting to see a rationalisation of top management.  The objective was that there would be fewer people running a more co-ordinated service but what happened was the original top grade in the old health board system, which numbered around 50, exploded and reached 780 at its peak.  That was pure mismanagement on the Government's part.  It should not have allowed such an increase in the number of Grade 8 staff, that is, senior management.  On top of that, we had two rounds of benchmarking, which resulted in excessive pay increases.  All of that has left the current Minister in an extremely difficult situation.  He is trying to control budgets and spending. </p><p>  The Minister of State made reference to future pay to pensions ratios, which is something that worries many people.  In the coming years, new entrants to the public service will be paid less but the pensions being paid out will be based on the old pay rates.  That in itself will create an enormous problem for future Governments because public servants will resent the fact that they are being paid less than some pensioners.  It is very important to clarify what has happened on the pensions front, in terms of levies and other charges, as well as the reductions that have happened in recent years.  There is political capital available to the Opposition in terms of arguing that there are many people who are floating around on massive pensions and that the Government is just putting up with that.  There have been enormous reductions made to people's pensions, particularly to the larger ones.  I ask the Minister of State to provide figures to the committee on the pension reductions that have been made for the specific grades referred to by Deputy McDonald.  A comparison between the amounts paid in 2007 and 2012 would be useful.</p></speech>

Deputy Twomey is quite right.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, has introduced a new unified pension scheme where career-average earnings rather than 50% of final salary will be used to calculate pensions in future.  Not only will new public servants be on lower pay, they will also be in receipt of significantly lower pensions on retirement, which will have a knock-on effect on the State's liability into the future.  Radical changes have happened in this area since this Government took office and that is borne out by the new single pension scheme.  As the Deputy has also pointed out, there have been significant increases in tax and the USC as well as actual pension reductions, which I will put on the record.  Pensions of between &euro;12,000 and &euro;24,000 have been reduced by 6%, those between &euro;24,000 to &euro;60,000 were reduced by 9%, pensions between &euro;60,000 and &euro;100,000 were reduced by 12%, while those over &euro;100,000 have been reduced by 20%.  These are radical reductions in pension cover.  Furthermore, at least one third of any pension over &euro;60,000 is returned to the State by way of tax.  When we talk about a pension of &euro;100,000 it is important to remember that &euro;100,000 is not the take-home figure, as many in this room would know.  A lot of change has already occurred and we are not ruling out further changes.  The important numbers are the billions, rather than the tens of millions.  The important figure is the total amount that has been saved over a three year period and we have further savings to make, without doubt.</p></speech>

This is a very serious issue that greatly concerns people on the street.  We can talk about constitutional and property rights and what people are entitled to but people are more interested in the gross figures.</p><p>  Are we sure of the numbers working in the public service now?  I ask because during the last Administration there was much debate about the exact number of public servants.  Are we also absolutely sure of the pension figures and the amounts payable?  Are the figures reliable now because they were not during the course of the last Government?</p></speech>

There were enormous changes this year because of the February deadline, when large numbers left the public service.   Furthermore, if people were 60 years or over and had the requisite service, they could also leave after February.  There was an enormous transformation in terms of the numbers exiting the service this year alone.  We are confident that the figures we have put into the public domain, in terms of the total numbers in the public sector, are correct.  There will always be some variation from one sector to the next, particularly in sectors like health and education because they account for a huge proportion of the total.  The figure for the total number of public servants, excluding those working for local authorities, in 2009 was 278,106.  That was the average number.  In 2012, the figure is 264,421.  </p><p>  Other areas of public sector reform include redeployment, shared services, altered working conditions and so forth and these must be forthcoming to prove to the public that we can do more with less and achieve greater efficiencies in the public service.</p></speech>

The net issue is that the Government has given a commitment to get down to numbers of 282,500 by 2015, coming from a height of 320,000 in 2008.  This is the target we must hit.  There is some evidence that a considerable number of people have come out of the system.  At the moment there are 290,000, but how we manage to get the next 8,000 or 9,000 in net reductions will be a critical issue.</p><p>  There is some evidence that a group of people who withdrew their applications to depart in February may be incentivised to consider it again if a new scheme is established.  The question is what the cost of that will be and whether we target it at particular sectors where there is a given requirement.  This issue will of necessity come out of the dialogue with the trade unions and on our side with management as a means of trying to ensure that we get to the number of 282,500 by 2015 and do so in a way that does not diminish the number of front-line staff.</p><p>  I offer one example of how to transform things and make a difference.  One of the key aspects of public sector reform is shared services.  Next year we will launch a human resources, HR, shared service.  The total number of people involved in HR in central government is 850.  The new HR shared services will do it all with 600 people.  This means we will have more than 250 people to redeploy.  That is a small example of what we can do if we get buy-in for the things we need in shared services.</p></speech>

If these retirements had not taken place, how much would the Exchequer have to pay in wages by comparison with what it is seeking at the moment?  What is the saving overall?</p></speech>

What if the retirements did not happen?  We reckon when someone moves from being paid a salary to being paid a pension the saving is at least 50%.  One could argue that the cost would be a further 50% if these people had not exited.</p></speech>

If the Exchequer was not seeking &euro;25 million, it would be spending more than &euro;50 million.  Ultimately, we are carrying out a cost-saving mechanism.

There are proposals with regard to what type of levy should be imposed on pensions.  This is pertinent for anyone thinking of joining the Civil Service or public service who could earn substantially more in the private sector.  If there is a cap on the amount of money that one can earn in wages and pensions, anyone wishing to provide for his family would take the view that the private sector is more of a safe bet and, ultimately, we will end up in a situation whereby people with useful skill sets will not be in the Civil Service.  Everywhere we go, we hear that a high level of expertise is needed in the Civil Service.  I am keen to hear a comment from the Minister of State.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-28a.162" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/958" speakername="Brian Hayes" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI22012112800009#H01200"><p>It is a complex organisation in which almost 300,000 people work and there are some extraordinarily talented people with vast expertise.  If some of that expertise was at work in the private sector, those involved would probably be on twice the salary they are on currently.  Another point should be made to those who regularly harangue those in the public sector.  Our public sector numbers <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the total number of people at work in the economy is small by EU standards.  Approximately 17% of the total workforce is made up of the public sector.  It is a rather small component.  Anyway, we must do things differently.  That is the great challenge and buy-in is required.</p><p>  Benchmarking was supposed to be about additional productivity for the additional pay given to people but I do not believe that ever happened.  In a funny way, with benchmarking in reverse, there is an opportunity now for a new type of benchmarking.  Several things have to be sorted out.  First, we must benchmark ourselves as a country <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> other small countries in Europe.  Second, we must benchmark ourselves with regard to the question raised by Deputies McDonald and Fleming on the long-term sustainability of pensions in the public sector.  Third, we need to benchmark ourselves against future agreements.  There must be space in which brilliant people in the public sector who have brilliant ideas and who carry out reform and make things happen are rewarded.  However, we do not have the type of flexibility within the pay and remuneration system currently in place to do that.  These are the challenges we face in trying to do benchmarking in reverse in a circumstance whereby the last exercise was a dreadful example of how not to go about it.</p></speech>

They find it remarkable that we are able to implement this level of taxation and cuts without civil unrest or strikes throughout the country.  There would be implications were such events to take place.  It would send a message throughout the world to anyone who was looking at the country and we are taking that for granted.  I am unsure whether the media are being briefed about the level of difficulty at which the Department is operating.</p><p>  I wish to point out one issue with regard to taxation or levies on pensions.  The effective rate of tax, as Deputy Fleming and myself are aware, on anyone earning in the top bracket is really 52% at the moment.  Let us consider what would happen if, as proposed by some committee members, the Exchequer put a 99% levy on anything over &euro;100,000 and a 50% levy on anything over &euro;60,000.  It is unbelievable to think that for every &euro;100 earned, if there was a 52% tax level and a 99% levy, then one would pay &euro;151 in tax.  It is probably the most crazy mathematics I have ever encountered, but the Minister of Sate can pass a comment on that if he so wishes.</p></speech>

People have paid into these things.  The legal position is that pensions are a form of deferred remuneration.  As I noted earlier, it is classified as a property right.  We have a body of law which is quite clear.  I refer to the most recent judgment made by Mr. Justice McMahon.  He referred to this point when he said that if the Exchequer tried to go after a group of people as a means of reducing what was a legitimate expectation on their part in an unfair or disproportionate way, there is a case that can be answered in terms of the courts.  The worst position for the country would be if there was some undermining of the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation, to which Deputy McDonald referred earlier, because it is emergency legislation.</p><p>  Considerable changes have taken place.  The public sector has shrunk in size and its pay and pensions bill has reduced remarkably.  No other country in Europe has done this in the circumstances we have faced.  We have done this in a framework that other countries would give their left arms for, as the Minister, Deputy Howlin, has said.  We should be mindful of that and also of the fact that we need to build capacity within our public service for the future.  This means being flexible in terms of bringing people in.  I understand that among new entrants to the Department of Finance in the past 18 months, some 30% have come from private sector backgrounds.  This is the type of interchange we need to see.  We need the public sector to find out what is going on in the private sector and <i>vice versa</i>.  We need to see flexible arrangements in order that within our public administration we have the very best people who can give us advice, as policy makers, in terms of getting the best results for the country.</p></speech>

A reformed, efficient and effective public sector is a key part of the Government's programme of recovery, because as an operating pillar the public sector is critical to our economic recovery.</p><p>  Before I joined the House, certain Deputies were responsible for introducing the Criminal Assets Bureau legislation.  Lobbying went on from certain sectors of society such as the agricultural community, which sought to be exempted from the CAB legislation.  There was extensive lobbying from certain sectors of society which may have acquired wealth by not conforming to the general provisions of the law.  Representations were made from certain sectors in agriculture to the effect that agriculture should be exempted from CAB work, but this was found to be legally impossible.</p></speech>

In recent years, Members' votes, in the budget or in subsequent legislation, for reductions in various sectors have not been followed by the Departments.  A gross figure is the one that is managed.  Our calls for a reduction in this or that are completely ignored.  The Departments simply look at the gross figure.  It is not drilled down.</p><p>  None of us wants to go into the Chamber and vote for cuts to disability services or home helps.  We vote on reductions in other areas but we are ignored when money is allotted to the people who are providing the services.  This happens in education, health and social welfare.  Individual Departments seem to take a gross figure and work off that.  They do not seem to make an effort to fulfil what is voted for by the Parliament.</p></speech>

We have a dedicated Department that is doing two things.  First, it constantly keeps a much more vigorous eye on expenditure and, second, it aligns that expenditure to necessary public sector reforms.  You seem to be saying, Chairman, that a further light of publicity needs to be shone on this.  That is a sensible proposal.</p></speech>

We might formalise it as a proposal.  I do not see a difficulty in that.</p><p>  The real problem arises if a Minister with responsibility for one of the big expenditure areas decides to save money in a particular area.  That is usually bad news because it means schemes being cut or people losing money.

He is clearly much more familiar with it than I am.</p><p>  I thank the members of the joint committee for making time available today to discuss this motion.  This is a very busy time for all parties as the budget approaches.  I was a member of the Opposition for a long time so I appreciate the work involved.  As members are aware, the motion concerns an opt-in by Ireland to a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council amending the decisions setting up three funds in the asylum and immigration areas.  These funds are the European Refugee Fund, the European Return Fund and the European Fund for the Integration of Third-Country Nationals.</p><p>  The legal basis for the proposed measure lies in Title V of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  Therefore, the proposal is subject to Article 3 of Protocol No. 21 which is annexed to that treaty.  Under this treaty, Ireland has three months from the date on which a proposal has been published in all official EU languages to notify the Council of its wish to take part in the adoption and application of the measure.  In the present case, the three-month period ends on 27 December next.  Alternatively, instead of opting in within this period, Ireland could do so after the proposal has been adopted.  However, it is generally better to opt in within the three-month period - all the more so in the present case because the proposal applies only to Ireland and to a limited number of other member states.  Under Article 29.4.7&deg; of the Constitution, the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas is required for Ireland to exercise any opt-ins.</p><p>  The proposed decision increases the co-financing rates under the three funds for member states which receive financial assistance under the instruments set up by the Union to help states experiencing or threatened with serious financial difficulties.  This proposal currently applies to Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Romania.  The Commission has proposed that the co-financing rates for support from the funds should be increased by 20 percentage points for the states in question, subject to the overall national allocation applicable to the member state.  Thus, the normal rate of 50% would become 70% and the 75% rate for projects addressing specific priorities would become 95%. The EU has already adopted measures providing for increased co-financing under other funds, such as the Structural Fund, for member states in financial difficulty.  An important feature of the proposal, as explained in the briefing supplied to committee members, is that once an action in a specific annual programme under a fund has been co-financed at the increased rate, that will continue until the end of the eligibility period, even if the country has exited the programme.  The eligibility period of an annual programme extends for one and a half years after the year to which it relates, giving a total period of two and a half years.  This element of the proposal is appropriate because a member state, upon leaving a support mechanism, is still in transition and continues to need some special measures.  It is our intention to emerge from the EU-IMF programme at the end of 2013.  Therefore, this aspect of the proposal is very welcome from our point of view.  As will be obvious to members, this is a good-news proposal from Ireland's point of view, and the European Commission is to be commended on its introduction.  Very properly, it recognised the implications of the economic and financial crisis for the member states affected and, specifically, it saw that it would adversely affect the necessary and desirable work done with the assistance of these three funds.  The adoption of this measure will make it easier to source the necessary national matching funding, whether that comes from the State, as would be the case for the return fund, or largely from individual projects, in the case of the other two funds.  I recognise that there are always challenges in raising matching funding in the present economic climate but this proposal aims to make this objective more attainable.</p><p>  The Minister, Deputy Shatter, and I are strongly of the view that Ireland should opt in to this measure.  Indeed, we can hardly do otherwise, given that it was formulated with our situation in mind, as well as that of a limited number of other member states.  I commend the motion to the committee.</p></speech>

The motion also provides the opportunity to address some of the challenges highlighted in the report of the Irish Refugee Council.  I am sure the Minister of State is as concerned as I am about the issues highlighted in the report.  According to figures for September 2012, a total of 5,098 people are residing in direct provision centres, of whom 1,789 are children.  They are provided with food and shelter and an allowance of &euro;19.10 per week and &euro;9.60 per child.  We are all aware of the nonsense stories about free haircuts and fancy cars.  These people are living in overcrowded conditions.  The report noted one case of a family of five confined to a single room over a period of two years.  The Irish Refugee Council is speaking out about this situation.  Also, respected public figures such as the chief executive of Barnardos, Fergus Finlay, and Ms Justice Catherine McGuinness have said this is a serious case of child abuse and neglect and is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights.  The children's referendum has been passed.  It is hoped that this additional funding will allow us to address these issues.  I appeal to the Minister of State to use this opportunity.</p></speech>

The Irish Refugee Council has rightly highlighted these conditions.  The overcrowding in accommodation and the lack of facilities is one aspect; the other element is the speed at which asylum applications can be processed, which is being addressed.  Care is required in transferring information from other jurisdictions.</p></speech>

We welcome the proposal.  Is the Minister of State in a position to provide a broad indication of the amount of money involved?  We welcome the increase in support from the European Union, but how large will be the budgets in this regard?  Has a determination been made on what will be the Irish contribution?</p></speech>

However, the budget for last year was between &euro;1.2 million and &euro;1.4 million.  This was split between the two funds, namely, the return fund and the repatriation fund.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-28a.190" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="09:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2012112800004#C00500"><p>Yes.  For the current year, the amount for the refugee and integration funds was &euro;1.5 million.  The provision for the return fund - this relates to people who wish to voluntarily return to their own countries - was &euro;720,000 in 2012.  We are assuming that the amounts for next year will be similar, but we do not know because the budget process has yet to be concluded.  A clearer picture will emerge at a later date.  The significant aspect of this matter concerns the projects which can be undertaken within the voluntary sector.  Up until now, it would have been necessary to have 30% of the money up front in order to obtain matching funding.  Given that it is increasing to 90%, a project might only need to raise 5% and would still manage to obtain the additional funding.</p></speech>

In the national context, &euro;1.5 million is a tiny amount.  Apropos what Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn stated, we are referring to people who are extremely vulnerable.  Nobody chooses to be a refugee.  One imagines that it is not a very pleasant lifestyle. This is taxpayers' money which is being well spent.  We must continue to invest the money in question in order that we might try to assist these unfortunate people.</p></speech>

We all absolutely support them and welcome what she has said about the benefits they are likely to bring for voluntary projects, in particular.  I echo what Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn said about the concerns raised by the Irish Refugee Council.  Will the increased funding available go some way towards addressing a number of the issues involved?  I refer, in particular, to the children in direct provision centres.  Some years ago I was involved with the Free Legal Advice Centres which, with several children's rights organisations, were seeking to ensure the children of refugees and asylum seekers would be entitled to child benefit on the same basis as any other child in the State.  In the light of the recent referendum on children's rights, is there any prospect of such a eventuality coming to pass?  Again, I welcome the proposals made.</p></speech>

Fortunately or unfortunately - I do not know which - we do not have responsibility for child benefit, the payment of which comes under the Department of Social Protection.  Projects relating to languages, cr&egrave;ches and similar child supports which are very specific to those who come from countries other than Ireland, can apply for funding.  Their applications will have a greater chance of being successful as a result of the fact that they will no longer be required to raise so much additional funding themselves.  We all know that the groups to which I refer are encountering difficulties in trying to raise money in order that they might attract matching funding.  I return to what I said about the overcrowding we have witnessed and the fact that children are living in unsuitable conditions.  Ultimately, it must always be about speeding up the process and regularising the lives of those involved.  The latter will have a greater impact than anything else.</p></speech>

Will she provide a breakdown?</p></speech>

Some 65% of the allocation for the return fund was used in the programme year of 2008, while 90% was used in 2009.  The proposal is designed to make it easier for countries in a bailout programme which, by definition, have serious problems.  The proposal will also radically reduce the requirement for matching funding.  In the case of projects which currently qualify for 75% co-funding, the amount will soon become 95%.  In other words, the organisation which brings forward a project will only be obliged to raise 5% of the funding required.  In the most recent round of funding under the refugee and integration funds, some 18 of 22 projects received 75%.  All past and current projects funded under the return fund received 50%.  This will be increasing to 75%.</p><p>  The increases involved are substantial.  The money provided by the Government will be capable of being recouped.  What is proposed will make matters far easier for the projects and for us also.  As a result of what is being done, projects which could not procure the funding necessary in the past in order to qualify will now find it much easier to qualify.</p></speech>

People who have had their position regularised would also have the right to apply.  For example, the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre is working sensitively with refugees and asylum seekers who have experienced sexual violence and other traumas.  There is also a project in Killarney which provides practical, moral and social support for asylum seekers and refugees in Killarney and Tralee.  The activities relating to this project include a drop-in service, an outreach service to local accommodation centres and capacity building through training and social activities.  The project also works with local service providers to ensure the needs of asylum seekers and refugees are met.  There are numerous similar projects which are funded from the money in question.  For example, the City of Dublin VEC has an education programme, while the D&oacute;chas Centre, the women's prison at Mountjoy Prison, also has a project.</p></speech>

Some of us would say it is an issue from individual cases in our constituencies.  Does the Minister of State have a concern this is a national issue and, if she has, how would she deal with it and with the protection of foreign nationals and refugees?</p></speech>

We have all come across such incidents; some have been blatant, some have been subtle, some have been institutional and some have been against an individual.  We have laws to deal with this issue.  This is a specific offence.  Anyone who experiences racist abuse or has been treated differently because he or she is a different colour, a different nationality or speaks a different language - it is a very broad mix - should report it.  We take a dim view of such behaviour and treat racist abuse seriously.  People reported for engaging in racist abuse have been prosecuted.  Sometimes it is a minor issue but other times it can be quite aggressive and can have a huge impact not only on the individual against whom it was carried out, but on his or her family and friends.  We have laws to deal with it.  As in all other cases of discrimination, we need to encourage people to take action when such incidents occur.</p></speech>

In some cases the adults move on within ten seconds and there is no chance of the children going to the Garda to seek to have them prosecuted.  The Minister of State spoke about cyberbullying and such issues, but it is horrific for a 15 or 16 old boy or girl to be racially abused walking down the street.  This is happening.</p></speech>

It is always adults who instill them into society.  It is a learned behaviour and it is something we need not only to confront in society but in terms of the law.  It is a big issue and a consequence of such behaviour is that these people will retrench into their own communities and we do not want that.  We need people to mix and be part of the general population.  That is good for us and it is good for them. I encourage people in the event of such abuse occurring to report it.  Even if it is carried out against a teenager, and most especially if that is the case, it is important to report the incident because teenagers are far more vulnerable.</p></speech>

This is definitely a matter of concern.  Are there any campaigns or programmes active in the Minister of State's Department to highlight these issues or to combat racism?</p></speech>

The multi-agency integration groups in all local authorities work very well.  It is at that local level we can have a bigger impact.  National publicity campaigns are important but I am not certain that the people we need to convince regarding these issues take any great notice of those types of campaigns.  Where notice is taken and we can have most effect is at local level and when people are confronted about their attitudes.  I am not certain we will convince people their attitudes are wrong but we can ensure when they express their attitudes publicly that they do not detrimentally affect others.  That is what we need to confront.  We need to ensure their attitudes do not detrimentally affect others.  If we can do that, we will be doing a good job.  I could be wrong but I could never be certain that we will ever change the attitude of people like that.  However, we can stop them from expressing it publicly and abusing others.</p></speech>

Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also wish to advise Mr. O'Rourke that the opening statement he has submitted will be published on the committee's website after the meeting.</p><p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

I am pleased to attend this committee and to make a short initial presentation outlining my background and the issues facing both organisations.</p><p>  I grew up in Dalkey, County Dublin and was educated in Scoil Lorc&aacute;in and Col&aacute;iste Eoin.  I then attended UCD where I studied engineering, graduating in 1980.  I joined the ESB from college and worked for five years in the steam and gas turbine technical services area and trained at Brown Boveri in Switzerland and Parsons in Newcastle, England.  I was then promoted to run a section responsible for monitoring and improving power station efficiency.  While at the ESB, I also studied part-time for a master's degree in industrial engineering/business, which I was awarded in 1985.</p><p>  In 1987 I moved to Irish Intercontinental Bank, then majority-owned by KBC of Belgium.  It subsequently became a fully-owned subsidiary.  I worked initially in corporate banking, but moved in 1989 to help set up the bank&rsquo;s international aircraft finance operation.  In the early 1990s I was appointed as head of the bank&rsquo;s international project finance operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  The team grew rapidly, to a point where it had 30 project financiers split between Dublin and Brussels.  The team, when I was there, was responsible for several billion euro of lending for infrastructure, energy and telecommunications projects.  During that time I was involved in road projects in England, Hungary and Portugal, tunnels in Belgium, France and England and a number of bridge projects.  I was also involved in light rail projects in Manchester and Sydney.</p><p>  In 2000, I returned to the ESB as investment director and worked on a number of major projects in Northern Ireland, Spain and Poland.  This job helped me to look at projects from the broader perspective of an investor, rather than the narrower perspective of a lender.  I was fortunate to work for a major semi-state company which has a disciplined and highly sophisticated track record in developing major projects.  In 2003, I moved to Goodbody Corporate Finance, where I have advised a number of semi-State and private companies on energy and infrastructure projects, as well as in other areas.</p></speech>

If it is acceptable to the committee, I propose to take questions from three members at a time.  I call Deputy Ellis.</p></speech>

I am not sure how people are nominated for positions of this nature but on the evidence of what he said, Mr. O'Rourke's CV is extremely impressive.</p><p>  Merging the NRA and the RPA is going to present a major challenge.  Will this merger result in job losses?  What will be the new organisation's main projects?  The north-west link is probably the only remaining project to be finished in order that we might complete the road network across the country.  What is Mr. O'Rourke's view in respect of this project?</p><p>  There are problems with regard to the Luas Broombridge, BXD, line, particularly in the context of Campbell's Garage and of the gated crossings at Castleknock and what is known in the area as Campbell's Bridge.  Will those problems, which are giving rise to mayhem and causing major delays not only in the context of those travelling to the west but also for local people, be addressed?</p><p>  Will Mr. O'Rourke outline his views on the metro north project?  I know the Government has shelved the latter but perhaps Mr. O'Rourke will provide an opinion on it.  There is a need for a link to allow people to travel to Dublin Airport from the far side of the city.  This is a major project and it would deliver a large number of jobs.</p><p>  Some money is due to be provided in respect of the A5 road project in 2014 and other money has been provided up to now.  Is this road vital in the context of linking Dublin to Donegal?  What is Mr. O'Rourke's opinion on the matter?</p></speech>

As Deputy Ellis stated, his CV is extremely impressive.</p><p>  I welcome the merger of the NRA and the RPA.  Getting this merger over the line is, however, going to present a hugely significant challenge, particularly in the context of staff, management and the engineering cohort of both organisations.  When the merger has been completed, does Mr. O'Rourke anticipate that conflicts may arise in the context of how the NRA traditionally delivers projects?  If such conflicts do arise, how might they be resolved?</p><p>  Mr. O'Rourke indicated that the existing staff expertise is very important and must be maintained.  I submit that in the coming years the challenges to be faced will, in the context of the type of expertise that will be required, be much different to those which obtained during the past 15 years.  In the latter period, what was being done revolved around land acquisitions and building new roads.  In the future, the emphasis will be on maintaining the new roads that have been built.  In the context of rail procurement, the focus will probably be on upgrading existing lines rather than constructing new ones.  Does Mr. O'Rourke envisage that many of the existing staff will be moved on and that new people will be brought in to deal with these challenges?  What does he believe will happen in the context of expertise, particularly in a changing environment, where the priorities will be completely different to those which obtained during the past 20 years?</p></speech>

Obviously, he will face many challenges.  It appears that during the coming months he will primarily be engaged in dealing with the merger.</p><p>  Is Mr. O'Rourke in a position to provide an indication of the funding requirements in respect of the maintenance of our national network?  Many present will recall that one of the most damaging aspects of the previous recession in the 1980s was the lack of money available for road maintenance and the fact that it took in the region of ten to 15 years to correct the position because our roads had deteriorated to such an enormous degree.  Our climate, as much as anything else, is responsible for causing the erosion of our roads.  Certainly regional and local roads were affected by erosion in the 1980s and I am sure the position regarding our new motorways is no different.  Is Mr. O'Rourke in a position to outline the budgetary requirements and can he indicate from where the moneys required will come?</p><p>  I appreciate that the new organisation will be dependent on the Minister and general Government policy in this regard and that it will only be able to operate on the basis of the money available to it.  However, I am sure Mr. O'Rourke is going to exert pressure on the Government and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in order to ensure that as much money as is required will be forthcoming.  In that context and in light of his own background, will Mr. O'Rourke indicate the role he believes public private partnerships will play in respect of the future of the new agency?  In recent weeks the ESB, with which Mr. O'Rourke was previously employed, issued a bond which was oversubscribed to an enormous degree.  This suggests that investors who may have stayed away from Ireland in recent years are returning in droves in order to invest their money here.  Is Mr. O'Rourke of the view that this may herald something of a change?</p><p>  Like Deputy Ellis, I am a strong supporter of metro north and am of the view that it is a shame that it has been shelved.  I would like to believe that when the merger takes place, the new organisation will press the Government to come up with funding.  I understand that the Government must fund a certain element of any PPP.  When the Minister shelved the project, he indicated that there was no private investment available.  However, it appears that the position in this regard has changed.</p></speech>

What we are doing in this regard represents a major challenge.  However, there is not a huge overlap between the two companies.  One is a road management and road building company and the other is a railway procurement company.  The overlap tends to be in the central areas.  It will be another few weeks before we finish the organisational design.  I do not expect there to be significant job losses.  There will undoubtedly be some retraining and redeployment but I do not expect significant job losses in either organisation.  It is a little early to say what will be the position.  We have had a first cut at the organisational design and we are now trying to refine it and check what we have done is correct.</p><p>  I am very familiar with the north-west link, particularly as I travel to Donegal from time to time.  As far as I am aware, there is no funding available for this project and it has not appeared on any list of proposed projects.  I understand Mr. Fred Barry discussed this matter with the committee on the previous occasion on which he appeared before it.  I would be delighted to have money to spend on this project but it is not a priority at present.  In the coming couple of years, the priority projects will be the N11, the Newlands Cross interchange and the N17 from Gort to Tuam.</p></speech>

The honest answer is that I do not know.  I will speak to the RPA and come back to the Deputy with a response.</p></speech>

I wish him success with the two merged agencies.  I very much welcome yesterday&rsquo;s announcement of the Luas BXD line to join up the two existing Luas lines and to connect up with other services as well.  The construction of the line will cause a number of problems and headaches.  Reference has been made to some of them already.  I understand that it is proposed to bring the Luas line around by College Green.  That would leave very little room for any other kind of traffic.  How will it be dealt with in terms of the overall transport layout and services that use College Green?  It is a key route for cross-city traffic.</p><p>  The other question I wished to raise relates to the Luas and safety.  As it is an on-street tram system using the same road space as other traffic, safety must be the highest priority.  There have been a number of high profile accidents in recent years.  One was a crash between a Luas tram and a bus at the junction of O&rsquo;Connell Street and Abbey Street.  A number of people were injured but thankfully no one was fatally injured.  Nevertheless, I understand the Luas crashed through a green light for some reason.  More recently the Luas was out of action for the better part of a day because of a collision between a bin truck and a Luas tram in the Smithfield area.  Inevitably, accidents will happen but we must be assured that safety is of the highest standard.  When one is travelling on public transport one does not expect to be involved in a collision with another vehicle.</p><p>  Another issue relates to the problem of crime and anti-social behaviour on the Luas red line.  Frequently, we hear of tourists who travel from Heuston Station to the city centre on the Luas and have wallets or cameras stolen.  There is a need for personal passenger security and safety on the red line in particular.  There is a problem with drugs on parts of the line as well.  There is a need for on-board security on the service.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-28a.241" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1073" speakername="John O'Mahony" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2012112800007#F00100"><p>I thank Mr. O'Rourke for outlining his curriculum vitae.  His experience makes him eminently suitable.  Given his experience in funding projects, does he see public private partnerships playing a key role in the future?</p><p>  I questioned Mr. Fred Barry, who was before the committee two weeks ago, on the funding of projects, in particular the Gort to Athenry road.  His response was that, while the project was included in the announcement of last year's stimulus package, it is contingent on the sale of assets.  If the sale of those assets does not go ahead as quickly as planned, does that mean the project will be delayed?</p><p>  Mr. O'Rouke said that we also have a great deal of work to do to improve those roads that are not up to standard.  I think we have many of those types of roads in the west, but will Mr. O'Rouke describe what he means by "those" roads.  I am concerned by his statement on the maintenance of the motorways and that the funding is &euro;100 million short.  Effectively, if there is a shortfall for the maintenance of motorways, is there any provision for the maintenance of secondary routes or will they revert to dirt tracks in the next few years?</p><p>  When Mr. Barry last came before the committee I put to him the legacy issues arising from the construction of motorways, the snag list, the lack of accountability and the relationship with the local authorities, the grey areas such as flooding, where individuals are being sent from local authorities to the NRA and back again with no resolution of the issue.</p></speech>

I am concerned about the maintenance of the road verges, as the weeds are not cut during the summer.  The tourists see lovely green fields, but between the fields and the roads are the  Buachal&aacute;n and thistles.  That sends out a bad message.  How can we overcome that problem?</p><p>  Signage raises issues for local authorities.  The NRA has a strict line on signage but there are insufficient signs flagging places of interest such as the Rock of Cashel and other such places on the main thoroughfares.  That is a real problem facing the local people who want to attract tourists to their visitor attraction.</p><p>  Will Mr. O'Rourke respond to these questions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-28a.243" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cormac O'Rourke" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2012112800007#F00300"><p>Deputy Se&aacute;n Kenny referred to disruption around College Green. College Green is a key hub and most of the traffic coming from the south side is being diverted through Tara Street to the quays. It is a vital transport link. When the Railway Order was being granted, much of the traffic management issues were dealt with by An Bord Plean&aacute;la. I do not know what trade offs were agreed during the planning process. Clearly there were a number of trade offs between Bus &Eacute;ireann and Luas. There is no simple answer but we have managed the traffic on Harcourt Street. With proper planning and co-ordination between Bus &Eacute;ireann and the Luas we can overcome the difficulties.</p><p>  I share the Deputy's concerns about safety. The safety of both passengers and staff is absolutely paramount. All incidents are logged, from a brush with a person who may not even stay around to more serious cases, and they are reviewed. The board of the RPA conducts a review every month of all of the incidents and reviews all cases to see if there are trends to ensure further training is not required. Mistakes will be made, perhaps as a result of tiredness or otherwise. We keep under active review the question of whether staff need further training.</p><p>  We discussed the anti-social behaviour on the Red Line at the RPA board meeting yesterday. We are working very actively with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to try to stamp out anti-social behaviour on the Red Line. There are mobile patrols on board to deal with fare evasion and anti-social behaviour. We have a Garda presence on board and continue to provide that over time.</p><p>  Deputy O'Mahony raised the question of funding projects. The future of public private partnership funding is, I hope, bright. All the indications are that we have overcome all the issues. It is the only form of finance we can find at present. It is very difficult for the Exchequer to fund road projects directly. I agree with the Deputy that some of the roads are not up to scratch. The NRA has developed a very sophisticated condition monitoring system to assess the condition of the roads and a review system for the bends and other unsafe areas. As money permits, we gradually work our way through the list of priority safety areas on the national routes. We will spend &euro;380 million this year on 500 individual projects on the national primary roads. While that is a great deal of money, it is not as much as we would like to spend and is not as much as we would have had in the past. As the Deputy knows, the NRA does not have a role in secondary roads.</p><p>  Deputy O'Mahony raised the question of legacy snags, but as I was not aware of the interface problem between the local authorities and the NRA, I must speak to Mr. Fred Barry about it to see if we can find a way to resolve these issues. It does not seem satisfactory that people are being passed from Billy to Jack. That is no way to deal with the public.</p><p>  I share the Chairman's concern about cutting the grass verges. Where public-private companies have been involved in road projects, the grass areas tend to be cut, as this is part of their performance criteria. Where the project is in public control and is one of the areas where we can potentially cut costs, they are not as well maintained as they should be. It can be quite unsightly and this should be looked at, but it is a question of priority. Do we straighten out a dangerous bend or do we cut the grass? I suspect the wisdom of Solomon is required to resolve those issues.</p><p>  I am aware that signage is a hot issue for the committee. A new standard has been adopted by the NRA. I will certainly look at the issue of signage for tourist attractions, because we should be directing tourists to such attractions. We will endeavour to address the signage issue.</p></speech>

His curriculum vitae is very impressive.  What impact are the motorways having on the rail network?  It seems to be much easier to access the major cities by motorway.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-28a.247" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cormac O'Rourke" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2012112800008#G00200"><p>I agree with the Deputy that the motorway network appears to have had an impact on the railways.  The rail service is fine for getting from one city centre to another.  However, it is probably easier to travel by road when going to areas such as west Cork.</p><p>  On the question about traffic projections, as I understand it, traffic increases in direct proportion to GDP and I think everyone got those rates wrong.  Undoubtedly we got the traffic projections for motorways wrong at the time, mostly because everyone, myself included, was over-optimistic about GDP growth rates.  I agree with the Deputy that we would probably get the biggest bang for our buck on climate change through the use of public transport in cities rather than transport outside those areas.  It is also relevant with regard to mainline rail.  My understanding of climate change is that we are a lot closer to our targets but for all the wrong reasons; it is as a result of the lack of growth rather than any proactive actions on our part.  Climate change problems are a result of economic success.  It would be a good problem for the country to have.</p><p>  We are working with the Department in the hope that projects such as the New Ross-Enniscorthy road can be started in advance of the sale of State assets.  Once the issue of the sale of State assets has been resolved - once we know the funding is in place - we would hope to commence in advance of the funds becoming available.  However, I do not have a date for that.</p><p>  I share the Deputy's concerns about visibility when driving on motorways in the rain.  Lorries at speed are particularly dangerous.  I suspect this issue may come under the remit of the Road Safety Authority rather than the National Roads Authority.  I will come back to the Deputy on that.  Anything which reduces spray levels on motorways is to be welcomed.  It is the case that drivers do not slow down in bad wet conditions.  Driving through spray is very dangerous.</p></speech>

Perversely, despite the fact that people drive faster on motorways, they are by far the safest roads in the country.  Visibility is good on motorways.  Speed limits are a policy matter.  However, I do not think the speed limit affects motorway road safety to a great degree because, unfortunately, accidents happen in the main on secondary roads.  I am not convinced that speed limits are the biggest issue with regard to safe driving.  I am not an expert on speed limits.</p></speech>

I was born and reared in Ashford, County Wicklow.  I am married to Jane and we have two boys, Giles and Philip.  All of my working life has been spent in active involvement in the business community of Wicklow town and county.  I have submitted a brief curriculum vitae to the committee but I will deal with some aspects of it.</p><p>  Since 1980 I have been managing director of my own company, Wire Ropes Limited, based in Wicklow town.  The company employs between 20 and 70 people.  The number of employees was 70 in the very best of times but the number is much lower now.  Between 1982 and 1990, I was president of the County Wicklow region of the Federated Union of Employers, now IBEC.  I gained much of my knowledge and information on industrial relations and corporate governance during that period.  We served all companies from Baltinglass to south Arklow and Gorey.  In 1983 and 1984 I was president of the Wicklow and District Chamber of Commerce.  This provided a good opportunity to meet with prospective investors in the Wicklow area and to work with the IDA in attracting new business to the area.  It was a good business experience for me.</p></speech>

I am glad to see a local person running such a company because there is more of a vested interest given that the person is a local and his qualifications are very good.  Also, he has much experience in the job.  In the present economic climate the issue is how to generate more business in the port.  He mentioned some of what is being done in terms of refuse derived fuel, RDF, and scrap metal.  Is he looking at any other areas, such as the leisure industry?  I appreciate there is much going on, such as the annual yacht race, but is there any other area that could be considered?  For example, are there any anniversaries in Wicklow where events could be run to coincide with those?</p><p>  How many people work in the company and what are the general spin-offs?  The tonnage through the port had decreased considerably but is starting to increase again.  What are the spin-offs in terms of the jobs?  If the tonnage level is increased, does it affect the local community or mainly people from outside coming in?  I imagine there should be a local spin-off.  In terms of the size of the port, what is the acreage involved and what needs to be done to modernise the port and would that entail extra costs?  I appreciate that funds are tight but what would be required to bring it up to a certain standard where we could attract in more businesses?</p></speech>

What are its main aims and what does he hope to achieve through that plan in the next five years?  I am delighted to hear that he shares his port facilities with sporting organisations, sailors and motor ski boats.  Is there a speed limit in the harbour and, if so, what is it?  If it is busy, we must think of swimmers who also use it and their safety.</p></speech>

We are always looking for more business.  The larger ports take the largest tonnage in any product.  We are limited to looking for niche markets which I mentioned in my submission such as scrap metal and RDF.  RDF is a new product and about which we are very excited because we expect a minimum of 50,000 tonnes per annum.  RDF is a win-win because it takes pressure off the country generally from the point of view of landfill, as landfill is running out and the European Union is becoming concerned about our reliance on landfill.  Given that millions of tonnes of refuse is going into landfill, a start has been made to put it into RDF.  It is packaged and wrapped four to five times and arrives in a bale, the shape of a glass.  There is approximately a tonne in each bale and a ship takes 3,500 tonnes.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-11-28a.265" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Newsome" time="10:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2012112800011#K00200"><p>The RDF comes from the Greyhound company in Dublin city.   The company packages the bales.  There was initially a slight perfume off them, but the wrapping is solving that problem.  If they get wet, there is a slight problem, but the company has worked on it and it has turned out to be a win-win because the reliance on landfill sites has been reduced.  We are falling into a trap in this regard and will be penalised if we do not scale down the reliance on landfill sites.  The bales go to Germany and Holland where they are incinerated and the energy generated is fed into their national grids.  One might ask why we do not have incineration facilities, but that is a different discussion.</p><p>  With regard to Deputy Dessie Ellis's question about more business, we hope that if there is a levelling off or even an upturn, there will be a return to timber.  We only need approximately 5,000 tonnes to double the current tonnage in the port.  Wicklow Port was one of the biggest importers of timber.  However, we lost one of our plasterboard products as a result of competition from our big brother in town, but we will not complain about competition because we are heavily engaged in it and remain one of the most competitive ports on the east coast.</p><p>  The Deputy asked how many we employed.  We have a chief executive officer who is the harbour master and has a part-time secretary in the office.  We also have a general operative.  They are the directly employed personnel, but most of the people working in the port are from Wicklow and employed by the stevedores who employ people to operate cranes, hoists and forklifts.  A carrier company also employs many people.</p><p>  We work closely with the chamber of commerce which is also involved in tourism and, for example, in developing the old jail in the town.  Wicklow Port is less than 100 yards from the main street and, therefore, close to activities in the town.  That is one reason the expenditure of &euro;1 million on the south quay was a big help to those on the main street because we are able to divert traffic on to the quay and it is a much better organised and efficient service.</p><p>  With regard to our aims for the future, we are still looking for niche products that can be exported in a reasonably good manner from the port.  Like my own company, when there is a recession, sales are down.  On the financial side, no matter how much costs are controlled, there will be no miracles if a company does not retain sales.  That is where we are and competition is fierce.  Not only are we experiencing a recession, everybody else is cutting costs and looking for a slice of the action.  While the port continues to seek niche business, we are under no illusions about the challenge to be faced in the next few years until the economy recovers to a reasonable level.  I am confident that will happen, given the manner in which issues are being tackled.  I do not know that there is much more about which I can assure the Deputy.</p><p>  We continue to seek opportunities with the help of the chief executive officer and the stevedores who are in the marketplace all the time looking for more business.  I am happy and confident that business will pick up, but the secret is when a company is in a depression, that it must look after its cash because it will not get any when it runs out from the banks.  That has been a good policy for my company and I try to use the same criterion as chairman of the port audit committee.  It is not the most popular thing to do to tell others that we should hold on to money until the economy picks up and that we should wait to see how our operating accounts are going.  We should not spend it all in one go and be forced to go to the banks which will say "No".  We would then have to go the Minister who will say he cannot give it to us and the Department will also state there is no money available.  Our policy to date has been prudent and wise in preserving our balance sheet and cash.</p></speech>

Many are of the view that Wicklow Port is an ideal location for a marina, but I have been saying for 30 years that we need investors because the company and the Department do not have the money.  We need another breakwater and a pier.  Then we would be home and dry with a marina, but along the east coast there are more marinas than there are yachts at Malahide, Howth, D&uacute;n Laoghaire and Arklow.  Tiom&aacute;in go mall.  B&iacute; c&uacute;ramach because an oversupply will not give a return on an investment in this area and any private partnership would realise this, but we are open for business and to talking.  We would welcome the opportunity to consider anything on the leisure side in that context.  There are other areas in the leisure sector, but I would be less than honest if I did not say they are unlikely to deliver a great return on investment.</p></speech>

If he had been an adviser to the previous Government, we might not be in our current position.  I understand how difficult it is for small ports, given my knowledge of New Ross and Waterford ports.  It is a challenging time for them to seek new business.</p></speech>

Wales has such a project but it is not related to ports alone.  One should have an open mind on the idea.  There are many reasons for the port authorities in Wicklow, New Ross, Rosslare and Wexford to talk.  The patch seems to be little overcrowded at present and there is insufficient business.  There are too many companies for the amount of business generated.  In Wicklow, we have no illusions about the fact that the challenge is quite serious.  If one does not hold or improve sales, cutting costs, to whatever extent, will not be a magic bullet for anything.  We all know that.</p><p>  Regarding the largest ship size, we take in ships with a capacity of up to approximately 3,000 tonnes.  A dredging programme is planned and we await the decision of the EPA, which must move a little slowly at times, on the improvement of dredging in the harbour.  With improved dredging, we would take in somewhat bigger ships.</p><p>  The River Vartry flows through Ashford, the village in which I live.  I recall the river being flooded and thousands of salmon going up the weir towards Roundwood and spawning.  An agreement was reached whereby Dublin Corporation could take a lot of water to supply Stillorgan and south Dublin.  On the statute, which I was very interested to see, there is an agreement whereby the corporation would assist with the clearance of the river, by way of dredging, from Roundwood to Ashford and into Wicklow Harbour.  If X million gallons of water are taken from the river, the flow is very often reduced to a trickle.  When the water reached the harbour, sluicing was not occurring to the extent that it had been up to 1948.  Consequently, the requirement for dredging is more regular than it was heretofore.  Perhaps it was hardly needed in the past.  I would be very interested in knowing the fate of the plan by Dublin Corporation to assist in the debt associated with clearing the harbour as a result of its taking the water into south Dublin.</p></speech>

The port did not fall into the trap of having significant defined-benefit pension plans.  There are strategic reasons for the low figure.  It is partly due to the age of the personnel.  There is a defined-contribution plan in place, contributed to by the members.  There is no negative aspect to the pension.  We are very lucky in that respect because most pension schemes in port companies and State companies, and many private companies, are in deficit.  There is tight financial control in the company and I am pleased that this will remain the position.</p></speech>

It is interesting to hear the questions asked and the level of surprise among contributors that the company has accounts in balance and that it has no extended debt or pension burden of any significance.  As the chairman designate said, the port has managed to tread the water healthily while waiting for circumstances to improve.  There is a lesson to be learned from that.  Mr. Newsome says it is the best-kept secret.  It certainly is but we just heard of Dublin City Council's best-kept secret, which we will have to investigate.  If the agreement is on statute, it is on statute; it is as simple as that.  We should examine the matter.  The amount of water the council takes from Vartry Reservoir leaves the flow very small at times.</p><p>  Wicklow Port is the only port in the country at which water, rail and road infrastructure meet at one point.  When there is capacity overflow in Dublin, for example, Wicklow is regarded as a handy alternative.  When business is tighter, business tends to be sucked back to the middle.  As Mr. Newsome stated, the port ought to be competitive.</p><p>  I have noticed an increase in the number of fishing vessels landing their catches in Wicklow.  Has Mr. Newsome any figures on that?  Are there any attempts at further development in this regard?  Is there sufficient capacity to generate secondary employment or industry in this area?  I refer to processing and marketing.  A fish retail outlet opened on South Quay in the past 12 or 18 months.</p></speech>

He obviously has an intimate knowledge of the company, having been involved in it for a number of years.  That knowledge is reflected in the issue he raised about the statute and Dublin Corporation.  Perhaps he should put it on the agenda for his first meeting and write to Dublin Corporation and quote the statute.  Dublin City Council is fairly adept at following up commitments itself.  Certainly, we should write to it about it because it is a legitimate issue.</p><p>  Wicklow Port and Arklow Port sometimes remind me of old traditional golf clubs in that there is a particular group that uses them but other people do not know what happens or are afraid to get involved.  I realise that is a quite simplistic view.  However, when Mr. Newsome takes over as chairman he will hopefully have a very progressive board and there is an opportunity for a new beginning, although it is important to acknowledge the work the others have done in the past.  Perhaps a public meeting should be held to change the mindset a little and make people in the broader area more aware, as that awareness is often lacking, of what is there, what the company is doing and that it is open for business.</p><p>  If Mr. Newsome were to pick a single issue that is holding back the development of the port, aside from the obvious one he mentioned about an investor to construct the breakwater and pier, what would it be and what can the committee do to try to assist him and the port company to develop?</p></speech>

However, that is not going to happen.  I am not aware of anything that is holding us back at present.  The stevedoring company protects the company from the point of view that it is not a cost or burden on the company.  It has resolved the employment issue with the dockers.  It deals with that and we do not employ dockers in the port.  The stevedoring company pays the people to drive the fork-lifts, cranes, carriages, lorries and so forth.  It is a very go-ahead company.  There are people who would say it is not able to deal with it because they do not get on with it but that is not my experience.  My experience of the company, especially the stevedores of R. F. Conway &amp;amp; Company Limited, is that they are very co-operative.  They will deal with any new business, niche or otherwise.</p><p>  The statistics from 2007 to 2012 refer to the capacity, which Deputy Doyle mentioned.  We are way down, at about 70% or 80% less, on 2007.  One could take the 2007 figure, multiply it by two and consider that our capacity.  We have a long way to go to get back to the 2007 level and I do not wish to give anybody the impression that it is going to happen this side of the recession being resolved, because it will not happen in that timeframe.  However, as a competitive company, we are ready to pick up once the recession starts to be resolved and if Europe is kind in giving us some money for our bank debt, we should move forward.  I have no doubt that the will and energy are there, and it is my intention to move forward.  My own business, which is in the port area, is a multiple of the size of the port in terms of financials, sales and so forth, but the same principles apply whether one's company is large or small.  As I always repeat, one does not need to be a rocket scientist.  One must control and preserve one's balance sheet and cash so one is not running to the bank, which will more than likely give one a Harvey Smith and say it has no money.  That is my gospel and I stick to that when running my business.</p></speech>
