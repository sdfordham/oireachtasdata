    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-15a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1257" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2017111500002#B00200"><p>All mobile phones should be switched off as we know they cause interference with the recording equipment in the committee rooms even if they are in silent mode.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Tony McLoughlin but I understand he will join us at a later stage when Deputy Madigan leaves to attend another meeting.</p> <p>  This meeting has been convened to consider Committee Stage of the Technological Universities Bill 2015.  The Bill provides for the merger of institutes of technology and for the process of merged institutes to apply for designation as a technological university.  The Bill was introduced in 2015.  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, who has special responsibility for higher education and her officials to this meeting.  I understand she will make an opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-15a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1247" speakername="Mary Mitchell O'Connor" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2017111500002#B00300"><p>This legislation is a high priority for the Government and is important and ground-breaking legislation.  The Bill is seeking to establish technological universities for the first time in Ireland and that constitutes a step change for the institute of technology sector and will underpin the development of a new type of higher education institution.  The Bill had been agreed on Committee Stage previously but following the dissolution of the Thirty-first D&aacute;il my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, undertook to consult with stakeholders on the provisions in the Bill and the rationale for the approach to the development of technological universities.  As part of that process a clarification document was subsequently agreed between the Department, the Teachers' Union of Ireland, TUI, and the Technological Higher Education Association.  TUI members voted to accept the agreement in June 2017 and suspended its industrial action in relation to the development of the technological universities.  A clarification document was also provided to IMPACT as part of this process.  The establishment of the technological universities will strengthen the skills, research and innovation capacity in the regions and support economic and social development.</p> <p>  Before we discuss the amendments circulated for today I would like to notify the committee that I am also finalising additional amendments which I propose to table on Report Stage.  With your permission, Chairperson, and in the interests of ensuring fairness and respect to the committee I will mention them briefly.  I intend on Report Stage, subject to the advice of the Attorney General and Government approval, to bring forward amendments to provide the Minister for Education and Skills with a new power to appoint an investigator to publicly funded higher education institutions.  The provision will also require a consequential amendment to the Long Title of the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-15a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1225" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2017111500002#B00400"><p>I welcome the Minister of State and her officials to the committee today.  I thank the officials for the information they provided when I asked for it.  That is very welcome.  I acknowledge that much work has gone on in recent years to get this right.  I acknowledge the work of the various institutions, the officials, Ministers and trade unions.  The TUI has been key.  It is very important that as politicians we do not interfere in any of the industrial relations matters that pertain to the Bill.</p> <p>  I look forward to going through the Bill in detail.  It is very welcome.  It needs to happen fairly quickly.  The Minister of State mentioned that she will table amendments on Report Stage on the investigators and I fully support that.  There is some resistance from certain people but we think it needs to happen.  However, I would not like to see the Bill delayed because of that.  I got slightly nervous when the Minister of State mentioned the Attorney General's advice and the approval of the Government.  We want to see the Bill go forward and for the institutions that are ready to start moving to make progress.  One institution will be ready to start the process in March.  We do not want anything to hold that up.</p> <p>  Given that the Minister of State is introducing amendments to the Universities Act I will bring forward amendments to allow the Royal College of Surgeons to designate itself as a university within the jurisdiction and not just abroad, as has been the case in recent years.  That is a bit of an anomaly.  I mention that now but it will be for discussion on Report Stage.</p></speech>

The rationale behind the Bill is to strengthen the talent pool in the regions, including Dublin, and that is to be welcomed.  I also very much welcome that the Government wants to treble the number of apprenticeships available.  We are looking at approximately 73 new areas.  I also welcome that there will be 11 major STEM-based projects.  Am I allowed to ask a question?</p></speech>

I had written the Deputy's name down.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-15a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2017111500002#C00300"><p>It is all right.</p> <p>  Like others, I welcome the Minister of State here today.  This is an enormously important Bill for the institutes of technology around the country, for the Dublin Institute of Technology and the Cork Institute of Technology which are two of the larger institutes of technology and where mergers with other institutes of technology have also been part of the proposals.  As someone who worked for a significant period of time as a senior lecturer in the Dublin Institute of Technology, I was heavily involved in the original move to the concept of technological universities and I want to declare my interest.</p> <p>  The issues for the institute of technology sector are that nowadays, the prerequisite is to have something that has very clearly a university status.  The work that is done in the colleges, in terms of allowing access to third level education all over Ireland, is an important social asset in this country but it is also important to employers in terms of identifying people who will have, in particular, not only broad educational development but professional development, for example, in engineering, in accounting and in other specific professional fields.  That has always been recognised as a strong merit point with technological universities.</p> <p>  I want to mention a couple of issues which I hope the Minister of State will address in the course of the discussion on this.  I note there are a number of amendments being put forward on the status of the trade unions in the governance of the university and the students union.</p></speech>

We must get into the specific sections.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-15a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2017111500002#C00700"><p>Yes.</p></speech>

I want to raise the poor terms and conditions under which staff, such as assistant lecturers, are recruited.  As these are the principal prized postgraduate qualified staff in Ireland, the way they are being treated makes no sense from the State's point of view.  As things stand many of them will get up and leave.  They are not being treated in a fair and equal way.</p></speech>

This includes a number of technical amendments required to delete references to certain sections of the Bill that are being deleted due to the change of the process for designation.  Institutes of technology are no longer required to merge in advance of making an application to the Minister for technological university designation.</p></speech>

There were a series of mergers mentioned previously as a possibility.  At this stage, is the Minister of State aware of which institutions continue to seek collective status and which want go-alone status?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-15a.32" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1247" speakername="Mary Mitchell O'Connor" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2017111500002#C02000"><p>First, there will be no go-alone status.  The whole idea is that there is to be consortia.  It is to be that two, three or four institutes of technology are to come together.  For example, DIT, Blanchardstown and Tallaght are interested in coming together as a consortium.  Kerry and Cork are also.  We have been told that Athlone is not interested at present.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-15a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1225" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2017111500002#C02100"><p>Are the institutions being left to their own devices as to whether to decide to go into consortia or is there any incentive or encouragement from the Government or the HEA as to where to go or whom to go with?</p> <p>  My colleague, Deputy Troy, will raise the programme for Government commitment.   We are deleting from this Bill, probably correctly, the specific provisions about Cork and Tralee, and Dublin and Blanchardstown and Tallaght.  That would have given legislative guidance as to what was to happen whereas now we are leaving the institutions to their own devices.  My question is similar to Deputy Burton's.  What knowledge has the Minister of State of where everything is going and what the regions can expect from this?</p> <p>  The high-profile institutes are Dublin and Cork-Tralee.  Even there, people are asking questions about it.  There are a lot of questions about Waterford and Carlow, and doubts have been raised.  There are a lot of questions about the western alliance too.  People are interested.  People value their local institute of technology and in many cases hope for it to become a technological university.  What is the Minister of State saying to those around the country?  Is she organising this or is it the colleges being left to do as they themselves see fit?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-15a.34" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1250" speakername="Robert Troy" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2017111500002#C02200"><p>I am somewhat alarmed at what the Minister of State has said in regard to the proposed mergers and the ability of certain institutions to go it alone.  The programme for Government states:</p><blockquote>Technological Universities<br /><br />The new Government will support the creation of Technological Universities.  These regional institutions will have greater links to industry and will have an enormous impact on our capacity to create and retain jobs in regions.  We will prioritise those institutions with clear ambitions and plans for the furthering of industry-relevant technological research and education.  The requirement of a mandatory merger of existing institutions can be reviewed, if a case can be proven, that for geographical reasons, a merger isn't feasible.</blockquote> <p>That last line is emphasised, underlined and in bold print in the programme for Government.</p><p>I am here very much speaking parochially from the perspective of Athlone Institute of Technology.  Athlone Institute of Technology has sought to go alone.  The reason it has sought to go alone is because of its geographical position in the country and it does not have a natural ally.  I wonder why the clear commitment given in the programme for Government is not being honoured by the Minister of State here today.</p></speech>

For the main part, they have intimated consortia that they would like to be in.  They are not going alone without any support.  Even yesterday, I announced a budget.  They had a budget last year.  There will be budgets built in to support the formation of the technological universities, TUs, throughout the country.</p> <p>  I have met many of the institutes of technology, IoTs, and their management.</p><p>Of course, there are questions.  This is a whole new merger and project.  Of course, there are many questions to be answered and solutions to be found and ironed out when a merger happens.  Deputy Troy asked specifically about Athlone.  It is clearly Government policy to consolidate institutes of technologies in a technological universities sector.  We will be building scale and capacity to make it attractive for students and staff in the regions where the technological universities are located.  Deputy Troy mentioned to me often when I was Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, as did others, that it is very important to have skills and students in the regions.  That is one of the reasons we are strongly working to ensure students have opportunities to gain a technological university education within their region instead of having to move from the places they reside to a certain city and never going back.  We believe it will really strengthen the sector by creating universities.  We were advised by the OECD in 2004 as well as in the Hunt report about maintaining the binary divide.  We are seeking to ensure that consolidated institutes of technology bring students together and create strong universities.  We would have a critical mass of students and lecturers in an area.  That will be an add-on for students.</p></speech>

I have no intention of hogging the committee's meeting this evening.  The Minister of State referenced the Hunt report and another report, both of which were available prior to the negotiations for the programme for Government.  What I read out at the outset was a clear and unambiguous commitment in the programme for Government in relation to the mandatory need for a merger.  The Minister of State has reiterated in her feedback to me that this is no longer going to be honoured.  That is a straight question.  Is the Government rowing back on the commitment given in the programme for Government?  That is my first question.</p> <p>  I agree that there is an urgent need to advance this critical legislation.  That the first amendment is to change its date from 2015 to 2017 indicates the length of time this has been ongoing.  I do not want it to get out there that I am trying to say, "Athlone deserves it".  It is up to Athlone or any other institute of technology to make its case based on the required areas of research and the level of doctoral or equivalent training among its teaching staff.  If an institute does not meet the high test set down, it will not be able to apply for university status.  If it does meet that, however, it should not be prevented.  I am making the case strongly because this was inserted in the programme for Government with Athlone Institute of Technology in mind.  Given its location, there are no nearby institutes with which it can merge.  The only benefit of a merger for Athlone would simply relate to scale and the number of pupils.  It would have nothing to do with the quality of the education being provided.  The Minister of State might clarify whether it is now the Department's position that it is rowing back from the commitment in the programme for Government or if it is something that can be looked at further down the line?</p></speech>

Is the Minister of State suggesting there is a timeline over which she wishes to see this completed?  Is there a transition period and how long is it likely to be?  Is there a numbers threshold?  That might be what affects Athlone.  Does it mean, in effect, that unless an institute is in a consortium or group, it will not have a pathway to university status, notwithstanding the fact that it may meet the other requirements?  This is very important.  As Deputy Troy said, the issue has been around for well over a decade.  It was dealt with in the Houses extensively during the period in office of the last Government.  It is a key issue for students whether they are selecting courses in an institute with the option of becoming a technological university by meeting the requirements in the Hunt report and the others down the years.  That is something very significant and it needs to be clarified.</p></speech>

That is clearly the Government's policy.  We have spoken to many of the institutes.  I refer again to critical mass.  DIT, Tallaght IT and Blanchardstown IT together have approximately 27,000 students.  Further down, it is 13,000 or 14,000.  In the case of Athlone IT, there are approximately 5,500 students, which means we do not have that critical mass for a technological university.  In any event, there must be two or more institutes merging as part of a consortium before we will approve technological university branding.</p></speech>

The wording currently indicates it as a representative body recognised by the institute.  Student unions are currently independent and given a mandate by students, and it is really important for them to have autonomy from a university.  It is similar to a trade union in the workplace that would have autonomy from an employer and be given a mandate from members of the union.  My amendment, which is similar to Deputy Martin's amendment, provides a more detailed indication of what is a student union.  Importantly, it stresses the independence of the union from the institution.  Having it as another representative body "recognised by the institute" is far too vague and I would have serious concerns about what the representative body would be and if students want it to represent them.  Students give a mandate to a student union and want that body to represent them.</p></speech>

My amendment No. 11 would define a student union as an independent body representing students.  The concern is that it must be recognised by the institute to be a student union, as per the Government amendment.  The student union should be an independent body elected by the students, as there is a risk it could be left out of procedures if it is not something recognised by the institute.</p></speech>

I will reserve my position until I hear the Minister of State's comments and a case has been made.  What is the procedure or precedent for this?

In this legislation, is there not an implication that the existing institutions within the institutes of technology travel with the institute to the new technological university?  If a student union already exists, as it does in all the institutes of technology, would it not carry over to the technological university?</p></speech>

The definition also includes a reference to other student representatives bodies, ensuring the definition includes the possibility of there being more than one student representative body in an institution in question.  For example, this might occur for postgraduate students.</p> <p>  In terms of the proposed definition, the entire statement relates to the independence of the student union with no corresponding insertions relating to governance or accountability for the funding channelled to the student union.  We cannot have a position whereby there is not an appropriate balance between autonomy and accountability, particularly when we are seeking to strengthen the governance and accountability framework for higher education institutions.  The officials have discussed this matter with representatives of the Union of Students in Ireland and intend to engage further on the matter, which is important.</p></speech>

There is no point in engaging further if it is already written.  The wording of my amendment and that of Deputy Martin does not indicate there can only be one student union.  It means "an independent body established by students, with a written</p> <p>constitution ratified by students in a referendum".  For argument's sake, there could be two student unions.  This is not about having one body with all the say for students.  The concern is that it is very vague to have it as an "other representative body recognised by the institute".  It does not state that it must be recognised by students, the student union or student bodies.  It does not state what is the representative body.  It is disingenuous to say officials will engage further if the decision is made today as there is no point in engaging further because we will have it in black and white.  Our amendment is more than reasonable.  It would be a progressive addition to the legislation.  We should look to press it.</p></speech>

The technical amendments in this group arise because of the changes to the application process for designation as a technological university.

The main changes that the Minister of State is putting forward here concern the halfway house that was originally proposed.  It was very unfortunate.  I do recognise the work that has been done to allay our concerns and the concerns of many within the sector, the TUI and the institutions themselves that institutions could merge, apply for technological university status and then find they did not get it.  There would have been huge uncertainties there about the status of degrees or other certification and the status of the institutions themselves.  This was a significant point of worry around the time this legislation came through.  For the record, it was a significant point of concern and objection on the part of Fianna F&aacute;il at the time so we are very happy that it is proposed to change this as part of these amendments.  We think this is the right and sensible way to do it.  On that basis, we have encouraged the Minister to proceed with the legislation and agreed to facilitate it so we welcome that and think the framework in the Bill is probably the best way to allow institutions to fulfill their ambitions to become technological universities or to achieve university status.</p></speech>

Does the term &quot;campus&quot; need to be defined in the legislation?  I do not think it is defined.  Many campuses in various regions are very important to people.  There are also campuses that will close down at some point or change when the Grangegorman campus in Dublin opens.  There are some campuses such as Castlebar, part of the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, that I am very concerned to protect.  There are other Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT, campuses that will move to Grangegorman.</p><p>I want some legislative protection for the campuses that it is intended will stay.  I have tried to provide for this in some of my amendments and I will come back on Report Stage with more detail in this regard.  I want a provision in the Bill to the effect that Castlebar will remain part of GMIT, or whatever institution that body would eventually become part of, and any other offshoots around the country.  The regional provision and regional location of campuses in the institute of technology, IT, sector is equally critical in the technological university, TU, sector if an IT is to become a TU.  It is an absolute precondition, a <i>sine qua non</i>, of Fianna F&aacute;il's support for the Bill that not only the regional identity and regional focus, but also the actual physical location of campuses and the multidisciplinary range of courses provided in those various campuses are retained, while obviously not legislating for the exact courses provided in universities.  A little more work needs to go into this, and I think there needs to be a definition of &quot;campus&quot; that acknowledges that some in Dublin are to move to Grangegorman but that others very badly need to be protected and maintained in the legislation.</p></speech>

If, for instance, an institution in some part of the country is on its own and does not have an obvious partner, or has a partner indicated by the Department but does not want to join with that particular partner, will the Minister of State confirm that the institution is free to put forward a proposal to join with an institution, for instance, in Dublin or Cork, even though they may not be in the one region, if it is the desire of those institutions to so merge?  For the sake of example, suppose Dundalk, Athlone or Carlow wanted to join the Dublin technological university.  I know it is a bit of an extreme example, but the Minister of State laid a lot of emphasis on the fact that there must be two or more institutions.  Can those institutions be selected nationally?  I was a little taken aback that in her reference to Athlone IT, which is a significant institution with particular specialisations, the Minister of State implied in her previous statement, as I understood it, that its numbers were not sufficient to merit an application as one of the two or more institutions.  The same may well apply to Carlow IT if, for instance, it were not able to address the ongoing discussions between it and Waterford IT.  When the Minister of State uses the term "region", does that mean there are options with other parts of the country where there are institutions with which they might well wish to be associated?</p></speech>

I would appreciate the Minister of State's response after all Deputies have spoken.  Has anyone else indicated?  Does Deputy Byrne wish to come back in before the Minister of State-----</p></speech>

Obviously, Blanchardstown and Tallaght are not moving to Grangegorman.  They are also a key reason the campuses need protection.  The regional focus applies equally in Tallaght and Blanchardstown as it does in Castlebar and Tralee, etc., and I would like the Minister of State to address that as well.</p></speech>

However, they are dealt with in the strategic plan in section 30 of the Bill.  To clarify, ITs can at any stage be stand-alone or apply to join a TU.  For the record, in case anyone thinks otherwise, I have the highest regard for Athlone IT.  I have visited it not only as the Minister of State with responsibility for higher education, but also in my last role.  In any of the messages I got from industries and businesses that opened in and around Athlone, Roscommon or Mullingar in particular, I heard the highest of praise for Athlone Institute of Technology, so I am a huge fan of AIT.  I did not put the critical mass numbers on the record.  TU4Dublin will be 27,880 students; Munster TU, approximately 13,495: the Connacht-Ulster technological university alliance, 15,910; and TU south east, 14,612.  We believe having a critical mass is really important.  According to the figures for Athlone IT that I have before me, there was a student cohort of 4,890 in 2015-16, while Dundalk's was 4,999.  Our plan is to put the colleges and ITs together and create a critical mass and a choice for students in order that they can go from level 6 right up to doctorate level if they so wish.  As I said, at any stage single ITs can apply for technological university recognition, but they must be a consortium.</p></speech>

Deputy Byrne asked the Minister of State earlier - and I would like it confirmed - whether the Government is actually committing to the retention of all the institutes of technology and the campuses in the diverse locations in which they exist around the country.  For instance, in Blanchardstown, and similarly in Tallaght, the student population is relatively small compared to the mass of DIT.  Many institutions are small but absolutely vital in terms of third level educational access for the people who live in the catchment areas.  For instance, Blanchardstown attracts not just, as one might expect, a significant number of students from the north west of Dublin, but also a very significant number of students from Meath, and that has always been the case.  Therefore, I would like the Minister of State to give an undertaking that the campuses will remain and that there will not be another agenda of slimming down the institutions as a consequence of the merger.  This is a legitimate issue for local areas where, particularly if they are trying to attract foreign direct investment, having an institute of technology or being part in the future of a technological university is a really significant and important draw when trying to attract investment to the area.</p><p>The reason IBM came to west Dublin in the early 1990s was because people like me were campaigning to have an institute of technology, which did happen.  Although small in terms of access to third-level education in the area, it has been very important.</p></speech>

If we think back to budget 2018, we saw the Government gave a commitment of &euro;200 million in public private partnerships to 11 projects in institutes of technology throughout the country, including Blanchardstown.  I am happy there is absolute Government support.  This was the budget where we showed intent and that we are really serious about making sure we bring into the technological sector those institutes of technology that want to do so.  We have also announced further budgets and the largest ever for education.  I want Deputy Burton to understand this and I assure her Institute of Technology Blanchardstown has also been given grants under public private partnerships, which shows our support.  It is real money on the table and real support.  It is not talk.</p></speech>

Diversity of debate and values are key aspects of third level education and I see them as core.  The language used in section 22 outlines the functions of the universities as collaborating with business, enterprise, professions, the community and related stakeholders in the region to ensure that in so far as possible innovation activity and research undertaken by technological universities will reflect the needs of those stakeholders.  This is in direct contrast with the weak language on page 20 on promoting broader aims.  The language regarding critical thinking, diversity, free speech, and the economic, social and cultural development of the State is only &quot;where practicable&quot; rather than &quot;in so far as possible&quot;.  The amendment is to place more emphasis on these being key and core aspects of third level education.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 21 and 25 are fairly self-explanatory.  Amendment No. 21 seeks to include the word "learners" because it is absent from the section and amendment No. 25 seeks to include reference to students and staff.</p></speech>

This wording is already provided for in section 22(k)(iii) of the Bill.  The amendment is therefore not accepted.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 21 proposes to insert a reference to learners into section 22 of the Bill, which deals with the functions of the technological university.  I am of the view that the term "citizens" includes all learners and a reference to flexible means of learning is also of assistance in broadening the reach of the programmes, so we will not accept this amendment.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 25 was submitted by Deputies Byrne and Funchion.  It proposes to insert a reference to learners in section 22.  The section is fundamentally about engagement with external stakeholders.  Staff and students are strongly represented on the governing body and academic council.  Their roles on these structures are provided for elsewhere in legislation.  Therefore, it is not necessary or appropriate to include references here.  Therefore, the amendment is not accepted.</p></speech>

If students and staff are so represented I do not see why we cannot include the words "students" and "staff".  It is literally two words.  It is the same with regard to learners.  Surely one of the main functions of any institution where people learn is for learners.  I do not think these are big asks.  It is only two words.</p></speech>

This is my exact point.  I believe this is weak wording and I wanted to place a bigger emphasis on it as being a core part of the university.  My issue is with the language in section 22(k)(iii).  I knew it was there, but I have an issue with the weakness of the language as I feel it should be a core function of a university.</p></speech>

Committee members have raised good issues, and perhaps there is something to which we could all agree on Report Stage that could be drafted by the Government.  This is what I suggest.  Deputies Martin and Funchion have raised issues.  It is not a function of a technological university in this section to promote gender equity, for example.  I know there is provision regarding gender equality slightly further on.  As far as I know, it is a function of the DIT legislation that gender equity is promoted.  Perhaps someone can highlight it if I am wrong and I would be delighted to hear it.  It is something that has to be included.</p> <p>  There is huge emphasis, and perhaps it is proper emphasis, on business and enterprise and developing an entrepreneurial culture, but there are many courses which do not relate to business and enterprise and a lot of academic disciplines that do not, such as social care, social work and education.  There are many areas.  I am thinking in particular about art and design also.  As far as I know, the institute of art and design would qualify under this legislation to seek to be part of a consortium.  There is art for art's sake, and design for design's sake and they are very important.  They should not necessarily have to be about the needs of business.  There is also culture agus an Gaeilge freisin.  Some of this can be part of a strategic plan, but we need to give more of an emphasis.  The cultural and social development of the State is mentioned, but business and enterprise are emphasised and they seem to be what hits one and what comes out.</p> <p>  There is another amendment in my name and that of my colleague, Deputy Lawless.  My understanding of his proposal, and he is our science spokesperson, is there such a thing as science discovery for the sake of science discovery.  It might not necessarily be directly relevant to a local employer in Blanchardstown but it could benefit the State hugely.</p><p> I have a slight concern with the reference to the community in the region.  I spoke to the officials and they helpfully advised that this wording came from the Parliamentary Counsel.  There seems to be many communities in the regions that these institutions are serving.  That relates to amendment No. 29.  I urge the Government to reconsider that.  The purpose of Committee Stage is for us to go through the Bill line by line but it would be helpful for the Government to at least consider the points we are making and come forward with an amendment on Report Stage which we could hopefully all buy into.  Issues have been raised and the legislation has been lying around, as it were, for quite some time.  There are many functions of a technological university that are not listed or emphasised.  We would be doing well to do that bit of work.</p></speech>

I seek an assurance from the Minister of State on an aspect of it.  The section refers to, "education and training that reflect the needs of citizens, business, enterprise", and so on.  Will she give an assurance that citizens within that meaning include people who are residents of the area as opposed to some precise constitutional meaning of a passport holder.   The institutes of technology have a long tradition of catering for people who are residents of Ireland and who may well one day become citizens.  They may be people who have refugee status, leave to remain in Ireland or another status but they are not technically a citizen.  I seek reassurance that the word "citizen" in this context does not mean a passport-holding citizen of the Republic.  I believe that must be the case because, under European law, these institutions would have to be open to people from other European Union countries.</p></speech>

As we are dealing with new legislation covering higher education and third level learning, we should try to make it the most progressive and inclusive that we should be.  I do not see a major difficulty with the inclusion of words such as "students" and "learners".  I do not see why it would have to be looked at again.  The amendment proposes that the provision would expand to include "those involved with social, community and cultural activities".  I consider that is more than reasonable and that it is being as broad and as inclusive as possible, which is what we should be trying to achieve in all aspects of learning, particularly at third level.  The amendment proposes a few extra words with respect to the Minister of State's own amendment.  I ask the committee to accept this amendment.</p></speech>

I have no difficulty with Deputy Funchion's amendment.  I have an amendment tabled covering the area of science.  The problem is that I am losing track of all of these amendments.</p></speech>

The earlier point I made about communities is relevant here as well.  The Parliamentary counsel may have advised the use of the word "community" but they are communities and perhaps the phrase to be used should be "the diverse communities", which would cover nearly everybody.</p><p>It is almost as if professions, business and enterprise are first, which is perhaps as it should be, but it seems to relegate everyone else.  I do not have a difficulty in this regard.  The only issue I do not want to change are the criteria for selection of the university, which are set out later in the Bill.  It would be unfair to change these.  The proposal in respect of the functions would not affect any of the current plans.  We must get this important section right.  Deputies have different perspectives on the Bill and various ideas will have occurred to all of us.  We have also been lobbied on various issues.  It would not do any harm if the Minister of State were to listen to the points we make, examine the amendments and revert to us with a composite change on Report Stage.  If she listens to the views of the Deputies, we will solve many of the issues that have arisen. </p></speech>

The principle of academic freedom is a defining characteristic of high-quality higher education and research across the world.  The Bill rightly ensures academic freedom will apply in technological universities in the same manner as it applies in universities.  However, it is understood internationally that academic freedom applies to the academic staff of higher education institutions.  Both this and the Universities Act 1997 reflect that understanding.  Extending academic freedom to students would put technological universities in a different position from their peers, both within the State and internationally.  It is believed this would not be appropriate.</p> <p>  In addition, the whole doctrine of academic freedom is based on protecting the security of employment of academics&rsquo; tenure.  As students are not employees, their time in a higher education institution is, by definition, limited.  There are appropriate policies in place in institutions to protect students.  There are separate policies and procedures which govern students&rsquo; rights to expression and to offer them protection in this regard.  This includes the right of free expression.  Any claim that this right is being restricted or the fear that voicing a contrarian opinion would invite academic retribution can be better challenged through the existing charters and policies which set out a detailed process for consideration and redress where necessary.  Such policies and processes have already been agreed with student representatives at local level and have been adopted formally by each of the academic councils.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 54 relates to the suspension or dismissal of a member of staff of a technological university.  This is drafted in accordance with similar provisions which apply to universities, institutes of technology and the Dublin Institute of Technology under the relevant legislation.  It provides that a technological university may suspend or dismiss a member of staff only in accordance with procedures established, following consultation with the relevant trade unions and staff associations.</p> <p>  The purpose of amendments Nos. 151 and 152 is to mirror the provisions contained in the Water Services Act 2014 and the Roads Act 2015, which relate to the terms and conditions of service of staff members.  This wording was sought and agreed with the trade unions and stakeholders during the consultation process.</p></speech>

It would be a bit odd if the Universities Act was different in this regard and I see the Minister of State&rsquo;s point.  I do not see the need for the amendment.  If someone can point me to international examples between now and Report Stage I will reconsider, but the Minister of State has made a convincing case.</p></speech>

A feature of their situation is that they may lack protection because they may not be staff <i>per se</i>or students <i>per se</i>.  Their status is a difficulty for many of these young people.  Adding the word &ldquo;student&rdquo;, as proposed in this amendment, may provide some extra provision for this category of person.  There might be an opportunity to discuss this later, as the Minister of State has agreed to discuss other items.</p><p>It is a technical area.  I worked for a long time as a senior staff member in an institute of technology.  I am concerned at the conditions under which some postgraduates are working, their status and the fact that they may have little protection.</p><p>For example, in regard to campus companies, they may have very little protection in terms of their status.  The Minister of State may be able to reassure us that all of this is accounted for but it is a newer and concerning development in the context of third level institutions.  Will the Minister take a look at this provision with a view to advising us on how student staff will be affected by it because as things stand they tend to have a very low threshold of rights in all the third level institutions?</p></speech>

In my view, it is too complex to provide for this in legislation.  I do not know if it is stated anywhere in legislation that technological universities, TUs, are required to state their policy on academic freedom in their strategic documents.  Perhaps it is in those documents that all these sorts of issues could be thrashed out.</p></speech>

The amendment has the potential to change the overall membership of the body.  Members of the body may be paid allowances in respect of remuneration and expenses as the Minister may determine, therefore any increase in membership could impose a charge on the Revenue and the amendment is therefore ruled out of order.</p></speech>

I have raised some of the points relating to this matter previously.  The word "community" is in there somewhere as well.  The point is that the plans of the technological university, TU, to provide programmes of education and training should meet the needs of citizens - Deputy Burton made a fair point about that word - business, enterprise and the professions.  I am a member of a profession.  Where do the arts and culture, particularly courses not of a business, enterprise or professional nature, fit in?</p> <p>  I will not press my amendment because it includes a flaw but I will speak on it.  In the amendment, I have added in the plans of the TU "to retain, maintain and develop the existing campuses of its applicant institutes including but not limited to its existing programmes of education, training and research".  I have not taken account of campuses that may well be closing in the city of Dublin but I want to ensure that there is some protection for Blanchardstown, Tallaght and the regional institutions.  This is my party's main point.</p> <p>  In this amendment, I am probably too restrictive in the context of the programmes relating to education, training and research.</p><p>I do not want to legislate to retain an exact range of courses as universities should have the academic freedom to provide the courses it wants to provide.  Can the Minister of State assure us that if an institution becomes a TU, a multidisciplinary range of courses will be available?  Can she assure us that institutions such as that in Blanchardstown will not turn into a specialised college for a specialised subject but will be similar to now, with a range of courses provided to meet the needs of the community in the surrounding area?</p><p> Paragraph (g) of amendment No. 64, to which I will return on Report Stage, concerns what we want to be included in the strategic plan.  It is proposed that the plans of the TU will ensure the geographic names of its various campuses are maintained in its nomenclature relating to each campus.  This means the Blanchardstown institution will be called the TU for Dublin at Blanchardstown, with the other the TU for Dublin at Tallaght, similar the TUs in Tralee or Cork.  This is the case for the various campuses of the University of Ulster.  Deputy Lahart raised the issue in respect of Tallaght and pointed out that some people want it to be called TU Tallaght.  That is not going to happen because it is going to be part of one body.  The name "Tallaght" should be retained somewhere, however.</p></speech>

There is a commitment in budget 2018 for &euro;200 million regarding a PPP project in this regard.  The institutions of technology need to come together to decide on a name.  We are not imposing a name but I think it is very important that the different institutes - Tallaght, Blanchardstown, etc. - keep their names.  We want them to progress and we do not want to freeze everything.  I hope the TUs can improve their offers of programmes because we want them to be more attractive.  We want them to be centres of excellence and we want students to choose to go to TUs.</p></speech>

Therefore, the various numerically-based criteria - such as the requirement that at least 4% of students be registered on a programme which leads to an award of at least honours bachelors degree level or research students be registered on a programme which leads to at least masters degree level - are required to be met jointly by the consortium rather than by individual institutions within the consortium.  These amendments are required in light of the fact that applicant institutes will not have merged at this stage in the process, whereas previously they would have had to merge before proceeding to apply for designation.</p><p>Does the Chairman wish me to discuss amendments Nos. 106 and 108?</p></speech>

I have also received well-meaning representations from many academics to change it.  However, I have considered it very carefully from a Fianna F&aacute;il point of view and we are not putting amendments forward.  The eligibility criteria were set down a number of years ago and TUs, in particular the TU for Dublin and that for Munster, have been working towards implementing them and if we were to put amendments down now and they were passed, it would knock the whole thing on its head.  I did not think it fair to change the eligibility criteria though I thank the people who made submissions to my party on it.  It is too late to change it now.</p></speech>

I forgot about those amendments.  They are not to change the criteria but, rather, to consider the internationalisation of the advisory body and ensure that there would be two international suggestions from the HEA and QQI.  As I should have said earlier, that will hopefully satisfy some of those with concerns about eligibility.  The eligibility criteria are very strong but the more the process is internationalised, the more seriously people will take it and the more respect the institutions will attract, which is what universities are all about.</p></speech>
