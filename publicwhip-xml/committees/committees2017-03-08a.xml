I am joined by Mr. Frank O'Connor, who is head of funding and debt management at the NTMA.<br/><br/>I do not intend to read out my opening statement.  If it is okay with the Acting Chairman, I will refer to some of the key points that I reference in it.  We have provided some slides that we use when we are in front of investors around the world talking about the Irish bond market which we thought might be a useful way of drawing out some of the key points that might be of interest.<br/><br/>The key starting point is that our debt, as is well known, is quite elevated and is still standing at &euro;200 billion.  That is four times what it was in 2007.  Although our debt-to-GDP ratio is showing an improving trend and our economic fundamentals are good, nonetheless some of the other key ratios that investors look at do not show Ireland in quite as favourable a light.  I will reference some of those.<br/><br/>As I say, the economic fundamentals are exceptionally good and have been for a number of years.  A particular focus for investors in the bond market is our fiscal position and our primary surplus.  The fact that the household budget is in primary surplus means that, essentially, our debt levels are stable.  That is an important dynamic and an important statistic for investors.  Our credit ratings have also improved and we are now rated in the A category by all of the rating agencies.<br/><br/>In terms of investor demand for Irish bonds, we have moved clearly from being considered a peripheral credit to being what we now consider to be a semi-core credit and we are now trading very much in line with France and Belgium as opposed to some of the peripheral countries when we trade in the market place.  That has been not only talked about in researched reports, but mentioned in the <i>Financial Times</i>a couple of days ago.  That has been the case for the past 18 months or so, and it reflects our strongly improving credit performance.  That has been tested in volatile market conditions and even when negative news hits the markets, Ireland has tended to trade closely to France and Belgium as a semi-core.<br/><br/>Investor demand for Irish bonds has widened and our investor base has widened.  That is particularly important for Ireland.  Ireland is very dependent on overseas investors for its debt.  Ninety per cent of our bonds are owned by overseas investors and that puts us in quite a vulnerable position versus other countries which have higher rates of domestic savings and participation in the bond market.  One of the few ways we can mitigate that is to diversify the investor base by region and by type, and we attempt to do so.  That has been happening.  Our investor base, I am glad to say, has been broadening significantly.<br/><br/>In terms of what we have done in the market in the past couple of years, since 2015 we have issued &euro;27 billion in total at an average yield of 1.3% and an average maturity of 16 years.  Some of the key highlights of that was the refinancing of the &euro;18 billion of IMF debt on which we produced an interest saving of approximately &euro;1.5 billion for taxpayers over the period of four years.  Probably just as important was the replacement of the maturity of that debt.  It was averaging four-year maturity as IMF loans and those were refinanced with maturities closer to 19 years.  By extending the maturity profile, that has also helped to improve the position.  We issued Ireland's first 30-year bond during that period and last year we also issued a 100-year bond at a yield of 2.35%, what was known as a &quot;centenary bond&quot;.  The fact that we were able to do that is a reflection of Ireland's credit but also, and probably more so, a reflection of the extraordinary interest rate environment that we live in, with quantitative easing and the impact that has had on interest rate markets.<br/><br/>This year, we have announced to the market that we will issue between &euro;9 and &euro;13 billion as a target for funding for the year.  We issued a &euro;4 billion 20-year note at a yield of 1.73% earlier this year.  We additionally raised, through a dual-auction last month, another &euro;1.25 billion.  We have another auction tomorrow where we will again announce a dual-auction of ten-year notes and 30-year notes, and the size has yet to be determined.  This dual-auction is something that we have not done for quite a few years but we are finding it very effective, both for accessing pockets of liquidity along the yield curve and smoothing out the benchmark yield curve.<br/><br/>What about the interest bill, which is probably most of interest to this committee and many others?  The total interest annual interest bill is &euro;7 billion at present.  That is down from &euro;7.5 billion and trending towards &euro;6 billion.  We would be very confident about that number.  As to whether it ultimately could go lower and go to &euro;5 billion, that will be dependent on interest rate conditions and markets, particularly over the next three years.<br/><br/>The next three years are an important period for Ireland because there is &euro;52 billion in maturing debt that needs to be refinanced between October 2017 and October 2020.  To put that in context, that maturing debt in the next three years is in excess of the total national debt that existed in 2007.  The interest rate environment, while we are refinancing that debt during that period, will be critical in determining the long-term overall cost of the national debt in terms of an interest bill.<br/><br/>The team is on the road constantly.  Ireland is a very small market, a very small country.  It is less than 2% of the European bond markets.  It is less than 0.5% of the global bond markets.  Even somebody who is an index fund manager does not necessarily have to buy a market such as Ireland.  It is a planes, trains and automobiles job.  The NTMA is on the road and always has been.  That is a core part of the business.  Whether we have a lot to issue or a little to issue, we need to keep the credit story in front of investors and ensure that they are fully aware of the dynamics.<br/><br/>I thought I might go through some of the slides to show the committee what we talk about to investors when we are on the road.  We tried to pick out some of the slides that we thought might be of most interest to the committee.</p><p>The first slide provides a potted history of Ireland's bond yield.  New investors, in particular, need to be able to put the market in context.  Obviously, that history has been pretty extraordinary and I will point to three of the dates we have highlighted to illustrate this.  In July 2011 Irish ten-year bond yields were at 14%, while Irish two-year bond yields were at 24%.  That was at the time we were entering the programme and essentially being shut out of the bond markets.  The next date of note is December 2013 when, following some tough policy decisions and renegotiation of margins, extensions and maturities by the troika, Ireland was gradually able to re-enter the bond markets without a precautionary credit line.  The last date to point to is January 2015.  We can see the considerable impact the announcement by Mr. Mario Draghi of the ECB's quantitative easing programme had on the interest rate markets.  <br/><br/>I wish to talk briefly about quantitative easing.  We spoke about the interest bill being &euro;7 billion annually.  In 2014 the official forecast by the Department of Finance for the interest bill today was &euro;10 billion.  We are now at a figure &euro;3 billion lower than what was forecast only three years ago and on our way to it being &euro;4 billion less.  That is an annual saving against what was forecast in 2013.  How has that happened or from where has the value come?  Obviously, Ireland has been a material beneficiary of the quantitative easing environment.  It is a disproportionately high borrower and a highly indebted nation; therefore, we have been a disproportionate beneficiary of quantitative easing.  Various policy decisions and the improvements in our credit story are obviously major factors too, but we are talking about savings of &euro;3 billion to &euro;4 billion against what the Department forecast only a very short time ago.  There have been significant savings for Ireland in that regard.  <br/><br/>The next slide in our presentation gives members an idea of where we are <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the rating agencies.  It is worth noting that we are now in the single A category for all investors.  That is important because many conservative investors around the world need the sovereign to be in the A category in order for them to be able to invest.  An A rating opens up additional pools of capital to us.  Moody's, the last rating agency to bring us into that category, rated Ireland as sub-investment grade as recently as January 2014.  We have, therefore, made quite a move in a very short period.<br/><br/>The next slide illustrates the gross national debt composition.  I will not go into detail on it now, but I will be happy to answer questions about it later.  <br/><br/>The next slide deals with the evolution of the national debt.  We are stabilising at a point just above &euro;200 billion.  That is the forecast for the next few years.  However, I cannot emphasise enough the extent to which our stock of debt increased from 2007 up until today.  It is four times larger than it was in 2007.  There are very few countries in the world the national debt of which increased by that multiple during the same period.  That is the real legacy of the crisis and that debt position still leaves us quite vulnerable.<br/><br/>The next slide refers to some of the key fundamentals in terms of fiscal out-performance that have encouraged investors, as well as the rating agencies, to re-rate our bonds.  Investors have actually been ahead of the rating agencies in re-rating Ireland in the semi-core from the periphery.  In terms of the general Government balance and the budget deficit, we have outperformed the European targets every year for the last six years.  As members know, we are on target to close that gap and go into surplus by 2019.  The next graph emphasises the primary surplus, which is the Government's budget without interest costs and a figure on which investors focus.  Debt as a percentage of GDP is a figure to which the market refers very often and our position in that regard has been improving significantly and smoothly owing to our stronger growth levels.  It is driven by GDP growth rather than by the debt changing; therefore, it does not change the stock of debt as such.  It just changes the position relative to GDP.  Obviously, when we had the distortion of GDP, it caused people to look for other indicators.  We have the GNI* and the working group chaired by Governor Lane which will be very helpful in that regard.  That said, investors have always looked at a number of other indicators.  At what are investors looking?  They can see that our stock of debt is high and need to determine our ability to repay them and refinance our debt.  They are the data for which they are looking.  Obviously, GDP growth is a key indicator in that context.  <br/><br/>The next slide contains a number of tables in which Ireland's position does not look so good, on a relative basis, in terms of debt-to-GDP.  Members should focus on the two middle tables which show Government debt to Government revenue and interest to Government revenue.  As only Greece and Portugal rank ahead of Ireland, we still have a long way to go, being the third worst performing country in Europe in both categories.  The tables are a better indicator of our vulnerability.  From our point of view, we want to stress the fact that Ireland is still a very indebted country.  While the interest rate environment has allowed us to refinance and lower our interest bill, the stock of debt is still very high.  It is at a very significant level.  We must bear this in mind.<br/><br/>The next slide shows the actual interest bill.  The point I made about the forecast is illustrated in the graph in red in terms of where we were forecasted to be and where we are now.  The interest bill is beginning to decline and headed towards &euro;6 billion.  On the back of the refinancing and fundraising done to date, we can be confident that we will get to the figure of &euro;6 billion, but whether it will be any lower will depend on the interest rate environment in the key period of the next three years.<br/><br/>I now invite my colleague, Mr. Frank O'Connor, to go through the next three or four slides.  He is the person on the road with the team, so to speak, and better equipped than me to talk members through the next section of our presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-08a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank O'Connor" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017030800002#C00200"><p>I will be as brief as I can.  The next slide shows the breakdown of our investor base.  It shows the last eight syndicate transactions where we launched a benchmark bond of a particularly large size, that is, transactions that were bigger than an auction, going back to 2013.  It illustrates the point made by Mr. O'Kelly about how dependent we are on overseas investors.  If members look at the right hand side of the graph, in terms of geography, about 87%, on average, of participants in the syndicate transactions were overseas investors.  On the left hand side of the graph we have tried to provide a breakdown of the types of investor involved.  The good news for us in that context is the evidence of the quite diverse real money accounts back in the market.  Members will have noted in some of our press releases the size of the order book and the fact that the number of orders was over 200.  In that sense, we were not reliant on ten or 11 large clients.  Members should note that the term "central banks" does not refer to ECB quantitative easing but to other central banks buying our debt.  We are talking about what I would call a much healthier, real money account base of long-term debt holders like pension funds and central banks.  The graph gives a description of what the situation has been like in the past few years.</p><p>Beyond that is the maturity profile.  I will not delay on it, but I will make a point about the various colours used.  Pre-crisis, there was just one colour of Irish Government bonds.  Obviously, it excluded our retail debt.  As there is now official sector debt, there is a multitude of colours.  The task for us over time is to find a home among traditional investors for that official sector debt, which entails EU money, the last remnants of the IMF money, bilateral loans, etc.  It could be up to a magnitude of &euro;70 billion.  We have bought ourselves time, which is good news, but we must be mindful of this.</p><p> I will not stop on the next slide.  It is included for members' convenience and shows the actual numbers per category as opposed to graphically.</p><p> I will conclude on the last slide.  It repeats the maturity profile on the left-hand table and the average life of debt portfolios in Europe on the right-hand side.  Look at the clear white bars which show large redemptions.  That is what we have been doing in recent years.  It is debt we have already repaid to reduce our funding profile.  The red is where we have been lengthening the portfolio.  The significant reductions in 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 primarily relate to IMF repayments.  When we repaid the IMF early, the debt only had, on average, four years of life left.  As Mr. Kelly mentioned, we funded to 17 or 18 years, on average, through a 30-year bond.  We took that opportunity, not only to save interest, but also to go further out the yield curve to improve the profile.  In addition, in recent years we have been buying back some short-dated bonds on a bilateral basis.  We have probably bought back &euro;2.5 billion worth of bonds in that regard and switched them to longer maturities.  We have made progress.  The figure a couple of years ago was &euro;70 billion in redemptions, but now it is down to approximately &euro;52 billion.</p><p> The right-hand side of the slide shows that the average life of Ireland's debt portfolio is one of the longest among our European peers.  This is on foot of the negotiated extensions in Europe, plus what we have been doing in the market in recent years.  It has left us in a healthier space such that we are not a hostage to refinancing risk in any one year, notwithstanding the fact that a couple of large maturities are approaching.</p></speech>

The slides helped.  I have three questions, although the delegates have answered one of them.  There is a likelihood that the State will sell 25% of AIB in the short term and the understanding is the proceeds of any sale of bank stock would go towards reducing debt.  Have the delegates any comment to make on this?  In what manner would they like to see the stock disposed of?  I am not asking whether they approve of it officially, as they would not comment in that way, but will they make an overview comment on the matter, including the potential impact on the debt?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-08a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor O'Kelly" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017030800002#D00500"><p>I would not like to comment on the AIB initial public offering, IPO, process, but it is well known and the Minister has stated that the proceeds will be used to pay down debt.  That is the expectation of investors in the marketplace and any material deviation would cause them to rethink and take time to pause.  I cannot speculate on what the impact would be.  Given that investors loaned Ireland money to help to resolve the banking crisis by putting money into banks, it is not unreasonable for them to expect money to come back to them in debt repayments.

The market buys and owns Irish bonds based on the expectation of forecasts of economic activity and growth, statements of Government policy and the likelihood of X, Y or Z happening.  Many investors consider Ireland's net debt position.  They look at its gross debt and assets, including its holdings in the banks.  They subtract them and arrive at a net debt position which they analyse <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>counterparties in any credit decision.  The credit agencies are the same, in that net debt is one of the metrics they consider.  People have subtracted the banks' holdings in arriving at the net debt figure.  Since the degree to which investors are dependent on this for their decisions to invest in Ireland varies widely, it is difficult to say one way or the other.  They do not all speak with one voice.  However, a material deviation would have negative implications for Irish credit yields and credit spreads, but I would have no way of quantifying it.</p></speech>

We heard a fascinating presentation on it last week when the Governor of the Central Bank and the director general of the CSO attended the committee.

It will be another indicator and there are many indicators that investors consider.  Debt-to-GDP is one of many indicators that display the health and vibrancy of an economy.  Investors and credit agencies look for indicators of a country's ability or lack thereof to repay debt.  As for getting hooked on one particular statistic or number and believing that is all investors and credit agencies consider, they are instead looking under the bonnet and way past these numbers to all sorts of additional micro-element.  It is slightly unhelpful that debt-to-GDP is not an historical statistic that we can use as reliably as we could in the past, but that is more of an inconvenience rather than dramatic in terms of how it would affect people's investment behaviour.</p></speech>

We are asked questions about whether we are worried about Brexit, Grexit, Frexit and Trump and whether we have contingency plans, but we have none for any of it, the reason being that we are in the permanent contingency business.  Ireland is a small country that depends on overseas investors to borrow a large amount of money.  That makes us extremely vulnerable to potential external events, some of which we might be able to predict like Brexit or are already in the public domain.  More than likely, something we have never even discussed will come around the corner and be a surprise.  When a country has a small, open economy like Ireland, has a high level of debt and depends exclusively on international investors to lend the money to fund it, it is in the permanent contingency business, full stop.  One can do a number of things to mitigate this such as ensuring one has cash and access to it in terms of short-term funding.  Currently, there is &euro;9 billion in cash on the books and additional access to very short-term cash.  One can diversify the investor base by geography and investor type.  One can diversify the product base by, for example, introducing index-linked, green bonds and other securities, as we will look to do in the future.  One ensures the maturity profile is as smooth as possible and that one's debt is as long as possible.  These are the only mitigants a small country like Ireland can put in place.</p><p>We spend most of our time assuming that something awful is going to happen and that is what we are paid to do.  We are asked to ensure that we are protected and that we are able to access markets notwithstanding the conditions.  I do not want trivialise Brexit, Grexit or anything else, but my experience would say that it is more likely to be something we have not thought of and that, therefore, we must have a permanent contingency plan in place that will allow us to withstand things we have not even envisaged as of yet.</p></speech>

The term "leprechaun-proofing" has entered the lexicon.  It is obviously in response to the inflated GDP figures last year.  We discussed it at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts late last year.  The GNI*, on which Mr. O'Kelly says he is not an expert, is a new key indicator that is being looked at by the Central Bank and others in terms of having a better indication of real production levels out there and a real measurement of the economy.  While Mr. O'Kelly trivialised that somewhat, is it not true that whatever indicators or measurements we come up with, the only one that matters in respect of the application of the fiscal rules - which is what we must concern ourselves with here in terms of a budgetary process - is GDP?  Is that Mr. O'Kelly's understanding?</p></speech>

The GDP ratio versus debt is how we measure the fiscal space and, consequently, apply the fiscal rules.  That is an important distinction because it relates to our work in terms of how much money will be there for us to invest in the economy in future years.</p> <p>  How sustainable is the debt?

How does it evaluate risk?  Debt is either sustainable or it is not.  If it becomes unsustainable, the NTMA needs measurements and processes in place that allow it to make a judgement on whether debt is sustainable, unsustainable or somewhere in between.  When the NTMA carries out its risk analysis, what does it specifically do?  How does it evaluate whether or not debt is sustainable or unsustainable?</p></speech>

That is the mandate that has been given to us so when we carry out our risk analysis - between 60 and 70 people in the NTMA spend all of their time doing this - we are trying to work out access to markets, the price of that access and how we can best optimise our ability to raise money in the marketplace at the lowest possible interest rate.</p></speech>

It relates to how we can ensure that when we come to the market, we have the freedom to decide that we are not bound to go to one place on the U-curve or one group of investors who could then charge a higher price.

I do not mean to underplay the materiality of the numbers.  Essentially, if one looks at the 2007 figure of &euro;47.2 billion and the figure of over &euro;200 billion, that is an increase of approximately &euro;160 billion in the debt during that period.  In the region of &euro;60 billion was due to the recapitalisation of the banks, while &euro;100 billion was due to the operating budget deficits we ran during that period when revenue fell and we had to finance those deficits over that three or four-year period.  Of the &euro;60 billion that was borrowed to go into the banks, about &euro;30 billion is likely to come back and &euro;30 billion is unlikely to come back.  Therefore, a net effect of approximately &euro;30 billion of the increase in the debt, from &euro;47 billion to &euro;200 billion, will be due to the banking crisis.</p></speech>

In the context of look-back exercises, it is the view of the Comptroller and Auditor General that we do not evaluate whether or not we get value for money for PPPs.  This is matter being re-examined because of the limitations regarding the fiscal rules.  There is a debate - we will get to it in a moment - about whether there needs to be greater flexibility in respect of capital spending.  One of the things that is being looked at is possibly making greater use of PPPs.  Before we embark on that journey, it would be beneficial for us to look at how effective we have been up to now in respect of PPPs.  Does the NTMA have a level of oversight in respect of that?  What is the NTMA's role regarding PPPs?

I would welcome more value-for-money exercises around looking back at PPPs.  There has not been a huge amount of historic data in respect of being able to measure direct procurement versus the PPP model but there is enough now.  I would welcome it with regard to any of the PPP projects.  I am quite comfortable that value for money exists.  The public sector benchmark is set quite stringently with the sponsoring Department at the outset.  Any PPP must meet that benchmark in the first instance so it must be cheaper.  When the first procurement is done, the figures must be below that public sector benchmark which has been set by the sponsoring Department.  At the financial close, which is normally 18 months later, it must be retested to ensure that it meets the public sector benchmark.  In my opinion, PPPs have more stringent public sector benchmark accountability than direct procurement.  That is my personal view.  It is not our role, but I would welcome the Comptroller and Auditor General or somebody else looking back to demonstrate that value for money for was obtained.  I would be very confident it would be discovered that value for money exists in PPPs.  There are times when PPPs are good value and worth pursuing and times when they are less good value.  They are not always good or bad.</p><p>I am not an apologist for public private partnerships, PPPs, in any way.  I am as interested as is the committee in how to procure and get infrastructure built in the optimum way for the taxpayer.  When is it worth turning up the volume on PPPs and doing more of them?  When is it worth doing fewer?  An environment where balance sheet restrictions exist, infrastructure requirements are significant and interest rates and the cost of PPPs in nominal terms and even in relative terms are low, is an environment where PPPs should be looked at as something we could do more of.</p></speech>

It goes on to talk about energy, transport and water.  Ireland is cited as one example where it is displacing Government spending.  The reason for that is the limitations of the fiscal rules.  This is one way around it because we cannot get around the flexibilities.  Some of us are concerned about that if we are seeing more privatisation of funding for basic infrastructure.  It is quite cheap for the State to borrow now, as Mr. O'Kelly said himself.  NewERA was before the Joint Committee on Future Funding of Domestic Water Services and said that it had borrowing for water provision built into its programme up to 2021.  It is actually cheaper for the State to do it.  That is what I am talking about.</p></speech>

It is a point that was made to us by the Minister when he appeared before the committee and we asked him about the fiscal rules and flexibility.  He said that would be dependent on whether we get support for changes from within the European Union.  We will have to look at greater use of PPP in the absence of that.  I ask Mr. O'Kelly to be conscious that, if we are looking at greater use of PPP, it could be more expensive and I have given the examples of where it is cheaper for governments to borrow at the moment.  I also ask him to be conscious of the Comptroller and Auditor General's concerns, notwithstanding Mr. O'Kelly's personal view of value for money.  He is the Comptroller and Auditor General who audits value for money and if he has concerns, as Mr. O'Kelly has acknowledged, those concerns need to be taken on board.</p></speech>

He said at the time that he was not resourced appropriately to do so and he would like to do so himself.  We have all agreed that it is a good thing to do.  We would all like to see it done.  That is an issue for the Comptroller and Auditor General, not for me.</p> <p>  Let us talk about PPPs for a second.  I am not saying that one is exclusive of the other.  Channels have to be kept open.  Infrastructure has to be built.  Not all projects are suitable for PPPs.  Larger projects tend to be more suitable for PPPs.  What is the cost?  What is being paid?  We can currently borrow money in the market directly at just over 2% for the period of a 25-year project, which is the length of most PPPs.  Approximately 4% to 5% in total in debt and equity is going to be paid in an all-in cost to the State for PPPs.  That is what it will pay in private capital.  It is 2% to 3% higher than what we could get over that 25-year period.</p> <p>  What are we getting for that money?  Is that good value?  We are getting the infrastructure built, managed and retained over that 25-year period, and returned to the State in a state that gives it a 20-year life-cycle from that point.  The committee has to decide whether that is good or bad value.  I think it is time to have more PPPs when rates are this low, the requirements are so great and the balance sheet restrictions are so significant.  I am not saying we should have entirely PPPs, but maybe 20%, 10% or 15%.  That is more than we normally do.  They are circumstances which make that an environment where more might be done.</p></speech>

I am only making the point that if we are examining a greater use of PPP only because of restrictions which are in place, then it is a valid argument that we should do that, because there are restrictions.  It should not take away from one of the issues which this committee is looking at, which is the need to get greater flexibilities for capital spend.  That would give us a greater choice.</p></speech>

There is not much choice at the moment.  We have very little capital spend because of the limitations of the fiscal space.  This year's budget is going to be worse because we have carry-over costs, reduced fiscal space and even though we can smooth capital spending, it is still going to be quite low.  The choices are quite limited.  I make that point more for this committee than for Mr. O'Kelly.</p></speech>

That private capital is quite cheap in absolute and historic terms today.  In our opinion, risks of interest rates are asymmetric.  They may stay low for a very long time.  They may still be like this in 20 years' time.  Future taxpayers may be able to borrow money at today's levels but the risk of them going higher versus going lower or staying where they are is asymmetric.  Therefore, it is my humble opinion that we should lock in more capital rather than less while able to at the current extraordinarily low rates, which they are by any standards, because the risks are asymmetric.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Kelly stated that NTMA is seeking to issue between &euro;9 billion and &euro;13 billion in bonds over the course of the year.  He said that it got 2017 off to a positive start, raising &euro;4 billion from the syndicated issue, the 20-year bond.  I notice NTMA's achievements in the past few years.  It successfully raised close to &euro;27 billion in long-term debt at a weighted average yield of just over 1.3% since the start of 2015.  It repaid the IMF loan facility of &euro;18 billion.  We saw the first ever issue of the 100-year note, which saw us borrow &euro;100 million at a yield of 2.35%.  The NTMA has those achievements but, overall, Mr. O'Kelly has rightly given a very sobering account of our national debt for this committee of all committees.  The global size of that and the percentage of debt compared with our general Government revenue is almost frightening, in a sense.  It puts the committee and the proposals that we would make for budgets and so on under intense pressure.</p> <p>  The period of 2019 to 2020 seems to be a very dangerous time for NTMA and this State in the sense that a quarter of the debt, &euro;50 billion, has to be refinanced between 2018 and 2020.  Other colleagues have mentioned the grave uncertainty that we are in.  We seem to be in a fundamental watershed period of history and therefore we are vulnerable.  Would it therefore be appropriate to refinance as much as possible of the burden that is hanging over us in 2019 and 2020, and get on with it while the waters are relatively calm?  Concerns have been raised that with Brexit and other issues, we could have a perfect storm again, like in 2009, and the agony that we have suffered since then.  Is there not a huge case for doing something as soon as possible to refinance that huge burden?</p></speech>

I will let Mr. O'Connor take this question since he has been more actively involved in it.  This number was &euro;70 billion not so long ago, and it is probably more accurately based on what we have already done.  In the background, it is getting towards &euro;40 billion of its full obligation.  We are looking at the interest rate markets, and notwithstanding surprises or whatever economic shocks might come, quantitative easing, QE, exists, the European Central Bank, ECB, is anchoring rates very low and investor demand and pools of capital are there.  While it is important to show that we still have elevated levels of debt, the way the market is structured gives us confidence that our ability to finance and refinance at relatively low rates is still quite strong.  Does Mr. O'Connor want to add anything there?</p><p>Exactly that.  It is correct to say that despite the progress, it is still substantial.  However, nearly everything for a number of years involved having our minds set on those particular dates.  To go back to the IMF point, the extension was deliberately issued as longer.  None of our recent auctions of syndications has tapped into that part of the curve.  They are always longer.  In addition, we have bilaterally, on occasion, switched with primary dealers and bought back a couple of billion in these short-dated bonds and switched them for longer.  We continue to work on that.</p><p> I do not know if members saw it in the material, but at the end of last year we were holding &euro;9 billion in cash and have already done &euro;5.25 billion pretty early this year.  We have another auction tomorrow.  Our target is to end the year with more than &euro;10 billion in cash.  We carry that into that cycle so that while &euro;52 billion is the formal redemption requirement, we are already down at close to &euro;40 billion in our minds.  As such, quite a lot has been done already.  In addition, members might be familiar with the floating rate notes the Central Bank holds.  While it is a matter for the Central Bank to decide what to do with them, we have bought back &euro;6 billion of those over the past few years.  They are bonds that will be sold in that period also.  Dealing with some of that, which is due to come out, is also helpful in terms of what might be happening in the marketplace.</p><p> Quite a bit has been done and we are very mindful of it.  We look at it first in terms of getting the liquidity.  Refinancing the debt is one part, including the price at which one refinances it.  Other defence mechanisms are about getting access to the liquidity notwithstanding price.  If one looks at our maturity profile, we deliberately left 2021 quite empty, so to speak.  It is some official sector debt.  At the end of 2015 and in 2016, people were asking us for a five-year bond but we deliberately did not issue one to mature in that year because it can be a defensive mechanism.  While there are large volumes to be rolled in 2020, one could issue some short debt into 2021 and then have a normal year as well.  One could do a bit of both.  In addition, it should not be forgotten that the bonds will not all mature on the same date in 2020.  There will be a couple of bonds.  We are watching it in terms of access to markets' liquidity and price.  As such, quite an amount has been done as we have indicated.  Some people might question why we have one of the longest average lives but we have been doing that with the deliberate view that these are larger redemptions compared to other parts of our yield curve.</p><p> What we do is very much of a long-term nature.  To show members how far back these things were thought of, I give the following example.  Ireland sought extensions in the European loans twice.  I remember during the second extension when Portugal was asking for the same, the initial negotiations or conversations were on rolling the debt for a few years.  However, we actually used that profile front and centre to argue that it would just create a bigger problem as we started to enter this period to put the official sector debt in a short maturity.  As such, we now have the European loans going out to the 2030s and 2040s.  That was done with a watchful eye on the redemptions to which the Deputy referred.</p></speech>

He always seemed to have quite a nice kitty somewhere.  He was like the mother of the household and always seemed to have &euro;20 billion or so on hand even going back to the early days of the crash.  Does the NTMA have a standard amount in that regard?  Mr. O'Connor said the NTMA hoped to have &euro;10 billion of offset.</p></speech>

We were at 12 to 15 months.  As a rule, we have a six-month minimum requirement.  While in the next six months, we do not have a big requirement, nevertheless we hold a lot of cash.  It is just a minimum as things have improved.  To go back to giving an example, we had &euro;9 billion in cash at the end of last year and already have &euro;5.25 billion.  The Exchequer borrowing requirement for the first few months of the year was actually positive because it is not linear.  It is seasonal in nature.  We have a bond redemption in October, so that is, effectively, funded.  As such, approximately &euro;6 billion in October 2017, which is in the &euro;52 billion figure, is funded.  If one thinks about it, we said &euro;9 billion to &euro;13 billion.  We only need this year, if one takes this year on its own, the &euro;2.2 billion Exchequer borrowing requirement and &euro;6 billion bond redemption.  As such, we have already allowed for the growing of our cash balance into this period and are probably ahead of ourselves this year.  That is in the mindset.  To go back to the Deputy's point about the buffer, we keep a substantial cash balance.  At the end of February, it was close to &euro;15 billion and at the end of the year we are targeting it to be in excess of &euro;10 billion.</p></speech>

The effect has been to anchor short rates but also to flatten yield curves and keep longer rates allowing countries like ours to access longer-dated borrowings and improve the profile.  That has been the significant benefit.  Ultimately, it has to stop at some point.</p></speech>

We will continue to be a very significant beneficiary of it.  At some point, one has lengthened one's maturity.  For us, initially, it gave us the opportunity to lengthen the maturity, issue 30 years and have a disproportionate interest in going longer.  Now, we have the luxury of having a 12-year average, which is one of the longest maturities in Europe, and that means when we come to auction, we want to go to the cheapest place on that particular day at that particular time.  It gives one the luxury of getting oneself into that position whereas at the beginning of 2015, one just needed to lengthen the maturity and get some longer dated debt.</p></speech>

As such, &euro;3 billion to &euro;4 billion per annum is the interest saving, which must be due to the interest rate environment in which we have been able to refinance.  That has been driven largely by QE.  However, it is also due to the policies adopted by governments and decision makers at the time, including Deputy Burton, which improved the credit story and the fiscal position for Ireland.  We saw our credit spread narrowing against Germany and moving into that space.  That had much more to do with our fiscal position than with Mario Draghi and interest rates.  That is Ireland as a creditor moving from the peripheral category with Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece to the category with France and Belgium, where it is today.  That is really more about Ireland, its credit story and the fundamentals.  That is the credit spread narrowing from 140 to 150 base points over Germany to where it is now at 70 or 80 points above.  The rest of it is more about the absolute level of rates, which have come down.  That is more to do with QE.  It is very difficult to break it out but we have been a very big beneficiary.</p></speech>

One is that our demographics are rather different from those of most other European countries.  In the long run, that is very much in our favour.  In other words, we have many young children and a much slower rate of ageing, although that will come into play by 2050.</p><p>We have a much lower rate of aging than most other European economies.</p><p> The biggest difficulty we have is the lack of infrastructural capital development, obviously including housing.  In Mr. O'Kelly's view, how do we leverage our current quite positive position, assuming quantitative easing, QE, and no great disruptions in the euro?  How can we manage the capital investment programme at the level we require for our population and to continue to be attractive to foreign direct investment, FDI, while developing sustainable Irish businesses at SME and larger scales?  I would see those challenges as being really difficult.</p><p> In the context of Brexit, we hear a lot of discussion of the potential for certain offices to move here, possibly to the IFSC.  There is a real bottleneck as regards housing, however, as well as in our overall transport infrastructure.  I am not going to go on about broadband but that is a further difficulty.  We also have targets in respect of environmentally appropriate actions.  What would Mr. O'Kelly's advice be as to how we should pitch the capital investment targets that I think we really need to meet those challenges?</p></speech>

In theory they have bags of money there.  In practice, it is "not for giving out to you lot" because there is some point or other on which we do not hit perfection.  I understand it is out there in the market and has to get returns, not unlike the NTMA.  However, we really have this investment gap.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-08a.75" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor O'Kelly" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017030800002#H00400"><p>In our position, borrowing more money is not a strategy that we would recommend.  It is not really a good idea to borrow more money because interest rates are low.  It is like saying to a household that it should go down to the bank and borrow more money, even though it has a big mortgage and credit card bills and a leased car in the driveway.  That is the kind of situation we are in.  It is difficult for us to suggest borrowing more money, even for capital spending, even though at some point the market will look more favourably on that.  When our debt levels get down further in two, three or four years' time, that is going to become a legitimate option for us and the reaction from the market will probably be quite sanguine for capital investment.  We are still just a bit too elevated for that.</p> <p>  There are the other parts of the NTMA that have a remit that is potentially more relevant - first of all the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF.  I was not around when the ISIF was set up but, to me, that was an enlightened legislation from the Oireachtas.  On an international scale, the limitations of monetary policy are now becoming obvious to everybody.  There is therefore a need for fiscal stimulus to be added, yet countries are already indebted.  Ireland, through the creation of the strategic investment fund, having moved the mandate from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, to focus on Ireland only, has a fiscal mechanism for investment that is pretty unusual.  Many European countries are looking at that now with some degree of envy.  It is a very powerful vehicle.</p> <p>  As the Deputy is aware, &euro;2.6 billion has already been invested by the ISIF in a variety of investments across the country, creating 19,000 jobs - 60% of them outside of Dublin - in all sorts of sectors.  Most importantly, as we always co-invest, the multiple of investment, which we expected to be twice what we put in, has turned out to be about 2.6 times.  We are talking about &euro;7.2 billion being invested because of the ISIF investment of &euro;2.6 billion.  It is an &euro;8 billion fund which gives great capacity still; our pipeline of projects is about &euro;2 billion in value.  That investment can be targeted at infrastructure in all sorts of ways, depending on where the requirement is.  Housing is obviously a big requirement.  There is &euro;550 million dedicated to housing.  There are platforms like Activate Capital, Ardstone or the DCU campus.  Some &euro;54 million was put into a DCU accommodation campus by the ISIF, which released another &euro;150 million from the European Investment Bank, EIB, for an overall campus development.  That is the kind of impact and investment that can be made by the ISIF.  We have a very powerful vehicle there.</p> <p>  Obviously, ISIF has to make off-balance-sheet investments, so it has to be commercial.  We have a mandate to have what we call a double bottom line, that is, a commercial return plus economic impact.  We work with investment partners and co-investors, which again helps keep our activities off-balance-sheet by demonstrating commercial capability.</p> <p>  The Minister has asked us to look at the housing area and social housing in particular.  In the investments we have made so far, there is a pipeline of about 8,000 residential units which are being built and will be completed.  There is potential for another 8,000 units in other platforms and investments that ISIF is currently considering.  It is a long-term fund.  Although the impact is not as immediate as any of us would like, the ISIF really can create long-term sustainable infrastructure investment to help solve some of those problems.</p></speech>

I do not think the housing market will really recover until such time as we have affordable housing for which, say, the likes of some of the NTMA's junior employees might be in a position to get a mortgager, even in the Dublin area where the price is somewhere from &euro;350,000 to &euro;550,000.  I just don't see that happening in any serious volume at the moment.</p> <p>  What the Irish market lacks is volume.  We have a lot of housing projects.  While that is all very good, the volume in terms of numbers relative to demand needs to be improved.  There is pent-up demand from the ten years since the economy crashed.  Some of the people who got their jobs ten years ago and are now in their early to mid-30s, maybe even older and, even though they might be public servants with lifetime jobs or people in stable, strong sectors, they cannot find houses to buy.  I think everybody here would know people desperately scrambling to get mortgage approval.</p> <p>  Is there anything that Mr. O'Kelly believes would generate volume in the Irish market?  I am thinking in particular of levels of affordability, which obviously vary in different parts of the country.  I am also thinking of what people like the social housing authorities, say, are doing.  They are talking now about affordable rent, as well as traditional life-long social housing tenancies.  The volume is not there.  A further issue is the fact that the housing associations are minutely small, given the numbers required.</p><p>If one looks at housing associations as they developed in the UK, their numbers are much greater.  Does the NTMA follow the housing market?  I know the NTMA has a lot of analysts working with it.

If one is talking about realising a price of that magnitude, in the context of a &euro;200 billion debt portfolio, one is talking about more than 1%.  As Mr. O'Kelly outlined, we do not assume the money so in terms of the numbers we talked about and our funding range that we told investors for the year, we tend to err on the side of caution because only six months ago or in summer 2016 people felt that bank share prices in terms of equity valuations were not as attractive.  There has been some recovery in those prices so people might have felt an IPO was talked about then did not happen but is now back on the table again.  We tend to err on the side of being cautious.  In the numbers we present here we do not assume the amount in terms of cashflow.  What investors want to know is if it does happen, what would happen the proceeds and the signal around that.</p></speech>

I had to attend statements in the D&aacute;il earlier so I missed the latter half of the presentation.  If I recall correctly, Mr. O'Kelly indicated in the written presentation supplied in advance of today's committee meeting that PPP fund lending is &euro;4.6 billion.  IBEC is lobbying for another big tranche of PPPs for road building.  What is the average interest rate we pay on a PPP?</p> <p>  I note that a significant amount of lending is in legacy debt to the European Union from the bailout period.  Was it ever possible for us to pay that back early, in the same way we did with IMF debt?  If I recall correctly the figure was 7%.  Given that we are able to borrow for the long term at such rates would it not have made sense for us to pay back European debt?</p> <p>  I was remarkably reassured by some of the figures but the one relating to debt as a percentage of Government income is still very high.  If there is any slip in Government income is there a threshold above which that might start to have a significant effect on the overall cost?</p></speech>

The question is what is the cost of the debt.  The cost of debt on current projects for the past 12 months for the average accommodation PPP, the majority of which are 25-year contracts, is approximately 2.5%.  We are raising money at 2.5%.  There is an equity component of approximately 10% of those so the all-in cost for the equity and debt of a PPP for us as a country entering into the contract is approximately 4%.  Let us give a bit of room and say that it is between 4% and 5% depending on where rates are.  The NTMA can borrow directly for that period for approximately 2%.  One is essentially paying an additional 2% to 3%-----</p></speech>

One can forget about the absolutes and the relatives.  Interest rates are extraordinarily low.  In our opinion they are unlikely to stay extraordinarily low for a very long time.  Future citizens and taxpayers may not be able to borrow at such attractive rates for 25 years.  The risks are asymmetric.  There is an opportunity to borrow all-in equity and debt at between 4% and 5% for a project where the PPP investor takes the risk on delivering the building, managing the portfolio for 25 years and then handing it back to the State in a condition that can survive another 20 years.  One is paying 2% to 3% above the rate at which one could do it oneself and that is what one is paying for.  It is an environment where we should probably be looking at that as a reasonably attractive option, irrespective of-----</p></speech>

That is the advantage, so when one has balance sheet restrictions, that is why PPPs are attractive and that is why one sees PPPs.  Even in America now PPPs are starting to come up in states that are really struggling to borrow money directly themselves in the bond markets.</p> <p>  The second question related to European refinancing of other debt alongside the IMF.  Mr. O'Connor would kill me if I did not let him answer this question because he was in the room when most of the negotiations took place so I will let him respond to that question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-08a.106" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank O'Connor" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017030800002#J03000"><p>I will give a reminder on the IMF, which is what I would call the expensive portion of the money.  When one is above one's quota with the IMF the credit margin in the early years was 3% plus the reference rates &ndash; the special drawing rights, SDR, reference rate &ndash; but after three years if one does not start to repay the IMF another per cent is added.  Three years into it one is talking about a 4% credit margin plus the SDR reference rate, which is why we always talk about IMF money costing 4% to 5%.  When our bond yields started to cross 3% into 2%, there was a desire to repay the IMF early.</p> <p>  European loans are different.  European loan are for much longer than the IMF loans and they are cheaper.  In simple terms, the European money, through the ESFS facility and the EFSM are rated AAA and AA.  We are rated A.  One should remember that the pace at which investors expect the money to change from all the other debt we have to fund and the institutional debt coming back into that traditional investor base is different.  I will give one example, the ESFM had to roll one of its maturities so it lent us money by issuing a bond until 2015.  It had to roll that because it had committed to us not repaying until after 2027.  It did three deals at an average of 14 years.  It went to the market with an array of bonds.</p><p>This was December 2015, or just before it.  They funded it at 1.13%.  The same 14 year bond that we had, our 2030 bond at that time, was trading at 1.8% so the European one does not arise at this time.  </p></speech>

Investors look at all these metrics but anything that affects Government revenue particularly if we become more dependent or too dependent on one particular stream of revenue, as happened in the past, would set off alarm bells.

In effect, the NTMA was carrying out a kind of value for money analysis and seeing if it could be done on a regional basis.  At the moment there are problems in quite a significant part of the country, first, where pregnant women do not get scans at 20 weeks and, second, where the more modern technology which is available in the private sector in Ireland for blood tests for issues a baby might have at around 11 or 12 weeks of gestation is not available.  Is any of that still being done by NTMA?  That work was very useful because it allowed evaluations on a regional basis, as happened in Waterford or Mayo at the time, and equipment which was maybe a couple of million euro or up to a couple of million was not that dear, in conjunction with some of the hospital developments.</p> <p>  Going back to capital development, we have a situation in the HSE where a lot of its capital equipment is older and it needs a strong cycle of renewal.

We have a lot of hospitals now with equipment that is so old it is embarrassing and that will continue.  If we could find a mechanism where equipment could be renewed much more rapidly.  There was something of a mechanism before, I am not saying that it was perfect but it resulted in a big improvement in things such as MRI machines being provided to hospitals.  At the moment, the director of the HSE is bemoaning the fact that he has a very large capital investment gap, including on small-scale stuff.</p></speech>

The opening statement was taken as read, but it states that in 2030, the forecast cost of borrowing will be &euro;10 billion.  I note that has reduced by &euro;4 billion or maybe &euro;5 billion.  That is a very welcome development and very positive for the country.</p> <p>  On the sustainability of the debt, while balancing the budget is a policy matter for the Government, carrying a debt in excess of &euro;200 billion puts the State at a certain level of risk.  What advice is being offered by NTMA on the sustainability of this debt?  </p> <p>  On the measurement of the debt, does the NTMA use any other metrics to measure the level of indebtedness?</p></speech>

One is to have a certain amount of cash on the balance sheet and in hand and access to short-term -----</p></speech>

Will this easing have an impact on the sovereign bonds?  </p></speech>

We tend to look at everything from a worst case scenario in that regard but we do believe that interest rates are likely to go higher, yield curves are likely to go steeper and credit spreads are likely to go wider.  That will have an impact on us in the medium term and will make it more difficult to get the number down, that the Deputy mentioned, from the &euro;10 billion that was forecast to the &euro;7 billion to the &euro;6 billion to &euro;5 billion.  We cannot predict what will happen but our working assumption is that rates could go higher when quantitative easing stops and that encourages us to pre-fund now as much as possible to take advantage of the low rate environment.</p></speech>

Anything that affects economic growth affects debt sustainability and investors' perception.  We got some head winds in front of us from Brexit and European instability as well as Trump and uncertainty around tax, in particular, and other policy so they are the headwinds today that we have to consider along with other things that could come around the corner at any time.  We have not isolated any particular risk but Ireland is facing some significant challenges that it has not had in the last couple of years which will negatively impact on its rating by investors.</p></speech>

I have mentioned PPPs a number of times today.</p><p>It is the kind of environment where public private partnerships should be looked at more favourably than they were in the past.  That is mostly because of the level of interest rates currently and the ability to fund all in at between 4% and 5% for 25 years.  I would question whether that type of low rate environment will be available to generations in the future.</p></speech>

A key issue is the extent to which the public bodies engage with that and show a commercial return for projects they are putting forward.  Is the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, happy with the level of engagement with public bodies?  What message would the NTMA want to send to those seeking funding for those types of projects on which they have to show there is a commercial return?</p></speech>

We have engaged with most of the Departments and, hopefully, most of the key industries know about us by now.  The Kilkenny regeneration project is particularly interesting and councils throughout the country are beginning to look at what might be possible.  People are also looking closely at the infrastructure in terms of housing.  There is quite a big regional spread so as we make investments across the country, awareness of the fund becomes more significant.  Our pipeline is very large and full of some very interesting high quality projects.  I am very comfortable about that but if people do not know about us and they have something to say, they should come and see us.</p> <p>  We have examined 5,000 projects in the past two years in regard to ISIF.  We have only made 39 investments so there is a high bar to jump, but we are happy to see everything.</p></speech>

That is a reality that exists currently but the EIB moving to Dublin is a very positive step for Ireland and it is likely to get us more engaged.  I would see that being very beneficial over the medium to long term rather than in the short term.</p></speech>

It is not as dramatic as it was in the crisis when we were rated less than A.  The gap is narrowing but it is still cheaper.  To give the Acting Chairman an example, last year the EIB loaned approximately &euro;430 million directly to the Exchequer close to a 15 year life and, from memory, it was at some 1.78% so it is useful in that regard.</p></speech>

Scale is what PPP operators look for, and they look for a continual pipeline.  Primary care is a very good example.  Some 14 primary care centres are currently being built around the country through PPPs.  That is about &euro;160 million in total value so it is projects with a value between &euro;100 million and &euro;200 million.  Smaller scale projects do not tend to attract the capital and the breadth of interest at the kind of rates that would become attractive.  Medium to large scale projects are particularly suitable.  The schools bundles have worked extremely well and the Department of Education and Skills, and the schools, are very happy.</p></speech>

Before we commence the discussion, I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery to turn off their mobile phones.</p> <p>  I formally welcome Ms Angela Black, chief executive of the Citizens Information Board, Mr. Graham Long, senior manager of the Citizens Information Board, and Ms Louise Loughlin, national manager, National Advocacy Service for People with Disabilities.</p><p>I thank our guests for attending the committee.  They have been invited here to discuss with the committee how the Citizens Information Board interacts with individuals with intellectual disabilities and special needs, how it manages to promote the services provided by its organisation through communications, media and outreach programmes, how or whether the Citizens Information Board can promote awareness of the Committee on Public Petitions and its processes, especially among citizens who are hard to reach, who experience exclusion or who have challenges with formal processes because of communication, literacy, language, health or other challenges, and if there is any advice the witnesses could offer which could assist the joint committee.<br/><br/>Before we commence, in accordance with procedures, I am required to read the following notice on privilege.

However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/><br/>I remind our guests that the presentations should be of no more than ten minutes duration and members have been circulated with the presentations submitted.

The board supports the provision of information, advice and advocacy to citizens on a wide range of public and social services.  We do this through online, telephone and face-to-face services.  We directly provide the <i>citizen.ie </i>website, which received 19.3 million visits last year.  We fund and support the Citizens Information Phone Service, CIPS, to run a helpline, based in Cork, which is available Monday to Friday, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.  Last year the CIPS received more than 139,000 phone calls from members of the public.  We also support 42 citizens information services which provide face-to-face information and advocacy from more than 260 locations.  In a typical year the citizens information centres throughout the country respond to more than 1 million queries from more than 607,000 individuals.  In excess of 1,100 of the information providers in the citizens information network are volunteers.<br/><br/>I am accompanied today by my Citizens Information Board colleague, Graham Long, and my colleague, Louise Loughlin, national manager of the National Advocacy Service for People with Disabilities, which provides a representative advocacy service for people with disabilities. We also support the Sign Language Interpreting Service which is based in the Deaf Village Ireland in Cabra.<br/><br/>We fund and support the 53 Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, offices to assist people with a wide range of debt issues, including mortgage debt as well as money management issues.  One part of our mandate is to ensure people have access to accurate, comprehensive and clear information relating to social services.  However, many citizens need more than information.  We assist and support people, in particular those with disabilities, to identify and understand their needs and options.  By combining our information services with advice and advocacy services, we help people in vulnerable situations to obtain information and claim their entitlements.<br/><br/>The committee, in its invitation, asked a number of specific questions and I would like to try to address those questions in turn.  It asked how the service interacts with people with disabilities.  Our aim is always to ensure our services are as accessible as possible to all citizens.  Our main website, <i>citizensinformation.ie</i>, is built and written with accessibility in mind.  As well as following technical guidelines, we have tried to make the website easy to use and the content easy to follow.  It is a fully responsive website that adapts to different screen sizes and where the text size and colour contrast can both be adjusted easily.  Another of our websites, <i>assistireland.ie</i>, provides a useful listing of assistive products and technology available in Ireland, for example, screen readers, grab rails, fall alarms etc.  These products are particularly helpful for older people and people with disabilities.  Assist Ireland also has a query service which can be contacted by e-mail, telephone or SMS messaging.<br/><br/>Our publications are carefully designed to be accessible, both technically and in the content they provide.  To give a few examples, we use matt paper in our leaflets to minimise reflections, and we do our best to ensure the content is clearly and plainly written.  When we publish our leaflets online, we publish in a range of accessible formats, including tagged PDF, Word document and ePub, which is a format for electronic books.<br/><br/>The CIPS is available Monday to Friday, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.  For people who have hearing or speech difficulties, the CIPS provides a live chat service that can be accessed online and allows the user to interact directly with an information provider.  More than 1,100 of these queries were received last year.<br/><br/>In addition, the citizens information services and the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service provide information, advice and advocacy to members of the public, including people with disabilities.  We also try to ensure our buildings are as accessible as possible.  Some of our customers face particular difficulties in accessing services.  We provide a number of specific services targeted at people with disabilities to make this easier.<br/><br/>The Sign Language Interpreting Service has a range of functions but one of its key offerings is the Irish Remote Interpreting Service, IRIS, which offers an online video link to an Irish Sign Language, ISL, interpreter using video chat programmes like Skype. The IRIS interpreter joins a meeting by video link and translates between Irish Sign Language and spoken English for the participants.  In 2016, the IRIS completed 3,127 assignments.  The IRIS is due to be rolled out to all 60 Intreo offices in 2017.<br/><br/>I previously mentioned the National Advocacy Service for people with disabilities, NAS, which we fund.  It has a particular remit for people who are isolated from their community and services, people who have communication differences, people who are inappropriately accommodated or live in residential services, and people who attend day services or have limited informal supports.  Last year, the NAS provided casework to 1,000 people and provided one-off information, advice and advocacy to 3,162 people, not 1,152 people as indicated in the presentation that was submitted, which is an error I want to correct.<br/><br/>People who contact the NAS may be people with disabilities, family members, service providers or health professionals.  The NAS ensures that when life decisions are made, due consideration is given to the will and preference of people with disabilities and that their rights are safeguarded.  The NAS advocates make every effort to communicate with people using their preferred communication style.  For example, some people use communication passports, gestures or assistive technology to communicate.  Other people communicate through behaviour and the NAS works with the individual and with others in the person&rsquo;s life to understand their preferred method of communication.<br/><br/>In addition to our direct services, the Citizens Information Board's social policy work highlights the experience of the public in accessing public services.  Our social policy reports and submissions to the Government have a particular focus on vulnerable groups and they are informed by feedback gathered from the citizens information and MABS services and networks throughout the country.<br/><br/>The committee has also asked how the Citizens Information Board can promote awareness of the Committee on Public Petitions and its process, especially among citizens who are hard to reach, who experience exclusion or who have challenges with formal processes because of communication, literacy, language, health or other challenges.  Our busiest information channel is our website, <i>citizensinformation.ie</i>.  We have a page on <i>citizensinformation.ie</i>that describes the public petitions system.  This was viewed 476 times last year and it links directly to the committee&rsquo;s information on <i>oireachtas.ie</i>.  The page was viewed 245 times in January and February of this year.  We often use news stories on our website to direct our readers to particular pieces of content.  We would be glad to add a news story describing the public petitions process and linking to further information.<br/><br/>Every month we produce four short articles for syndication in local newspapers throughout the country.  These are called &quot;Know Your Rights&quot; and these columns are written in question and answer format and are published widely.  A &quot;Know Your Rights&quot; column covering public petitions would be a very good way to promote the petitions process.<br/><br/>Our information centres carry leaflets and material from a wide range of organisations.  Leaflets from the committee describing the public petitions system could be distributed through the citizens information centres.  Perhaps a key area where we can assist with the petitions process is through raising awareness with our face-to-face information providers.</p><p>Many of our citizens information centres operate outreach services including, for example, in prisons, libraries, family resource centres, community centres, hospitals and other settings.  We could use a training seminar to highlight the petitions process to our information providers and advocates, who could then ensure that customers who might use the process are informed about it.  We would welcome engagement with the committee around the development of a seminar on the process.  <br/><br/>A further important part of the work of information providers and advocates is assisting people to engage with organisations and processes.  Again, with training, staff and volunteers in our delivery services could actively help customers to engage with the public petitions process and ensure they can exercise their rights in this area.<br/><br/>Citizens information and MABS services are promoted in many different ways.  Our presence online is very important because it allows people to get information and to find our services quickly and easily.  Our services have extensive partnership networks at local level to help raise awareness.  Both the MABS and the Citizens Information Board are involved in outreach work and engage in local promotional events and activities such as leaflet drops.  The Know Your Rights columns, which I mentioned earlier, are distributed by the CIB information team.  These appear in local print media and act as the catalyst for numerous local radio slots.  CIB also manages communications campaigns at a national level.  National campaigns encourage members of the public experiencing difficulty to seek advice or information.  Some of our activities in this area include radio and print advertisements, material made available in health outlets and digital partnerships with key websites.<br/><br/>The scale of our network helps a great deal with brand awareness.  There are 260 CIB locations and 60 MABS offices.  CIB provides high street signage for both MABS and CIS.  Along with our information leaflets, CIB provides a range of promotional materials to services including posters, leaflets, pens and roll-up banner stands.  Some key partnership initiatives have also helped to increase brand awareness of both CIB and MABS.  These initiatives include the Green Ribbon mental health campaign, the HSE's <i>whatsupmum.ie</i>information campaign and the Insolvency Service of Ireland, ISI, information campaign.  Our services are promoted at national events where there is high footfall, including the National Ploughing Championships, the Over 50s Show in the RDS, the 50 Plus Expo in Cork and the Which Course exhibition in Croke Park.<br/><br/>Finally, we engage actively with the media to highlight the value and importance of the services we fund and support.  The most recent example is the launch of the Abhaile communications campaign, which took place in CIB on 27 February and which highlighted the pivotal role of MABS in acting as the gateway to Abhaile, the free mortgage arrears support service.<br/><br/>It might be worthwhile for the committee to engage with other organisations that could assist with promotion such as public libraries, centres for independent living, unions, active retirement groups and others might all be good channels to let people know about the petitions process.  I would be happy to forward a list of suggestions if the committee wishes.</p></speech>

I thank Ms Black for a very comprehensive report.  Organisations like the CIB are often taken for granted in terms of the work they do on behalf of the general public.  It is only when one steps back and takes time to reflect that one realises the comprehensive nature of that work.  I am aware of the enormous physical footprint of the organisation in this country.  I am from Navan and I am aware that there are three centres in County Meath.  The centre in Navan is right in the middle of the town in a modern office block.  It is accessible, visible and the public engages with it.  The MABS is particularly valuable.  I recall that Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v opened that facility and I attended the opening ceremony.  It is a very valuable service that is in close proximity to other State-run services in the centre of Navan town.  The people of Navan and County Meath very much appreciate the service provided by the CIB.</p> <p>  I ask Ms Black to provide a breakdown of the public engagement with the service.  How much of it is physical, face-to-face engagement in CIB offices and how much is online engagement?  The organisation's online presence is an invaluable resource for Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann, not to mention members of the public.  It provides a quick reference point on many issues.  </p> <p>  I also ask Ms Black, without breaching anyone's confidence, to give an outline of the type of queries that are dealt with by the organisation.  How has that changed in the last decade?  I am sure that during the recession there was considerable demand for the financial advice services provided by MABS.  This committee has asked for help from the CIB.  I ask Ms Black to give us details on the help provided to the public in terms of, for example, enabling ordinary people to understand new legislation and how it will impact their lives.  </p> <p>  In summary, I ask for details on the breakdown of online versus face-to-face engagement, the scale and type of queries being dealt with and the impacts on people's lives.</p></speech>

The demand for MABS in general is up to 40,000 between face-to-face and telephone interactions.  Approximately 150,000 people phone the citizens information telephone service every year.

Website traffic is growing and the nature of the online queries are changing.  Previously we had information, advice and advocacy and the latter was particularly important for people with disabilities.  With each layer, the query takes longer to assess and answer.  Outcomes are more difficult to measure as queries get more complex.  It is very easy to say what the footfall used to be when it was only about people going in to use MABS.  While the footfall may only have increased by 10% or 15%, we are dealing with mortgage arrears issues and serious matters that fundamentally affect people's daily lives.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about making legislation decipherable-----</p></speech>

However, other organisations provide easy read materials on legislation that has been passed.  Inclusion Ireland, in particular, would produce easy read versions of legislation.  A number of weeks ago, for example, an easy read version of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 was up on its website within a day of the legislation being passed.  It has pictorial representations to enable people to understand the law.</p> <p>  We would have easy read versions of our own materials.  That would be the main focus of our work in this area and our easy read documentation would mainly be targeted at people with intellectual disabilities.  There are recognised methods of producing easy read formats and certain standards must be met before information can be approved as being easy read.</p></speech>

Do the witnesses think that we should make our language more easy to follow, less cumbersome and less inhibiting for those who may want to make a petition?  Looking at some of the language used, it might frighten the ordinary person who might not be familiar with what we are doing.</p> <p>  I commend the Citizens Information Board on the services it provides.  As Deputy Cassells stated, what it is doing is superb.  The volume of people who interact with the board is considerable.  If we, as politicians, got that, we would be thrilled.  What is worthwhile - the witnesses might think it goes unnoticed - are the regular updates from the board that we can put into our folders.  Staff in my office and I find them most useful because they are a font of knowledge.  For many of us, the board is the Google of politics, if I can use that term.  It is a good reference point.  I do not want to be patronising but I would like the board to know that we value its work.  While we go out into the community and talk to people, sometimes they come to us in our clinics having gone to the board, and they would have always found the board helpful and willing.</p> <p>  Given that the Recognition of Irish Sign Language for the Deaf Community Bill 2016 will, hopefully, be made into law soon, the number using the IRIS service, at 3,127 completed assignments in 2016, is extraordinary.  I link to that the remarks on the seminars on how we can engage and enhance our ability to communicate.  Certainly, there are a lot of good suggestions and we need to take up those.  It is important we do what the service does, which is to engage.</p> <p>  Often people come to the service when they are most vulnerable, in a time of crisis or frustrated, and I and those I know who deal with the staff of the service, in Cork in any case, have nothing but praise and admiration for them.  I thank the witnesses for today.  We can learn from some of the presentation, in particular the way it is portrayed and located on the website.  It is something we should look at.</p></speech>

Of all the material the committee has there, the one aspect I might have looked at again is the form the person must fill in to send the petition, which is quite long.  Some parts of the form are not explained.  There is a bit of room for improvement.  Otherwise, I was really impressed with it.</p></speech>

They provide a brilliant resource to all our communities.  Their website is fantastic.  It is a one-stop-shop database and it is easy, as they said, to access.</p> <p>  I have a few questions in and around the Committee on Public Petitions itself.  The witnesses stated they had figures that show 245 have touched on their section on the Committee on Public Petitions.  Over the years did they ever receive any feedback from staff in their offices regarding the Committee on Public Petitions?</p> <p>  The witnesses have already touched on a few of the weaknesses.  Would they be able to let us know in detail what weaknesses they see with the current process and how we can be a little more transparent?</p> <p>  Out of curiosity, would the witnesses have available information on the location of their busiest offices in the organisation?  In line with that question, could they outline what would be the issues people present with?  Particularly in my constituency, they have a fantastic service on Bunratty Road in Coolock.  There are times - we ourselves accessed it - when we are near having to get an appointment because the girls are out the door with work.  If they could provide that little bit of feedback, I would appreciate it.</p></speech>

I would say one of our busiest offices is probably the one in the centre of Dublin in O'Connell Street.  Equally, those in the largest urban areas - Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway - would all be very busy offices.  I do not want to single out any.  There was mention of Navan earlier.  I happen to know that it is an extremely busy office and, therefore, I have probably left out a lot.  In big towns, it is big business.  Part of the reason it is big business is that we pride ourselves on giving independent information, advice and advocacy.  We do not affiliate ourselves with any grouping, any political agenda or anything like that.</p> <p>  I also think that part of the reason it is difficult to maximise on the footfall online is because people have so many channels through which to ask a question.  For some people, using the citizens information service is a way not to use a politician's constituency office.  For others, it is the precursor to going in to a politician anyway.  We cannot second guess why people would come in to us first, but we do try to promote it.  However, we would have no problem in promoting independent, neutral approaches to get answers to questions from any member of the public.  I do not know whether my colleagues have anything to add.</p></speech>

So far this month, we have had 60 hits on that web page.  It is increasing quite a bit relative to last year and that is a good sign.</p> <p>  I am not aware of any specific feedback on the Committee on Public Petitions or the petitions process.  I have not come across any in that context.</p> <p>  In terms of the types of queries, a large part of our business is in the social welfare area and we would expect about 40% of the queries of those who are dropping into our offices to be in the social welfare area. There are also queries on health, housing, employment, money and tax.  I am sure it would probably reflect what the committee members see in their own constituency offices in terms of queries around medical cards and issues to do with working time and unfair dismissal and similar matters.</p> <p>  In terms of the process, I had a couple of comments on the form which I would be quite happy to send in.  It is not really process related.  It is merely on the technicalities of it.  I would be quite happy to send that on.</p></speech>

It is a sensitive subject and I do not want her to breach any confidentiality.  From her engagement with the public in the course of recent years, how are people being treated by the financial institutions and what type of queries are they coming to her with?  There is both factual and anecdotal information in terms of how people are being treated and the pressure they are being put under, for instance, starting off with unsolicited calls from the financial institutions.  I am sure, no more than ourselves as a point for people to contact, Ms Black is dealing with people who are under a lot of stress, both financially and emotionally.  Can Ms Black say whether there has been a better approach by the financial institutions over recent years in dealing with those who find themselves among the cases of mortgage arrears and how the nature of that is changing?</p></speech>

I would be merely saying, in my opinion, that it has been up and down.  The fact there is a need for consumer protection codes in the first place reflects the fact that a lot of the time people are in over their heads.  Sometimes it is down to how they are treated by the lender and sometimes it is down to how they have viewed the undertaking they have taken on.  When it comes to a mortgage situation, in particular, everybody knows that people are in over their head.  The approach, both from the Legislature and from ourselves in the community, in reacting and protecting people, has had to reflect the fact the arrears do not get better and that they get worse and need to be dealt with.  In a factual and neutral way, we deal with whatever comes up.</p><p>We deal with the lenders, some of whom treat customers very well but others do not.  As it got into the longer mortgage arrears, we had to do this response, which we are pleased the Government has supported, the most recent part of which was the Abhaile launch.  Perhaps this would not have been necessary four or five years ago because people were not as far into arrears difficulties as they are now.</p></speech>

Ms Black has a bird's eye view from the perspective of citizens regarding how everything is going for them.  She made interesting comments about the depth and complexity of the queries.  It is not, therefore, just about the numbers.  There are also trends relating to people's financial circumstances.  The board has made good suggestions to the committee, particularly regarding the form.  We will take that up to make that as easy a form as possible for people to complete.  The secretariat might revert to Ms Black on that.  She also made other suggestions, including a news story, a "Know Your Rights" column, leaflets, which are being updated, raising awareness with face-to-face information providers, outreach, and training seminars.  We would love to examine all of those and Ms Black said she would come back to the committee.  We would be open to that because we would like to raise the profile of this process to show that citizens can have their day and have an issue explored.  The board has such a reach that working through it would enhance our coverage.</p></speech>

The committee had a public policy remit and we are arguing the toss about having that reinstated.  If it is, are there public policy issues that would be useful for us to explore?  Ms Black may wish to consider that and come back to us because the board encounters a great number of people with many issues.  Deputies Cassells and Mitchell referred to that.  What themes could we explore that would be helpful, which might not come under the remit of a single Department but cut across a number of them, were the committee's remit to be extended?  Ms Black can offer some thoughts now and come back to us as well.</p></speech>

Having a public policy remit spares the committee from giving an <i>ad hoc</i>response to issues as they arise.  We tend to favour the public policy batching together of trends and patterns of behaviour in order that it becomes evidence and then policy can be based on evidence that can be extrapolated countrywide.  We garner that evidence from our Oyster database that is operated by the Citizens Information service and from the MABS system because we have such a broad network.  MABS takes down the reason for the query and the needs resulting from it.  It is best to assimilate a pattern or a trend and not to treat queries on an ad hoc basis, and then make a decision on whether there is a problem, a market failure, a social failure and so on.  We then respond to that.  As a result of this work, for example, we devised the personal micro-credit scheme to reduce the scourge of moneylending in the country.  A pattern emerged of people coming in with problems relating to this.  Similarly, we have other inputs prior to the annual budget where evidence from a large cohort in the community arrives on our desk and it is analysed and assessed systematically and not on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis.  We will revert to the committee on this.</p></speech>

With regard to extending the committee's remit, there was a question about us bringing forward our pet projects.  The Deputies and I are concerned about many issues but that is not the point of this forum.  However, the petitions must be evidence-based and come from individual queries which are grouped together and analysed to establish whether are trends and public policy issues to which we need to attend.  A submission from the CIB on that would be most welcome as well as elaborating on the suggestions made.</p> <p>  Would it be helpful for us to go out on the road?  We ask people to come in here.  How important would it be from the CIB's point of view for us to meet people directly?  We will not necessarily take that on board.</p></speech>

If there is not a public face to bridge the gap between their lack of knowledge when they come in the door and how confident they feel when they leave, then we are remiss.  We cannot just do this from the ivory tower of our headquarters.  The committee might not feel that it is that similar to us but perhaps when that is said, members might feel they need a more public facing presence.  I am agnostic but committee members are welcome to tag along to any of our seminars or meetings if they want to make a presentation to let people know.  There cannot be too much information and knowledge sharing given the complexity of daily life for citizens.  They are not engaging in society in the way they used to; they are engaged at all levels, from financial services to their properties and so on.  It has become much more complicated and they are in over the heads not only in respect of mortgages but in respect of many other things.</p></speech>

Perhaps we can flesh those out and work together on the public policy ideas and on visibility.

My colleague, Ms Freda McKittrick, is the head of our guardian <i>ad litem</i>service and our resident expert in all these matters.  Between us, we should be able to answer any questions in due course.  We have made a detailed submission to the committee in addition to the opening statement.<br/><br/>The story of Grace has shocked and disturbed us all.  It raises deep questions of accountability and practice.  It obliges us, to the extent that we regard our country as a republic, to find out how and why terrible things were allowed to happen to one of our fellow citizens.  These things happened on the watch of the State and while the State was funding the care of a child who grew to be a young woman.<br/><br/>In her suffering and resilience, Grace has taught us an underlying and indelible lesson, if only we are willing to listen.  If a child is vulnerable and at risk but has no voice, that risk is multiplied.  If a child is crying out for help and cannot be heard, help will never come.  If corruption or abuse is possible, the existence of closed doors and blind eyes will make it certain.<br/><br/>Every day, children appear in front of the courts in Ireland.  If those children or young people are charged with a crime, they are constitutionally entitled to the best defence they, or the State on their behalf, can afford.  That is as it should be.  However, if a child stands in front of a court charged with no crime but faces decisions that can affect the course of the rest of his or her life, that child has no right to be heard.  We know that the judge, whose job is to determine the future of the child, takes that task seriously.  Frequently, they exercise their discretion to appoint an independent person to help to establish where the best interests of the child lie.  However, the point is that this only happens at the discretion of the judge - it is not a child's right.</p><p>Over the 20 years of operating a guardian <i>ad litem</i>service, our guardians have worked with children who have made multiple attempts on their own lives while in the care system.  They have worked with children who have been abandoned, abused or neglected.  They have worked with children who have been put at immense risk by their parents' drug and alcohol problems.  They have worked with children who have been hurt almost beyond repair by sexual and other forms of abuse.  They have worked with children who self-harm, who blame themselves for the things that have gone wrong in their lives or who are full of self-hatred and want to take it out on the world.  They have worked with children who have been left alone, hungry, fearful and cold.  All of those children appear in front of the Irish courts, which is where their future can be decided.<br/><br/>It may seem perverse to say it, but in one respect at least, these are the luckier children.  They are children at risk to whom a judge has appointed a guardian whose only task is to represent the best interests of those children and young people, to advocate for them and to seek a better outcome than the life that faces them now.<br/><br/>We could supply this committee with dozens of case histories.  We have attached some to our submission.  What they show is a system that wants to produce the best results for children.  There are dedicated and committed social work teams and thousands of carers doing amazing jobs.  However, it is a system that is terribly constrained by resources and other pressures.  In some ways, it is constrained by the culture, which still exists in Ireland, that children should be seen and not heard.  Our case histories show people often working together, though sometimes challenging each other, to try to secure the best result.  They also show a system that has become more legalistic, more adversarial and more expensive in the struggle to balance the best interests of children against scarce resources and often imperfect solutions.  Our case histories do not show happy endings in every case, but all of our experience shows that children always do better when they have someone who represents their views and wishes and no one else's.<br/><br/>For that reason, our first reaction to the Bill before the committee is to welcome it strongly, but also to say that it does not go far enough, and in some respects it sends us backwards.  This is a Bill that seeks to make it the norm rather than the exception that a vulnerable child, faced with the decisions that an imperfect world can make, would have someone at their side at all times.  However, this does not make it a right.  The right should be explicit in law.  It is not explicit in law despite the fact the 31st amendment to the Constitution, passed by referendum of the people, provides that, &quot;in the resolution of all proceedings ... brought by the State ... for the purpose of preventing the safety and welfare of any child from being prejudicially affected ... the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration [...] the views of the child shall be ascertained and given due weight having regard to the age and maturity of the child&quot;.<br/><br/>It is not the law in Ireland despite the fact that the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Ireland has ratified, obliges us in Article 12 to enable children to express their own views in all matters concerning them.  In particular, &quot;the child shall ... be provided the opportunity to be heard in any judicial and administrative proceedings affecting the child, either directly or through a representative or an appropriate body&quot;.<br/><br/>We will always strongly argue that we must move towards progressive realisation of those rights.  The primary purpose of this Bill is to establish a single national provider of the service which is essential to those rights.  We strongly welcome the Bill on that basis also.  In our written submission, we advocate ways in which the Bill can be significantly improved.  I will touch on some of them in a moment. <br/><br/>However, the underlying principle of the Bill is that this is an area that needs its own reform.  As the largest provider of guardians in Ireland, last year our 32 guardians worked with more than 800 children.  We have always argued for more and greater transparency in the system.  In several submissions over the years we have made to the Department we have advocated a unified and much better managed approach.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that a cloud has been cast over the independent representation of vulnerable children by the and unregulated system which has been allowed to develop.  A recent study by the Comptroller and Auditor General shows clearly that in an unregulated world costs can vary significantly from case to case, and in overall terms there is a huge question mark about whether children are being effectively and independently represented on a value for money basis.<br/><br/>Barnardos has always argued that the only remedy to secure proper transparency and accountability while maintaining standards and independence is a stand-alone entity, operating on the basis of a single contract with the State and subject to best practice in the areas of management and governance.  This Bill, together with the necessary processes in areas such as tendering that will follow its passage, is designed to secure that.<br/><br/>However, we believe that some of the measures contained in the draft heads will militate against what the Bill aims to achieve.  The provision whereby Tusla continues to be the funder of the service, for example, is both unnecessary and undesirable.  It is not something Tusla wants, and very few of the submissions made to the Department in this area advocate it.  The only provision that makes sense would be a public contract between the Department and the provider.  We strongly recommend to the committee that that approach be taken.<br/><br/>It is important to state unequivocally in the law that the role of any guardian must be to seek to promote the best interests of the child.  It is our view and our experience that the best outcomes are always to be found when those who are involved in the child&rsquo;s welfare work together collaboratively to try to develop plans that are adequately resourced and centred on the child&rsquo;s needs.  There will be times when disagreements arise and where there is a need to challenge decisions made around allocation of resources.  Particular issues arise at moments of complex and challenging transition for children.  The moment when they reach 18, for instance, can be the moment when they are most at risk.  Anyone who has followed the tragic story of Daniel McAnaspie will know that to be the case.<br/><br/>In that context, it will never be enough for a guardian to be, as the explanatory memorandum says, some kind of expert witness with no role other than to prepare a report.  While we have never had any wish to see an adversarial approach being taken to this work and we do not believe the current frequently highly conflictual situation serves the best interests of children, guardians cannot be passive.  They must be able to support good practice and challenge poor practice.  They must be able to express strong views when necessary resources are being withheld.  They cannot adequately represent the best interests of children to the court by remaining silent.  It must also be said that there is one thing guardians know, that the best outcome for children is found when everyone involved is working together in a collaboration that centres on the needs of the child.  The more conflict that can be removed, the better the outcome that is likely to emerge.  The day-to-day experience and work of guardians prove this.  Getting this balance right is complex and, in our view, requires further drafting work.  We have attached a more detailed examination of the Bill to this presentation and would be more than happy to answer any questions the committee might have.<br/><br/>If we get this Bill right, we can make significant strides towards achieving something I believe we all want.  We all want a system that is well-managed and accountable.  We all want transparency and consistency in the investment the State will be required to make.<br/><br/>From our examination of the figures as they apply to Barnardos, and I cannot speak for anyone else, roughly speaking it costs between &euro;4,000 and &euro;5,000 per year per child when a guardian working on the case.  That sounds expensive.  When compared with the fact the State pays around &euro;5,000 per week to keep a child in private residential care or about &euro;10,000 per week to keep a child in State-provided secure care, &euro;5,000 a year to keep children out of the care system is actually very cheap.<br/><br/>Over and above the question of cost, there is one key point.  We now know that the babies and children of Tuam had no voice.  The thousands of children sent to industrial schools by Irish courts had no voice.  Grace had no voice.  The system fails when it fails to listen.  That is why we believe it is unthinkable, knowing what we know, that we would continue to allow our child care and child protection system to continue to operate without being absolutely certain that the children most affected by the system have a voice of their own, and that that voice is always heard.</p></speech>

We unite more than 100 member organisations and it is our goal to make Ireland one of the best places in the world to be a child.  We are campaigning for the implementation of children's rights in our laws, policies and services.<br/><br/>We welcome the publication of the general scheme of the guardian <i>ad litem </i>Bill.  This is a very important step.</p><p>It is an ongoing part of the dialogue that has been happening in this area with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Department, and we welcome that.  There has been extensive consultation in the development of it.<br/><br/>For many reasons, we welcome the establishment of the scheme and of the service.  As Mr. Finlay stated, we are dealing with one of the most vulnerable groups of children in the country, namely, those within the child care system.  There are approximately 6,500 children in the child care system.  Only half of them have judicial supervision or even have the possibility of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>being appointed.  One should be aware that there is a possibility of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>being appointed in the case of only half of the children in care.<br/><br/>The other point that comes through in respect of many of the children who are in the care system is, as Mr. Finlay stated, that they have been abused and neglected, and have been failed in some way.  Through the 17 official reports, we know that the State has failed children in the care system in many different ways and we have to remember that.  One of the most important and shocking findings coming from the Ryan report is that children did complain when they were starved and neglected.  They tried to complain to various people but they were not listened to.  That is why the voice of the child, and ensuring that children can participate in proceedings affecting them, is so incredibly important.  We know the cost of not listening to children.<br/><br/>I will outline one or two positives of the scheme and where we might enhance those areas, and my colleague, Ms Quinn, will contribute.  The first positive is there will be a national guardian <i>ad litem</i>service that is established and regulated.  That is really important.  We know from the report on child care law reporting that there are potential issues in respect of the quality of service that is provided throughout the country.  There is some very good service on one hand but we are not sure whether children are getting the best service on the other.  That is why regulation is incredibly important.<br/><br/>One matter that is at issue for us is that while guardians <i>ad litem</i>will be given independent status under the Bill, the service that is to be commissioned will not have independent status.  That could be a serious issue for us because the service will be accountable to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  The financial management of it will be in the hands of the Child and Family Agency but the service itself will not have an independent status.  For example, the Courts Service of Ireland is an independent service.  Previously, the then Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform managed the courts service and there were serious issues around in the courts system's independence because the Department was directly managing it.  It could be an issue.  If the service itself is not given an independent status in the Bill, the Minister could impose certain restrictions, regulations and funding requirements that could impact on the overall independence of the service.<br/><br/>Another positive in the scheme is that there is a presumption that guardians <i>ad litem</i>will be appointed in child care proceedings.  That is a positive step.  We know from the reports on child care law reporting that these are not appointed in all circumstances.  Not all children who come before the child care courts get a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  That requirement should be extended to the Circuit Court and to the District Court.  There should be a presumption that a guardian <i>ad litem</i>is appointed in all child care law proceedings.  That is an important principle that we need in the future.<br/><br/>Another issue coming up in the Bill relates to the role that is defined in the legislation.  At present, under the scheme of the Bill, the position regarding the role guardians <i>ad litem</i>will play is quite circumscribed.  Essentially, they will be expert advisers.  The role of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>needs to be extended.  I will pass on to my colleague, Ms Quinn, to elaborate and explain, from a human rights perspective, why that is important.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-08a.200" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Edel Quinn" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017030800002#D00200"><p>The issue I want to address, as Ms Ward mentioned, relates to the status of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>under head 6 of the general scheme of the Bill.  It is important to ask from the start who is the guardian <i>ad litem</i>and what should his or her role be.  For us, the guardian <i>ad litem</i>should be the child's representative in the court.  That flows from the child's right to have his or her views heard, as Mr. Finlay mentioned.  Article 12 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child - I will repeat it, although Mr. Finlay mentioned it, because it is important - provides that the child has the right to have his or her views heard in all matters affecting him or her, including judicial proceedings, either directly - by speaking to the child directly - or through a representative such as a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  That provision was incorporated into the Constitution as a result of the children's referendum.  Under Article 42A, they now have the right to be heard in child care proceedings and for due weight to be given to those views, having regard to the age and maturity of the child.  It does not mean that the child's views are the deciding factor but they are considered as one of the deciding factors.<br/><br/>In addition to the role of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>in informing the court of the child's views and advising the court in the child's best interests, over the years the role of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>has evolved to have a wider remit.  In practice, guardians <i>ad litem</i>have been given legal representation in proceedings.  They have fulfilled the role of defending the rights of the child and they have had a similar status in child care proceedings to the parents or Tusla.  That has meant that they have been able to vindicate the child's rights where there has been a gap.  As has been mentioned by both Mr. Finlay and Ms Ward, under head 6 of the general scheme the status of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>will be as a special type of expert witness, and that reduces and dilutes the role of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>to a large degree.<br/><br/>In effect, what can the guardians <i>ad litem</i>do today?  They have the crucial role of being able to cross-examine witnesses.  They can cross-examine parents.  They can cross-examine Tusla where there might be a bad decision that is not in the child's best interests around the allocation of resources.  Critically, they can take appeals against bad decisions.  They have full access to reports in respect of the child.  They can attend meetings with professionals such as, for example, to get a child assessed for psychiatric needs.  They can liaise with a child and his or her parents around access.<br/><br/>We understand that they will not be able to undertake any of those roles under the new scheme.  They will simply be able to make a report to the court.  We see that as a big problem.  One of the big questions to be answered then is who will fulfil this role if it will not be the guardian <i>ad litem</i>?  Who will undertake that role of vindicating the rights of the child in the proceedings?  These are fair procedure rights that a child is entitled to, and the High Court recognised that recently in a case before Christmas.  Ms Justice Marie Baker recognised that right.  In order for those fair procedure rights to be vindicated, the guardian <i>ad litem</i>should have legal standing in proceedings to represent the child and the child, through the guardian <i>ad litem</i>, will then have an equal standing in the proceedings to other parties.<br/><br/>To wrap up, this function of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>where it has had this wider remit predates the children's referendum.  It would be a sad state of affairs if children were left with inferior rights as a result of the status of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>now as opposed to before the children's referendum.</p></speech>

Potentially, the judge could make a decision that the child would need to question, and challenge, as well.  It is an important check and balance in the system to ensure that decisions are made in the best interests of children.  As one can imagine, social workers throughout the country can be overburdened with high volumes of cases.  Perhaps they are not able to give a child the attention that he or she needs.  Perhaps their supervisor takes a particular view on something or perhaps the judge takes a particular view on something.  There needs to be someone there to defend and vindicate the rights of the child.  Sometimes the parents can do that but, as one can imagine, it is difficult for a parent, if, for example, he or she has been prosecuted for neglecting his or her child, to play that special role.<br/><br/>As a final point, to echo what Mr. Finlay said, we recognise that a real attempt has been made to restrict the role that Tusla has in the management of the money in respect of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>service in the scheme but, from an independence perspective, it would be much better that Tusla would not have a role in managing the moneys around the guardian <i>ad litem</i>scheme.  It could be the Department of Children and Youth Affairs or it could be another body.  That is really important, particularly in the context of the perception of the system and the perception of independence.</p></speech>

Mr. Finlay started off by saying that Grace and the babies in Tuam have taught us a lesson.  Sadly, we need to listen to this lesson.  That is the first message.  I first came into the D&aacute;il in 1998, around the time the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse was established.  There was an apology from the Taoiseach of the time and so on.  We thought that we were recognising what had happened in the past.  Nearly 20 years later we are discovering again the appalling neglect and lack of a voice of children in very vulnerable situations.  The witnesses have certainly brought that home to me this morning.</p><p>Both witnesses have rightly emphasised the issue of a rights-based approach.  There has to be a right to a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  In drafting this legislation, my first question would be how we can ensure that every child within the courts system, at least, would have that right, so that it would not just be at the discretion of the judge.  I know there are other children outside of the courts system who might also benefit.  Are the witnesses satisfied that the legislation does provide this right to every child?  If they are not, how can we alter the wording of the legislation?  I suspect this will touch on some of the points the witnesses have made already, particularly in their written submissions.</p><p>I would like a bit more clarity on how exactly the witnesses believe the system should be run.  Both of them have suggested that the issue of guardians <i>ad litem</i>be dealt with directly by the Department, or else by another independent body, rather than by Tusla.  The legislation suggests it should be Tusla.</p><p>The witnesses have pointed out that the guardian <i>ad litem</i>should not just be an expert witness for the court but should be the voice of the child.  The witnesses have given some documentation around how that should be implemented in their written submissions.  Could they elaborate on this?  Our job is to feed into the legislation as it is being drafted and to ensure that it is as strong as possible.</p><p>I was reading the case studies from Barnardos.  One was about Sally, a girl who was in care early on and was given back to her mother's care between the ages of four and six.  She was found out in the open with nobody looking after her and was brought back into care again.  Eventually it became established that something awful had happened to her in those two years.  The guardian <i>ad litem</i>in this case appears to have been involved all the way through, right up to her 18th birthday, ensuring that Sally understood all the way along the line what the care provision was going to be.  What I understood from the case study was that the guardian <i>ad litem</i>enabled the child to trust the system.  How comprehensive can the role of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>be?  Based on that case, it does not appear to be just a matter of appearing in court with the child but seems to be something of a broader role.</p></speech>

I have no fear of what the witnesses are saying here today.  I admire what they are saying and doing.</p><p>I have a couple of questions, though, probably arising out of my own ignorance.  Mr. Finlay mentioned that Barnardos has a panel of 32 guardians <i>ad litem</i>working with 800 children each year.  If it comes to pass that we are going to have a guardian <i>ad litem</i>for every single child who needs our help - we are talking about thousands of children - how are we going to do that?  How are we going to have the manpower to be able to look after all these children?</p><p>In the past, we have trusted social workers, Tusla and lots of other organisations with the care of our children, yet we have been let down badly in so many cases.  Although, with the mother and baby homes situation, we seem to be talking about events that happened more than 50 years ago, our digging is getting nearer and nearer to the present day.  Who is going to scrutinise the guardians?  Is there going to be a body that will oversee them and ensure that we do not make the same mistake again of trusting without even looking at the possible dangers that can evolve?</p><p>I fully agree that it should be a separate body to deal with the financial aspect of funding this.  It should not be Tusla.  The almost incestuous integration of what is happening in the HSE and bodies like this is too much.  We need to have something that is separate, for the children only and nothing else.  If the witnesses need any backing or support on that issue I will be happy to give my voice.</p></speech>

Never before did we feel such weight as Oireachtas committee members as this morning in respect of the revelations of the past month.  The Bill is very welcome.  Along with other members, I have been looking for it to come before us for some time.  However long it takes us to get it right, we now need to do so - to get this Bill right in its entirety.  We need to future-proof it so as not to continue making the mistakes of the past.  We will be doing this blind to some extent, without any commission reports or anything.  We all need to take a collaborative approach.</p><p>I was very much taken aback by the witnesses' presentations.  They were fantastic.  I know there are 6,344 children in care at this moment.  To think that only 1,500 of them have access to a guardian <i>ad litem</i>service, and that at the discretion of a judge, is shocking.  The most important thing that needs to be enshrined in the legislation, with the will of everybody, is the right of the child to be represented, and not just on a discretionary basis.  Both witnesses touched on that this morning.  Deputy O'Sullivan has also addressed it.  We need to strengthen the Bill in respect of that issue.</p><p>Considering the balances, checks and controls and the overarching body that needs to be put in place, I am concerned that we would be creating another structure.  Will we be able to monitor it?  I  have a concern around creating another entity, when it may be the case that another body cannot manage it.  I have a concern about taking the role away from Tusla because Tusla was set up to protect the child.  That was the whole reason it was taken out of the HSE and the reason we have Tusla there.</p><p>I think Tusla is still a department in infancy which we need to grow because it has never been given the opportunity to do that as it has not had enough staffing or funding.  Coming back to collaboration, it all has to work together.  There is a role for Tusla to play here and I am not in favour of leaving it out completely.  I would like to hear what the controls, balances and staffing of the overarching body would be.  <br/><br/>What has worried me from the various press articles over the past fortnight is that one person who acts as a guardian <i>ad litem</i>service is getting &euro;300,000 for providing that service.  I do not know what controls or checks and balances exist for approving those sorts of services.  That is what I want to see happen.  If we go back to the Grace case, we see that someone was given an opportunity to provide respite which turned into full-blown fostering and there is no documentation.  We need to get the balances and checks from its inception and write that in as part of the Bill.  How do the witnesses foresee this working and how would it work with the agency that is in place?</p></speech>

I will make some general observations first and, if it is possible at a later stage, come back with some specific observations on some of the specific headings.  I was very taken with the two presentations in general and I would be very sympathetic to many of the observations.  I agree with the idea that a right to a guardian <i>ad litem</i>should be explicit in law.  Unfortunately much of the discussion in recent weeks on the guardian <i>ad litem</i>service has related to cost and some of the headlines have been misleading, in terms of social workers costing X amount without any real reflection about what service is being provided in the specific instance.  That is unfortunate.  Obviously, some of this discussion has to take cost and cost efficiency and that kind of thing into account but the priority needs to be the voice of the child.  Members of this committee need to be robust in reflecting that this is a very particular service with a very important role.</p><p>I am sympathetic and agreeable to the idea that this should be funded and structured separately from Tusla.  The fact that Tusla is likely to be a party to so many cases means that it is logical and sensible that over time if some tensions or conflict were to emerge between the body of guardians <i>ad litem</i>and Tusla, there should be a firewall there.  How would the witnesses see a national service operating, providing it was independent from Tusla?  This is not an employer-employee relationship; I imagine it would be a contract for services type of relationship between the guardians <i>ad litem</i>and other Tusla services. </p><p>If this legislation is passed following some improvement, and I anticipate that it will be, a matter arises which I think would be a positive thing, I imagine there will be increased demand and an increase in the number of guardians <i>ad litem</i>required.  Does the capacity exist within the number of people who are qualified to undertake this role?  Will there be a need to bring on more people with the necessary qualifications?</p><p>I agree that the presumption should exist that children should be entitled to a guardian<i>ad litem</i>and it should be extended to the lower courts.  I am interested in the point about the extension of the role.  This is largely dealt with in Head 3 where the role is defined largely as that of an expert witness.  The witnesses are concerned that it will not be able to undertake some of the functions that it can undertake currently.  The Barnardos submission outlines the idea of a tandem model.  Could the representatives expand on how that tandem model would work where the guardian <i>ad litem</i>communicates with legal representation?  I have never seen it in court myself and I am curious about how that works.  Do the legal representation and the guardian <i>ad litem</i>currently participate in cross examination?  Is that potentially cumbersome or is it something that should be the aspiration, where a guardian <i>ad litem</i>conveys the wishes of a child not only to the court but also the child's official legal representation, whether it is a solicitor or barrister?</p><p>I have one or two additional questions but that is enough for now.  </p></speech>

Not to take away from the other subject which has arisen, which was before my time, for me and for my generation it beggars belief that this took place in our lifetime.</p> <p>  Could the witnesses flesh out in more detail why they would prefer an independent body administering this instead of Tusla?  The witnesses mentioned how it is when children reach the age of 18 years that they are most at risk.  Could they flesh out the areas of improvement they would like to see to help children who are reaching adulthood during that transition period?</p></speech>

I have previous experience of working as a barrister with a guardian <i>ad litem</i>and I have been through that process so I understand how the court process works.  It appears that the legal representation provided to a guardian <i>ad litem</i>is almost a certainty; most guardians <i>ad litem</i>are represented in court.  The proposals with regard to the qualifications that a guardian <i>ad litem</i>should possess include that they should be a qualified social worker with five years experience.  If the guardian <i>ad litem</i>is to retain the ability to make court applications and engage in those legal processes, do the witnesses feel that those qualifications are sufficient or should some legal training be provided?  The huge cost associated with the guardian <i>ad litem</i>is often the hiring of their barrister.  If the guardian <i>ad litem</i>wants to retain the ability to make these applications, which are quite basic and over time they would be making the same applications time and again, how would witnesses feel about the development of a one year diploma course or certificate in legal studies, for instance, that each guardian <i>ad litem</i>would have to achieve before they would be able to act in that particular capacity?  This is a long-term plan but maybe it is something that we should work towards in terms of efficiency and cost saving and getting rid of the necessity to hire a barrister on every occasion.</p><p>I agree with the presumption of representation or the presumption of a guardian<i>ad litem</i>being appointed.  Every child should have representation in court and it should not be at the discretion of one individual.  However, I would say that the justice system does act very well in this regard and judges would be very mindful of this.  The application can come either from the Child and Family Services, parents, the guardian, the court, so there are a number of checks and balances there to ensure that a guardian <i>ad litem</i>is appointed if needed.  There are probably very few cases where a guardian <i>ad litem</i>is not appointed where one is needed but I agree that in law we should enshrine the presumption that one would be appointed.  That is a very sensible approach.  </p><p>Fears were expressed by Deputy Rabbitte and others about retaining the services under the remit of Tusla, but I wonder if we move it to somewhere else, do we get rid of those risks or would we create other problems?  We could have the same problems with another organisation.  Can we work with what is there to put further checks and balances in place and see if that service works properly?  I agree with Deputy Rabbitte that it is an organisation in its infancy and instead of discarding that link we could work to improve it and address the concerns that have been expressed around that.  Ultimately, we want to ensure that the guardian <i>ad litem</i>offers an independent assessment and recommendation to the court, that they feel they can operate independently of any other organisation or body and that there is no fear in doing that.</p><p>What checks and balances can be put in place to ensure that continues?  At the end of the day, guardians <i>ad litem</i>will be paid from public funds and, therefore, there will always be a link to the State.  Perhaps we can make it more tenuous by putting them at a further remove but the link will always be there.  How can we ensure that an independent assessment will always be forthcoming and there will be no fear on behalf of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>in providing that?</p></speech>

To balance that statement and put it in context, however, more than 90% of the children in State care cost &euro;300 a week.</p><p>I have many issues with the guardian <i>ad litem</i>system.  I am a foster carer but it is disgusting that up to &euro;15 million a year is paid to people to represent a child in court when I cannot access speech and language therapy for a child in my house who has difficulty speaking or access psychological services and supports for a child who is distracted by her home situation.

The figures are published by Tusla and within our own published accounts.  Barnardos was paid approximately &euro;3.2 million last year in respect of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>service it provides.  That covered approximately 30 guardians and 800 children.  On average, a guardian works with 25 children a year.  Guardians are, by and large, employed as independent contractors by Barnardos on a contract for service.  They earn, on average, &euro;75,000 a year, which is the same as a social work team leader.  Some earn more, some earn less.  The cost to Tusla on a per child basis is approximately &euro;4,500.<br/><br/>I agree with the Chairman.  There are forms of care which cost very little and the best form of care is the foster care arrangement, which works well for the child and costs very little.  Keeping children in care in that way in relationships that work well for them is hugely beneficial to the child and to the child's development but it is also very cost effective because the moment a child needs to go into residential care, the costs multiply significantly.  If guardians can help to keep a child out of the residential care system and, particularly, out of the secure care system, they will save the State an enormous amount.  That might sound like special pleading but I do not mean it to be that way.<br/><br/>The Chairman declared a special interest and I should also.  It is intended that after this Bill is passed, there will be a tender for a national provider.  Barnardos will be a competitor in that process.  We may or may not be appointed.  Whatever happens, what we want is that the best system will emerge.  In any definition of the best system, value for money has to be included.  There are no two ways around that.  Some of the costs involved are indefensible and they need to be addressed.<br/><br/>In response to Deputy Chambers, one of the ways they will be addressed is that a requirement of the tender, as we understand it, will be that the new agency to be established will have an in-house legal resource for the precise purpose of ensuring guardians have more training and more access to advice and so on, and they will not always have to have a legal resource standing beside them when they are in court.  Currently, particularly in the Dublin area, most cases involving guardians also involve a solicitor, although Ms McKittrick will know better.  One in ten or 11 involves a barrister and they tend to be the more complex cases.  The right way to get that cost down is to have a system in place where the provider is obliged to support the guardian with an internal resource.  That would be cheaper and more effective and would result in guardians being over time much more independent of the legal profession to meet the Deputy's point.<br/><br/>I feel as passionately as the Chairman about the fact that every penny spent on this is not a penny spent somewhere where it is desperately needed.  Like him, I have spent 30 years advocating for speech therapy and other essential services.  It is a false choice to say that if children are deprived of their voice in court at a moment life changing decisions are being made about them, the speech therapy service or other support services that they need can be more easily afforded.  These are not choices we should ask children to make.</p></speech>

The funding would be ring-fenced.  I accept the Deputy's point that if an organisation is to be set up under public procurement, it has to have proper governance.  There is no governance at the moment.  People practising as guardians <i>ad litem</i>come into Barnardos on a voluntary basis; they do not have to do so.  They can work elsewhere or by themselves.  There is no regulation at the moment and that was highlighted in chapter 11 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's annual report in 2015.  It is a free-for-all, leading to the kind of difficulties the Chairman is experiencing.  The argument that is held up is that to get a guardian, we are sacrificing resources for Tusla.  We need to get this out from under Tusla in order that we do not have to make such choices.<br/><br/>On the legal questions, currently the spend is balanced 50:50 between guardian <i>ad litem</i>practice and guardian <i>ad litem</i>legal fees and we have no oversight regarding the fees.  The proposed scheme would provide for a legal department and it would allow us to properly examine legal fees, obtain much better value for money in respect of the legal requirement that is needed, and to get on with our practice while opting for legal representation only when it is needed.  It would allow the service to take an overview on when it was required.  It is important the guardians <i>ad litem</i>have a proper standing in court and that they are properly equipped.<br/><br/>Deputy O'Sullivan asked how it can be made a presumption.  Under head eight, if a child is going to the High Court for special care, which means that he or she will be detained and their liberty will be restricted in the specialist care unit, a guardian <i>ad litem</i>will be appointed.  Subsection (2) states, &quot;If a child is the District Court or Circuit Court, a <i>guardian ad litem</i>may be appointed&quot;.  The intention is that will become the norm but that is not strong enough.  If that were to say, &quot;...a <i>guardian ad litem</i>will be appointed save in exceptional circumstances&quot;, that would allow the court to say one was not needed in this case.</p></speech>

In 13% of cases in Galway, guardians are appointed while it is more than 80% of cases in Louth.  I am a guardian and I work on the ground.  The child care cases in Galway are the same as they are in Louth and the difficulties and challenges children face in the courts are just the same.</p><p>The case studies that we have submitted contain sensitive information that has been anonymised and details have been changed but they are based on real children.  Sally did not have a guardian until the day she was taken into a special care unit.  She did not have a guardian when she was in an adult psychiatric ward.  She did not have a guardian when she was sent home to her mother when she was six.  She got one when she went into special care and her guardian and social worker worked hand in hand with the Child and Family Agency to obtain resources.  By having a guardian working alongside the social worker, the latter was able to access resources that had not previously been available to Sally.  This is the kind of work that we do on the ground.<br/><br/>An element of the Bill that worries me is that guardians <i>ad litem</i>, GALs, are not allowed to cross-examine witnesses.  We do not go to court everyday to cross-examine witnesses but when a question arises as to the quality of care that a child has received, we must be able to ask questions of the social workers and the parents if they want their children returned to their care.<br/><br/>Another element refers to how the guardian will not request an assessment in respect of a child.  A child might need speech and language therapy or psychological intervention but we cannot ask for that as his or her guardians.  Were the provision to read &quot;the guardian may not require&quot; and require us to make a court application, that would be fine, but to say that we cannot cross-examine or request more information puts us in the back seat and takes away from what we are able to do now.  We do a great deal of valuable work but there are many more Graces out there as well.  That is our worry.  When a child who is among the quarter of children who are represented approaches 18 years of age, we are able to argue for a robust aftercare plan for him or her, but we do not know whether the same is happening for the remaining 75%.  Tusla's aftercare policy, a matter that we will raise directly with that body, states that children with moderate learning disabilities will not get aftercare workers because that is the HSE's job.  There is a gap, which leads to the concern that children with borderline mild-to-moderate learning disabilities are being put into community placements without sufficient protections for their welfare.</p></speech>

When children are subjected to abuse and neglect, the Constitution empowers the State to intervene in a proportionate manner.  It can be an intervention in family life, but that can deprive a child of his or her family.  It is one of the most serious decisions that can be made about a child.  Children have a right to have their voices heard and to participate in proceedings, they have a right to fair procedures under the Constitution, and they have rights in the care system.  It is a complex area of law, which would explain why there must be a presumption to have a GAL placed and why legal representation in these proceedings is required.</p></speech>

As Ms Ward stated, this is a complex area, so it is important that everyone be represented on an equal basis.</p> <p>  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan asked what the GAL system would look like in practice.  Our recommendation is that a child who requires a GAL should be designated as a party to the proceedings through that GAL.  In this way, the child would have a solicitor.  If the child is not designated, however, that would not be the case.  By being a designated party, the child's voice would be heard and the GAL would have legal representation.  In this way, GALs would have equal standing with children who were joined directly and all other parties to the case, including Tusla and parents.</p></speech>

Political and legal accountability for GALs is a major issue.  As Ms McKittrick stated, there are no governance arrangements or regulation of the GAL system.  Establishing the service and regulating it in law are the first steps.  From a legal point of view, GALs can be held accountable by judges, the other parties to a case, Tusla's lawyers and parents' lawyers.  This is how it will happen in court.  Politically, the State can hold the GAL service accountable.</p> <p>  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, working directly with the service, is how the system is structured in the Bill, but this raises an issue of independence in that the service's independence could be undermined by imposing too many restrictions and regulations and not funding it properly, which would mean that it could not provide an appropriate service.  This matter needs to be considered.</p> <p>  The issue with placing the service with Tusla is that we live in a small country, so one can imagine the impact on local relationships if a GAL presents a view that opposes that of the Child and Family Agency.  What will happen to that information and where will it go?  We need to put procedures and barriers in place so as to ensure that there is no possibility of political interference or even the appearance of same.  Often, the GAL could be in agreement with Tusla's decision, so it is important that we know that that has been done independently as opposed to because the GAL is being funded directly by Tusla or there is a close relationship between the two.  This important issue of accountability needs to be considered.</p> <p>  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan asked about broader independent representation for children in care.  Tusla funds Empowering People in Care, EPIC, to provide an independent advocacy service for children in care.  This is an important measure, so the service must be properly funded, but having a legal service specifically for the courts is also important.  Perhaps the two could be merged at some point.</p> <p>  Regarding training and qualifications, GALs could be trained in a range of fields that would build their capacity to provide a good service, for example, listening to children, working with children who have experienced trauma, and various forms of legal training.  Training in how to be questioned and cross-examined is a major part of that.  Social workers in Tusla and others must go before courts, but being questioned by judges and lawyers is difficult, so this is an important part of their training.</p> <p>  This matter could be addressed in the legislation, not by specifying what type of training people get, but by specifying that they should get training on a regular basis.  There are similar provisions for solicitors.  For example, they must amass so many continuing professional development points annually.  The same could be imposed on GALs, so they would have to update their own training and experience constantly.</p></speech>

He referred to it being an either-or choice but that was not my point.  Previous committees to this one did not do their work.  That is why we are where we are and &euro;15 million or &euro;16 million per year is being spent on GALs, who are unregulated and unaccounted for.  In any language, that is wanton waste.  The reason for this is the language - mother's apple pie, the voice of the child and however else it is referenced.  We must remove the emotion and deal with the hard, cold, clinical facts.  There is a finite amount of money for looking after our most vulnerable asset, namely, children who are in need of care from the State.  We must ensure that that is done to the best of our ability, which means that we must discuss money.  That is why I am at a loss regarding the figures.</p> <p>  I have a bias, but to put it in context, Barnardos spent &euro;3.5 million on providing a voice for 800 children in court.  For 300 children, that &euro;3.5 million would have provided food, a roof over their heads, warmth, love and everything else in a home for 365 days of the year.</p></speech>

When I talk about choices I am asking if we, as a State, are happy to allow that kind of wanton waste and exaggerated costs and fees to give the child a voice in court when we neglect so many other areas?  To put that in context, the &euro;3.5 million would provide 300 children with a roof over their heads, love, warmth and food 365 days a year and would provide a voice in court for 800 children.  I am not saying that the voice in court is not needed.  Of course it is needed, but there is something wrong if we are allowing that to happen, and it is our fault.  I do not expect Barnardos to have raised the cost of guardians <i>ad litem</i>, GALs, as an issue.  It would not make any sense for it to do that, but we, and our predecessors, should have examined this issue and asked questions about it.  That is where I am coming from in this regard.</p><p>I want to make a point about taking the service from Tusla to ensure independence.  I do not accept that argument.  Tusla has many franchises and avenues.  To distil that down to the logic the witness is putting forward, I should not be allowed comment on Tusla in terms of the foster care system.  We are all impacted by and connected through Tusla.  It would be great if another budget was created somewhere else.  A previous speaker made the point that this did not come out of the Tusla budget but if we create another agency, more layers of management and accountability or whatever, that will swallow up massive amounts of the finite resources available that I want to see going to the areas where they are needed.  Somebody mentioned early trauma, intervention and care.  That is a huge area and if we could get the funding to address that, it would massively transform the area of children in care.  There are many possibilities in that regard but we have to watch where the finances are allocated.  I do not believe taking it from the remit of Tusla makes any sense on a financial level.</p></speech>

The difference between the voice of the child in court and the right of the child to access speech and language therapy is that the child has a constitutional right to have their voice heard in court.  Unfortunately, the child currently does not have a constitutional right to speech and language therapy.  We believe children should have that right.  That is one of the rights that children have in the Constitution and it is fundamental that it is protected.  I agree completely with the Chairman.  We failed as a country to regulate the system and it has resulted in massive costs.  Why are some GALs getting paid &euro;300,000 a year?  That is potentially more than some of the judges and some legal practitioners in the system.  I agree with the Chairman.  The fact that the Minister and the Department are moving to regulate this area is very important.</p> <p>  In terms of Tusla versus the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, we will not be creating another body by allowing the Department to directly manage the money going to this service.  The creation of a new body would be if a new public body was established that involved some level of costs.  Overall, in terms of the funding for the service, there will be more demands on the service but not every child needs the same level of support and representation.  It is only if a particular problem arises on a case, and that is where the GAL needs to act.  If we have regulation of a service, we will have value for money.  The current pot of money will be better spent on the current cohort of children in the care system.  The point to consider is that we will get a better service for the pot of money available to us.  We might not get any savings but more children might be provided with a better quality service.</p></speech>

It is one we need to examine and make sure that whatever is set up brings the maximum amount of benefit for vulnerable children out of whatever money is available.  That goes without saying.  There is a broader issue about the cost of legal systems in general, which is much broader than our committee's remit, but the enormous amounts of money spent on legal representation at tribunals etc. is a major issue.  I support the Chairman's point that we need to examine the issue of value for money in this area but at the same time representation of their voice in court is the right of the child.  Other people get legal representation to have their voice heard in court.  It is about getting that balance right.</p></speech>

The current system is one whereby 60 to 70 people are enabled, by law and by practice, to invoice the State for work they have done, get that bill paid in an <i>ad hoc</i>, unregulated way.  This Bill is proposing to replace that with proper accountability and regulation and better value for money.  The Chairman has fought for children in his care.  Many of us, as parents, have fought for children in our care.  What I know for certain is that the child who has somebody to fight for them will be better off than the child who has nobody to fight for them, but it is not enough to say that.  It has to be done in a way that is properly accountable to the State and to the taxpayer.  If the Chairman says to me that there has been waste in the system up to now, I will not disagree with that.  If we achieve nothing else through this debate other than a sense that we are all committed to providing a value for money system which is capable of delivering real care, prevention and outcomes that save the State money in the long term and that enable other resources to be put into prevention and early intervention for all children, then that is a good thing.</p></speech>

He then said in terms of GALs operating independently or from other service providers it is costing the State approximately &euro;4,500 per child.  It is already operating on a more conservative basis than other service providers but those two figures alone have highlighted the lack of regulation and the fact that money is floating around, so to speak, and that no one is accountable for it.  Paying &euro;2,800 per child, which is the average figure Mr. Finlay gave for Barnardos, is a good deal of money for a court process for one child and one GAL.  It might be wise for the committee to seek to have sight of the terms of the tender process.  What the Department is seeking from a service provider in terms of the service they will provide and the legal aspect is the key.</p></speech>

Barnardos has very little control because there is a market rate.  Its legal costs will still be quite high.  In reality the salary of an in-house solicitor is also still quite high.  Barnardos needs to address the legal qualifications its GALs possess to do their work.  I do not see anything wrong with this.  If Barnardos requires a person to be a qualified social worker and have five years' industry experience, why not train him or her to do court work?  If his or her full-time job will be to operate in court and Barnardos wants him or her to retain the ability to cross-examine and make court applications, he or she is essentially performing a qualified legal role.  Why not have him or her properly trained to do it?  As a long-term plan, if Barnardos intends to be a service provider or compete for that role, it should think about this.  It will not happen in a year's time, but it may happen in five or ten years and Barnardos will have properly qualified people to do the work.</p></speech>

I have a passion for the well-being of all our children and I hope the work we do together will enable and ensure that, ultimately, none of our children will be othered in our State.</p> <p>  The Revised Estimate for my Department for 2017 provides a gross funding provision of &euro;1.311 billion.  This represents an increase of &euro;173 million, or 16%, over the 2016 allocation.  This is a significant investment of taxpayers money and I am very grateful for the trust and confidence being shown towards me and my Department as we lead on our objective to improve the outcomes for children and young people in Ireland in that some of their dreams will come true, they will be loved, cared for, protected and safe.  I remain fully committed to ensuring the full delivery of this Government&rsquo;s programme for Government commitments.  I want to see an Ireland where the rights of all children and young people are respected, protected, fulfilled, where their voices are heard and where they are supported to realise their maximum potential now and in the future.  I remember at this moment the four year old boy I met in a community centre in Togher, County Cork, and Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire was with me there.  I spent quite a bit of time with the child in order to enable him to speak with me, getting down on my knees and having a chat with him.  I am also remembering the mother I met in one of Ireland's top legal firms when I went there to speak in the context of how to influence the influencers.  She spoke of how proud she was of her eight year old trans boy.</p><p> My Department, and its agencies, have a complex range of policy, legislation and services to deliver on.  Examples of this range from: initiatives to improve the level and quality of early childhood care and education; providing for the needs of children and young people in the care of the State; providing services to protect children against child abuse and to provide help and support to children and their families when that, unfortunately, happens; providing adoption services and; listening to children, learning from them, and finding out what works when we look to improve their lives.  We listened to young people when we gathered some together to hear about what Brexit means for them.  The Acting Chairman, Deputy Rabbitte, Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire and other public representatives were present.</p><p> As I noted, I have received a significant increase in funding in 2017 for which I am very grateful.  This funding will allow for a range of key service developments.  The most significant in terms of the level of increased funding relates to the provision of an additional &euro;120 million for early years care and education services.  The additional funding will be directed towards a suite of measures to improve the affordability, accessibility and quality of child care.  That brings the total allocation for early years child care and education to &euro;465 million, accounting for nearly 36% of my Department's overall allocation.  That level of funding allows for the extension of the ECCE scheme into a second year and the further full roll-out of the access and inclusion model.  Just the other day when we finally acknowledged and recognised the ethnicity of Travellers I had a long conversation with my assistant secretary, Bernie McNally, on how to ensure the access and inclusion model is also about including Travellers.  We also aim to provide more targeted child care subsidisation for lower income families as a first step and; to provide for universal subsidisation towards the cost of care for all children aged from six months to three years who are using regulated child care.  I met the early years forum we have established the other day and we looked especially at childminders in that regard.  I am also conscious that we need to assist making the child care sector more sustainable and some of the additional funding in 2017 will be used to acknowledge non-contact time required to deliver high-quality services.  It is an initial important step in terms of doing that kind of work to ensure sustainability but some funding has also been provided to enhance inspections and registration schemes to ensure services are delivered in a safe, supportive and caring environment.</p><p> I also welcome an additional investment of &euro;37 million for Tusla in 2017.  Tusla now has an annual allocation of some &euro;713 million which, I am confident, allows it develop as a sustainable organisation which will standardise, streamline and improve its services to children and families.  As Members well know, this agency provides services for some of the most vulnerable children and families in the State.  The extra funding in 2017 will allow it to further alleviate service pressures in respect of matters such as unallocated caseloads, private residential and foster care and services relating to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  It will also allow Tusla to continue to prepare for the introduction of mandatory reporting under Children First later this year.</p><p> As we all know, it has been a challenging time for Tusla.  One of the challenges it continues to face is the bringing together of various cultures and legacies from the HSE, the National Educational Welfare Board, NEWB, and the Family Support Agency, FSA, when it came together to establish itself and move forward with the intention and ambition to provide the best care and protection for children.  I had a recent meeting with the board in Cork to discuss the challenges and the ways in which it has reassured me that it will do all that it can to meet the ambition both in its vision and mission and also in its upcoming business plan for 2017.</p><p> The significant additional resources secured for 2017 will allow my Department and its agencies build on the good work by all involved in working with children and families to deliver on the Government's commitment to fundamentally reform the delivery of services.  As far as I, as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, am concerned, in terms of delivering on the Government's commitment and the reform of services I can do it better with the input, criticism, constructive suggestions and support of committee members.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions.  First, I very much welcome the increase in funding for the Department, which is up by 16%.  I am sure the money will be put to very good use.  A total of &euro;1.6 million is available by way of capital carryover.  Could the Minister indicate what capital investment was not completed last year?</p> <p>  There seems to be an increase in spending on sectoral programmes for children and young people.  Could the Minister provide detail to the committee on what programmes they are and what is being done this year?</p> <p>  Specifically, in terms of the spending on Tusla, the children and family support programme is &euro;743 million of expenditure for 2017, which is broken down into seven subheads, one of which relates to other current expenditure programmes.  Out of the &euro;730 million or so being spent for this year, approximately &euro;43 million will be spent on these programmes.  Could the Minister explain what is involved?</p> <p>  There appears also to be an increase in pay and administration for the agency for this year.  Could the Minister also explain where that money is going?  We do not appear to have a breakdown from Tusla on what it is spending its money on.  No performance information is provided to the committee on where the money is going and I would be interested to hear in more detail about where Tusla is spending its allocation.</p> <p>  One of the biggest complaints I receive as an elected representative relates to the provision of social workers.  How many social workers are currently employed by Tusla?  Does the expenditure on social workers come under the heading of administration and pay?  What is the projected expenditure for 2017 in respect of social workers and how does it compare with last year?  Are we spending more on social workers this year and if we are, how much?  Does the Department have any plans to employ additional social workers this year?  Are there currently any vacancies and if so, how many positions remain to be filled?  When does the Minister expect to fill the vacancies?</p> <p>  Could the Minister provide some detail on the children and young people's services committee, CYPSC?  I understand new co-ordinators were hired across the country towards the end of last year and perhaps some are being put in place this year.  How many committees are currently up and running?  How many co-ordinators do we have in place?  Could the Minister undertake to provide a performance report to the committee at the earliest convenience?  It would be useful for the committee to perhaps have the national co-ordinator of those committees appear before the joint committee to give an update to members as to how the new programme is working.</p></speech>

This time last year, much of the discussion related to Tusla's efforts to deal with the number of unallocated cases and also to ensure that all children would be provided with aftercare plans on the commencement of the legislation.</p><p>Towards the end of last year, Tusla indicated that it was aiming to increase the number of social workers by between 150 and 200 as compared with the previous 16 months.  Is it roughly on target to meet that objective?  How many social workers in excess of this number will be required over the next 12 months?  Will the Minister comment on how far the recruitment of these additional social workers will go towards addressing the unallocated cases in accordance with Tusla's main priorities?</p><p> I will comment briefly on capital expenditure, which has been increased under a number of heads.  There will be increased demand for child care services and, consequently, a need for community facilities, many of which are directly funded through Tusla.  Will increased funding be provided this year and in the coming years to develop community child care facilities in locations and settings other than those set out in programme C?</p></speech>

Obviously, the funding of the schemes falls under a different programme not provided for under this head.</p> <p>  Chart 3 shows a 10% increase in expenditure for subhead A4, youth justice and children's detention centres.  I understood the term "children's detention centres" would not longer be used.  Obviously, capital expenditure was one of the major issues at the Oberstown campus where there was a lengthy snag list of more than 20 items, some of which were small while others were substantial.  Does the Minister anticipate that a 10% increase in funding will be sufficient to address all the deficiencies in buildings and so forth at Oberstown?</p></speech>

Funding should continue to increase on the back of improving economic circumstances and decreasing unemployment.  I echo many of the questions asked by Deputy Lisa Chambers.  On administration non-pay versus the ECCE preschool programme, will the Minister flesh out the reasons for the 31% increase in the allocation for non-pay administration costs?  Is it connected with the 41% increase provided for the preschool programme?  If so, what is the breakdown of both figures?  How does the administration system operate?  Is it electronic or paper based?  Investment in technology tends to bear fruit by reducing administrative costs.  This may creep into the capital area.</p></speech>

If I do not answer any of the questions, I ask Deputies to come back to me.</p> <p>  In general, many of the questions raised by Deputy Lisa Chambers will be answered in the Tusla business plan, which will be published on Friday, 10 March.  Extensive discussions at official level and my ministerial performance statement have helped in the development of the 2017 business plan and the priorities I have identified will guide the plan.  As I indicated, I met the chair, chief executive officer and board of Tusla.  In 2017, Tusla expenditure will focus on a number of areas.  This is the second year in a three-year initiative to tackle the issue of child protection cases awaiting allocation to a social worker.  I will address the specific question on social work recruitment targets in a moment.  The additional funding provided will allow Tusla to continue its challenging programme of recruiting social workers.  </p> <p>  Tusla will continue its preparatory work in advance of the introduction of mandatory reporting under the Children First Act.  Adoption is also part of its plan to ensure it is in a position to implement the provisions of the Adoption (Amendment) Bill, which we are about to complete, and the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill, Second Stage of which will begin in the Seanad later this month.  There will also be a focus on aftercare to ensure Tusla meets its statutory obligation in respect of children leaving care and aftercare supports.</p> <p>  I will discuss a number of other aspects of the plan if Deputies wish.  However, I would like to address more specifically the ongoing issue of Tusla's social work recruitment targets.  In September 2015, Tusla published its three-year plan, From Survival to Sustainability, which estimated that 268 additional social workers or 1,627 whole-time equivalent social workers were needed to address the unallocated cases during the timeframe of the plan.  With only 250 social workers graduating each year, the labour market is highly competitive.  I have directed my officials to contact CORU and the Higher Education Authority to discuss the number of social workers graduating and how it can be increased.  However, it will be some time before an increase in graduate numbers is achieved. </p> <p>  Tusla has taken a proactive approach to recruitment, including recruiting social workers outside the jurisdiction.  The organisation currently has 1,467 whole-time equivalent social workers and the end target for 2017 is 1,520.  This target is short of the target set in From Survival to Sustainability by approximately 100 whole-time equivalent social workers, which reflects the constraints in labour supply.  Tusla will continue to prioritise the recruitment of an additional 100 family support practitioners, 166 social care staff and 125 administrative staff to allow social workers to focus on their care work with children and their families.</p> <p>  Deputy Lisa Chambers asked a question about pay in Tusla.  The allocation for 2017 is approximately &euro;217 million or 38% of overall expenditure.</p> <p>  Recruitment is directly related to the issue of unallocated cases.  Deputies will be aware that the Tusla chief executive officer recently stated that the recruitment of social workers was ongoing.</p><p>The funding is in place to achieve the recruitment.  The recruitment environment is proving to be challenging.</p><p> On its impact in regard to unallocated cases, when Tusla was set up there were almost 10,000 unallocated cases.  This was reduced to 5,413 at the end of 2016, which is a 20% reduction in 2016 alone.  Of the 5,413 unallocated cases, 801 of them were classified as high priority, 3,262 medium priority and 1,350 of low priority.  One of the points I would like to particularly communicate here too today is that there was a downward trend in the numbers of unallocated cases from the beginning of 2016 to October last but that was reversed at the end of the year.  The number of unallocated cases increased then by over 1,100 in the final two months.  Tusla has advised me that this was due to challenges in the area of social work recruitment.</p><p> The question on the Oberstown Children Detention Campus was whether the moneys allow for the completion of the repair works.  The capital allocation of &euro;3.25 million includes funding provision for a range of remedial and improvement works that were identified - I also noted the need for some of these in my visits to the campus, and I note the committee visited there too - as being required following a period of operation of new facilities and several incidents, such as damage to the new and previously existing facilities by the young people.  Two of the previously existing units are due to come back into operation in March of 2017 following remedial works and the demolition of a third unit, which was severely damaged by the fire.  Other works have commenced and will be replicated in all of the residential units across the campus during 2017.  The full cost of all of these works has yet to be established as there are some ongoing design elements involved, including the identification of alternative door design.  In my first visit to Oberstown, the issue of doors, and how to design them in a way that is appropriate, both for the living environment of the young people who are there but also to provide the security that is require, continues to be challenging, not only nationally but also internationally.</p><p> I will address the capital investment in child care that Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire raised.  Needless to say, capital investment will be required.  We all would agree with that.  As the affordable scheme is rolled out and more families avail of high quality affordable child care, I will soon announce &euro;3 million in capital funding for early years in 2017.  On Monday last, I announced &euro;4 million in capital funding for school-age child care.  I will seek more investment next year and beyond.</p><p> In regard to the capital carryover from 2016, the school-age child care capital funding was not spent in 2016.  That is because the Department was finalising an action plan with the Department of Education and Skills in that regard.  I am delighted to have launched that school-age child care action plan this week and the associated &euro;3 million capital scheme to increase the number of high quality after school places as well.  There was also an underspend in the youth requirements but I can assure the Deputy that will be spent in 2017.</p><p> Deputy Lisa Chambers asked a question about the administration.  Was it in regard to the Department itself?</p></speech>

I will revert to her with the exact numbers of CYPSCs that are up and running because I do not have the exact figure here.  I understand that the system is well operational now.  A national co-ordinator is in place and is engaging well with the communities at local level.  There is a national implementation group that promotes good inter-agency working.  I met the group a number of months ago and the Deputy's question prompts me to think that it would be useful for me to meet it again.  That is as much as I can answer that question now.</p> <p>  Let me see whether there are other questions outstanding.  Are we okay?  I can provide some more priorities in regard to the Tusla programme for 2017.</p></speech>

What is the authority doing about it?  For example, in my constituency, GMIT, on the Mayo campus, has a new social work course with students going through it.  In terms of uptake it is one of their most successful courses.  I would imagine if other colleges were to run a similar course, there is demand from prospective students for them.  Is the HEA planning to bring other courses online or to increase the capacity in the existing institutes of technologies and universities to churn out more graduates?</p></speech>

Apologies, I meant to say we will engage.  We are just about to have the discussions with the HEA.  We have been planning to do exactly as the Deputy identified.</p> <p>  I would make two points here, specifically, in regard to social workers.  More places need to be created at third level for the significant numbers of young people who want to avail of those place.  Until that happens, one action in the Tusla active recruitment programme is that it must look outside of the country, to Northern Ireland, the UK and beyond, in order to attract social workers here.  This is probably more a medium-term ambition.  If the Deputy has views in that regard or anything that she wants to provide to me and my Department, I would be more than happy to consider them.  In coming into office, this is one of the first items on which I would have had discussions with the Department stating this is what we need to aim for.  The other point is we need to create more places.  I understand that is a big ask and it is good to know we are about to engage in those discussions.</p> <p>  The other aspect, in terms of higher education, that we have been speaking about that also influences the challenges in recruitment, particularly within Tusla so that we have who we need for unallocated cases and also working for the care and protection of children, is the issue around the qualifications for social care workers.  We have been looking a lot at that, more from a third level education perspective, to ensure that we support and encourage that the programmes, and content of the curriculum of the many such courses, are geared and reformed in an ongoing way to the challenges in the work, particularly in the care and protection of children.  Many in my Department are working on and committed to that.</p> <p>  As I have stated on a number of occasions in other contexts, it is important to emphasise that it is not only about social workers.  I do not mean these comments by way of explicit criticism of the current programmes and degrees for social care workers.  Those working in this field are aware of the challenges.  We are merely identifying that it would be important in ongoing conversations to ensure that there is a match between what is required in terms of the ongoing challenges in caring for children and what is going on in the workplace, particularly in light of the Tusla requirements on social care workers.</p><p>Social care staff, administrative staff, etc. can reduce the burden on social workers.  Many members will probably have heard the complaint or concern that social workers are sometimes  caught up in doing more administrative work than they wish.  Therefore, we need to increase the number of social workers. </p><p> The Government has provided the money to me in terms of meetings to ensure that pressure is maintained to tackle recruitment issues.  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan has raised the retention of workers before.  I know that Tusla is addressing the matter, particularly in its plans for 2017.  </p></speech>

I personally know people who studied social work in college and, at a later stage, undertook counselling courses or moved into another area because they  found social work very difficult.  Has an attempt been made to attract older qualified people who went in different directions in Ireland, apart from going abroad?  We all want, and I know that the Minister wants, to ensure that we can allocate social workers for all the children in care and for other purposes within the Department as well.</p> <p>  Are we discussing all of the programmes now?  </p></speech>

The figure compares favourably with England where the average turnover was 17% in 2014.</p> <p>  Over the past number of months I have met with a couple of organisations which represent social care workers and social workers.  The Deputy has rightly identified the challenges of working at the coalface, particularly in the context of Tusla and the work that is required of social workers.  That work is sometimes more difficult than the other kinds of jobs that social workers can access and be employed in.  Representations have been made to me.  I am fully aware of the situation and have shared that experience with the senior management of Tusla whom I meet on a quarterly basis.  They are aware of the concerns too.  I can supply the Deputy with more information at a later point if she so wishes.  Tusla is very focused on finding ways to improve retention policies and practices, whether through employee assistance programmes or other initiatives.  Staff retention is not only a recruitment issue.  As the Deputy has said, social work is not just a money issue.  Resources are available.  We must find ways to improve the ongoing supports available to social workers in the context of Tusla to retain staff.  </p> <p>  Retaining staff is a challenge but Tusla has adopted a number of approaches to address the problem.  Recruitment is one aspect.  We must have an internal transfer list to help people to work in areas nearer their homes.</p> <p>  In terms of attracting new people, interviews have taken place, panels have been established and positions offered.  I will get the exact figure from my accompanying staff.  Some of the offers have not been availed of because the posts are not close to where people live.  Location raises particular issues.  Tusla is trying to address the problem, along with the professional organisations.  Indeed, they are also focused on continuing professional development, employee welfare initiatives and managed caseloads for newly qualified staff.  These measures will address recruitment and provide support to people in order to encourage them to stay.  </p></speech>

I mean staff who can head up investigations into historical cases.  There are 5,000 historical cases but an ordinary person cannot work in such a department.  Has funding been set aside to bring back people with relevant experience, who can manage teams, demonstrate  leadership, give direction and deal with historical cases?</p> <p>  The CEO of Tusla was in here two weeks ago.  I asked him whether historical cases were high, low or medium priority.  I was told that present day child welfare cases are high priority whereas historical cases would not be as high a priority.  To me, historical cases should enjoy the same priority as present day cases.  We do not have the manpower in place.  Have historical cases been pitched at the right qualified staff?  Have they been encouraged to come forward to lead teams?  Will they be supported?</p> <p>  I have a question on ICT.  It is hard to retain and recruit staff if they do not have the tools to do their job.  I have met a lot of social care workers and some of them told me that they did not have the ICT tools to do their job.  </p> <p>  My final question is on family resource centres.  </p></speech>

It was interesting to hear about the recruitment issues.  We have a very high number of unallocated cases.  I am sure the Minister is concerned about the matter, in particular the 800 odd high priority cases.  Granted, graduate issues exist but if there is a quick fix then it should focus on ensuring that the absolute maximum amount of administrative work and similar work is reduced for social workers through the use of support staff.  Resources for a quick fix should focus on reducing administrative work and enhancing the amount of contact time.</p></speech>

The first questions were about Tusla dealing with historical cases and the particular expertise required to do so.  It is an excellent question.  Tusla is setting up an expert team to deal with historical cases.  The chief executive officer wrote to my Secretary General last Friday to indicate it would be happening perhaps as a result of ongoing engagement and particularly the Deputy's engagement with the committee.</p> <p>  With regard to the 60% of all referrals to Tusla which are directed to family support services, this area is also being developed.  </p> <p>  The Deputy asked a question on ICT, which I appreciate very much and know is a particular concern of hers.  Let me outline where things are at and why it is such a challenge.  In 2017, the funding that Tusla requested for the national child care information system has been provided with capital funding of approximately &euro;4 million to support the development and roll out of it.  It is scheduled to roll out to at least three additional areas in 2017 and roll-out of the system nationally is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2018.  The question then is why the progress of the roll-out has been so slow.  To identify the number of technical issues that have hindered the project's progress, it was essential to ensure that all users of the system were on a single domain so information could be integrated and shared.  It was also important to ensure networks were upgraded to facilitate the use of the NCCIS and progress has been made in resolving these technical issues, which it is anticipated will facilitate the continued roll-out of the system in 2017.  It is also helpful to know the project requires formal approval at all stages from the peer review group of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Tusla also had a formal meeting with the peer review group of NCCIS in February 2017.  It is awaiting approval to progress to the next stage of the project.  We are seeing this in lots of different instances in my Department and across Departments.  When there is a roll-out of an information technology system of such magnitude, there are not only technical issues but several layers of management of the process.  Within the Department or agency, a project management board usually oversees it and there are potentially peer review processes as well.  There is also the Office of the Chief Information Officer, OCIO.  Unfortunately many of these roll-outs are slower than what was anticipated initially but I have tried to provide the Deputy with information on their ambition and with all the supports what will be happening in 2017.  We want to get it right.  </p> <p>  The Deputy also asked questions about family resource centres.  There are 109.  I was much helped by meeting with representatives of the family resource centre network recently.  They raised a number of issues on what would enable them to continue to develop.  We have been able to provide some additional funding for 2017, in other words, a slight increase in funding.  They identified funding issues and what is really required for them to move towards sustainability and increase the reach of their work.  The allocated funding in 2016 was &euro;13.51 million.  They identified a need for significantly more money for that.  They talked about the need for at least three staff members in each centre.  We are aware of that.  They indicated the budget will not be increased in 2017.  That is what I meant to say.  Tusla will be increasing funding for the FRCs in the 2018 Estimates.  I am working with them to look at how to build the argument for that, particularly in terms of the ways in which their prevention and intervention work can reduce the need ultimately for the unallocated cases on the other end.  The issue of unallocated cases is significant both politically and for the Government.  It is a particularly useful argument to use as I move into 2018 to support those efforts and their call for multi-annual funding.  Tusla provided once-off funding at the end of 2016 of &euro;1.422 million.  They raised issues with me on child care facilities for many of the family resource centres and the challenges they have in the context of working within a community.  I am bringing those specific concerns into ongoing conversations with the Department in terms of community-based services and the challenges they are having.</p> <p>  I am encouraged to say that Tusla has a new organisation development plan for the NCCIS for 2017 and a new director of the ICT structure.</p></speech>

The figure for last year was &euro;3.65 million and the figure for this year is &euro;5.8 million.  Is that to counteract the withdrawal of funds by Atlantic Philanthropies?  The reason for the fear for the future is the coming to an end of the Atlantic Philanthropies funding.  Deputy Funchion and I are looking for an assurance that there will be a continuation of those very valuable programmes.</p> <p>  My other question is on the new child care scheme.  When we discussed it here we talked about the fact that there is a set amount of money allocated for it for this year.  Is there a possibility it could be oversubscribed so that children are qualified but there is an issue with the money available?  Will there be a supplementary budget?  What is the intention?  Has the Department had time to consider that question because we do not want to see any children who qualify not being able to avail of it because of lack of money?</p></speech>

It was an unusual question.  I wanted to see how funding is distributed across the country.  That was the nature of the question.  I do not expect the Minister to answer the question today.  Can she give me a commitment that in future she will provide me with an answer?  It is not different to the area-based childhood programme.</p><p>They would like to see their youth organisations receive a fair share of the funds.</p><p> My last question is on the new child care fund.  There has been a change in the band and for those on medical cards and a reduction from 40 hours to 15 as part and parcel of that element.  Has an allocation been set aside to provide for exceptional circumstances where a family or persons find they require more than the 15 hours allocated?  Will there be an opportunity at departmental or city and county child care level to access additional funds if need be under the model?</p></speech>

This initiative was an innovative and important programme introduced by the last Government under the leadership of Deputy Jan O'Sullivan and her colleagues in order to continue the Department's work on area-based approaches to combating and reducing child poverty.  I have had a particular interest in it since assuming this position.  One of the first things put in front of me as Minister was related to funding to ensure its ongoing sustainability as we looked at ways to support the area-based approach, as well as mainstreaming the learning from it.  In terms of finding money to do that in 2017 and given the projections for 2017 and the significant increase in funding identified by the Deputies, we are talking with Pobal about all of the sites with the hope of extending programmes to the end of the year.  That is what we are examining.  A number of sites have programmes based on the academic year and, as such, the next challenge is the funding required to mid-2018.  Overall, I want to ensure no site will have to close suddenly.  In addition, we are doing the work with a focus on mainstreaming.  My personal commitment and discussions in the Department relate to enabling that sustainability as much as possible on the existing sites, while working with the challenge of mainstreaming the learning from operations in the past few years.</p> <p>  I was asked about the funding of the new affordable child care scheme.  To answer in general terms, the funding we were able to get in 2017 is being identified for the roll-out of the scheme from September.  There are moneys available to the extent that we can anticipate the level of demand in the light of the new scheme.  We had discussions earlier about what would happen in September and the fact that the fully automated scheme might not be available in the way we had anticipated and hoped for.  However, we are committed to it.  I will come back to the committee within a short time on the issue of ensuring the moneys will be available for parents to benefit additionally in accordance with the objectives of the scheme.  Our intention is that it will happen.</p> <p>  I was asked about youth services and money.  Deputy Anne Rabbitte did not refer exactly to the question, but we will come back to its content.  I can say that, as the Deputy is probably aware, the overall b0udget of &euro;60 million includes nearly &euro;57.5 million in current funding and &euro;3 million in capital funding, which represents an increase of &euro;5.5 million on the allocation for 2016.  Is the question where the money is going?</p></speech>

I would love to see that happen too.  Seriously, we need to pay attention to it.  I am thrilled that there was an increase of &euro;5.5 million.  It is the first increase since the austere years and I am aware that there is still a lot of catching up to be done.  The Deputy asked about the figure of 15 hours.  Children who need more than 15 hours of assistance may be identified by sponsors such as Tusla, with which we are in discussions.  Children with very significant needs will have the full cost of their care covered.</p> <p>  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan asked if the budget for the affordable child care scheme budget was sufficient.  The &euro;19 million provided is sufficient and being added to the &euro;86 million in the base.  However, we will monitor demand and take-up closely.  The spending code of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform requires a spending cap.  Having said that, we will monitor the scheme closely.</p></speech>

Some really good work is being done under those programmes.  If the Minister can mainstream them and have the same good work done in other places, that is fine, but we are talking about targeted poverty programmes.  We are dealing with some of the most disadvantaged children.  Addressing child poverty is crucial in terms of equal opportunity.  We should come back to this issue as a committee at some stage to see what is happening.  I have seen some fabulous programmes, including in my constituency, but there is a particular one in Dublin of which I am thinking.  It gets women to sign up when they are pregnant and follows them through the child's early years.  I have not seen that happen anywhere outside of ABC programmes.  Some very good things are being done in addressing the most disadvantaged children who are at great risk of poverty.  It would be a shame to lose out on that work.</p></speech>

I would welcome the committee revisiting that issue with me.  The Deputy will know that I have the same commitment she has identified.  There are some in my constituency also.  In fact, I started one.  I understand it from the inside and these are the conversations I have been having in the Department.  There is a challenge with the exit of Atlantic Philanthropies, but there is extraordinary work ongoing on those sites.  Part of the rationale from a policy perspective for supporting the extension of funding to the end of 2017 is that the evaluation of the programmes will not be ready until late 2017 or early 2018.  That is important.</p><p>We want to ensure we have that and what is going on is fed into the evaluation.  That evaluation will be really critical in building the arguments not just in unpacking or closing up what has been done but in focusing on the mainstreaming of lessons learned.  That relates to another initiative on which we are spending a significant sum of money and I am fully committed to the mainstreaming and development of data hubs and mentoring to ensure ongoing quality.  This is all part of the capacity-building initiative and it is what is going on throughout the world where the best and most progressive governments are looking to ensure that all the programmes provided to children are done in the best possible way.  My personal view is that this should not replace the provision from an area-based perspective that is going on.  This will be very challenging as much money has gone into those programmes and we do not have a funder to couple that.  I have a personal commitment to it, as does Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister to comment on an issue we discussed earlier this morning with Barnardos relating to the pre-legislative scrutiny of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>Bill.  The cost of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>system has attracted much negative media comment recently.  In my 12 years in public life, I found reading the figures in a Sunday newspaper most staggering.  I am open to being corrected on them.  The Ombudsman for Children's office costs us approximately &euro;2 million per year and we can see the amount of services and support it provides to children across the State.  The guardian <i>ad litem</i>system would cost &euro;15 million or &euro;16 million to give a small number of children a voice in court.  I am not downplaying that but in our earlier conversation, we noted the dearth of services available for children in State care, such as speech and language therapy, psychological services and early trauma intervention because the finance is unavailable.  I find it staggering we can afford &euro;16 million to give them a voice in court, notwithstanding the value of that.  Will the Minister comment on it?</p></speech>

There are two aspects to the question.  It is a lot of money and some of the commentators are wondering if that amount of money is being spent in the best possible way in supporting a guardian <i>ad litem</i>system.  We all agree there is a requirement for it when it comes to the rights of children.  Within the Chairman's question I hear the query of whether it is the most efficient way to use that money within the system.  Moreover, what about moneys we require for the care and protection of children in other contexts?  The ambition and policy intention of the new legislation is to give a much more cost-effective system, with much more given to the voice of children and less money spent on legal fees.</p><p>The second point is we anticipate that in the design of the system as it is rolled out - I know the committee was doing pre-legislative scrutiny on it earlier - more children will have access to it.  In that way, there will still be a cost.  That is what we must consider.  Underneath the Chairman's question is the query of whether the money is being spent in the most efficient manner but the legislation is effectively saying it needs to be better.  That is what we are trying to achieve.</p></speech>

What will happen if more money is required?  This may not be relevant to the Minister but it relates to the draft policy of 2014 from Tusla on procedures of governance as applied to historical cases and everything else.  When will it become policy?  In the past month it was taken from the website.  I would have asked the chief executive officer of Tusla the same question.</p></speech>

With regard to the commission of investigation, the diverse nature of the concerns to be examined requires that the commission has the financial resources to retain a multidisciplinary range of professionals deemed necessary, some of whom I have met, to assist its investigations.  The budget of &euro;6 million is available to support the commission in 2017.  Given the profile of the expenditure to date, the Department is satisfied sufficient funds are available within the subhead to enable the commission to respond to the matters that may emerge as the investigation progresses.  I am of course aware of the number of questions and concerns about potential extension of the terms of reference.  The issue around money would be completely separate if there was ever any decision to do that.  As regards the terms as they stand, we are confident the money is there to do the work in the term.  The policy for historical cases is being revised in light of establishing the specialist teams to deal with these cases.</p></speech>

I will introduce myself and my colleagues.  I am Muiris O'Connor, assistant secretary in charge of the research and development and health analytics division in the Department of Health.  I am joined by Fergal Goodman, assistant secretary in charge of the primary care division, along with Tom Monks from the eligibility and primary care policy unit, Kieran Smyth, head of the international unit in my division, and Sarah Rose Flynn, also from the international unit.  I will begin by setting out the wider context of the Brexit challenge.  I will also use my opening statement to briefly outline the principal impacts for the health sector and the work we are undertaking to examine and address those impacts.</p> <p>  The overall priorities of the Government regarding Brexit are clear.  They are to minimise the impact on trade and the economy, protect the Northern Ireland peace process, maintain the common travel area and influence the future of the European Union.  Preparing for Brexit is a whole-of-Government task.  The Department of Health is participating fully in the structures co-ordinated centrally by the Department of the Taoiseach to ensure a joined-up approach.  It is worth remembering that we are at an early stage in the Brexit process.  The UK has not yet notified the EU of its intention to leave by invoking Article 50 and negotiations have not yet started.  When negotiations do begin, Ireland will participate as one of the 27 member states remaining in the European Union.  A great degree of uncertainty surrounding Brexit still remains.  For example, we do not yet know what new arrangements may emerge as regards the UK's future relationship with the EU.  We also do not know whether transitional arrangements will be put in place to bridge the gap between the UK's exit from the EU and the conclusion of an agreement on its future relationship with the EU, or how long a period such transitional arrangements would cover.  This context of uncertainty makes conducting work to examine and address the implications of Brexit challenging.  It also means that a definitive analysis is not possible at this stage.  Nevertheless, our preparations are ongoing.  The Department of Health will continue to revise and update its analysis as matters become clearer over the period ahead.  As the committee will be aware, the Government is determined that all possible preparations will be made ahead of the UK leaving the EU and that the focus will be on protecting and advancing the interests of Irish citizens, within the context of this country's continuing membership of the European Union.</p> <p>  I will now set out some of the potential principal impacts of Brexit for the health sector.  Firstly, however, I wish to note that the UK has not yet left the EU and remains a member, with all of its existing rights and responsibilities.  This means there have been no immediate changes in the area of health care, nor are any expected during the negotiation period.  The Department of Health has put in place a process and work is under way to examine and address any implications for the health sector over the longer term.  All our work relating to Brexit is informed by the following key priorities: to ensure continuity in the provision of health services; and to avoid any changes to the current situation that would have a negative impact on human health.  I will give an overview of some of the issues we have identified in our analysis, which will be deepened and refined as time goes on.</p> <p>  The principal impacts of Brexit for the health sector cover a number of areas including free movement, rights to health services and regulatory issues.  Brexit raises a number of issues relating to free movement and these affect all sectors.  In the area of health, issues such as emergency ambulance transfers between Ireland and Northern Ireland and mobility for cross-Border health workers will need to be given due consideration.  Regarding health services, ensuring that there is minimum disruption and that essential services are maintained on a cross-Border, all-island basis and on an Ireland-UK basis will be the key concern for the Department of Health over the period ahead.  In particular, the Department is conscious that the operation of the EU treatment abroad scheme and the cross-border directive under which Irish patients currently enjoy the ability to access health services in the UK, in particular in Northern Ireland, may be affected by the UK leaving the European Union.  The common travel area has been in existence since Irish independence.  It allows freedom of travel between the two jurisdictions for Irish and UK citizens and provides for largely reciprocal benefits of citizenship in terms of entitlements to reside, work and access services.  These arrangements stem from the close historic relationship between the two countries and predate the entry of both into the EU.  Both the Irish and British Governments have set out their desire to maintain these arrangements, and this will have relevance for the health sector.</p> <p>  Regarding regulatory issues, it is clear that having a single set of rules across Europe is enormously helpful to protect human health, ensure consumer protection and provide a level playing field for industry.  A UK move away from a harmonised regulatory system in respect of food safety standards, pharmaceuticals, medical devices and cosmetics could disrupt trade between Ireland and the UK or necessitate increased certification requirements.  It is important to remember that there are other issues that will affect the health system but which may not necessarily be led by the Department of Health.  The Department is working closely and collaboratively with other Government Departments to examine and address these issues, including through the interdepartmental group on EU and UK affairs.  Cross-departmental work is essential in resolving issues.  For example, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and his Department have successfully secured certainty for the EU-funded cross-Border co-operation programmes PEACE and INTERREG, which includes a number of health projects, up to 2020.  The Government is committed to securing EU funding for successor programmes post-2020.  The strength of the relationships between Ireland and Northern Ireland and the UK will be of benefit as we work to find solutions to any problems that arise for the health sector as a result of Brexit.  There are already effective partnerships and working arrangements in place and many examples of practical and effective co-operation between the jurisdictions for mutual benefit in the health sector.  The Department of Health remains strongly committed to continued co-operation with Northern Ireland and the UK in the health sector.</p> <p>  As well as preparing for the challenges posed by Brexit, we are pursuing opportunities.  The Government decided late last year that Dublin should be proposed as a very suitable location for the European Medicines Agency, EMA, which will need to move from its present home in London once the UK leaves the EU.  The EMA is responsible for the scientific assessment with respect to the authorisation, maintenance and supervision of medicines in prescribed areas developed to protect human and animal health by pharmaceutical companies for use in the EU.  The EMA is also responsible for monitoring the safety of all medicines authorised in the EU.  Detailed work is under way under the auspices of an interdepartmental and inter-agency group led by this Department.  An extensive programme of ministerial and official-level engagement is also under way in support of Ireland's bid.  I would be happy to expand on this if the committee so wishes.</p> <p>  I will turn now to the programme of engagement under way on Brexit, the structures that have been put in place across Government Departments and the work the Department of Health has carried out to date.  An extensive programme of Government engagement is under way on Brexit, led in particular by the Taoiseach, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs.  Ministers are meeting their EU counterparts at Council meetings and other events, while officials are maintaining contact with their counterparts in other countries.  The Minister for Health has met with the European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety twice in recent months to discuss the impact of Brexit on Ireland and the health sector and to discuss Ireland's bid for the European Medicines Agency.  The Minister also met his Northern Irish counterpart at the North-South Ministerial Council health sectoral meeting in November, at which a paper on "Implications of the UK Referendum" was discussed.  He has also discussed Brexit with the UK Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health, the UK Secretary of State for Health and the Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Health, Wellbeing and Sport.  At official level, this Department has proactively engaged with officials in the Northern Ireland and UK Departments of Health.  The potential impact of Brexit on health services has been examined and explored.  It is intended that this engagement will be ongoing and will be strengthened as we get more clarity on the actual Brexit arrangements that might emerge.</p> <p>  Ireland's preparations for Brexit continue to be strongly co-ordinated from the centre of Government through the new Brexit Cabinet committee chaired by the Taoiseach.  The Department of Health participates fully in the senior officials group on EU affairs, the interdepartmental group on EU-UK affairs, and its work groups established to support the Cabinet committee on Brexit.  The Department established a management board sub-committee on Brexit in advance of the UK referendum to examine the implications of a decision to leave the EU.  The sub-committee is chaired by my colleague, Deputy Secretary General Colm O'Reardon, and made up of representatives from across the Department, as well as from the HSE, which is represented by the national director of primary care.  Our preparations for Brexit are under way and progressing well.  The Department of Health is building on initial work undertaken to conduct a more detailed analysis on the impacts of Brexit in the area of health.  Individual units in the Department and agencies are conducting analysis and continuing their contingency planning to identify the best strategies to mitigate each of those impacts.  In addition to regular contact with agencies, Brexit is now being formally included as a standing item on the agenda of governance meetings between agencies and their responsible line units in the Department.  The sub-committee serves as a co-ordinating body to pull the various strands of this work together and facilitate information-sharing.</p><p>Our continuing assessment of the implications of Brexit in the area of health is part of ongoing Brexit analysis and scenario planning for input into larger Government deliberative processes.  Until such time as the UK&rsquo;s relationship with the EU following its withdrawal becomes clear, the precise implications of Brexit for the area of health will remain unclear.  A comprehensive analysis of the health implications of Brexit will have to be informed by the UK&rsquo;s intentions in this area.  Our focus will remain on ensuring that services for patients are maintained and human health is protected.</p><p> By way of conclusion, the Department of Health, in co-operation with its agencies and other stakeholders, will continue to deepen its analysis of how best to mitigate the impact of Brexit for the health sector over the period ahead.  We will continue to engage with our EU partners, the UK and Northern Ireland, particularly as positions crystallise on areas of shared interest relating to the health sector in a post-Brexit context.  I hope my opening statement has been helpful and I look forward to the committee&rsquo;s questions.</p></speech>

Like all the debate around Brexit, uncertainty is the major backdrop in all of this.  Very often, we are potentially planning in the dark but we must anticipate certain issues that may arise and have contingency plans in place.  If there is potentially to be a hard Border of some form or another, the issues of concern are that there could be difficulties with the free movement of goods and services between the Republic of Ireland and the North, creating difficulties for commerce, movement of services and people.  That could have a potential impact in the health area as well.</p><p>We have referenced rare diseases on numerous occasions.  We have a population of 4.6 million people here and there are approximately 1.9 million people in the North but there must be close co-operation in order to achieve economies of scale.  We may not have enough expertise on either part of the island but collectively we have a critical mass in the area of rare diseases, not only with respect to the number of people with rare diseases but, more importantly, of clinicians and specialists who would be able to operate on an all-island basis.  If we ever get our children's hospital built, for example - I assume it will happen at some stage - this issue may arise more frequently due to the fact that we would have a centre of excellence in Dublin that might be able to address some issues in the North as well as the South, with clinicians in both areas working in collaboration.  I have referenced rare diseases and the issue of paediatrics but that could be broadened to other areas, such as transplanting and other high-end areas.  What observations do the witnesses have in that respect?  With regard to the registration of medical practitioners, such as consultants and nurses, etc., we have two administrative areas.  Do the witnesses foresee any difficulties in that context with regard to registration and people living in the North and working here or <i>vice versa</i>?</p><p>Reference has been made to the treatment abroad scheme on a number of occasions, as well as the cross-border health care directive.  In fairness to the Department of Health and HSE, it does not seem to advertise that much for fear people might find out about it.  There are two schemes.  The first is the treatment abroad scheme, for which people can make an application if the consultant can verify it is clinically acceptable and treatment cannot be provided in this country.  Alternatively, the cross-border health care directive allows for a person entitled to public health care here to avail of it elsewhere if he or she so wishes.  Do the witnesses foresee any difficulties in that area?</p><p>There is the issue of public health policy in general and health promotion in the context of wellness and having a healthy lifestyle.  There is also the issue of vaccines.  The greater the core of a population that is vaccinated, the more impact there is.  Has anybody considered this issue with regard to development of vaccines down the road and all that flows from it?  The more people who partake in a vaccination programme, the greater the coverage and the smaller the risk of cross-infection etc.  Has any thought been given to that?  I do not expect full and detailed answers but the issues have been brought to my attention by clinicians and professionals.</p><p>Clinical research is sometimes bolstered by co-operation between industry and colleges.  We have a reasonable footprint of pharmaceutical and medical device companies that co-operate with universities and institutes.  The larger the pool of research available, the better the chance of superior outcomes.  I hope those issues are kept to the fore in Brexit discussions to ensure we can manage them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-08a.356" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017030800002#F00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for their attendance and presentations.  I was struck by the frequent mention in the opening statement of analysis and what might happen in future.  I was in Donegal and Sligo fairly recently and people are very occupied with the implications of Brexit.  They fear the Government and the various Departments are not as occupied and from listening to this, I tend to agree with them.  This is very high on aspiration but frighteningly low on detail.</p> <p>  With regard to work done to date, has an exercise been carried out to quantify the amount of work and extent to which our health service is reliant on the National Health Service, NHS, with regard to the cross-border directive and other issues?  The radiotherapy unit at Altnagelvin has a very recent service level agreement with the HSE.  Has that been Brexit-proofed?  I am willing to be corrected but my understanding is it was signed after the vote in Britain.  If the agreement has not been Brexit-proofed, I would be very disturbed about how serious is the Department in dealing with the issue.</p> <p>  The next issue relates to the extent to which we are reliant on the NHS in the North and in Britain.  Is there a plan B, as scenario planning has been mentioned?  Is one scenario what will happen if there is a hard Border and in the event that it becomes more difficult for people than it is now?  I know people in County Donegal, for example, who will rely very heavily on the services in Altnagelvin.  A hard Border will be quite frightening for those people.  Specifically, there is the issue of transplants.  I am sure the witnesses are aware of media reports of difficulties that our health service has in trying to hit required times in this respect.  We have our own problems in the Twenty-six Counties and they have been aired in the media.  I know there is a service in the North but has advance planning been done with regard to that vital service and how we can avail of it?</p> <p>  There has been mention of what is happening at the Department but what is the involvement of the HSE?</p><p>I ask for a list of the HSE groups that have been established and the work done to date.  Much of this references the work of the Department.  The involvement of practitioners and those delivering health services on the ground will be essential in contingency planning.  I fear that five minutes before the border is put in place someone will say, "Well, Jim, we had better put a plan together for how we are going to manage without being able to access services in the North."  Perhaps the delegates might put my mind at rest. </p><p> Who from the HSE is involved in the working groups?  If they are not involved, do they have their own group?  If they do have their own group, what is the level of communication between the departmental group and the HSE group?  How will it be managed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-08a.358" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Muiris O'Connor" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017030800002#G00200"><p>I will take most of the questions, while Mr. Goodman will speak about the cross-border health care treatment directive and the treatment abroad scheme.</p> <p>  Deputy Louise O'Reilly asked for reassurance on the comprehensiveness of our preparations.  I can reassure the committee that the Department is fully engaged and has been since before the Brexit referendum in the United Kingdom.  It is a very comprehensive engagement with the challenges.  All units are working with it and liaising with the agencies.  There is a sub-committee of the management board on Brexit which co-ordinates our involvement at departmental level and connects us to the broader interdepartmental preparations for Brexit.</p> <p>  We have a national director of the HSE on our board and are engaging the HSE at all levels, particularly the North-South unit.  The Department has been working closely with the HSE and other agencies to conduct an analysis of the implications of Brexit in the area of health.  The Department also took part in an in-house seminar organised by the HSE for its organisation on the implications of Brexit.  The North-South unit of the HSE has provided valuable expertise and assistance in examining the implications of Brexit for North-South co-operation and citizens in the area of health.</p> <p>  The Department and the HSE will continue to work closely together with the aim of ensuring minimum disruption in the area of health and that essential services will be maintained on a cross-Border, all-Ireland and Ireland-UK basis.</p> <p>  With some very senior members of the HSE, I recently attended an EU-exit health care workforce round table discussion with counterparts from Britain and Northern Ireland.  We are very concerned about the concern in Border areas about the continuity of services.  We were asked about the extent to which Altnagelvin Hospital is Brexit-proofed.  It operates a joint service level agreement on radiotherapy services between the Western Health and Social Care Trust in Northern Ireland and the HSE.  There is good will on both sides and a determination to continue and deepen co-operation.</p></speech>

I respect the aspirations of the people involved, but has it been Brexit-proofed, given that it was signed after the referendum had taken place?  Does the SLA include a section which deals specifically with Brexit?  If it does not, that is fair enough, but I would be surprised if does not.  If there is, I ask Mr. O'Connor to outline some of what it includes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-08a.360" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Muiris O'Connor" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017030800002#G00400"><p>I do not know if there is a specific reference to Brexit; I do not believe there is.  However, there is a comprehensive memorandum of understanding underpinning it which provides an overarching framework for collaboration between the two jurisdictions on the centre.  As well as agreement between the Departments of Health, North and South, it is primarily a service level memorandum of understanding between the service providers.  To the extent that free movement is allowed at the end of negotiations as they evolve across the Border, we are very confident that there will be minimum disruption to services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-08a.361" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017030800002#G00500"><p>What is the basis for Mr. O'Connor's confidence?  I would not be confident and certainly would not be confident, given that the SLA does not include a reference to Brexit, perhaps one of the biggest things to happen in the health area in the North.  If it is not stipulated in the SLA, from where does Mr. O'Connor derive his confidence that everything will be grand?  The view of people living along the Border is that the Department of Health and other Departments are stating, "Sure we will be grand," and they are hoping they will be.  When Mr. O'Connor says he has confidence that everything will be fine, although we have not included it in the essential agreements, it does not strike me that the Department of Health is planning seriously for Brexit.  If there is a hard border, there will be huge issues.  The SLA is predicated on the cross-border health directive and people being able to move freely.  If they cannot move freely, which is a possibility, it will be too do anything late five minutes before the lads with the shiny buttons put up the customs posts along the Border.  We have a chance to start planning for it.  Mr. O'Connor is saying he is confident that it will be grand, but I am not hearing anything that backs up that confidence.</p></speech>

However, the MOU underpinning the co-operation on radiotherapy services in Altnagelvin Hospital was signed in 2014 and I do not believe there was any awareness of an impending Brexit referendum at that point.</p></speech>

I do not have a date for the service level agreement.  The MOU provided for investment from both sides in the capital development of the facility.  Services commenced late last year and it is recognised as a very important service.  The Deputy is articulating very well how important it is to provide prompt care for the people of the north west, including those in this jurisdiction.  I did not mean to sound at all complacent in saying I was fully confident.  We are exploring and working very closely in the Department and with counterparts in Northern Ireland to ensure the continuity of these very important services which are highly appreciated on both sides of the Border at official level and among the general public.  They are critical services and a real priority for us in our planning for Brexit.</p></speech>

I understand the MOU was signed a while ago, but it contains all sorts of information on the development of the service.  However, the SLA is specific to service delivery and it would be useful for us to see it.  In the future all SLAs with a North-South dimension will need to be Brexit-proofed.  That would allow people to say they were confident.  Without it, the confidence seems to be somewhat misplaced.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-08a.368" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Muiris O'Connor" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017030800002#G01200"><p>Deputy Billy Kelleher sought an assurance that North-South co-operation was a factor.  It has been well documented that North-South collaboration in the health arena is real and that real benefits accrue to citizens.  There are many examples which illustrate the level of co-operation between the North and the South on health issues.  As the committee is well aware, North-South co-operation on health matters takes place through the North-South Ministerial Council, as well as through joint departmental projects.  There has been significant cross-Border health and social care activity in the past decade or more.  Matters being considered and progressed in the North-South Ministerial Council since its commencement include health promotion campaigns on such issues as alcohol, tobacco, obesity, cancer services, research, suicide prevention and food safety.  We will include the specific issue of vaccines in our analysis.  The chief medical officer's team is looking at the general implications of Brexit.  That is one we will bottom out in considering the implications.</p><p> Significant projects have been undertaken in recent years and they have made a difference to the lives of patients.  Deputy O'Reilly referred to the Altnagelvin Area Hospital radiotherapy unit that was completed last year.  Deputy O'Reilly adverted to how it provided access to radiotherapy services for people in the north west of the island, including people in this jurisdiction.  Other important examples of cross-Border collaboration include the primary percutaneous coronary intervention services - also known as stenting - in Altnagelvin.  The arrangement allows Donegal patients to have access to these services on a 24-7 basis.  In July 2016, the then Northern Ireland Minister of Health, Ms O'Neill, and the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, opened the hybrid cardiac catheterisation laboratory at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin.  The laboratory provides emergency surgery to babies born with congenital heart disease in Northern Ireland in addition to providing services for patients in the South.  As Deputy Kelleher pointed out, these are good examples of how North-South collaboration can generate the critical mass of patients to make services of a specialist nature feasible at local level.</p></speech>

It is singularly helpful that within the European context there is mutual recognition of all these qualifications.  There are serious implications for this area.  From day one of the UK leaving, those responsible in the UK are likely to mirror the existing EU arrangements.  Much will depend on the inclination of the UK as regards UK professional qualifications thereafter.  There is an eagerness at official level and among professional bodies to maintain the equivalences in place as well as the mutual recognition of qualifications, but we cannot take anything for granted.  Further and closer engagement with our Northern Ireland and UK counterparts as well as with the broader European Union will be important.</p> <p>  I and senior HSE people attended a discussion recently up North.  The idea was to broaden and deepen our understanding of the potential implications and preparations.  However, it became clear that it is not only a question of member state governments but also a matter for the royal colleges and the professional bodies associated with the recognition of qualifications in various jurisdictions.  This area will require substantial further work.  It is an area of key importance.</p></speech>

Straight away, it results in paperwork and delays and so on.  It was the oldest trick in the book for many years and one applied by protectionist countries.  Mr. O'Connor is suggesting that most of the professional bodies in the UK as well as officialdom would be supportive of the present regime.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Much of this will be political and, politically, it is unclear what direction the UK will take.</p> <p>  Deputy Kelleher also referred to clinical research and co-operation between higher education and industry as well as the extensive co-operation between Ireland and the UK.  This area is very much in the frame for us.  It is led by the Department of Education and Skills but the Department of Health has a major interest because of the importance of health research.</p> <p>  In a sense, our approach is two-pronged.  The first is to sustain and continue to develop the existing research collaborations with the UK and Northern Ireland.  However, there is recognition that we must broaden our partnerships into the other 26 countries, in particular under the EU Horizon 2020 fund.  Ireland has an ambitious target to get &euro;1.25 billion between 2014 and 2020.  It is unclear whether the UK would be automatically expected to leave or to what extent eligibility for Horizon 2020 would be affected, although there are some indications that the UK may be willing to continue to engage with the programme.  In any event, there is a major opportunity for us perhaps to increase our share of European research funding drawdown and to build and deepen our partnerships beyond the UK in research.</p> <p>  Mr. Goodman will address the questions on cross-Border health care and the implications for the treatment abroad scheme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-08a.376" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fergal Goodman" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017030800002#H00800"><p>If Mr. O'Connor does not mind, I might touch on one or two of the issues mentioned.  I was not inclined to cut in while he was speaking, but I will elaborate on one or two points.</p> <p>  The first relates to the scenario when Brexit happens.  As was said in the introductory statement, much of this will revolve around what happens with the common travel area.  If this goes in one direction, we have a rather favourable outcome.  If it goes in another direction, things could be far more difficult.  I agree that we need to plan for the scenarios and consider the spectrum of things that might happen.  That is what we are doing.  However, at a certain point it becomes speculative in respect of what any of us believe will happen.  We are dependent on what direction things move in that regard.</p> <p>  When it comes to professional mutual recognition and so on, Ireland is not the only country affected.  We feel an especial closeness and there is a good deal of collaboration backwards and forwards.  Irish students are training in the UK and they then want to practice here and so on.  That is a matter of great consideration and importance for us.  However, Ireland is not the only country of the remaining 27 countries so affected.  We do not have a solo position that we can put out and run with.  As was said at the outset, we are part of a wider engagement process between the EU and the UK.  Department of Health officials and our Minister have to be cognisant that we are part of that overall framework.</p> <p>  North-South issues have been touched on to a considerable extent.  I am aware from speaking to colleagues in the Department who are involved and, as Mr. O'Connor has said, from contact with counterparts in Northern Ireland that there is a strong desire to maintain the cross-Border collaboration relating to Altnagelvin and paediatric care issues in particular.  It is important to note that these are not carried out or provided for under the EU directives.  They are not part of the treatment abroad scheme, for example.  They are predicated on memoranda of understanding or service level agreements between the statutory health authorities on the two sides of the Border.  If we take the travel permissions issue out of it, there should be few, if any, impediments to the continuation of the arrangements.  This is the view of officials in the Department of Health.  Certainly, that is the objective we strive to achieve.  In other words, regardless of how Brexit plays out, we will maintain and continue those services, some of which are still only in the developmental phase.</p> <p>  It is important the committee understands the strength of our determination to ensure we adapt to what might come out of the Brexit process.  We cannot predict it at this point.  I fully admit that.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the treatment abroad scheme and the cross-border directive.  We undertook some initial analysis of how these are working.  The cross-border directive is rather new.  Deputy Kelleher asked whether it was being promoted.  When the directive was developed, there was a general consensus across EU member states that the scheme was not to be strongly and highly promoted by national health systems.  That was the consensus view at European level and we need to respect that.  However, it has been promulgated to the medical associations.  It has been promulgated at operational level, in other words, at hospital level and hospital group level, in terms of making information available to patients.  Also, the HSE has a particular national contact point and considerable information is available on the HSE website.  It is still in the early years of implementation.  Certainly, it is instructive to look at the analysis of developments on the cross-border directive.  We would be happy to share the data with the committee.  We can provide it afterwards, if members wish.</p><p>A total of 237 inpatient treatments were done and reimbursed under the cross-border directive in 2016, with 213 done in Northern Ireland.  Therefore, 90% of inpatient cross-border treatments went to Northern Ireland.  Outpatient and day cases are lower at 31%.  We do not know how much of the remaining 70% or so outpatient work went to other parts of the UK.  Intuitively, one would feel that it could be significant.  We do not have that data yet.  We are seeking that detail from the HSE's analysis but it is fair to assume that the cross-border directive - for cultural and other convenience reasons - operates primarily as an Ireland-UK facilitation.</p></speech>

The more we assume it is the UK, the more significant is the issue.  We are, therefore, not seeking to down play the significance of what could be at play here.</p></speech>

The answer I have been given is that the Department is speculating.  We are discussing the implications of Brexit.  The first action that should be taken is an analysis of the extent to which the cross-border directive, which may not survive Brexit, is contributing to the HSE's work.  When will Mr. Goodman have data on the extent to which the rest of the NHS is picking up the slack here?  I understand that 90% of the inpatient treatments were performed in the North.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that it is difficult to read out a table and give figures to members but out of a total of 237 inpatient cases done under the directive, 213 went to Northern Ireland, which gives the 90% I referred to.  Of the 1,501 outpatient and day cases reimbursed, 479 went to Northern Ireland.  I do not have a country breakdown of the remaining 1,022 but we know the countries where the directive has been exercised by people.  Northern Ireland, England, Poland, France and Lithuania are instanced as countries of significance but we are seeking a country-by-country breakdown and the HSE has to run some analysis to provide that for us.</p></speech>

It does not appear that advance planning is being carried out to any great extent.  The Department waited for the committee to invite officials to discuss Brexit before seeking information from the HSE.  If the Department was being proactive, with the greatest of respect to the officials, surely they should have that information.  The vote on Brexit took place in the middle of last year.  Should the committee write to them every week to say it wants them to discuss Brexit?  This is a massive issue but they only requested the information from the HSE following the committee's invitation to appear.  Mr. Goodman's opening statement is based on analysis that is being done and on deeper analysis.  What are officials analysing if they have not discussed the extent to which we are reliant on the NHS to treat patients who should be treated here but are not?  If they have not done that, what are they analysing?  What planning are they doing to replace the directive?  It does not seem that Brexit is a priority issue but it should be.</p></speech>

We are awaiting a specific breakdown of figures for countries.  We received an analysis from the HSE in its contribution to our management board sub-committee on Brexit across a wide range of issues.  We are maintaining a risk register which was developed even before the referendum and we have continued to refine that.  What is awaited is a specific set of figures.  We are aware, as is the HSE, that the UK and Northern Ireland account for vast majority of destinations used by Irish citizens under the directive.  It is not that we have failed to engage with these issues; we have discussed this in-depth and we continue to engage with it.  The specific figures and country breakdown are awaited.  This is not our first engagement with this issue and, therefore, we will provide them.</p></speech>

I am not putting words in anyone's mouth because that is exactly what was said.  If they are as proactive and confident as Mr. O'Connor claims, they will be to deal with this.  That information would have been among the first sought months ago and, instead, a few weeks ago, on receipt of the invitation from the committee, information was sought.  It is not beyond the bounds to suggest that there is a level of complacency because, clearly, the figures were not sought until an invitation was received from the committee.  If we can get Mr. O'Connor's assurance that the information will be sought and worked on without the committee having to issue an invitation, that would be helpful.  It would also be of some comfort to people in counties Donegal, Sligo, Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim and elsewhere along the Border who are concerned about the implications of Brexit.</p></speech>

It is a recent development at EU level and there was no reimbursement scheme prior to its institution.  The challenge is to see if we could have a bilateral arrangement with the UK to maintain such a provision.  Our overall objective is to maximise the continuity of the arrangements we have at the moment but the question of whether the cross-border directive would continue to involve the UK is an EU-UK discussion point.  We are in a unique position in having a land Border with the UK but the cross-border directive also operates between the UK and the rest of the EU.</p><p> I want to be clear about the treatment abroad scheme.  This is arranged on a consultant-to-consultant basis and operates when a treatment is required but not available in Ireland, or only available outside the time required.  We are very dependent on the UK for the scheme and in 2016 there were 636 cases, of which 574, or 90% went to the UK.  We are particularly dependent on the scheme for paediatric, liver and cardiac transplants.  The scheme will continue to operate within the EU but, as it is for services that are time-critical such as transplantation, it will be difficult to use France or other places in such cases.  In the interests of continuity of quality and accessibility of service we will strive for an arrangement whereby we can continue the scheme but we cannot predict this and since it operates under EU regulations we will not have the facility to make a bilateral international agreement.  We need the Brexit process to move on somewhat before we have greater clarity as to how we should move on this matter.</p></speech>

Has the Department done any work on the implications for these products, particularly in the area of timelines?  We now have same-day, or 24-hour, deliveries of drugs from the UK.  Will there be increase in these timelines and what might the knock-on effect be for patient care?  Time is money and, as is the case with hauliers, if things are delayed and turnaround times are increased there will be cost implications.  These are hard to quantify and we do not know how long the delays will be but has any work been done to establish the effects and mitigate them?</p> <p>  Mr. Goodman spoke about the EMA in the context of the regulation of medications and appliances.  If there is a hard Border, the UK will not be able to avail of mutual recognition and centralised procedures for medications.  Is there any indication of what the UK plan is in this regard?  It is a bit like a farmer's market, where everybody inside signs up to the charter of the market while there is a lad with a stall outside trying to sell carrots to the people in the market and he is not abiding by the rules of the market.  Has the UK given any indication of the direction it wishes to take in this area?  It is better to have a copy of the rules and be inside the market.  Norway and Iceland have asked to be included in the current procedure but has the UK given any hint of what it will do?</p> <p>  Deputy Kelleher asked about regulation.

The system is that one graduates in pharmacy in the UK and, having done one's registration year, becomes a member of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, getting the same accreditation as here.  It widens the pool of professionals and not one person in pharmacy in Ireland would deny that they have learned a lot from the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, a story that would be similar across all medical professions.  It is a major concern, especially for those currently studying there who had planned their career pathways.  This could be dealt with in advance of knowing exactly what was going to happen.  Can the Department update the committee on the latest situation in this regard?</p> <p>  I have been thinking about the foot and mouth outbreak, swine flu and various other public health issues.</p><p>My father worked in the Department of agriculture during the past two outbreaks of foot and mouth disease and he told me about the amount of work that happened at the Border and the connection between Ireland and the UK in terms of trying to keep the country free of foot and mouth.  That was the case also with swine flu.  What I am talking about is connected with what Deputy Kelleher said about vaccines.  This is about population health and how one deals with such issues when theoretically there might only be a hedge between two countries and viruses are not aware that there is a border.</p><p> My fifth question relates to the E111 cards.  To clarify, they allow one to receive medical treatment in another EU country.  What is the situation in that regard?  Have the witnesses considered it?</p><p> I fully agree with what Deputy O'Reilly said.  She asked how long ago were the data sought on people receiving cross-border health treatment.  It seems bizarre that this information would only have been sought in recent weeks and that the question would not have been asked an hour after Brexit was signalled about how many people from here are being treated across the Border or across the Irish Sea.  It is not as if we have a population of 50 million.  There are not that many of us.  I do not blame the witnesses; I blame the HSE.  One should be just able to ask the executive and the information should be sent on a spreadsheet.  I get very concerned when we cannot get information at the touch of a button or in response to an e-mail from the Department of Health to the HSE.  We should be able to find out where 1,700 people are going.  It is not 17 million, it is a very small amount of people.  That information is significant.  To be honest, that is stressing me out a bit because if we do not know that, what are we at?</p><p> Has work been done on abortion?  I will refer to what was said by Sam Coulter-Smith is a very well known and eminent obstetrician.  He said: "I suppose one of the fallouts from the recent potential exit of the UK from the EU is that the freedom of travel may be affected - and that will be something which will be important for this group of patients."  I assume he is referring to women who are seeking abortions.  Again, we are back to the area of speculation but it is a real issue when we have 70 women a week travelling out of this country to the UK to terminate pregnancies.  We generously gave them the right to travel abroad so we would not have to deal with the issue in our country.  Has work been done to examine that massive issue, namely, the 70 women a week who are travelling?  Are there arrangements in place to try to deal with the issue as best we can if the situation changes?</p></speech>

I wish to return to the figures for inpatient cases.  As I understand it, of the 237 cases, 213 were treated in Northern Ireland, which means 24 were treated in the UK.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-08a.412" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1409" speakername="Colm Burke" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017030800002#L00400"><p>Yes.  The figure of 24 seems very low to me.  Is it the case that not every individual is counted under the cross-border health care heading?  For example, is there an arrangement where someone in a hospital in Dublin goes straight to the UK because it is an urgent matter?  I have dealt with a number of cross-border health applications.  Could it be the case that figures are missing that have not been assigned under the cross-border health care heading?  I had medical treatment outside of this country and I did not have to deal with the HSE at all.  I did not get a bill from the UK where I had received the treatment.  Is it the case that there is a far higher reliance on the UK than we realise, especially given that medicine has become so sub-specialised?</p> <p>  My second question relates to people living in this country who have retired here from the UK.  What will that mean within the health service once the UK leaves the EU?  What arrangement will we have in place in such a scenario?  As a corollary, what about retired Irish people who now reside in the UK, whose children, for argument's sake, have emigrated there?  Such people get an Irish pension and have never worked in the UK.  Where will they fit into the arrangement and have we considered the issue of medical treatment?  It has occurred in many families that parents have moved because their children are all in the UK.</p> <p>  Much of the scrutiny for training bodies, especially in respect of medicine, is UK-based.  Given that the population is very small here, the UK body is often the governing body for qualifications.  In some areas of Irish medicine, as few as 20 people are specialists in a particular area.  How do we see that working from now on?  Will the same recognition levels be in place or is it expected that they will change once Brexit occurs?</p> <p>  My final question relates to recruitment, especially of doctors.  Reference has been made to that already.  We are very much reliant on doctors who initially come from outside of the European Union to the UK where they work for two or three years and then come to Ireland.  Is it expected that Brexit will have an effect on that flow of doctors?  At any one time we have more than 4,500 doctors working in this country who are not Irish graduates.  In fact, a large percentage of that number are not even EU graduates.  If we then add in those who are UK graduates, the 4,500 number changes as well because we have many such doctors who are working in the Irish system.  We have approximately 18,000 registered doctors.  How do we expect the situation to change in the next few years, especially once Brexit occurs?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-08a.413" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1419" speakername="John Dolan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017030800002#L00500"><p>I have a number of observations first before I get into the detail of the submission we received.  I very much welcome the opportunity to get this report.  It is more than timely for us to begin such an engagement.</p> <p>  What is important now is how the committee, the Department and the HSE &ndash; indeed the whole of Government &ndash; proceeds with the issue and that we do not just behave in a way that we are all very busy but that we are thoughtful and strategic in our approach.  We must include a risk analysis.  I suspect we will not be able to cover all the possibilities as if there were no clock ticking down.  We need to do the risk analysis and ensure we are strongly working on areas.</p> <p>  That leads me to another observation, namely, that I suspect we all woke up the morning after the Brexit referendum and uttered a similar two or three words.  Let us be honest about that.  None of us were expecting it in any real sense.  I do not mean just those present in the committee room but people in general.  In effect, what we had was an intent to fire a starting gun, Article 50, and we are all finding it difficult to come to grips with it.</p><p>We can talk about Brexit but almost as if it is just another thing that is going to happen and we will have to get up afterwards.  It is difficult to marshal ourselves.  I am also thinking about the various interest groups, whether disability or broader civil society groups.  We all need to help each other to get to grips with this and just get on with it because it is a live action now.  We can do the analysis when it is over.<br/><br/>The opening statement provided by Mr. O'Connor and his team refers to the whole-of-Government task.  We - not just the health committee - need to have a greater sense of the matrix of what is going on between different Departments and the system as a whole.  One of the points made in the opening statement is &quot;It is worth remembering that we are at an early stage in the Brexit process.&quot;  We are, but it will clock on in ways that may not suit us.  Therefore, the question - I do not particularly expect to given a full answer to it today, but perhaps a framework of one might be outlined - is how we are best placed to work this process as best we can.  This relates to risk analysis.  Members have raised many very interesting matters that all need to be put into the mix.  One of the final points under the heading &quot;General Context&quot; in Mr. O'Connor's statement reads:</p><blockquote>This context of uncertainty makes conducting work to examine and address the implications of Brexit challenging.  It also means that a definitive analysis is not possible at this stage.  Nevertheless, our preparations are ongoing.</blockquote><p>This is a hard space to be in because we do not know what will come up against us and we are caught between whether to wait to see what comes up against us or do some general scenario planning.  I would like to get some sense from the Department of its key approach or framework to this kind of never-never land in which it finds itself.  It does not know exactly what it is facing but it knows it will face any number of issues of greater or lesser intensity.<br/><br/>Further on in the statement, under the heading &quot;Principal health sector impacts&quot;, the third bullet point states, &quot;All our work relating to Brexit is informed by the following key priorities: to ensure continuity in the provision of health services and to avoid any changes to the current situation that would have a negative impact on human health.&quot;  I do not say this with any disrespect, but anyone could have written that.  They are very solid first principles.  Going back to my previous question, what I am getting at is the question as to what the next piece is.  What are the next few paragraphs that would come after these two principles?  What is the evidence behind them and the analysis for moving on?  That needs to come on fairly sharply.<br/><br/>Regarding free movement, if one goes out onto the street and asks anybody, he or she will name a few very important hospitals in the UK that have saved people's lives.  I would consider the area of disability.  Deputy Kelleher talked about rare diseases.  Ireland is a small country.  Even if one adds Northern Ireland, it is still a small outfit.  We are dependent on expertise from the UK.  Granted, it comes from other places too, but the UK has been very strong and world class on a range of the issues at hand.  That is a real worry for people.  The disability movement and other groups also need to play a part in trying to work through this, which is a point to which it would be useful to return.  How will the Department, the HSE and others engage with civil society or the patient groups or whatever one wants to call them?  We are all in this together.  We will face the same problem after it.<br/><br/>Further on, the statement reads, &quot;It is important to remember that there are other issues that will affect the health system but which may not be necessarily led by the Department of Health.&quot;  This is critical.  We are the health committee.  The determinants of health is a module I would like to hear more about and one that needs to be worked on.  Even the points that have been raised by example - products, free movement, the speed or slowness of borders - are outside health but impact on health.<br/><br/>Another quote from the statement is, &quot;The strength of the relationships between Ireland and Northern Ireland and the UK will be of benefit as we work to find solutions to any problems that arise.&quot;  Is this an overly hopeful in nature?  Sometimes, we all hope things will work out well.  When push comes to shove, how good will good relationships need to be to deliver the goods?  That is the question.  They may still be very good relationships, but people may be hamstrung because they are on one side of the line now rather than on the other.<br/><br/>I wish to raise a very practical matter.  I am not criticising anyone but I am bamboozled by the fact, referred to in the opening statement, that we have the Brexit Cabinet committee chaired by the Taoiseach, the senior officials group, the interdepartmental group, the working groups - sooner rather than later we will need a map or a matrix.  Some of these matters are beyond the witnesses and are the business of others.  Perhaps some of the matters I am talking about are about helping all of us to help others to start in a meaningful way to deal with this.<br/><br/>Those are my few points.  I again thank the officials from the Department for being here.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-08a.416" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017030800002#M00300"><p>Unfortunately, I will have to go to the D&aacute;il for Question Time.</p><p>First, we should remember one thing: Brexit was not our idea.  We did not invent it but there are consequences for us.  The presumption on the basis of all the information so far is that it will be a stark, hardline Brexit.  The expert opinion we have to go on is that the former Prime Ministers, John Major and Tony Blair, have both come out in recent times and explained the ill-thought-out nature of the decision in the first instance.  That is all in the ether now.  We will have to do the best we can from what we have, but I would be wary of bilaterals, particularly at this stage, because we could very well talk ourselves out completely and find ourselves in a position along the lines suggested by a certain columnist in <i>The Times</i>of London in the past few days.  That is not a place we want to be and it certainly would not be a strong position from which to negotiate.  We should operate on the basis of the worst-case scenario, do what must be done and recognise that we are negotiating from inside the European Union.  The lines have already been discussed by various people here.  We should do our utmost to keep a single market on the island of Ireland.  To those who say this cannot be done, I say it is in the interests of those on both sides of the Border that it be done.  Again, I emphasise that we did not cause the problem in the first instance, so let us put the pressure on somebody else instead of being put under pressure to deal with this.</p><p>Freedom of movement will be gone if we have a hard Border.  It is as simple as that.  The hard Border is removed if the island of Ireland is treated as a single entity; likewise the common travel area and the customs union.  All of this creates an absolute, distinct line.  It is not a line in the sand; it is a Border that will have to be observed.  Then we will be on the other side of the discussion table, talking to ourselves, in one sense, among the people on this island, but also talking as members of the European Union.</p><p>If we move away from that premise and start talking about bilateral trade agreements in the interim, we will not be in the European Union or, worse still, we will have a new European Union which will mean nothing and we will then have a reversion to the old system of having bilateral trade agreements for everything across the Union.  All of the things to which we have become accustomed for nearly 50 years would go by the wayside and matters would be determined by the larger countries which always benefit most from bilateral trade agreements.  That has always been the case.  A certain newly elected person on the international stage said a good deal was one when he won in a bilateral.  I presume that is what he meant.</p><p> There is much to play for.  Brexit will have major implications, but we cannot do anything until we see what unfolds.  However, to be ready we will need to raise the bar considerably.  We need to be unabashed in the way we present our case.  Our right to present it rests entirely on the fact that we did not precipitate this situation.  What will unfold for Northern Ireland and us on this side of the island will not be of our making.  It is in our interests to stand solidly in support of and protect our colleagues in Northern Ireland, into the details of which I will not go now.  What will come remains to be seen.  The North-South dimension is of common interest in the area of health and others.</p><p> My colleague, Deputy Kate O'Connell, asked why information on procedures was not available.  The Chairman knows my view on that issue.  One cannot have two masters.  We have two entities, the Department of Health and the HSE.  I have to ask myself all the time to which of them I should refer for the information required.  We know that the information Deputy Kate O'Connell rightly said should be available at the touch of a button is not available.  It is hidden somewhere in the HSE.  However, it will not the HSE but the Department of Health that will be involved in negotiating Brexit.  I never understood why we went down the road of having to debate with two organisations, of having a  two-pronged attack against ourselves.</p><p> There is a grave danger that we will find ourselves involved in itsy bitsy negotiations, with bilateral trade agreements, concessions and the establishment of small territory ground rules which will not necessarily be to our advantage in the context of Brexit.  It must be recognised that the best outcome for us is the retention of what we have, warts and all, namely, access to markets in the United Kingdom and the rest of the European Union.  Brexit will have major implications that were not thought out.  I anticipated that there would be a Brexit.  There have been some developments globally in the past year or two that were against the run of play and for which there does not appear to be a logical explanation and we may see more.  Logic does not enter into it.  However, we are in the business of survival.  We have to do what is necessary to ensure that, as a nation and a country, we will survive to the best of our ability.</p></speech>

It is one about which we are concerned and it has been identified by both the HSE and the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA.  Ireland is a small market.  There are a number of risks, one of which is that products are packaged and labelled for use in Ireland, the United Kingdom and Malta, countries in which English is spoken.  A common supply chain is operated.  If the United Kingdom was to be carved off, potentially we could find that we would no longer be part of the bigger supply chain that would include the United Kingdom, leaving aside the trade issues of the speed of delivery.  When we hit a medicines shortage, we can bring in product quickly.  I am sure the Deputy knows much more about the practicalities than I do.  We can do that currently, but in a Brexit scenario it would be threatened significantly threatened, as Deputy Bernard J. Durkan mentioned.  The HPRA is part of a heads of medicine agency network.  It is also involved on the board of the European Medicines Agency, which is the regulator.  We have identified the difficulty presented by this issue.  There is not and could not be a simple solution in a hard Brexit scenario.  As such, we may have to look at a different supply route, whereby we would link with other markets in which we might be able to access supplies speedily.  However, we are still at the point of identifying all of the challenges, following which, together with other colleagues internationally, we will plan to avail of the available options to work around them.  As is apparent from the list of issues we identified, many of which were echoed by members, we did not identify every issue on what is a long list.  All of the ones Deputies and Senators have raised are ones of which we are aware.  We will move from identifying issues to quantifying them and scenario planning to determine what the options are, including what nobody had thought of previously or had to engage with because for most of our working lives we have operated within the EU domain.  As there is none in place, we have to devise alternatives but in collaboration with our European colleagues. </p> <p>  I do not know what the United Kingdom's plans are, but we have noted that the EMA will have to relocate from London.  It has already been signalled by the pharamceutical industry in the United Kingdom that this is a big concern for it.  The Japanese pharmaceutical industry has also expressed concern that the EMA will have to relocate from the United Kingdom because that is where it is plugged in.  It is one of the consequences that may not have been contemplated when votes were being cast and debates were being had in the United Kingdom.  Internationally, everyone is waiting to see what proposition the United Kingdom will make in this respect when it moves into the negotiations.  There will be issues and sub-issues all the way down in every sector.  The United Kingdom has not put into the public domain what its analysis is or how it wants to proceed.  We are all waiting to see how it plans to move forward.</p> <p>  On the issue of recognition of persons who have trained in the United Kingdom, as it happens, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland is one of the bodies with which I have a working relationship in the Department.  It has identified this issue as a key concern.  It operates a registration programme for pharmacists from non-EU and non-EEA countries, whereby applicants must successfully complete all stages of a third country qualification recognition process.  It is much more onerous than automatic recognition.</p></speech>

The process is hugely onerous and while the language barrier is one problem, there are other issues involved.</p><p>This girl was highly qualified and to my mind was fully suitable to do the job.  I did the process and it is a completely different ball game getting one's certificate from the pharmacy society in the United Kingdom, coming here, essentially getting a form stamped and turning up on a day.  That would mean going through the entire internship programme, which used to be called the pre-registration process.  It is a complete departure.  Essentially, it is retraining after one's degree.  It is very serious.</p></speech>

Deputy Durkan spoke about the risk of us scurrying off and looking at many individual bilateral arrangements.  We can scheme up what might be necessary.  Senator Dolan adverted to a whole-of-Government approach and the fact that the Department of the Taoiseach is the lead organisation when it comes to policy and the Government's strategy on and approach to Brexit, and that that belongs within the whole-of-EU approach.  We do not have licence to engage on some kind of bilateral basis.  We can work up ideas as to what we might do if we end up moving into that space, but that is not what we have authority to do at the moment.  I would imagine it is not the Government's policy across all sectors that we would break out and start to try to do things individually.</p></speech>

There is a task force set up under Mr. Barnier that will represent all 27 member states.  That is the pinnacle of the negotiating apparatus for the EU.  To date, it has identified four key priorities, one of which is the Good Friday Agreement and the North-South peace arrangements.  That is a demonstration of early success in influencing the broader EU negotiating position.</p> <p>  We share Deputy Durkan's wariness about bilateral arrangements.  On the other hand, we have routine, deep relations with the UK and in terms of North-South bodies.  The full management team of the Department of Health met the full management team of the Department of Health in the North in January to discuss a range of issues, one of which was Brexit.  We will continue to meet biannually, not to engage in bilateral negotiations.  That is to collectively deepen our appreciation of the challenges and, as is clear, it remains to be seen what the specific objectives the UK will bring to the negotiating table around this area.

Is there a need to contact our insurers to see if they have given cover for treatments abroad where the treatment abroad fund would not have been aware of that?  That is why I believe the figure of 24 for inpatients is very low and I do not believe it is a true reflection of the actual numbers.</p></speech>

That is a matter we are very live to and one that is very high on our risk register.  Ireland is disproportionately reliant on the UK higher education system, particularly for specialist postgraduate programmes and the health sector is particularly reliant on that across various sectors.</p> <p>  In terms of the training bodies with the UK, there is a complexity in that regard.  It is a bit like the bilaterals.  It is not sufficient for us to engage with and agree equivalences with the UK because as part of a bloc of 27 other countries, it is a broader negotiation.  However, when the negotiations get under way we are confident that our close relations with the UK will be utilised by the broader European side in ensuring a maximum of alignment.  The UK would be very alert to that because it has a huge reliance on EU nationals in their health workforce.  I do not want to say I am hopeful but there is a shared interest on both sides in that regard.</p> <p>  As a general point, the Department is working with much more detail than it was possible to bring to bear on the material supplied today such as the opening statement and so on.  In advance of negotiations it would not be appropriate to divulge much of the detail but in terms of the details requested here on service level agreements, SLAs, and so on, we will look at that.</p> <p>  Senator Dolan captured very well the live nature of the process and the amount of contingency planning that has been done.  In fact, it is almost all contingency planning.  There is nothing that is not contingency because the UK's position is so unclear.</p> <p>  Senator Dolan also captured well the extent to which health is part of a bigger discussion.  We probably made the apparatus and the arrangements sound complicated but they are quite streamlined within the Department and interdepartmentally and we may not have done them justice here today.</p> <p>  The national priorities have been set out and they relate to issues of economics and trade and customs and borders.  It is clear in any of the health issues that those broader issues of customs and borders and trade will have huge and direct implications for the challenges we will be navigating on the health side.</p></speech>

A substantial number of people have retired from the UK to Ireland.  Approximately half a million UK pensioners reside in other EU countries, of whom approximately 130,000 reside in Ireland.  A similar number reside in Spain, and others reside in Italy and France.  We are a big feature in that regard and there are reciprocal arrangements in place for Irish pensioners in the UK.  The agreement between us provides for provision of health care.  In effect, a medical card is provided in Ireland without any assessment process of those UK pensioners on the basis that that is what they would be entitled to in the country where they paid their social security contributions and so on.</p><p>If there was an exiting process with no follow-on arrangements, we would have to subject those pensioners to a medical card assessment process.  That would be an administrative process.  We believe many of them would qualify for a medical card anyway but it is much more streamlined at the moment because there is no requirement.  Once somebody is a UK pensioner, they get a medical card and there are no issues and no questions asked.</p></speech>

We are an English-speaking country.  Is there a positive there?  Have the witnesses seen any evidence of positives where we might become a destination for research because we will be within the EU and, therefore, EU funding will probably be channelled here more than to the UK so our universities and standards could benefit?  In the long run, we could come out of this very well from a pharmaceutical point of view because we have such a good international reputation for making and developing stuff and producing good graduates.  Have the witnesses seen any positive moves towards that sort of thing?  Are they anything other than notions I might have?  Are there positive moves from academic centres and research institutes to have a look at Ireland because it is an English-speaking country with a very good workforce?  Are soundings like these coming through or not?</p></speech>

I am afraid that on this occasion, the risks appear to outweigh the opportunities.  The European Medicines Agency is a very significant opportunity.  We are one of a number of countries that are preparing bids to have it located there.  We feel we have a very strong case, much of which has been articulated by Deputy O'Connell, such as the industry base we have, the university base, the fact we are English speaking and the minimisation of the disruption for the existing staff in London.  That would be a huge boost to the industry, to Ireland's reputation more generally and to the wider economy.</p> <p>  Research is the other area that emerges as one of potential opportunity.  This was not strong in the discourse before the Brexit referendum but the UK is a huge beneficiary of EU research funding because of the strength of its university base.  There is a lot of concern in the UK about the absence of Horizon 2020, not just for funding but for the international collaborations and global standards in which the UK can aspire to lead.  The Department of Education and Skills would lead on this but we work very closely with it in identifying opportunities in health and matters like joint professorships.  Such things are being explored as part of the planning around that to see if we can attract some of the key researchers to Ireland.</p></speech>

The purpose of this evening's session is to discuss the right of everyone to enjoy the highest attainable standards of physical and mental health.  Professor Dainius Pras and Ms Orla O'Connor, director of the National Women's Council of Ireland, are with us today.</p><p>I draw the witnesses' attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009 they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

A world congress on women's mental health has been going on for the past three or four days in the RDS in Dublin.  It is being jointly hosted by ourselves, Trinity College, Dublin and the International Association of Women's Mental Health.  It has been examining women's mental health needs within the context of health and well-being for women.</p> <p>  As part of the congress, we had the pleasure of inviting the UN special rapporteur, Professor Dainius Pras, to Dublin.  He addressed the congress this morning at the event for International Women's Day.  That is to give the committee a sense of what this is about and also to be clear that this is an unofficial visit by Professor Pras.  An official visit by a special rapporteur is when the Government invites him or her to make a report on the State.  This is an unofficial visit on the invitation of the National Women's Council of Ireland and Trinity College, Dublin.  It does not result in a report but is a way of meeting people in Ireland.</p></speech>

This mandate was established by the UN Human Rights Council in 2002.  Rapporteurs may also work on other issues as there are more than 40 thematic mandates.  My role as special rapporteur is to inform the UN and member states on opportunities, challenges and obstacles to the implementation of the right to physical and mental health.  Special rapporteurs carry out this work through thematic reports, country missions and reports, communications procedure and also non-mandated activities such as my participation in the congress.</p> <p>  While discharging my mandate, I use the analytical framework developed by the first special rapporteur on the right to health, Paul Hunt.  Many important themes have been developed by my predecessors, Paul Hunt and Anand Grover, for example, the themes of health systems; access to essential medicines; rights to health of vulnerable groups; and social and underlying determinants of health.  Both of my predecessors also issued very powerful reports on sexual and reproductive rights and health.  </p> <p>  In my thematic reports and country missions since my appointment in 2014, I have been addressing issues that have not been sufficiently addressed and issues that are emerging as new priorities.  My reports to date have addressed the right to health in early childhood and adolescence, the right to health and sustainable development goals, SDGs, and the right to health and healthy lifestyles.  I am currently finishing my thematic report to the Human Rights Council on the right to mental health.  </p> <p>  As the committee members know, all human rights are indivisible and interdependent, and the right to health cannot be exercised effectively without protecting and promoting all other human rights.  The congress I have attended in Dublin is a very good attempt to link two important parts of the right to health, namely, the right to sexual and reproductive health and the right to mental health.  With regard to sexual and reproductive health and rights, I have elaborated on this in my thematic report on the right to health in adolescence of 2015, and in the statement of UN independent experts last year.  One of the conclusions of my report on the right to health in adolescence is that states should adopt comprehensive sexual and reproductive health policies to ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health care services.  My main recommendations were that abortions should not be criminalised; that all adolescents should have access to confidential, adolescent-responsive and non-discriminatory sexual and reproductive health information, services and goods; and that age appropriate, comprehensive and inclusive sexuality education, based on scientific evidence, should be part of the school curriculum. </p> <p>  Last September, on the day of action for access to safe and legal abortion, I joined other independent experts to highlight that the criminalisation of abortion and failure to provide adequate access to services for termination of an unwanted pregnancy are a form of discrimination based on sex.  Restrictive legislation which denies access to safe abortion is one of most damaging ways of instrumentalising women&rsquo;s bodies and a grave violation of women&rsquo;s human rights.  We recommended the good practice found in many countries, which provide women with access to safe abortion services on request during the first trimester of pregnancy.  We insisted on international legal requirements that women can access abortion at the very least in cases of risk to their life or health, including mental health, rape, incest and fatal impairment of the foetus during the first trimester and later.  </p> <p>  Violations of sexual and reproductive rights, including denial of access to safe and legal termination of pregnancy, remain a worldwide problem.  During all country missions I have had, I have been raising the issue of gender-based violence and violations of sexual and reproductive rights.  Human rights are interrelated, and so are violations of different human rights.  When sexual and reproductive rights are violated, this has a negative impact on physical and mental health.  In my current report on mental health, which will be presented in June 2017 to the UN Human Rights Council, I critically assess the current situation in global mental health and psychiatry, including violations of the rights of persons with psychosocial, intellectual and cognitive disabilities.  Following numerous consultations in countries across the globe, I have identified major obstacles for the realisation of the right to mental health.  These include the medicalisation of mental health and overuse of biomedical interventions; huge power asymmetries in mental health care between service providers and service users; the legacy of coercion and forced treatment in psychiatry and mental health care; inadequate attention to mental health promotion and prevention; reluctance to eliminate violence, including that against women and children, in all ages and all settings; and other factors.</p> <p>  Now, when mental health is included in strategic development goals and Agenda 2030, it is of utmost importance not only to invest more in mental health, but also to invest in a human rights approach in mental health care and to abandon outdated concepts and power asymmetries than hinder progress in global mental health.  The main priorities should be to address all human rights in all settings so that poverty, inequality and violence are effectively addressed, to target relationships rather than individuals and their brains, and to develop rights-compliant mental health services with a radical reduction of coercion in psychiatry.  There will be a need for states to act as champions in the promotion of such a shift in mental health policies and services.</p><p>More information on activities while discharging the right to health mandate can be found atand.</p></speech>

I have read a little about Professor Pras recently.  I would like him to elaborate on the issue of access to free, safe and legal abortion.  His statement refers to access to abortion "at the very least in cases of risk to their life or health, including mental health, rape, incest and fatal impairment of the foetus during the first trimester and later."  Has he done any work on or does he have recommendations or thoughts on how one could tick the boxes for women who have been raped?  While it might sound easy to allow abortion in a case of rape or incest, I have always asked whether a woman has to go to her police station to report it?  Who fills in the form?  What man, or woman, for that matter, will tick the box stating the woman deserves an abortion because she ticks the rape or incest box?  How is it implementable practically?</p> <p>  In his submission Professor Pras uses the phrase "abandon outdated concepts and power asymmetries".  Perhaps he might elaborate on it briefly.  Is he saying we over-rely on medications with regard to mental health in general?  Is it a funding issue?  We have discussed this at some meetings of health committees, although I am not sure about this one.  Six months of cognitive behavioural therapy in Ireland costs far more than a dosage of antidepressant tablets lasting six months.  Is this what Professor Pras is getting at or am I misinterpreting him?  Is he saying we need to change our approach to mental health?  Rather than prescribing a tablet for everything, would other methods be as or more effective?  Leaving the money element out of it, would there possibly be better outcomes?  Perhaps Professor Pras might elaborate on the issue.</p></speech>

Given that it is International Women's Day, I wish to ask a few relevant questions.  </p> <p>  Reference was made to the right to access terminations, particularly in the first trimester, in the context of rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormalities.  This Parliament has established a citzens' assembly to examine the issue of abortion.  We have a written constitution that prohibits abortion in this country, except on very limited grounds, namely, where the life of the woman is threatened.  Legislation passed through the Parliament in 2013 to support that interpretation of the Constitution.  We are now going through a process of considering the issue of abortion.  More than likely, the people will be the final decision-makers in this context and there are varying views.  The delegates' views on the issue would not be universal.  The issue has been very divisive, not only in Ireland but across the globe.</p> <p>  While I believe our current system is not ideal - we have to address it - we take a very casual view of women's health internationally, other than in respect of the issue of abortion.  In this regard, one should consider vaccinations and access to proper health care, for example.  In many countries, there is a stigma attached to vaccinations which women and their children are not able to obtain.  What is the United Nations doing about these broader issues?  Professor Pras, as special rapporteur, talks about a right to health.  The basic health issues include access to clean water, for example.  I wonder at times what the United Nations is doing at international level to push out the boundaries in terms of female health in general, including mental health.  Professor Pras highlighted some of the issues.  While efforts are made to deal with practices such as female genital mutilation, for example, what is the United Nations doing on a country by country basis to address the issues to which I have drawn attention?  I have highlighted the issue of vaccinations and taboos associated with women's reproductive health.  Sometimes we do not highlight them enough as nations and internationally.  Very often we get caught up in the one issue of reproductive rights and women's health.</p> <p>  Professor Pras talks about mental health and oppression in some countries.  In this regard, what research is the United Nations carrying out on basic equality across the globe?  Many of us have grave concerns about this issue.  While we all respect one another's culture across the globe, issues arise regarding the oppression of women in various states.  To tell the truth, my view is that at times the United Nations can be casual about such oppression owing to larger political interpretations, alignments, etc.  At times, it has to be above and beyond these and call it as it is.</p></speech>

On the issue of access to abortion, I have outlined the minimum requirements or standards the United Nation proposes.  Personally, I find them confusing.  Actually they create new problems.  Of course, I would be in favour of the recommendation that we, as experts, have provided in the statement, but I recognises what happens in real life.  With regard to having special circumstances, those states that choose to have restrictive laws are recommended to do as outlined, at the least.  I agree that almost all of the cases mentioned are such that if we try to imagine how the system would work - there are countries where the type of legislation in question is in place - we note that problems would be created not only for women but also for doctors, for example.  They have to decide.</p><p>Especially in mental health but also in physical health, medicine is not as exact a science as maybe we would like it to be.  Therefore, on the question of what is the criteria to differentiate between the right to health and the right to life, as a medical doctor, I should not agree to be involved in this exercise because it will be always subjective.  This is particularly so with mental health, where we do not have any single biological marker.  If we take any sample of blood or biopsy, we will never find anything to indicate if it is, let us say, depression or not depression, and if it is a high risk of suicide or a low risk of suicide.  To further complicate matters, in the countries which have high rates of suicide, these are not because of severe depressions but rather as a result of a very high number of mild depressions which make this number of suicides high.  Most suicides are from mild depressions, not severe depressions, because there are so many mild depressions.</p><p> We understand that all these ethical issues are related to prenatal diagnostics of, let us say, chromosomal diseases or abnormal development of the child.  This is a huge issue to be discussed.  For example, it is a more clear position that we have to inform families and to support any decision.  If, in the first trimester, Down's syndrome is diagnosed, we should respect any decision.  If they decide to terminate the pregnancy or if they decide to have this child, it is not for us to apply pressure for one side or the other, although this happens.  I know some colleagues who would like all these women to terminate pregnancies in such cases and I do not understand why.  It is not their business so to say.  It is up to families to decide what decision they make.</p><p> I agree that these minimal standards create new legal, ethical and other issues for women and for doctors.  When travelling in these countries where they do not have these even minimal requirements, I have seen how the thinking of doctors is changing.  In one country there was a case of a ten year old girl who was pregnant as a consequence of rape and my formulation was she was forced to pregnancy and motherhood, but the doctors with whom I discussed it could not see any problem.  The doctors told me the girl was okay and there was no harm to her physical and mental health.  I was thinking the doctors were wrong but who will judge whether I am right or this doctor is right?  In that context - maybe it is some survival strategy - it depends on cultural and legal contexts.  Doctors are human beings and they adapt.  I could share also other stories about this so-called "dual-loyalty" when doctors, as doctors, should think one way but the law suggests to them to think another way.  It is a complex situation for doctors.</p><p> If I may move to the second question, it is about this interesting situation in global mental health when there is common agreement between experts that there is a global mental health crisis but some experts emphasise a so-called "global burden of mental disorders" and other experts like me emphasise a global burden of obstacles in the realisation of the right to mental health.  People have always had mental health conditions.  We do not now have some epidemics.  It is just that we may collect information better.  The problem I see is overuse of biomedical interventions for different reasons.  Biological psychiatry promised 30 years ago to solve effectively problems, and maybe even to cure mental health conditions with modern medications, and now there are not so many promises.  We see that psychotropic medications may be effective but may be also not effective, and they are overused.  For example, to treat mild and moderate depressions, one does not need anti-depressants.  Anti-depressants are usually needed for severe depression.</p><p> Deputy O'Connell raised a question about therapies.  I am presenting the global view.  Again, I am here not to assess the Irish situation but to merely inform about global situation.  There are many countries, including in eastern Europe, where psychosocial interventions have never been covered.  If a woman or a family with child will go to the mental health services, they will always receive medications, whether they are needed or not needed.  It is merely that there is a long tradition to biomedicalise mental health and it is still this way.  We can find compromise with inexpensive more short-term and not-so-very-sophisticated psychosocial interventions which can be cost-effective and not so expensive.  The main point is that we should address more social and structural determinants of health, such as poverty and equality, and violence, instead of medicalising consequences.  It often happens that those who are suffering from unbearable conditions in their lives, if they go to mental health services, will be diagnosed as if it is a chemical imbalance.  In today's presentation, I allowed myself to use this.  I think it is more often a power imbalance than a chemical imbalance.  Too often, it is the consequences of different social and environmental determinants, including the fact that many societies tolerate and condone violence against women and against children and then they are surprised why there are so many mental health issues.  I do not want say that medications are not needed.  I merely want to signal also in this report that sometimes biomedical interventions are overused, not to speak about institutionalisation.  In many countries, there are many people enclosed in residential institutions.  Under my report to the Human Rights Council, I will merely remind it that psychosocial interventions and public health interventions are not a luxury.  They can be very effective.  They are not less effective than medications.</p><p> A more complex question followed.  I mentioned and then Deputy O'Connell mentioned power asymmetries.  Power asymmetries means that if, in general medicine, there was agreement globally, in law and ethics, to move from paternalistic relations between doctor and patient to partnership, this has not happened in psychiatry.  In psychiatry, the doctor still make decisions for basic elements of life of users of mental health services and when one has such monopoly of power, it is difficult not to misuse this power.</p><p>This power asymmetry does not help to empower users of mental health services, and we need to address that.  I am looking for states which could be champions.  I want to discuss the matter with the leadership of the psychiatric profession and to move to more innovative mental health services, which would reduce this power asymmetry.</p><p> I will respond to a question on broader issues of women's health.  I agree that there are many equally important issues regarding women's health, including physical health.  The UN is doing its best, but I have to remind the committee that I do not represent the UN.  We special rapporteurs often like to criticise the UN and the World Health Organization, WHO.  We have such a right because we are independent experts and the UN and WHO were perhaps too slow to react to emerging new priorities.  The first priority was communicable diseases and the global response to the HIV-AIDS crisis was quite good.  Indicators suggest we are now in the middle of the way.  This very ambitious sustainable development goal to eliminate AIDS by 2030 is an example of where the human rights approach was really used in practice.  I do not know the motives, and perhaps it was out of fear, but many countries moved to effective policies to address HIV-AIDS and reduce discrimination against these people.  There are new priorities now, as states are starting to understand, in the form of non-communicable diseases and mental health.</p><p> Sustainable development goals, SDGs, signal that these problems are equally important for all countries, including high income countries, while millennium development goals, MDGs, as the committee remembers, were more focused on the developing world.  Europe was maybe not so interested in SDGs because major problems have been solved by European countries.  All 17 sustainable development goals, including goal 3, to promote health and well-being, are equally important.  These include the health of women, demographic shifts where there are huge numbers of children, adolescents and young people in many countries, and also issues of a large population ageing.  These shifts should be addressed by countries implementing practical health policies.  Some countries are doing this better and some are doing worse.  I agree that there are many issues relating to women's health which need to be addressed better to reduce this gap and these gender inequalities which still exist where women in many countries cannot access health care and girls cannot receive education.</p><p> This is also related to the next question which Deputy Kelleher raised, about research across the globe.  He mentioned oppression from which women in particular suffer because of different political systems, if I understood correctly.  I agree and share this concern that the global picture is not very good.  Many countries threaten to take more populist decisions and do not pay enough attention to human rights, as it was in 1948, for example, when the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was unanimously approved.  Now we need more arguments to convince everyone why we need full respect for all human rights.  I see some countries exercise human rights and the right to health care in a selective way when I go to them.  Some rights for some people are okay, and some rights for other people could be ignored.  This leads to further inequality, social exclusion and I do not imagine that we can reach the agenda for 2030 and its very ambitious sustainable development goals in this way.  I agree that there are many issues globally which need to be addressed in a more serious way.  I am doing this on behalf of my mandate, which is about a right to health care.  Sometimes, some countries remind me that when I go abroad that I may overstep my mandate since the right to health care may not be exercised without other rights.  I do not think I do.</p></speech>

There is huge poverty and poor vaccination programmes for children on top of that resulting in much disability and so on, and the women of these countries are often charged with trying to mind all of that.  An observation I would make, and it is not a criticism of Professor Pras, who I hope refers this to the UN, is that it should be more proactive in those areas or as active as it is in other areas.</p></speech>

We often talk in this Parliament about the provision of abortion services for women.  Some like to think that this is a country where we do not have abortion.  Of course we do.  Women have abortions every day of the week.  They mostly travel to England to do so because they cannot avail of services here.  We would be foolish to suggest that we have somehow created a little statelet where abortion is not a reality.  It is.  Women have abortions every day of the week.  The only difference between here and a country where a woman can avail of a full suite of services is that she has to travel.</p> <p>  The UN found that the State had failed to protect one of our citizens, a woman by the name of Amanda Mellet, from cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.  It is a fairly damning indictment of the State, of our health care system and the choices and the options that are available to women, that we could say that our State has failed women to that extent in the very recent past.  I would be interested to hear Professor Pras' views on that.  Women have abortions, as we said.  We know that this happens.  They are our sisters, our friends, our aunts and our mothers.  We know that it happens.</p> <p>  We have an issue with follow-up care for women.  I wonder if Professor Pras might comment on the necessity for women to be able to avail of a full suite of services, including follow-up care where a termination has taken place.  We can talk a lot about how we have failed women - and we continue to fail them - but are there examples of best practice?</p><p>Professor Pras's presentation refers to universal access to sexual and reproductive health care services, and the need for states to act as champions in the promotion of mental health policies and services.  Are there countries that do it better than we do, from which we could learn in order to become the champions, as Professor Pras advocates and as we would all like to be?</p><p> It is very timely to get an international perspective on the extent to which the church, specifically the Roman Catholic Church in the case of this country, exerts an influence over the choices available to women.</p></speech>

Many issues relate to women, disability and mental health.  I am delighted that Professor Pras is here.  It is interesting that it was not until 2002 that the UN appointed a rapporteur on the right to health.  That may be an echo of some of the comments that have been made already.  However, it is important that it is there.</p> <p>  Professor Pras mentioned that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 was the first declaration of the UN and came in the wake of awful tragedies across the world.  I believe that committee was chaired by Eleanor Roosevelt, the widow of the former American President, who was a man with a disability.  I am making a point about culture.  It took the international community until 2006 to realise that people with disabilities had human rights, because that was when the UN agreed the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  People with disabilities were people in 1948.  It makes the point that it is easier to validate the rights of some people in some situations than for others.  I am not talking exclusively about people with disabilities but lots of vulnerable folk.  It is very difficult to get that mindset and that culture.</p> <p>  In answering a question Professor Pras mentioned it is more often the power imbalance rather than chemical imbalance that is in question.  I accept that regarding the mental health area.  The culture of things is so ingrained.  There are different cultural issues in the western world, the south or different parts of the world with different religious backgrounds etc.  The cultural thing is almost like a virus that is nearly impossible to neutralise.  That is a major obstacle to dealing with these things.</p> <p>  Professor Pras also mentioned the importance of addressing the social determinants of health, which resonates with me.  He took the example of Down's syndrome.  Now not just Down's syndrome but a whole range of conditions can be identified before a baby is born.  People can carry certain genes and get certain conditions.  In some parts of the world because we have this information and knowledge we might now be on the cusp of making judgments based more on economics than on human dignity and protecting people's lives.  To make it concrete, if a mother finds out she is carrying a child with Down's syndrome, there can be a lot of pressure.  There is no contest here; there is only one thing to do - terminate the pregnancy.  That is a cultural thing.  It is a push.  However, in the state where that woman lives she has to look at the very practical bread-and-butter services and supports that she would need to actually if she is supported enough to get over the cultural issue.  Where will the supports be there for that woman and hopefully for those parents to be able to give that baby, that child, a decent worthwhile life?  I am not saying it has to be right or whatever.  I believe these kinds of social and cultural issues have become a very contested space and will continue to be more so.</p> <p>  The European Commission has declared this year as the European year of focused action to combat violence against women and girls.  I know we are talking about a wider canvas here, but let us just keep it to Europe.  There are huge issues.  Disability and mental health are mixed in with a range of other areas where women and girls are vulnerable.  Women as they get older are more vulnerable.  Young girls are vulnerable if they are migrants or come from different ethnic groups.  There are major issues here on our doorstep.  I ask Professor Pras to comment on some of the observations I have made.</p> <p>  The European Parliament, the Commission and the Council Presidency in the Malta joint statement of February of this year have jointly made a strong call for action to member states - we are one of them - to ratify and fully implement the Council of Europe's Istanbul convention on preventing and combatting violence against domestic violence.  There is no science to the answer to this.  What is Professor Pras's hunch or sense if the vulnerability around violence against women and girls were removed, how significant would that be in aiding the health and well-being of females?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-08a.467" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1401" speakername="R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017030800002#FF00300"><p>I welcome our guests.  They are very welcome as fellow human beings who are lucky enough to be alive.  While welcoming Professor Pras, I am disturbed although not surprised by his presentation.  He bears a great title of UN special rapporteur on the right to health and he has an important brief.  It is vital that the UN succeeds in its mission in the world at so many levels.  However, I consider that he is operating on what seems to me a very corrupted understanding of human rights, if on the one hand he can talk so much and no doubt so sincerely about the need to eliminate violence and violence against women in particular without acknowledging that violence against the unborn is what we talk about when he promotes abortion as a right.  I think he has a very corrupted understanding about human rights.  I do not see how we can talk authentically about human rights unless we include the whole human community.</p><p>More than the problem of misunderstanding human rights is the damage Professor Pras does to his ability to get buy-in on so many important issues around the world from so many different states.  Let us acknowledge and salute on this International Women's Day the countless women who oppose abortion not for anachronistic, religious or philosophically idiosyncratic reasons as some would have us believe, but because they have an essential idea that human dignity belongs to all and starts with the protection of the most vulnerable, and that there is always a better solution than the taking of an innocent human life.</p><p> In his presentation Professor Pras did not mention the baby or the foetus.  He does not appear to acknowledge that abortion involves the killing of a child and that is a serious problem given the brief that he holds.  He also said some very tendentious things, for example, stating so matter of factly that the criminalisation of abortion leads to a higher number of maternal deaths when he is in a country that, since 1983 as a matter of human rights and constitutional law, has upheld the equal right to life of mothers and their unborn children and has done so in a way that allowed Ireland to be consistently among the countries with the lowest maternal mortality rates in the world.  Medics here have become highly skilled at seeking to protect mothers and their unborn children and where necessary medical interventions to save mothers&rsquo; lives have always enjoyed top priority.  That has been the Irish experience.  To be unable to acknowledge another reality, that the non-legality of abortion in Ireland has meant that Ireland has a very significantly lower abortion rate than other countries, taking into account what Deputy O'Reilly has to say about the sad reality that some Irishwomen travel-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-08a.470" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1401" speakername="R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017030800002#GG00300"><p>Indeed.  Some Irishwomen go to Britain for abortions.  I was about to give the figure that Deputy O'Reilly cited, 4,000 to 5,000 a year.  One can also count the newer reality of people importing abortion pills and the like.  That sad reality, tragic for those women and their babies, leaves Ireland with a situation where approximately one in 20 pregnancies ends in abortion, whereas in our nearest neighbour that rate is four times higher, at one in five.  Professor Pras should acknowledge that the Irish law has had a protective effect.  In the words of one woman, the time it took to arrange an abortion in England was the time she needed to change her mind.</p> <p>  I do not mind the witness acknowledging, if he were generous enough to do so, that sincere people can differ on this issue.  It is clear they do but dogmatism underlies this document, where he does not even acknowledge that this is not an issue like others, that it is an issue that divides sincere people, atheists and religious, people of good will.  He does not acknowledge that abortion is a reality around the world and is responsible for millions of deaths.  I have asked that today we remember the countless women who oppose abortion because it is contrary to human dignity, and the countless, 50% plus, of unborn women who die as a result of abortion.  Will Professor Pras consider the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which in its preamble, the bit Professor Pras never quotes, states: "... the child, by reason of his [or her] physical and mental immaturity, needs special safeguards and care, including appropriate legal protection, before as well as after birth."  How can we conclude otherwise than that human rights are being corrupted when people in Professor Pras' position never quote that preamble?  At most they will offer that the preamble does not contain justiciable rights, which is true, but it has legal force and it is a required part of the interpretation of UN jurisprudence.  I see his colleague taking a note on that but I would like to hear that point contradicted.  It is legal.  It is part of the law.  It is the never quoted part.</p> <p>  I note Professor Pras says that he does not speak for the UN and that he is free to criticise it which is very good.  Would he agree with me that it might be okay if the UN were to criticise him?  I wonder does he speak, for example, for the new Secretary General, Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, who speaks about human dignity with great regularity, and whose voting record as a politician has been to include all, born and unborn.  Surely the presence of such an eminent figure at the head of the UN should prompt him to rethink his understanding of human rights or at least to acknowledge that there are different points of view on this issue.  Where there is a different point of view, there must surely be greater respect for different member states' rights to make laws reflecting their understanding of human dignity.  Would Professor Pras agree that he does a disservice when he links issues such as gender-based violence on which we must all act together, with, as he put it, violations of sexual and reproductive rights, by which I presume he means the denial of legal abortion?  He does a great disservice to human rights when he links areas that should be common case with areas that are highly contestable and I would argue noxious because of the danger to life.  </p> <p>  Professor Pras mentioned Down's syndrome and spoke of his respect for the decision of people to terminate or to have a child.  Is he really doing enough there, given that his brief is health and in other contexts we would all talk about the need to treat disabled members of our community on the same footing as those who do not have a disability?  I note with great attention and care what my colleague, Senator Dolan, has had to say and I agree with him.  Would Professor Pras agree that laws on abortion at the very least should not discriminate between children who are disabled and able-bodied members of the community?  I think it was Lord Shinkwin who unsuccessfully attempted in the House of Lords to change the British abortion laws so that there would be no extra grounds for abortion on grounds of disability.  Would Professor Pras agree that if there is a sincere motivation to treat disabled members of our community on the same footing as everybody else and to champion everybody's rights equally that there should be no extra grounds for abortion, based on disability whether serious, life-limiting or more trivial?  Is he not being hypocritical if he supports the rights of countries to legislation for abortion on the particular grounds of disability?</p> <p>  In talking about respecting the decision to terminate or to have the child, I note that Professor Pras talks about the goal to eliminate AIDS by 2030.  Let me tell him about another 2030 goal, which is the goal of the great and the good in Denmark to be Down's syndrome free by 2030.  Is that not the reality that Professor Pras' neutrality masks, whereby the existence of children with Down's syndrome has become increasingly uncommon in the Western world with rates of abortion of children with Down's syndrome at well over 90% in Britain?  Has he anything to say to that?  As one commentator in Ireland recently said about that Danish aspiration, all will be well and all will be Orwellian.  Would Professor Pras agree that is an Orwellian aspiration?  It is a goal already achieved in Iceland.  He says first trimester abortion is a basic right to which he would aspire.  Has he anything to say about the reality of abortion in a country such as Britain where a child with a disability as mild as cleft palate can be aborted because of that disability?</p><p>Does the witness have anything to say about the fact that in 2008, according to British statistics, more than 60 children survived a botched abortion and were simply left to die?  Does it come under the health brief to have any kind of care for those aborted children or is the witness happy enough for the British to have such a law?</p></speech>

The Chairman is very kind to indulge me.  Ms O'Connor would be well aware of this but I will say it for the benefit of our visitor.  A somewhat distorted picture of the reality of our maternity services was painted there and I can speak with a small degree of confidence as somebody who has used the maternity services in this country and seen my daughter use those maternity services very recently.</p> <p>  The witness is in a country where 20-week anomaly scans are not offered to women.  It is something that would be considered very basic.  Before we get ourselves into a frenzy of praising the maternity services in this country - the men and women who deliver those services are exemplary - we should realise that this is a country where a 20-week anomaly scan, if one is lucky, might be offered if that woman is in one in six of our maternity units.  In truth, this routine screening is not offered to pregnant Irish women.  Dr. Louise Kenny from Cork University Maternity Hospital has made it clear that women under the care of maternity services undergo unnecessary procedures because of the failure by the State to provide this scan for women.</p> <p>  That is one example but if I chose to I could take up all the time in this meeting describing exactly what it is like in reality to use the maternity services in this country.  It is a fact that one cannot as a matter of routine access a 20-week anomaly scan in this country.  I would not want the witness to think he had somehow landed in a sort of maternity paradise, as he has not.  The truth is very far from that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-08a.473" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Dainius Pras" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017030800002#HH00300"><p>I thank the members for their questions and I will try to match them somehow with answers.  I thank Senator Mullen for his frank statement.  I have attended many international meetings and participated in discussions like this.  Of course we cannot reach agreement today or in the new few days on the main issues but I stand firmly behind universal human rights principles.  Among them is a woman's right to control her own body and make decisions about it.  I am not here to assess the Irish position and what I have said was not about Ireland but rather the global position.  In the 21st century, unsafe abortion is one of the leading causes of maternal mortality and morbidity globally.  According to the World Health Organization, WHO, approximately 22 million unsafe abortions take place each year worldwide and an estimated 47,000 women die annually from complications resulting from the unsafe practices for termination of pregnancy.</p> <p>  I will raise the issue of violence against women.  Reports on country missions indicate some hypocritical division of violence, with some so-called mild forms of violence tolerated and condoned in the name of culture or patriarchal tradition.  We face some regressive tendencies in countries, including some in Europe, as in the name of so-called traditional family values, the rights of women and children are undermined.  The role of a woman is reconsidered in such cases, with the idea that a woman should be needed mainly for reproduction and raising children.  This is alarming in the 21st century.  Deputy O'Reilly spoke on the role of the church.  We should respect religion and religious feeling but in secular countries decisions should not be made from a church perspective.</p> <p>  Violence remains one of the major risk factors with regard to mental and physical health.  There are many forms of violence, as we know.  Against children there is child abuse, against women there is domestic violence and with collective violence we see terrorism, wars and youth violence.  All forms of violence must be addressed not with violence, which will escalate a new cycle of violence, but with a good combination of public health and human rights approaches.  I will raise the issues in my next report, which will take in bullying and different forms of violence against women and children.  Even suicide is considered by the WHO as a form of violence.  From a public health perspective, if people do not have enough skills to know themselves in a constructive way, they will regress to destructive or self-destructive behaviour.  Suicide is not just an issue of psychiatry and it is a public health issue as well.  It is considered a form of self-directed violence.</p> <p>  There are many good recommendations to address violence, including gender-based violence and violence against children.  In the world only 53 countries - we know there are almost 200 UN member states - have banned corporal punishment of children.  When I travel and ask why it has not been banned, I am told it is very good for discipline and a very healthy measure.  The world still has nostalgia for a culture of violence.</p> <p>  I understand the issue raised by Senator Mullen is very sensitive.  I understand we need to discuss this but I do not envisage agreement.  Perhaps the only agreement is that both sides agree we should have as few abortions as possible.</p></speech>

I may choose to join a trade union but next week I might choose to unjoin.  I will give the example of a mother with a baby with Down's syndrome.  Hopefully there is a partner but I will not complicate the matter by talking about them at the moment.  The availability of services and supports, including soft supports, and the fact that it is culturally okay to have a child with a disability have a bearing on a woman making a choice.  How does one make a choice when one does not have a choice?  What are the views of the witnesses as to the responsibilities of the State to enable a woman in such a situation to have an equal opportunity to make a choice?  In this case she would know that there were supports, whatever her decision, and that if she decided to give birth there would be a decent chance of dignity and a future for her child, and that she would be respected as a mother.</p></speech>

We have stated very clearly that abortion is not in isolation from all the other things in society, including the inequalities that women experience.  I agree that we need it to be easier in this society to have children.  There needs to be choice but there also need to be supports and the National Women's Council of Ireland campaigns for affordable child care and other things.  Disability is sometimes brought into the discussion disingenuously, and we need to do a lot more on the rights of people with disabilities, including the area of State supports where disabled people need it.  However, that does not take away from choice.</p> <p>  This is about the human rights of women, including the right to make choices and rights over our bodies, but that is totally missing from Senator Mullen's contribution.  We will never agree but abortion is a reality and women in Ireland choose to have abortions.  We have to make a decision about how we support those women and provide the services here because it is happening here.</p></speech>

In an answer to the Chairman's question, the special rapporteur clarified that the UN has nothing to say to contradict abortion at any stage before birth and that is very revealing.  Many Irish people will find that absolutely chilling.  I noticed the chairperson of the National Women's Council of Ireland nodding in approval as he conceded that.</p> <p>  We have asked what the UN supports but it is important to realise that we are talking about UN committees, which have been interpreting treaties to which member states have signed up.  These committees claim a moral authority and, on the back of that, declare that what they say is the UN's position.  In reality, these committees are highly ideological and their new version of human rights, which excludes babies before birth, has no legal standing.  This is why I say that what the special rapporteur is doing is so dangerous.  He has such a radicalised, perverted concept of human rights that he is undermining the moral authority of the UN in many areas.</p> <p>  Ms O'Connor represents an organisation that is an umbrella body for different women's organisations and gets significant State funding.  Perhaps she will tell us how much it gets.  She does not speak for many of the women who are members of these organisations and she never acknowledges the differences of opinion they have.  In surveys, the figures of those opposed to abortion are slightly higher among women than among men but the National Women's Council never speaks for them or acknowledges their existence.  The Constitution acknowledges the equal right to life of the unborn, meaning they are constitutionally protected human beings.  Is it not anomalous to get massive State funding to advocate a position that not everyone shares and goes directly against one of our fundamental constitutional rights?  Can Ms O'Connor give me any other example of an organisation which is opposed to the constitutional rights of other human beings in this country but which gets significant State support?  Can she not concede that, whatever about our difference of opinion, this is at least anomalous?  Would she not concede that she should also give voice to the thousands of women who are members of the organisations for which the National Women's Council is an umbrella group but who differ from her in believing that unborn children are human beings and ought not to be killed before birth?</p></speech>

The National Women's Council speaks for me on most issues and I do not believe its funding structure is a matter for the Joint Committee on Health.</p><p>I note people getting very exercised on the issue of abortion who are never exercised about any other aspect of women's health care.  It all comes down to one element for which, with respect to all of the people here and their views, there is an ideological difference between some of us.  The fact is, however, women cannot access a 20-week scan.  I would love to live in a country where men and women got exercised about the way that we let women down continuously but regrettably, it seems that level of hysteria can only be reached when discussing access to abortion services.  These people are not here to answer for the funding structure and it is not the business of this committee to interrogate that.</p></speech>

Long before Deputy O'Reilly was even heard of and long before her party ever spoke on the subject, I championed the criminalisation of the users of persons in prostitution; it has been one of my issues.  Any attempt to suggest that the concern of people who are opposed to abortion for women's health and well-being is partial is deeply ill-founded.</p></speech>

The passage of a child from its mother's womb to the outside world is a very short one but it seems to be jumping a huge gap in respect of its rights.  We are, and will be, discussing abortion in our Parliament over the next number of months.  In fact there is a Bill before the House tomorrow on attempting to decriminalise women who have had an abortion.  There was a lot of sympathy in the debate last night on how a woman who had procured an abortion in Ireland could be subject to a 14-year jail sentence and the purpose of the Bill debated last night is to reduce that to a small monetary fine because the Constitution does not allow complete decriminalisation of somebody who procures an abortion.  Certainly, the balancing of the right of an unborn child and giving it no balance whatsoever in respect of the mother and the mother having the right to control her own body without consulting the silent foetus seems difficult to conceive, if that is not the wrong word.  I find that difficult myself.  Does the UN have a difficulty like that?</p></speech>

We are talking about global concepts with regard to the termination of pregnancies.  Even if people agree the concept that a woman is entitled to her reproductive health, there is always a concept in legislation - which one will find in most national parliaments I know of - whereby a term limit is put on a stage at which a termination can take place, after which a termination cannot take place unless it is on health grounds.  Is Professor Pras saying the UN has no view on what stage a termination can take place?  Are we talking about pre-partum?  I seek clarity on this point because it is important.  I hope we are talking about two different things.  When Professor Pras talks about entitlement to a termination, is that for health or for life, as opposed to a decision which the woman makes?</p></speech>

Is it just the decision of the mother regardless of what condition her foetus is in?</p></speech>

Again, I think that is up to the parents - up to the mother - to decide.</p><p>We should not force people to have a child after we inform them of the results of prenatal diagnostics.  The idea behind the prenatal diagnostics is to inform people.  If we inform people that the child will be born, for example, with severe disability, my position is that we should respect the decision of the family.  Perhaps the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which is a board of independent experts interpreting the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, will protect the rights of those with disabilities.  The committee is not happy with the tendency of people to choose not to have children with disabilities.  We are back to advances in science.  This is a most sensitive issue.  My background is in working with children with disabilities.  I do not know why the world is looking for a cure for autism, for example.  For me, autism is a matter of diversity.  It is good that we have many children and adults who are autistic, yet science is looking for a cure for autism.  This is not about the termination of pregnancy.  If many people think it is okay to not have any more people with disabilities, it is a mistake.  I do not think I contradict myself when I say that parents have to make the choice but they have to be well informed.</p></speech>

I might begin to agree with Deputy O'Reilly as she appeared to be suggesting it is for Ireland to decide its own laws on abortion without regard to what the UN has to say.  She did not quite say that but she was going in that direction in her effort to support the special rapporteur.  Deputy O'Reilly is heading towards better ground because quite clearly there is no moral coherence coming from the UN.  We have just heard from the special rapporteur that, on the one hand, the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities might oppose - I would like to know if it does - a chromosomal abnormality as a ground for abortion because it is discrimination but he has no problem with it on his committee.  Not only that, he says he believes in promoting diversity and does not believe autism should be seen as something to be cured.  Yet, at the same time, despite his interest in diversity, he says that somehow disability can be a particular ground where abortion is legal even though it might not be legal otherwise.  That is logically incoherent, not to mind morally incoherent.</p></speech>

That is one thing.  The other thing is when that woman looks around her and sees there are no services or that they are scattered and  poor, it is a real influencer of choice.  At present, we are dealing in Ireland with women who gave up their children.  Did they give them up or did they have no choice?  We have to look at choice in the context in which it takes place.  Is it really a choice?  That brings me back to this difficult issue about the dominant culture.  Dare I ask, what is the fashion?  Who will knock on that woman's door, say they are there for her and that there is a health service, social service or education service available?  Who is there for them?  That is part of being able to cleanly exercise choice.  That is still something that needs to more strongly come into this discussion.  We will not solve it this evening but it is a really important practical element of it.</p></speech>

It is very important to say they did not just have their children taken from them.  By all accounts, what is emerging from the mother and baby homes and what some of us might have known for a while is that these women had their human rights violated in the most disgusting way possible.  If we want to talk about morals - Senator Mullen mentioned some sort of moral code - we have to take a good, long, hard look at ourselves and how we treated women down through the decades and generations.  Senator Mullen made a reference to something he was doing long before I was around.  I suspect long before he knew I was around I was campaigning for women's rights.  If his ears are deaf to those arguments, he probably did not.</p></speech>

The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 to provide for a requirement for registered medical practitioners to have medical indemnity insurance, except in certain circumstances, to give effect to Article 4 2.(d) of Directive 2011/24/eu of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 2011 on the application of patients rights in cross border health care and to provide for related matters.</p> <p>  I ask the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy to make her opening statement. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-08a.550" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1339" speakername="Marcella Corcoran Kennedy" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2017030800002#B00200"><p>I am very pleased to be here today at the resumption of the Committee Stage of this important Bill.  The Bill, which has been passed by the Seanad, will make it mandatory for medical practitioners to provide evidence of minimum levels of indemnity cover to the Medical Council, on registration with the Council and on annual renewal of registration.  There is currently no legal obligation on a medical practitioner to have medical indemnity insurance cover.  As a result, some patients and the users of medical practitioners' services may find they are unable to seek redress in the event of a medical mishap or negligent care from a medical practitioner.  Given the high cost of litigation and the long-term consequences of some adverse events, this legislation is to be welcomed as patient-focused and progressive.</p> <p>  The main purpose of the original Medical Practitioners Act 2007 is to protect the public and to have a proactive system of robust registration and regulation of the medical profession, in order to minimise the risk to the public and safeguard the health and well-being of people accessing health services.  Under the Medical Practitioners Act, the Medical Council must register every medical practitioner who practises in Ireland.  In anticipation of the enactment of this Bill, the Council already asks medical practitioners on application for registration and on annual retention of registration whether they have indemnity cover.</p> <p>  On the enactment of the legislation medical practitioners will not be registered to practise unless evidence of adequate indemnity cover is provided to the Council.  This development can only be to patients' benefit.  The Bill requires that the State Claims Agency would specify the minimum levels of indemnity required for medical practitioners in different medical specialties.  The State Claims Agency has the relevant competence and expertise in the area of managing clinical claims and it also has close links with medical indemnifiers and so is well placed to specify what the minimum levels of indemnity should be.</p> <p>  This policy change requires that a new function be given to the State Claims Agency under section 8 of the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2000.  There are currently 58 medical specialties on the Medical Council's register and practising in some would be higher risk than practising in others.  Within different specialties too, there could be a higher risk attached to certain types of practice.  It is important to point out that all doctors who work in the public health system are provided with medical indemnity insurance under the State's clinical indemnity scheme.  Likewise, private consultants who practise in public hospitals are also covered by this scheme.</p> <p>   However, doctors who are engaged in wholly private practice must purchase private indemnity insurance cover.  There is a wide range in the cost of cover for consultants engaged in wholly private practice.  For example, a consultant practising dermatology, based on figures from medical indemnifiers, would be considered low risk and the annual premium for this practice would be around &euro;16,000.  Nevertheless, a spinal surgeon may have to pay over &euro;100,000 for annual medical indemnity insurance cover, reflecting the much higher risk involved in that practice.  The cost of this private cover increased by approximately 42% for private consultants in 2014 and this was mainly due to the high cost of awards for clinical negligence.</p> <p>  We will now examine the Bill, which includes three minor technical Government amendments.  The amendments are needed because the original text of sections 45 and 50 of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 were amended by Regulation 95 of the transposing regulations of the European Union (Recognition of Professional Qualification) Regulations 2017, that is SI 8 of 2017.  I will explain the implications of these textual changes on sections 7 and 8 of the Bill as we examine those sections.</p></speech>

Subsection (1A) (a) requires a medical practitioner to provide evidence in the manner in which the Medical Council may specify in rules of the minimum level of indemnity which applies to his or her practice.  The Medical Council will provide all relevant information to registrants and prospective registrants on its website to assist them in complying with the legislation.</p><p>Subsection (1A)(b) requires a medical practitioners who is not engaged in medical practice and therefore who would not fall into a class of medical practitioners who must have medical indemnity to provide evidence that he or she is not engaged in practice, again in accordance with rules, which may be set out by the Medical Council.  </p><p> Subsection (1)(b) of the Bill had introduced a new subsection (8) after subsection (7) of section 45 of the Principal Act to specify that the Medical Council cannot register a medical practitioner who falls within a class of medical practitioner, which requires indemnity, unless the medical practitioner has provided evidence of his or her minimum level of indemnity cover as may be set out in rules under section 11(2)(va).  However, a minor amendment to that text is required for the following reason, which is that the Medical Practitioners (Amendment) Bill 2014 was passed by the Seanad on 4 November 2015, but section 45 of the Principal Act was amended by regulation 95 of the transposing regulations of the European Union (Recognition of Professional Qualifications) Regulation 2017, SI 8 of 2017 and was signed into law on 17 January 2017 by the Minister for Education and Skills.  These regulations transposed EU directive 2013/55/eu of the European Parliament and of the Council  of 20 November 2013 on the recognition of professional qualifications.  In this transposition subsections (4), (5) and (6) of section 45 were deleted by regulation 95.1(e) and an amendment is therefore required to the text of the current Bill to state that subsection (7) in section 45 of the Principal Act has now become subsection (3).</p><p> This is the effect of amendment No. 1 in the name of the Minister.  Following on from that the next subsection, that is subsection (8) will become subsection (4).  This is the effect of amendment No. 2 in the name of the Minister.</p></speech>

The joint committee has identified penal policy and reform as one of its priority issues in its 2017 work programme.  I welcome from the Irish Prison Service Mr. Michael Donnellan, director general; Mr. Fergal Black, Mr. Martin Smyth and Ms Ethal Gavin.  I also welcome Mr. John McDermott and Mr. Frank Hanlon.  On behalf of the committee, I thank them for their attendance to discuss this important issue.  The format of the meeting is that the delegates will be invited to make a brief opening statement which will be followed by a question and answer session.  It is our hope to conduct this engagement within one hour.  </p> <p>  I draw attention to the fact that witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p> <p>  Under the salient rulings of the Chair, members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. Donnellan to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I understand the committee is engaging with a range of groups, including the Irish Penal Reform Trust, the Prison Officers Association, etc.  The meetings will be very important in helping tjo chart the future of the Irish Prison Service in the context of penal reform.</p> <p>  The committee will be aware that significant change and reform have occurred in the prison system in recent years, addressing many of the issues highlighted by the committee, including prison numbers, overcrowding and prison conditions.  For years overcrowding caused a strain on the system and created significant challenges for management and staff of the Irish Prison Service in providing appropriate accommodation and constructive regimes for prisoners.  Thankfully, the issue of overcrowding has been eliminated in the majority of prisons.  The numbers in custody have fallen by 20% since their peak in 2011, while the numbers on temporary release have reduced by almost 70% during the same period.  The implementation of the fines legislation is starting to have an effect, with some drop in the numbers coming to prison for fines offences.  Provisional figures for 2016 show a decrease of approximately 15% on the figures for the previous year.  This reduction in numbers has allowed the Irish Prison Service to progress and enhance several key services, including enhanced pre-release planning and resettlement; structured temporary release; the community return scheme and the community support scheme; the incentivised regime programme; drug treatment facilities; developing the psychology service; integrated sentence management facilities; working with the families of those imprisoned, as well as working with the third level sector and in-reach services.</p> <p>  The Irish Prison Service has continued to implement a comprehensive capital programme to provide additional accommodation and enhance the quality of accommodation across the prison estate.  The priority has turned to improving existing accommodation and rehabilitative facilities.  The number of prisoners slopping out has decreased from 1,003 in 2010 to just 49 or less than 1%.  The refurbishment of Mountjoy Prison has been completed and all cells now have toilet facilities and wash-hand basins and been returned to single occupancy.  In 2016 we saw the opening of a new prison in Cork.  It provides high quality accommodation and for rehabilitation for families.  It also allows the service to provide enhanced visiting facilities for prisoners and their families.  Current and planned capital projects will result in the complete elimination of slopping out across the estate for the first time.</p><p> Huge progress has been made to incentivise prisoners to participate in constructive activities.  The incentivised regime programme has provided real incentives to prisoners to participate and engage and has also reduced levels of violence across the estate.  New training facilities have been provided for the first time in Mountjoy Prison.  It is vital that the services and opportunities provided are available to all prisoners.  As the committee will be aware, some prisoners are unable to associate with other prisoners for various reasons.  These are mainly factors that come into the prison from outside and prison management must ensure the safety of all who work and reside within the walls.  That said, we have made huge strides in reducing the numbers of prisoners who require protection or are accommodated on a restricted regime.  The number of prisoners on 22 or 23-hour lock-up, or solitary confinement, has decreased from 211 in July 2013 to 72 in January this year.  While this figure can fluctuate, we hope to and I am confident that we can eliminate solitary confinement as we know it when we implement the Mandela rules and our new policies.</p><p> The work we have undertaken has positively contributed to the goal of a safer, fairer and inclusive Ireland.  Since 2013, in partnership with the Central Statistics Office, CSO, annual recidivism studies have been published that show a reduction in recidivism levels from 55% in 2007 to 45% in 2010, a drop of ten points.  I am confident that we can take that down by another ten points over the next ten years and meet the best practice within Europe. </p><p> There are still significant challenges facing the Prison Service, including issues of mental health, the management of prisoners on protection and how the service can best manage violently disruptive prisoners.  I am confident the Prison Service can meet these challenges and the work being undertaken by the committee will assist in our endeavours. </p><p> I am confident that the successful implementation of our strategy for 2012 to 2015 and our new strategy, built around four pillars - supporting our staff, supporting our prisoners, supporting victims and enhancing our organisational capacity - will see further improvements across the Prison Service in the years to come.  I have no doubt that we could become a world-class prison service.</p></speech>

Prisons are always a microcosm of society.  We engage with people in prisons to deal with the situation we encounter.  All prisoners who are on committal will see a nurse or doctor within 24 hours.  Where people who have addiction issues give a history of opiate use and test positive for opiates and where they have been maintained on methadone treatments in the community, we will continue that treatment while they remain in custody.  There are currently just under 10,000 people on methadone treatments in the community.  Additionally, we have a contract with Merchants Quay Ireland to provide addiction counselling in 12 of our 13 institutions.  We have addiction pharmacists in Mountjoy and other facilities, and we have general practitioners, GPs, with a special interest in substance misuse.</p> <p>  In summary, we provide a range of services for people addicted to drugs within the prison system.  While the numbers on methadone in the community have continued to rise in the last few years, we have seen a significant reduction in prisons.  There were 750 people on methadone maintenance across the prison system when I came to the Prison Service in 2008.  There are 465 today.  There has been a change in that, notwithstanding the reduction in numbers.</p> <p>  We regard prison as an ideal opportunity for somebody to address his or her addiction issues.  We have a self-directed detox programme in the Mountjoy campus where people can reduce their methadone intake by 5 ml a week under the supervision of the doctor and pharmacist.  We did research in the last two years, from June 2014 to December 2016.  We had 530 patients involved in self-directed detox in Mountjoy.  Some 120 have come off methadone completely and 88 are still off methadone as of last week.  Some 197 reduced their methadone intake by a minimum of 20 ml.</p> <p>  We are concerned about other drugs, particularly new psychoactive substances, NPS.  Deputies will be aware from looking at recent media footage of what is going on in English jails of the impact of NPS on violence and deaths in custody in English jails.  We have not seen it to any significant extent here yet.  We have seen some small episodes of it.  We have brought over our colleagues from Public Health England and the National Health Service, NHS, to help us to try to ensure that we are prepared if NPS becomes a real problem in the way that it has in English and Scottish jails.</p></speech>

Those 72, as of 1 January, are people who would be in their cells for 22 or 23 hours a day.  They would mostly be people who have mental health problems and may be awaiting a place at the Central Mental Hospital, CMH.  They may be people who fear for their lives and that they are going to be attacked because of the crimes they have committed.  We also have other people there for a whole range of reasons, including debt, money and drugs, who say to us that they cannot come out onto the landing, cannot associate with others and that we need to protect them.  We have to work with that group because we know the psychological damage that that does to people.  We are working to eliminate that practice.</p></speech>

That will not happen in the short term due to our current staffing issues.  We hope that we could develop a 40-bed therapeutic community in the beginning of 2018, in the area that was occupied by children in St. Patrick's Institution, which has been significantly developed.  We are working with a number of providers and hope that we could develop a therapeutic community model in prisons.  It has never been done in Ireland.  We have visited a number across Europe and we think that there is a real benefit but we have to wait to get the staff.</p></speech>

We have canine units, nets, search procedures and all of those things.  The reality is that it is almost impossible to stop drugs from getting into prison.  There is a situation in which families are under significant pressure to bring in drugs from all sorts of sources.  We are very conscious of that.</p> <p>  The training unit in Mountjoy does not have in-cell sanitation and we were looking at it.  It offers a drug-free location for people.  Given that our numbers have fallen, we have to consider the growing number of older individuals in custody when developing our overall infrastructure.  The number has risen from a very small base, but today we have about 250 people over 55 years of age.  International research shows that older prisoners compare unfavourably with their counterparts in the community.  Old age would be at 55 rather than 65.  We have decided to refurbish the training unit as a facility for older prisoners.  We are going to refurbish that over the next 18 months and ensure that we develop a state-of-the-art facility for older prisoners which meets their needs.</p><p>We will then relocate the current facility in the training unit into what was the old St. Patrick's Institution but will continue the same regime within that.  Our intention is to continue to offer a facility for people who are not involved in drugs and for people who have addressed their substance misuse and to effectively operate in the same was as we have always done.</p></speech>

The plan for Mountjoy within the next three months is that the C and D divisions will accommodate ordinary prisoners, while the A and B divisions will accommodate protection prisoners.  Mountjoy west, which is the old St. Patrick's Institution, will accommodate super-enhanced people, that is, the old training unit people.  There is in-cell sanitation there.  Then we will work on the training unit.  There is a natural flow within the Mountjoy campus for everybody from the inner city area of Dublin.</p></speech>

What percentage of the cost is attributed to rehabilitation, education and support?  I ask the witnesses to give a breakdown of the unit costs per prisoner and an outline of what the Prison Service does to provide an appropriate, wraparound intervention for the individual.</p></speech>

Approximately 75% of that budget is for staff costs, with the rest for programme costs, including maintenance, food, clothing, light, heat, power and providing the regime.  The latter is Mr. Black's area so he can provide more details.</p></speech>

Effectively, I have responsibility for non-security issues.  I am responsible for education, work training, psychology, chaplaincy and all of the services that are there to assist prisoners.  In terms of education, for example, the service is provided by the Education and Training Boards, ETBs.  They provide the 220 whole-time equivalent teachers across the 13 prisons.  The cost of their salaries is not included in our budget of &euro;25 million.  Similarly, the cost of the 250 work training officers that we employ, which amounts to approximately &euro;16 million, is not included in our budget.  The programme costs also include pharmaceuticals and all of the other elements of a care and rehabilitation service.</p></speech>

When we had massive overcrowding problems five years ago, rehabilitation did not really feature because it was so difficult to get to people.  Our numbers have come down and we now have about 97 per 100,000, whereas our colleagues in England have double that.  Now we have an opportunity for the first time in Ireland to really address the purpose of prison, namely to rehabilitate people and create fewer victims by ensuring that people who come into prison have the best opportunity to change.</p></speech>

The Department and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality have decided that a new inspector will be appointed through the Public Appointments Service, PAS.  The position will be advertised in the coming months and a new Inspector of Prisons will appointed through the PAS system.

We have the national drug treatment programme, which operates in the medical unit in Mountjoy.  We commissioned a review last year and are building a full curriculum around that.  We have organisations such as Coolmine Therapeutic Community, Ballymun Youth Action Program, YAP, the Ana Liffey Drug Project,  Merchants Quay Ireland and the Harmony Programme operating that service on our behalf.  There are 18 beds in that unit.  When individuals come into prison who are using illicit substances, the first thing we do is try to get them to stop using those substances and get them stabilised on methadone.  Then, when and if they are ready, we try to wean them off or detox them from methadone.  If that proves possible, they can go on the drug treatment programme and get to a drug-free status.  Beyond that, we need to provide appropriate locations so that they can maintain that drug-free status.  In that context, we have more than 20 addiction counsellors from Merchants Quay Ireland who provide supports.  We also have 140 nurses who operate 24/7 and doctors with expertise in addiction psychiatry.  We have a range of services available, including educational services.  All of those services are there to assist people, ultimately, to leave prison and live more purposeful lives.</p></speech>

While the witnesses would argue that the prison provides an environment for prisoners to end their addiction and to avail of wraparound services, many of the people I have met would have a contrary view.  Many told me that the prison environment made their addiction worse.  In fact, many of them developed polydrug use while in prison and their level of addiction actually increased.</p></speech>

Are we doing our best, in terms of the current allocations, to provide rehabilitation for prisoners?</p></speech>

It makes no sense that anybody would leave prison worse than when he or she went in.  Overcrowding really did not allow for much to be done, apart from crowd control and the warehousing of people.  We now have an opportunity to have a debate about the importance of prison and its potential contribution for people.  I believe that it is possible to engage people, in their hearts and minds, and to encourage them.  Realistically, a lot of people come into prison with problems.  We estimate that approximately 70% of people come into prison with an addiction or substance abuse problem.  That is the reality and they do not give it up when they come into prison.  They will use every opportunity to further that but we must be there to encourage change.</p></speech>

I worked in D&oacute;chas and ran some programmes with the organisation with which I work.  I found it an amazing experience.  I worked with prisoners who were incredible.  They really wanted to recover.  It is very difficult for prison officers to work in the chaos of addiction.  We have worked with family members who have a loved one with an alcohol, drug or gambling problem and the chaos for them is soul destroying.  People do not know how to cope.  There are significant mental health issues for those suffering from an addiction and their family members.  I saw this in the Irish Prison Service in general with the staff, who are under significant pressure in working with those who are in the chaos of addiction.  The problems in D&oacute;chas were not related to heroin alone, there was a significant issue with prescription medications which were probably more of an issue.  A lot of the women in prison were there for crimes related to alcohol.  They also had alcohol issues.  Is there a programme for prison officers to give them information on the impact of addiction and how they can deal with it?  I have no doubt that there is burnout among staff.  If they burn out, they will become angry and frustrated and get fed up.  Personal mental health issues also arise.  Are there supports in place for staff to deal with the chaos of addiction?</p></speech>

Prison officers interact day in and day out with people who are chaotic and need help and support.  We have a training college where we train all prison staff.  We have a number of courses which prison staff can attend.  Recently, we developed a mental health course for staff, which is really effective because it begins to help staff to get an insight into people's mental health problems and know the signs to look out for.  Suicide is an issue in prison and very traumatising.  We have a range of supports in place.  We also have a staff support system under which we have staff support officers available to whom staff can go for help or to get advice.  We provide a counselling service, have an employee assistance programme and a freefone number which prison officers can ring 24/7 if they go home from work and have experienced something really difficult.</p> <p>  The Senator is correct - prison can be chaotic because one has a range of people with different needs and from different backgrounds.  The majority have come from highly traumatised backgrounds with early childhood problems that play out in the prison environment.  For many prisoners drugs offer pain relief and they do not care what they take.  They take it to soften the damage caused by their pain.  It is about getting through that barrier with them and supporting staff.  As the Senator said, it is a very difficult environment.</p></speech>

We only ran three programmes because the funding ran out.  Unfortunately, education which is very important for prisoners got in the way of the programmes we were running.  Many of the women had been born into homes where there was an addiction.  What we tried to do was to help them to understand why they were suffering from an addiction and to find compassion for themselves so as not to constantly beat themselves up about being a bad person because they had an addiction.  That is from where I am coming.  Unfortunately, the education programme got in the way of that work.  What I mean is that the women had to go to their education classes in order to get certificates that would be good for them following release.  Would it be a good idea to prioritise addiction services and recovery and provide certificates for attendance at therapeutic instead of education programmes?  I do not say education is not good because it is very important, but, unfortunately, it got in the way of some of the therapeutic elements of the programmes we ran.</p></speech>

We try to celebrate any achievement of prisoners.  Most prisoners have dropped out of society.  As Mr. Donnellan said, they have had a poor educational experience.  They are poor economically, but they are also poor emotionally, psychologically and in other ways.  We are dealing with a range of complex issues.  On the drug treatment programmes provided by the Red Cross and Samaritans, we look to celebrate any achievement of prisoners because they have not had many opportunities.  To answer the question specifically, it is really about where a person is at.  He or she needs to want to be part of the addiction programme.  We will support anyone to manage his or her addiction, but we also want to encourage people to engage in education, work training and offence focused work with the psychology, chaplaincy and all such services.  I personally believe it is about creating a balance within a prison.  I remember an occasion in the D&oacute;chas Centre in the education unit a couple of years ago with Senator Frances Black where there was unnecessary friction or competition.</p></speech>

At that point he wanted to move into recovery.  He wanted to get into a treatment centre, but, unfortunately, they could not get him in anywhere.  She ended up ringing the Joe Duffy show.  I have given this example previously.  Thankfully, as a result, he got into a treatment centre and is now doing really well.  He graduated and is fantastic.  He was in and out of prison constantly, but he has not gone back to prison since.  Is it possible to have intervention when people are going through the courts and for a judge to give a person a choice of six months in recovery or six months in prison?  Would the delegates agree with having such an approach?</p></speech>

We actively support that continuum to ensure people will be given the opportunity.  Perhaps Mr. Smyth might want to say something on that point.</p></speech>

We do everything we can to incentivise prisoners to engage in drug addiction programmes and face up to the challenge of overcoming their addictions.  We do not have a specific checklist in considering concessions for prisoners such as release under a community return scheme, for example.  There are a number of factors we consider, but we always pay particular attention and give credit to any prisoner with addiction issues or who had them in the past and has made efforts within the prison to tackle them.  Essentially, we are talking about an issue of security - fighting the contraband and trying to prevent smuggling.  There is also, as my colleague mentioned, the issue of rehabilitation.  To incentivise prisoners, we give credit in assessing people for onward movement to open centres or even to external drug treatment facilities.</p></speech>

I thank the delegates for coming before the committee.  I am sorry that we have dragged them away from their other responsibilities as we know very well about the good job they do.</p> <p>  Before I forget it, I will mention the Red Cross first.  I was going to bring up the issues of programme also.  Reference was made to the importance of celebrating achievement and validating people's experience.  It is critically important to normalise prisoners as productive members of society.  We have seen the value of this and other programmes.</p><p>We had organised a visit to the Oireachtas for some of the participants in the scheme - current and former inmates who are willing to give up their time and explain to colleagues what that job involves.  Everything was ready to go but, as members know, it was pulled at the last minute.  My belief is that somebody in the Department of Justice and Equality probably panicked and thought the gutter press would go on a rampage about criminals drinking tea and eating sandwiches in the D&aacute;il while crime spirals, or the usual sensationalised rubbish.  That is the only reason I can see because it is utterly valid for those people to come here and talk about this programme.  We want to do that again.  Without putting the witnesses on the spot in any way, our belief is that this is valid and would be good.  I presume the witnesses do not have any fears that there would be any negative consequences.  Nobody will be harmed by it.  Could the witnesses give us their views on that?  Would they like to come in?  I do not mean to be unfair or put them on the spot but could the witnesses talk more about that programme and how it would be good if they came here and presented it?</p><p> I thought Mr. Donnellan's point that, for the first time, the Irish Prison Service is in a position to really deal with the problems and tackle the rehabilitative end was interesting.  I have no hesitation in saying that this ideology and ethos is at the top of the Irish Prison Service and is shared by many of the staff.  The question of whether we are any nearer achieving it is probably a different story.  It is not because of any lack of will.  I fully appreciate that but there is a huge gap in terms of delivering it.  The drugs problem starts with sentencing.  I do not understand why people who have a drug problem are being sentenced to prison.  They should be sentenced to some rehabilitative facility if they wish.  What is the witnesses' level of knowledge of people who are being cajoled, threatened or forced into bringing drugs back to prison when they are on a day out, possibly to pay off a debt?  That vicious circle is very difficult to address.  Even when people are trying to get off drugs, if they are in a chaotic environment where they are isolated, the instinct to go back to drugs is there.  The challenges in this area are huge.  Do the witnesses have any comments to make about criminal involvement sinking in?</p><p> Ultimately, training is key.  Following on from the points made by Deputy Jack Chambers, I still do not really get what is happening in the training unit.  The explanation did not satisfy me.  The training unit as an ideology was ahead of its time in the European context.  The training unit in Mountjoy was very high spec and involved working with people who were drug-free, rehabilitating them and normalising their life inside.  It is the only facility in Dublin that does so.  The inmates sleep and eat there, and the staff ratios are incredibly low.  It is probably the cheapest facility the Irish Prison Service runs and yet there have been no assaults and no problems with staff and inmates.  I could not believe it when I heard that it will be shut down in three months time.  I do not see why an old people's facility could not be developed alongside it because it is about more than training.  It is about adjusting to a way of life and it is incredibly efficient.  I would be very worried if it was to go because from where will that experience and acclimatising be replaced?  I do not see how.  </p><p> In respect of training for staff, there is a view among some prisoners that new staff often come in and are "up for it" with lots of new ideas but that gets knocked out of them fairly quickly.  They become demoralised or institutionalised.  Some of the older staff then feel that they have been there for far longer and are not appreciated.  Sometimes they feel that they are put in vulnerable positions where they do not get backup.  They can become dehumanised themselves because of being cut off and the circumstances they are exposed to.  While there may be some access to supports, it is never enough in any job.  We need to pay a lot of attention to staff in terms of welfare because the environment plays with people's heads and affects the way they think.  People can become dehumanised and institutionalised on all sides and that needs to be addressed.  There is a need for enhanced training.  I am interested in the mental health training programme that was mentioned but that should be mandatory for everybody and should be of a high level.  That obviously means money.  I am not blaming the witnesses, but is that their view? </p><p> How many people are in prison because of society's failure to fill the gap caused by shutting down all these horrendous institutions we read about day in and day out, even the psychiatric hospitals?  Previously, people who had problems were sent to these hospitals and locked behind closed doors.  Nobody wants that but there is a huge gap.  How many of these people are now in prison so that the management and staff have to pick up the pieces regarding people who need help?  I know evidence was given to the Committee of Public Accounts that there are 30 inmates with severe psychiatric problems and it is the staff who must deal with them.  In respect of the relationship with the Central Mental Hospital and how it could be improved, it is completely unacceptable that management, prison staff and prisoners are left in a situation where, when somebody requires urgent medical help, only one person is taken in for a couple of weeks and then sent back again.  It is just not on.  I am amazed nobody has been killed in our prisons.  It is incredible.  Is there anything we can do to deal with that issue?  To me, that is the key.  If people who should not be in prison at all got help for issues, it would simplify things.  If we got all of these people out of prison and got them treatment, we could do what they do in Norway where, when somebody comes into prison, he or she is told they will be working with a specific person until he or she leaves prison.  The day ones go in, one is on a pathway to how one reconnects when one goes back out.  Unless we get there, the rates will be higher.  These are just a few observations.</p></speech>

It is the only facility on the Mountjoy campus that does not have in-cell sanitation.  Every other cell in Mountjoy has in-cell sanitation.  Time has moved on.  The training unit was in its heyday when Mountjoy was very poor in terms of accommodation and in-cell sanitation so we find it quite difficult to get people to go to the training unit because the conditions in Mountjoy or the Midlands Prison are far superior.  What we must do is move on and look at what accommodation we have and how we are going to re-purpose it.  If members have ever visited the training unit, they will know that it is a very low-rise, sprawling building.  We think it would make an ideal facility for older people.  That is the issue regarding the training unit.</p> <p>  The Red Cross and the Samaritans listener scheme are so important to the Irish Prison Service and do phenomenal work.  The support we get from the Samaritans and the International Red Cross is phenomenal.  The media keeps a focus on prison and we are always judged on our last mistake.  We do 99 good things every day but if we make one mistake, we will always get into the newspapers for it.  That is the reality of prison life and I do not think I can change that but we just have to tell it as it is, try to be honest and put our hands up when we get it wrong.  From time to time, we get it wrong so we have to say when we get it wrong and be honest with the media and change the narrative.</p><p>Deputy Clare Daly and this committee can also change the narrative regarding how we deal with offenders.  If we deal better with offenders, we will have fewer victims.  We will have fewer victims if we pull in these people and try to support and help them.</p><p> The mental health training is absolutely fundamental.  It is a very detailed programme that has been worked out by psychology, psychiatry and our prison staff.  People very much enjoy it and we need to do it more.</p><p> Drugs continue to be an issue, and we have addressed that.  In 1950, there were 30,000 people in mental health hospitals.  Today, are there 1,100?</p></speech>

Prisons held 370 people.  Today, 3,700 are held in prisons.  There is therefore no doubt but that there has been a displacement of essentially poor people - not just economically poor, as Mr. Black has said, but poor in every way.  There is an opportunity in Ireland to have a reasoned debate as to what the quality of prison should be and what contribution should be made in that regard.  Prison is important for violent people and people who commit very serious offences.  Prison is important and it will always be there but we must look beyond prison, as 99.9% of people in prison will come out into their home communities.  We must make sure we get ready for that.</p></speech>

Apart from its structural, physical relocation, the training unit's purpose of normalisation and resocialisation, particularly for prisoners coming towards the end of long sentences, will remain.  A large proportion of the prisoners in the training unit have been through the parole board process and are on programmes already approved by the T&aacute;naiste.  We will not be changing this in any way.  I wish to give an undertaking that the position of non-parole board prisoners, that is, those prisoners whom my staff sentence-manage directly, who are going in and out every day to engage in employment or training etc., will not change.  We are not moving these people to a darker place or moving away from our ethos of renormalisation.  I wish to put the Deputy's mind at ease regarding that aspect of the matter.</p></speech>

Since Deputy Clare Daly has robbed all the time and the questions, I will be as brief as I can.  I am disappointed to hear that if I end up in prison, I will be considered an old man, given that I am over 55.</p> <p>  It has been brought to our attention and highlighted to us that while there have been huge improvements in Cork with the new prison - the old one was in a very dilapidated condition - chronic staff shortages at the prison has left one of the wings in a bad state, with low staff morale, widespread bullying of prisoners and deteriorated staff-prisoner interaction.  Are staffing levels a big problem?  We understand further that many retirements are coming down the track.  Will recruitment numbers be sufficient to fill the gap?  On the same theme, I think we all agree that rehabilitation and dealing with prisoners' mental health challenges and drug use are important.  We know what needs to be done.  We are probably a little sceptical that we can make serious progress in these areas unless the Irish Prison Service gets more resources.  What do the witnesses think about this aspect of the matter?  Deputy Daly talked about the media.  It is unfortunate that sometimes, some people do not do the right thing because of how the media might react to it.  I think we would all be better off if we cared less about what the media think and just went ahead and did what we think we should do.</p> <p>  Would it be more difficult to control the prison population if there were no drugs or is that a false notion?</p></speech>

No, I do not believe so.  If there were no drugs, we would have achieved the perfect prison.  One would expect we would have achieved a highly motivated prisoner population at that point because they would not want drugs.  In other words, we do not encourage drug-taking in prisons at all.  It does not make our working environment better.  As Mr. Black and my other colleagues have already said, we are encouraging prisoners to avail of the therapeutic services in place such as those provided by Merchants Quay Ireland.  Methadone clinics also assist prisoners towards achieving their personal goal of giving up drugs.  It would therefore not be easier at all, to my mind.  It would be much easier if we had a drug-free environment.</p> <p>  The mental health training is a six-hour programme which every single governor in the system is encouraging our training liaison officers to make sure is part of the overall training plan so that every single officer gets the training in a short timeframe.  We are very motivated towards ensuring that training need among our staff is satisfied.</p> <p>  Yes, there are many retirements but this correlates with the fact that many staff came in 30 years ago and have the opportunity now to leave.  This is an unfortunate situation.  Perhaps the closing of the training unit will consolidate resources for the short term in order that we can acknowledge the elderly within our prison and give them for the first time a unit specific to that category of prisoner.  It is very difficult when people have to move but as the training unit is on the Mountjoy site, both staff and prisoners, as my colleague in operations has said, will be facilitated and I think the greater good will be achieved in closing the unit.</p></speech>

We have come out of one of the worst times economically, as the committee is aware.  Our budgets were cut and cut and cut and we had to make phenomenal savings.  This year will be the first time a newly recruited prison officer will be seen coming into the Prison Service.  That is the reality of where we are with our staffing.  Next year we will really build on that and have significant recruitment.  We have not been allowed to recruit prison officers because of the moratorium and our budgets.  This is the first year we will put this right but we have recruited other people and Mr. Black can perhaps-----</p></speech>

We have also recruited nurses in the past two months.  We brought in six new resettlement support workers because we see the importance of the Prison Service being outward-looking, working with organisations to facilitate the transition from custody to community.  Our resettlement support workers link in.  We now have a protocol drafted with the County and City Management Association on accommodation provision.  We have a memorandum of understanding with the HSE to ensure those eligible for medical cards have continuation on release and with the Department of Social Protection.  This is always difficult for us because the media can portray it differently but we see this very much as providing protective factors for people leaving prison to ensure society is safer.  If someone has uninterrupted prescriptions, access to a general practitioner, accommodation and income, we believe they have a significant chance.  Our job is to make these links.  We cannot provide the services - we are the Prison Service - but we have fairly effectively mobilised the other organisations in the State to help us to ensure this transition is successful.</p></speech>

We are not saying it is the Prison Service's fault but we are convinced it will be necessary to put many more resources into the Prison Service if we are to get the results we would like.  The chances of getting them without actually investing in it is just pie in the sky.</p><p> Is the special unit being built in the midlands still going ahead?

However, the case load of the national forensic mental health service at the Central Mental Hospital is of the order of 220 patients at any time.  These are people in prison with a severe and enduring mental illness.  The greatest challenge we face within the prison service is managing these people in a safe way.  Notwithstanding the best efforts of all our staff, including prison officers, nurses and doctors, this is a major challenge for us.</p> <p>  The imminent announcement of the opening of the new Central Mental Hospital should help.  Recently, we have secured some additional consultant psychiatrists for the prison in Castlerea.  We are about to get posts for the prisons in Cork and Limerick.  We will have a full spread of national forensic services in all our closed prisons.  The HSE and the Prison Service are delivering more forensic services to the prisons because that is where the need arises.</p></speech>

My first question relates to the detox programmes.  I know the deputation touched on methadone.  What other detox programmes does the Prison Service run?  Does the service run any other medicated detox programmes apart from methadone?</p> <p>  Mr. Donnellan touched on another point.  He spoke of the continuation of supports when people are leaving prison.  That is critical.  Let us face reality: the vast majority of people who go into prison are there for a short period.  Let us suppose they go in with a substance misuse or addition problem and they start a detox programme.  It is critical that the programme is continued on the outside.</p> <p>  Many of the people I meet find it really difficult to continue the programme of detox and supports when they come out of prison.  I realise this is probably outside the remit of the Prison Service, because it relates to what happens back in the community, and I realise the Prison Service staff do the best they can to try to match up those services.  However, this needs to be worked on in a holistic fashion.  It cannot simply be left to the Prison Service to try to ensure the continuation of supports and services.  That is one of the failings currently in terms of trying to address addiction problems in prison when prisoners come back out.</p></speech>

It all goes for naught if the person comes out and does not have methadone or supports.  Our new job in the prisons is to make those connections with people as they come back into the community.  The first 24 or 48 hours is the most dangerous period for the community when someone comes out of prison.  We need to ensure they have the supports that are needed.  The committee will have representatives from the Probation Service in next.  The Probation Services provides much of that support on release.  The Deputy is correct: it is critical for us to ensure support is available.</p> <p>  We do a good deal in this area.  We maintain we should not let people out of prison on a Friday afternoon or Saturday or Sunday because there is no support available for them to pick up.  Several people could go on community return or support.  However, we will not let them go because they have no house, flat, bed or hostel or they are not connected with a treatment facility.</p> <p>  Five years ago, we simply had to let these people go.  There was no choice because a further 100 people were coming in and we could not cope with the numbers.  However, for the first time we have a chance to properly plan for release into the community.</p></speech>

The service is not only for opiates; it also operates for benzodiazepines etc.  The reality is that for those who are not linked in with treatment services in the community, we have to ensure that on release, a treatment place is available.  We can only start people on a programme where we can ensure that the place is available on release.  The system has got better in recent years.  We are involved with the Department of Health in the oversight forum on drugs.  Several pockets exist throughout the country where problems arise.  However, we try to link people in.  We work with our colleagues in the voluntary sector to try to ensure that people are linked in with services but it is not always possible.</p></speech>

I have read the opening statement from Mr. Donnellan.  I congratulate Mr. Donnellan on his reappointment as director general of the Prison Service.  I believe it was a wise move because he has done an extraordinary job.  The resources of the Prison Service have been cut considerably in recent years.  Yet, what the service has achieved has been remarkable.  We have gone from 1,000 people to 50 people slopping out.  That is only one figure but it is remarkable.</p> <p>  The Prison Service officials can take it from the tone of this committee that we are very much in unison in terms of the work the Prison Service staff are doing, their attitudes and their approach.  We are very much of the view that when people go to prison, it should be for rehabilitation.  This view is not shared by the public, unfortunately, and that is the job we have to do.  A prisoner may be given a sentence for several years.  Society needs to embrace the fact that these individuals and citizens will be back out in the community.  We have a duty and responsibility to rehabilitate them.</p> <p>  I am one of the longest-serving members because I was on the last committee.  We visited Mountjoy Prison and Cork Prison, before the new prison building was constructed there.  It would not be a bad idea, Chairman, if we were to revisit Cork Prison to see what is happening in the new prison.  There is nothing better than being in a place to really get a flavour for what is happening.</p> <p>  The idea of prison as an absolute last resort is something we all support.  I am keen to offer whatever practical assistance those of us in the Oireachtas can give, outside of funding.  The fines legislation has certainly made a difference.  I note that Mr. Donnellan has indicated the Prison Service is already noticing the difference in this regard.  Are there other areas where we can assist?  Would other legislation assist in ensuring that those who should not be committed to prison can be dealt with in another way?</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Clare Daly's suggestion that mental health training should be mandatory.  The committee should write to the Minister and look for additional funding to be made available to the Prison Service in order that it can provide mental health training to all staff.  It is a good thing that new prison officers will be recruited this year.  That is important.</p> <p>  My final question is important from our perspective.  I am not convinced that prison visiting committees serve any useful purpose.  I am keen to hear the view of Prison Service officials on how effective they are.  Is there a better or more meaningful role for them?  Is there something better they could do?</p> <p>  My next comment is on the whole structure of whistleblowing within the structures of the Prison Service.</p><p>Based on what is going on in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I presume the Prison Service has an established protocol for whistleblowers who have concerns about, for example, what Deputy Wallace was saying about bullying.  If someone were to come forward, are proper structures in place to deal with it?</p></speech>

Punitivism does not really work.  Many countries have tried it and it fails again and again.  We have to go beyond punitivism and look at other things.</p> <p>  Prison visiting committees have an important role.  They comprise ordinary citizens who have the right to come into prisons, walk around and interact with prisoners and staff.  That is important because prisons are closed, institutional places and the more that people come from the outside in, the more helpful it is.</p> <p>  On whistleblowing, we also have protected disclosures just like everyone else.  There is no doubt that bullying happens.  In the prison environment, prisoner on prisoner bullying happens, but we try to deal with it as effectively as we can.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, the clock is going to beat me.  There were themes running through all of the questions and contributions.  Some words recurred.  Mr. Donnellan referred himself to "cut, cut, cut" but what I heard on this side was "drugs, drugs, drugs".  There are so many areas we have not had the opportunity to address.  If it is within the witnesses' gift to offer any additional information in a written submission subsequent to the meeting, I would be very interested to hear about work and education opportunities within prisons.  These are words that have not come into our dialogue this morning, which concerns me.  Sport and recreation are others.  I would be very concerned if we were driven into a particular set of focuses rather than to look at the whole subject holistically.  These are essential areas to address which, unfortunately, the ticking clock will not allow me to get to.  I will not even give myself the opportunity to add an addendum at this point.  If the witnesses could offer a written precis of these services currently, it would be greatly appreciated.</p> <p>  My final task relates to the group photo.  That is why we have such a great attendance this morning.  Members love getting their photographs taken with visiting representatives.  Deputy Wallace even got a new perm this morning.  We like to include each of the participating witness groups in our reports.  The photographer for the Houses of the Oireachtas is outside to take a picture and I invite the witnesses to join us for that.</p> <p>  Before suspending the meeting for five minutes to attend to that photograph, I thank on behalf of the committee the witnesses and their colleagues for their contributions this morning.  I found them hugely informative, very interesting and encouraging in terms of wanting to learn more.</p></speech>

The purpose of this part of the meeting is to engage with the service on the issue of penal policy and reform.  For the information of our guests, the joint committee has identified penal policy and reform as one of its priority issues for the 2017 work programme.  I welcome Mr. Vivian Geiran, director of the Probation Service.  He is joined by Ms Ita Burke, Ms &Uacute;na Doyle and Mr. Brian Dack.  On behalf of the committee, I thank them for their attendance here today to discuss this very important issue.  I apologise for the late start.  Our first session, with the Prison Service representatives, ran on a little.  The format of the meeting is that the witnesses will be invited to make a brief opening statement, and this will be followed by questions and answers.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should neither criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members should be aware that, under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite Mr. Geiran to make the opening statement.</p></speech>

I am joined today by my colleagues: deputy directors Ms Ita Burke and Ms &Uacute;na Doyle, and assistant director Mr. Brian Dack.  I propose, in these opening remarks, to give the committee a brief overview of the role and work of the Probation Service and to highlight some key issues that may assist the committee.  In the more extensive briefing paper, which will have been made available to members ahead of today's hearing, they will see more detailed information about the structure and work of the service.  In addition, my colleagues and I will, of course, be more than happy to answer any questions and engage in further discussion on any matter as the committee sees fit.<br/><br/>Probation, as a concept and a practice, has been around, both in these islands and internationally, for more than 100 years.  The 1907 Probation of Offenders Act is still very much the core legislation for what the Irish Probation Service does every day.  Probation, across the world, is based on the idea of offering offenders a second chance to make good for the harm they have caused, and specifically not to reoffend.  Probation also works on the basis of a classic carrot-and-stick approach, that is, offering help<i></i>to the offender to make positive changes in their life, but within specific boundaries<i></i>of supervision, surveillance and control.  While there is an undoubted need for custodial sanctions &ndash; prison &ndash; in penal systems, international research consistently shows that punitive responses to crime alone, such as imprisonment, are in themselves statistically not as successful in reducing reoffending as community-based sanctions such as probation, which are shown to be generally more effective in reducing the risk of reoffending.<br/><br/>The two primary areas of work undertaken by the Probation Service are offender assessment and offender supervision.  Most assessments are undertaken by probation officers at the request of the courts to assist in sentencing decisions and to identify what factors need to be addressed to reduce an individual's likelihood of reoffending.  Other individual offender assessments are undertaken by probation officers on behalf of the Parole Board and the Irish Prison Service, for example.<br/><br/>Offender supervision programmes come under two broad headings: probation-type supervision and community service.  Probation supervision includes a range of interventions undertaken with offenders, mainly in the community, aimed at helping them to reduce their risk of reoffending and make good the harm caused by their offending.  Specifically, these interventions, which are based on the probation officer's initial risk and needs assessment, enlist the co-operation of the offender and those around them, such as family and other positive supports, to address any dynamic - by which is meant open to possible change - issues or factors that may have contributed to their offending.  These factors can include anti-social attitudes, pro-criminal associates, substance misuse or addiction, homelessness, mental health issues, lack of positive role models, poor problem solving and self-management, and unemployment, among others.  What we term &quot;probation-type supervision&quot; also includes work with those in custody, helping them prepare for reintegration in the community, again with a focus on helping to reduce their risk of reoffending.  Community service is a direct alternative to prison, available to the courts for those 16 years of age and over who are guilty of an offence that would otherwise attract a custodial sentence and who can then be ordered to perform unpaid work in the community as an alternative sanction.<br/><br/>At the core of what probation staff do across all our programmes is to motivate offenders to change, help them increase both their ability to change, and facilitate improved opportunities for change.  Probation officers do this through the development of positive professional relationships, within clear role boundaries, and using skills and interventions based on those shown by research to be effective.  These, in turn, are founded on social work training and national and international standards of good practice, including for example the Council of Europe probation rules of 2010.<br/><br/>While those we work with are, in the main, those who have committed criminal offences, a central focus for probation work is the impact of offending on victims and the needs, rights and position of victims of crime.  Our work would be one dimensional if we focused only on the offender.  In doing what we do, we need to be conscious of, and seek to repair where possible, the broken relationship between offender, victim and the wider community.  We do this in a number of ways.  When preparing a pre-sanction assessment on an offender, we assess, as part of that, the impact on the victim or victims, the offender's understanding of that impact, and how we can help that offender to avoid creating more victims again in the future.  We also provide opportunities to offenders to make good the harm they have caused.  This includes performance of community service as well as a number of reparative and restorative interventions and programmes that we run, many in conjunction with partner agencies.<br/><br/>The Probation Service is an agency of the Department of Justice and Equality.  The organisation, which functions independently, in practical terms on a day-to-day basis is headed by a director who is also a member of the Department's management board and answerable to the Secretary General.  We have almost 400 staff based in offices throughout the country.  We have a presence in every county as well as in every custodial institution in the State.  Our annual budget is now &euro;46.3 million.  On any day, the Probation Service is assessing and supervising more than 8,500 offenders in the community as well as working in all 14 prisons and the children detention school.</p><p>Of the 8,500 people being managed in the community every day, around 2,200 are on community service and 3,500 are on probation supervision as direct sanctions from the courts.  Just over 1,300 of the 8,500 are women, 260 are under 18 years of age and more than 1,200 are on post-release supervision after serving a custodial sentence.  Every year, the Probation Service assesses and-or supervises around 15,000 offenders, mainly in the community.  Those referred to us have offended across the wide spectrum of crimes, from relatively minor to the most serious violent offences.<br/><br/>While all criminal justice agencies bring their own unique skills, roles and ways of working to how we respond collectively as a society to crime and offending, no single organisation or agency has all the answers.  Probation cannot do what the Prison Service does nor what An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does, and <i>vice versa</i>.  Reducing offending is a societal problem and needs a whole-of-society response.  That co-ordinated response has to start with a whole of criminal justice system approach in the first place.  One key to the success of the work that the Probation Service does is the nature of our interagency and multidisciplinary approach to what we do, especially with our justice partners, namely, the Irish Prison Service, the Courts Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Youth Justice Service and the Department of Justice and Equality.  The Probation Service is a community-facing organisation, and community-based organisations are a key group of partners for us in our work.  We channel &euro;15 million in funding from the Department of Justice and Equality every year to community and voluntary organisations that partner with us throughout the country in providing essential services to help in reducing offenders' risk of reoffending and facilitate their reintegration in their communities.  These organisations provide a diverse range of services, addressing offender needs in the fields of training, education and employment, accommodation, addiction treatment, resettlement and mentoring, among others.<br/><br/>In many jurisdictions, probation tends to be seen as either an alternative to imprisonment or as something for diverting those guilty of really minor offences, particularly first-time offenders, away from more serious sanctions.  While probation can and does usefully fulfil both of those functions, it is in fact most appropriate and most effective with those who present a medium to high risk of reoffending and who can safely be managed in the community.  Probation officers carry out their work with offenders broadly from the standpoint that the individual person has committed an offence and must be held accountable for the offending and take responsibility for his or her own rehabilitation.  In addition, we recognise that offending typically takes place in a wider family and social context, which must be taken into account in trying to help the offender turn his or her life around for the better.  We also recognise that change is usually difficult and that people are more likely to be successful in making and maintaining changes in their lives if they have the benefit of skilled professional help, which is what we provide.<br/><br/>While the full range of work that the Probation Service undertakes is important, I want to highlight some particular priority categories of offender with whom we have been undertaking specific initiatives.  First is prolific offenders.  Recognising that a significant percentage of certain offences, such as burglary, are committed by a small percentage of prolific offenders, the Probation Service, in partnership with the Prison Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Justice and Equality, has established the joint agency response to crime, or JARC.  This programme, developed in four areas of Dublin since 2014, is being extended to a number of areas outside the capital and targets in a uniquely intensive, interagency approach those identified as being the most prolific offenders in their areas.  Burglary and violent crime have been the two primary offence categories targeted under JARC, with observable success.<br/><br/>Second is young people.  Recognising that the mid to late teens and early 20s are statistically the peak ages for offending by many individuals, the Probation Service has a dedicated division, young persons probation, that specialises in work with this age group, primarily those under 18 years, but extending the same focused and age-appropriate supervision to those up to 21 years of age.<br/><br/>Third is women.  Women are disproportionately represented in the criminal justice system and face unique issues in addressing and reducing their risk of reoffending.  For that reason, we have put in place a number of responses to take these issues into account.  These include, for example, gender-appropriate assessment and supervision, female-specific community service projects, peer mentoring, and accommodation programmes.<br/><br/>Fourth is sex offenders.  As well as working closely with our psychology service colleagues in the Irish Prison Service in delivering sex offender treatment programmes to those in custody, we also run, with a number of partner bodies, similar treatment programmes in the community as well as accommodation support initiatives and circles of support and accountability programmes.  Since 2010, the Probation Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Prison Service, Tusla, the child and family agency, and local housing authorities have worked closely, through the sex offender risk assessment and management, SORAM, initiative to supervise and manage jointly the risk posed by sex offenders in the community.  This work is overseen nationally by a strategic co-located interagency team based in Harcourt Square.<br/><br/>In respect of post-release supervision, the Probation Service traditionally worked with those referred directly to us by the courts.  More recently, we have supervised an increasing number of people on post-release from custody under a number of legislative provisions.  Approximately 15% of all those we supervise in the community are now on some form of post-release programme.  These programmes, including community return and community support, have proven very successful and mean that virtually all those released from prison on temporary release now are on one or other form of structured post-release programme, involving some probation input.  Much of our work in relation to life sentence prisoners is undertaken under the umbrella of the parole board process.  As well as preparing assessment reports on life sentence prisoners for the parole board, probation officers work with such prisoners in addressing issues related to their offending and helping them prepare for release and resettlement.  The Probation Service, with the Irish Prison Service and the parole board, is developing a more co-ordinated interagency approach to the management of life sentence prisoners.<br/><br/>The Probation Service has developed a number of restorative justice programmes over the past 20 years or so.  Restorative justice services in Dublin and the restorative justice in the community programme, based in Tipperary and Cork, run community-based reparation panels where offenders have an opportunity to confront their offending and its impact on their victim or victims through discussion with panels of people representing community interests, including victims where appropriate, and to take specific actions to go some way towards making good the harm caused.  As part of our restorative justice strategy, the Probation Service now also offers a range of victim-offender mediation interventions, including in relatively serious cases.<br/><br/>How effective is probation?  This is a frequently asked and important question.  On the face of it, such effectiveness is something that can be measured quite easily in terms of the rate of reoffending by those who have been under probation supervision.  On that reoffending measure alone, probation is effective both here in Ireland and internationally.  For the past four years, in partnership with the Central Statistics Office, CSO, reoffending rates by all those who have been on probation orders and community service each year has been measured.  This is tracked over a three year follow-up period.  Findings, which are published by the CSO, show that six out of every ten probationers have no further convictions in the follow-up three year period.  This compares favourably with statistics for those who have been in prison and also with probation comparators internationally.  I appreciate there is no room for complacency and we are constantly reviewing our practice, based on statistical and other evidence, to improve our outcomes.</p><p> Effectiveness in probation needs to be measured on other scales apart from reoffending.  As well as probation&rsquo;s effectiveness in offender rehabilitation, some of those other effectiveness measures include: probation&rsquo;s relative cost-effectiveness as a sanction; promoting citizenship and social justice; its value as a proportionate and just sanction and as an alternative to custody; reducing the impact of imprisonment on prisoners&rsquo; children and families; as an aid to sentencing decisions; in resettling ex-prisoners; in building up communities; through the unpaid work undertaken in communities by those on community service; and by helping those who have offended to be reintegrated in their communities and to become positively contributing members of society.  In monetary terms alone, supervised community sanctions cost a fraction of custodial ones: &euro;1,500 for a community service order and &euro;5,000 for a probation supervision order.  The unpaid work done annually by people on community service, estimated with reference to the national minimum wage hourly rate of &euro;9.25, is the equivalent of a total of &euro;2.7 million worth of work done in local communities across Ireland every year.  It is valuable work which would not otherwise have been done.</p><p> Penal policy has been the subject of ongoing consideration for some time.  A previous Oireachtas justice committee reported in 2013 and made five recommendations, a number of which have been substantially achieved.  The report of the strategic review of penal policy was published by the Minister for Justice and Equality in September 2014.  This report contained 47 recommendations, across the penal policy field, half of which relate directly to the work of the Probation Service.  The Probation Service is fully committed to implementing penal policy, as set out in the programme for Government and the Department of Justice and Equality strategy.  We work closely with our partners to implement Government and departmental policy and, specifically, the actions in the 2014 strategic review of penal policy.  We report regularly to the relevant implementation oversight group, chaired by Dr. Mary Rogan.  Implementation reports are published on the Department of Justice and Equality website regularly.  In that regard, we are well on track towards implementation of the review&rsquo;s recommendations.  Much positive and productive change has been achieved in Ireland in recent years.  More remains to be done and that work programme is being advanced in a collaborative way across the justice agencies.</p><p> Probation work done well makes a difference and adds significant value to the criminal justice system as a whole and to making Ireland a safer and fairer place.  The Probation Service&rsquo;s unique role is in helping to create safer communities and fewer victims through offender rehabilitation.  Probation staff are in the business of hope, hope that is based in reality and evidence-informed practice.  In that way, we provide unique services, reducing reoffending and victimisation as part of a proportionate, just and effective response to crime, offending and offenders.</p></speech>

Equally there is a relatively small proportion of women under our supervision in the community but in comparison to the number of crimes being committed by women, the number of women in prison or on probation is disproportionately high.

As a result of a number of initiatives, including new legislation and a value for money review of community service, there was a significant increase in the number of people on community service.  The number peaked in 2011.  The numbers on community service have dropped since then but there are several reasons for that.  The number of people in prison has also gone down.  Since that time, there have been a number of other legislative provisions introduced for different types of sanctions.  The 2006 Criminal Justice Act introduced, on a legislative basis, the possibility of fully suspended prison sentences, with or without supervision, and also part-suspended sentences of which there has been an increase.  I referred in my presentation to the fact we have an increasing number of people that we supervise on post-release supervision.  I guess that some of those have displaced some of the community service orders.</p></speech>

It was really comprehensive.  We are getting a greater understanding of the number of different agencies and services that are there and integrating into each other in this area.  Community service is something we constantly put forward as a much better alternative to prison in terms of the damage done and the cost.  I note the points Mr. Geiran made about why the numbers might have decreased.  Is the option of community service available nationally?  Are there areas where the judges do not use it so the facility to take it up is not really there and there is difficulty in getting useful community labour or employment for the person?</p><p>Is it a seamless set-up in all areas where the services are there?  If a judge sentences somebody, is there a ready and useful project into which the person can be integrated?</p><p> The next question might make me sound really stupid.  With regard to the national spread of the 400 staff, does a probation officer require a social work background or are they people with good life experience?  Who would be a probation officer and what is that person's educational background or experience?  Are we dealing with young people or people from the communities?  Is it a mix?  It is a good number but I would say more are needed.  The issue in prisons is something I would like to explore a little.  The service has people in every prison but how many people are there and are they in the prison all the time?  If I am a probation officer in the D&oacute;chas Centre, is it my only job or am I only there for a couple of days?  It is my understanding that people want to access the Probation Service but they cannot necessarily do so.  Ideally, the first day somebody is in prison, he or she should be able to have access to a probation officer.  My understanding is people are often told by prison authorities that they are not long enough into a sentence and they do not need an officer.  Such prisoners should be worked with from very early.  Will the witnesses comment on that?</p><p> The next question relates to restorative justice.  How many people would have been put through those programmes?  I like the point made that we should not be waiting on legislation.  It is great that there have been some programmes but they are probably under-advertised.  Their success is probably not well known but all the studies show the really positive impact they have.  It is great to see them up and running so is there anything more we can do in that regard?</p><p> It is critical to work with people post-release and whereas they obviously need the greatest support if they have a drug problem, they also need employment and housing.  The Irish Prison Service has told us it has a protocol with the city and county managers with regard to housing.  Where are we in delivering employment opportunities?  Before the recruitment ban in the public service, we could have got a fellow into the council or as a porter in a hospital.  That has gone so we need an alternative public source of employment for people coming out.  Where are we with that?</p></speech>

Mr. Dack can deal with the questions related to prisons.</p> <p>  We have community service programmes available across the country and a staff presence in every county.  We are currently recruiting more probation officers and community service supervisors.  We have always worked hard to maintain that availability of community service work across the country in all areas.  Sometimes if we have a particularly high number of referrals, there might be some delay in getting people placed in projects.  Our focus is always on having work available in a timely way so we can place people in work programmes as quickly as possible after the order.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-08a.678" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms &Uacute;na Doyle" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017030800002#M00300"><p>I thank the Deputy for her question.  The majority of probation officers, which form the bulk of our professionally trained staff, are qualified social workers with a recognised qualification in social work.  It is not a requirement to become a probation officer but we have been very successful in attracting people of that calibre and grade.  It is certainly a preference of ours and it is the direction in which we should go given what the director has indicated in terms of social work qualification, knowledge and skill base, as well as effectiveness in engaging with offenders and motivating change.</p> <p>  Like much of the public sector, our overall staffing numbers had decreased over the period 2008 to approximately 2015 or 2016, as Mr. Geiran has alluded to.  We are in the process of recruiting and in 2016 we were successful in running a permanent probation officer competition.  We are seeing the benefits of that now with an intake.  We have taken in an additional 20 probation officers since the end of last year, which is a very positive development.</p> <p>  In terms of service delivery and its implications, as we are a national service with a footprint in every county in the country, as there is ebb and flow in the rates of referral or the demands placed on us to respond,  we are in a position where we can do so by reassigning staff across the service.  That is facilitated through people with geographical transfers.  To answer another of the Deputy's questions, in the main most of our staff are based in the three urban hubs, as that is where the critical mass of the population tends to be.  That is in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  That said, we have 40 staffed offices nationwide.  Our staff in prisons are assigned to a prison for the duration of an assignment and, for the most part, staff are based there on a full-time basis.  To use the Deputy's example of the D&oacute;chas Centre, staff assigned there would work just there.  It would be the same in other prison complexes.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-08a.680" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms &Uacute;na Doyle" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017030800002#M00500"><p>They are based nationwide and particularly in the critical masses of Dublin, Cork and Limerick to meet demand.  The availability of community services is a nationwide provision.  We have supervisors to supervise people on-site.  Additionally, in meeting the needs of the potential participant, from time to time we may look at a more bespoke model to suit the needs of an individual.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-08a.681" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Dack" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017030800002#M00600"><p>With regard to community service, there are certain realities relating to critical mass and what services we can provide.  We have community service available nationally in every county.  There are certain particular types of projects in which we can excel and bring them forward in areas where there are larger populations.  In Dublin and Cork, we have a graffiti removal project that we operate in tandem with local authorities, targeting different hot spots in order to clear the graffiti.  We are able to do that because we have mobile community service buses manned by community service supervisors with a team of individuals sentenced to complete community service.  It is not something we can do in every county in the country but we have a variety of ways of operating.  We have community service supervisors in every county and in some areas where we do not have community service projects based in schools, community centres or youth clubs, we have individual placements in host agencies where we have negotiated and agreed they would undertake supervision with support from ourselves and constant monitoring.  To answer the Deputy's question, the service is available nationally.</p> <p>  We have had a presence in prisons since 1960, when the chaplains and ourselves were the only services of a helping nature there.  The environment has changed greatly since, as I am sure the Deputy is aware, and we have changed accordingly.  We work with prisoners throughout their sentence in terms of the amelioration of the worst excesses of the prison environment, helping people cope while in prison and supporting families.  Our focus is towards the latter end and the preparation of people for integration into the community.  That is where the majority of our work exists.  As Mr. Geiran highlighted earlier, there is a number of people in the system with post-release supervision orders from the courts and they are our primary focus.  That is not to say we would not work with prisoners during the course of their sentences who do not have post-release supervision.</p></speech>

I thank the service for its great work.  What happens with somebody who is serving a life sentence in prison?</p><p>What is the procedure in terms of the Probation Service for when they are ready to be released?  I simply want to find out the way that process works.  Is training provided for probation officers throughout the country on how to deal with people with mental health issues and addiction?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-08a.686" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Vivian Geiran" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017030800002#N00200"><p>In terms of the life sentence prisoners, we would engage with all life sentence prisoners when they are in custody because, apart from anything else, ultimately we will be supervising all of them when they are eventually released, assuming they are released, and, by and large, everybody who receives a prison sentence is released at some stage.  On any given day we would supervise approximately 80 life sentence prisoners in the community and we work with a couple of hundred others who are in custody.  The two main areas of focus for us in our work with life sentence prisoners are addressing the issues that may have contributed to their offending and reducing the risk of their reoffending.  We also help them to prepare for release and address any issues that might need to be addressed in the context of their resettlement in their local community.  Those are the areas we would address with them.</p> <p>  All life sentence prisoners would go through the Parole Board process.  At the request of the Parole Board, we would prepare assessments on people serving life sentences, as would other services, and subsequently the Parole Board would make recommendations to the Minster regarding a prisoner's release or otherwise.  Probation officers would be involved in that at every stage of the process.</p> <p>  Regarding probation officers' training in the area of mental health, I will ask Ms Doyle to respond to that question and following that response I will ask Dr. Burke to respond to the previous question on restorative justice.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-08a.687" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms &Uacute;na Doyle" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017030800002#N00300"><p>As part of their progressive career development, probation officers would have in-service training.  We have a dedicated team.  That training focuses on the issues presenting at any given time within the context of our work.  In the area of addiction and mental health, which are quite prevalent at this time, we would work alongside other service providers to develop programmes, in-service training and supports for our staff within that context.  We are currently adopting and rolling out the SAOR assessment model, which is an assessment that will complement our general assessment in regard to addiction, to support staff in identifying particular areas of addiction, as addiction is one of the most significant factors that is relevant to people offending.  Within that context, we move on to integrate that into what is called their case management work etc.</p> <p>  One of the new changes that is happening in the area of addiction, which we are examining, is the move from opiate-based to non-opiate-based problems.  That is an area in which we are on a learning curve and it is one to which we need to be able to respond in terms of working with our client group.</p> <p>  Similarly, in the area of mental health, we would draw resources from our colleagues in the Prison Service, particularly the psychology service and also the community mental health teams, in helping us support our staff, build awareness and upskill them in that area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-08a.688" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ita Burke" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017030800002#N00400"><p>To follow on in the addiction area, we are involved with funded projects in helping women recover form addiction.  It is the peer support, lived experience model in respect of which we have trained some of our staff in the reduce the use and recover me programme.  It is focused on people dealing with recovery from addiction and relapse prevention.  It is a very innovative programme and it is working extremely well.  Women are training other women and workers in the homeless field and the criminal justice field around recovery.  It is a particularly good programme and one we encourage and want to continue.</p> <p>  In terms of restorative justice, Deputy Clare Daly will be aware, the Probation Service funds two dedicated restorative justice projects, which cover the Dublin area and the midlands, and the Cork area.  The Deputy inquired about figures.  During the past two years both of those projects would have catered for up to 400 offenders.  Apart from those dedicated projects, all our probation officer staff would be trained in restorative work.  We have worked with judges throughout the country and judges can look for restorative interventions as part of their pre-sanction assessment.  We are involved in that work.  It could range form a letter of apology to some reparative work such as painting and getting involved in a local community.  The other area in which we are involved is victim offender mediation, where a mediator would work with an offender and a victim, and it would all be about repairing the harm.  It must be voluntary.  We have found from our work with victims over the years that what they want most is for the offender to stop offending, and that would be very much to the fore in our work in the restorative justice area.</p></speech>

I have two brief questions.  The first relates to the potential expansion of the Drug Treatment Court as a model of intervention and giving people another chance.  Has Mr. Geiran a view on that?  It might be a possible intervention as part of national drugs strategy.  Could the Probation Service manage that expansion of that programme throughout country?</p> <p>  My second question relates specifically to work opportunities for people.  Do all the agencies of the State co-operate with the Probation Service or does the service have a difficulty in forming those relationships that are required?  Is there any intervention from a political perspective that could perhaps come from a senior level within Departments to impose an obligation on different agencies to work with the Probation Service to give people an opportunity and another chance?</p></speech>

It has been in place for more than 20 years now.</p></speech>

The approach works very well for certain offenders.  When I speak to people, particularly from other jurisdictions, about Drug Treatment Court models, I am conscious that in Ireland we have a District Court system that operates very much in that way.  Clearly, the Drug Treatment Court is a more focused version but District Court Judiciary and the District Court generally want to give people who have addiction issues a chance to address them, and we work with many of those people on behalf of the courts.  If there is anyway we can extend and make that approach more available, that would be welcome from my point of view.</p> <p>  The Deputy's question about the work of other agencies and Departments is very important.  I referred in my opening statement to the need for a whole-of-Government approach.  One of the recommendations in the report of the strategic review of penal policy pointed to the need for a whole-of-Government approach as well as the implementation oversight group, to which I referred, to which we and the other organisations have to report.  An interdepartmental group was also established at the initiation of the Department of Justice and Equality at the most senior level, which invited all of the Departments and significant agencies to be represented.  That group is chaired by Dr. Ruth Barrington; it has been convened since last year, and I believe it is making very good progress in that regard.  It is clearly a very important area that we need to continue to work with.</p></speech>

The Probation Service obviously has a good role to play in addressing many aspects of how we believe things should be done better in respect of prisons and offenders.  I am curious about the framework.  I have never really known enough about the Probation Service.  What work do most people do when doing community service?  Does the Probation Service work hand in hand with the local authorities everywhere?</p></speech>

Most people who do community service work do it under the supervision of a community service supervisor employed by us, namely, one of our staff.  They perform the work as part of a group, supervised each day.  We are in a position to put a small percentage of the people we supervise on community service in individual placements because they are probably more capable and have potential to do work with voluntary organisations that we can monitor and which would qualify and be classified as community service.  The bulk of people, however, do their work as part of a group programme supervised by one of our staff.  As Mr. Brian Dack mentioned, in some locations, such as Dublin, Cork and one or two other places, there are graffiti-removal projects.  We have our own equipment in a van and do the work in collaboration with the local authority.  This relates to the Deputy's other question.  Apart from this work, we do a lot of work for voluntary organisations and community groups around the country.  This may involve site clearance, litter removal, painting and decorating, refurbishment and sometimes small building-type projects.  Much regeneration and renovation work is of a kind that we do.  We engage with Tidy Towns committees.  In a number of places, we have been able to build special gardens for schools or community facilities.</p> <p>  With regard to the question on local authorities, we have a good relationship with a number of local authorities, particularly in areas where we have graffiti-removal programmes running.  Currently, we are in the process of developing a relationship with a wider range of local authorities in the area of waste management.  Mr. Brian Dack might be in a position to say a little about that.</p></speech>

We have been invited to present there.  We recognise the possibility of establishing relationships with local authorities throughout the country to assist in clearance where dumping takes place.  We are looking forward to that.  It will be a win-win situation, for us in terms of generating work for offenders we are supervising and for local communities where we help to eradicate unsightly dumping that takes place.</p></speech>

They often do.  We do not always give ourselves enough credit for our community service in Ireland.  As the Deputy will be aware, in some jurisdictions, including some that are not too far away, people have to wear special clothing that identifies them as participants on community service.  We absolutely do not stipulate this at all.  We do not make the people working in the local community identifiable as having been convicted.  In some places, it appears as if the probation services get people to do the most menial and meaningless work.  We always try - sometimes it is a challenge - to ensure the work people do on community service is not only valuable to the community but also allows the individual to feel it is meaningful and contributes something positive in his or her local area.</p></speech>

We place female offenders in individual placements - for example, in many of the charity shops and meals on wheels units.  The main point about these is that they are available in every community.  If one does not have a community service supervisor, one can link in with another voluntary organisation.  It is actually making a difference to that local community so it is repairing the harm.  Therefore, it works very well.</p></speech>

While the primary function is to implement the court order in terms of the work being done, we recognise the secondary benefits associated with developing a work ethic, skills, team-working and all the elements that will contribute to somebody's skills base when he or she seeks employment or engages in other activity himself or herself.  For us, that is a really important element of the programme.</p></speech>

We have a big problem in the State owing to the lack of apprenticeship schemes.  In the construction sector, for example, there used to be a great apprenticeship system years ago but it is now gone.  Has the Probation Service examined this area?  It can be difficult for somebody with no work culture or work experience to get work.  The apprenticeship scheme was good because an apprentice did not cost the employer too much.  The employer was not losing too much money on the apprentice.  It was a great opportunity for the individual to learn.  From where should the initiative come on apprenticeship schemes?  The State probably has a role to play.  That there are no apprenticeship schemes now is a big problem.  We should be considering reinstating them.  Services such as the Probation Service could make great use of them.</p></speech>

Whether one has a job can have a big influence on whether one stays away from crime.  There are a number of initiatives.  Mr. Dack already mentioned the organisation we fund and which has training and employment officers who engage directly with the people under our supervision across the country.  That is one initiative.  With the Irish Prison Service, we have a joint project established in which we have employed a national co-ordinator in the area of social enterprise to try to develop different types of employment opportunities for offenders, including self-employment and social enterprise.  Therefore, there are a number of areas that we are developing.</p> <p>  As part of the interdepartmental group I mentioned, we are engaging very well with the Department of Social Protection on trying to fit what we do with the people under our supervision with its employment activation programmes and so on.</p></speech>

That programme has proven to be extremely successful.  I am sure it was mentioned earlier.  I refer to the experience of having a working day, being trained, supervised and having a good relationship with the community service supervisors, who are critical to the work we do on pro-social modelling and giving a lead to the people they are working with, and to the sense of well-being participants get from giving back to communities.  We frequently find that when people have finished their sentence and paid their dues, they still want to stay on because it is a meaningful activity for them.</p><p> We also ask the training and employment officers to do a couple of sessions with every person on the system so that they have the opportunity to continue with the training employment officers who link with the Department of Social Protection to explore pathways into employment.  We are positive and hopeful of employment becoming more available.  We did a small survey recently on our Dublin sites and we found very good figures for people finding employment and moving on.  Some good green shoots are being seen.</p></speech>

Mr. Geiran indicated in his opening statement that the service is on track in implementing them.  Are there specific obstacles to any of those that it has not yet been able to introduce?  Are there any legislative, regulatory or resourcing needs that need to be met in order to ensure that the recommendations can be introduced and implemented?  We will be producing a report for the Minister with recommendations.  We are always very anxious to see that they are activated.  Could Mr. Geiran indicate whether there are any particular reasons why, at this stage, any of those recommendations have not yet been implemented?</p></speech>

The one I would highlight is, as I said earlier, the whole-of-Government approach.  Progress is being made in that regard.  By virtue of what has been achieved, there is still much more that can be done.  Very often, it is not legislation, <i>per se</i>, or resources that stop things happening, rather it is the will of the people involved.  I include myself in that.  If we can continue to build that whole-of-Government, whole-of-society response, then legislation and resources will follow.</p></speech>
